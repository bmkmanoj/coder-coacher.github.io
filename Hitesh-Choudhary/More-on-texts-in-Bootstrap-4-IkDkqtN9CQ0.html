training further down and we are looking
up by for some of the classes written by
somebody else now we have talked with
some of the h1 tags display tags
paragraphs black coats blah blah stuff
now let's continue further with a few
things which are important again and
these are few revised things in the
bootstrap four and I love them the first
of them is the list now again since the
list I don't want my list to be going
very very to the left just like these
paragraphs I want them to be a little
bit stable I will wrap everything inside
a container so I'll write div dot
container and this is by the way a
shortcut of generating a division with a
class of container you guess that right
dot for class hash for ID so if I do
that this gives us a class command Z and
if I do a hash there put my cursor end
and this gives me ID okay everything
this is mentioned in our Emmet video
training which is free and go ahead and
watch it in case you wish them now let's
go into the container in here and what I
want to talk about is an ordered list
okay
now again we will be generating some
boilerplate code to understand the
unordered list in here okay
so I'll write u L that means unordered
list in that I want a list item and how
many list item let's just say five so x
five and there we come some boilerplate
code so I'll write I'll just press my
command key and I'll write multiple
cursors there and I'll write one there
okay some boilerplate code so that we
can see it in here okay and I'll save
this and I expect this to reload okay so
there we go we can see some darts no big
deal you have already seen these things
or in your HTML section now what we want
to do is to add some classes there now
the first thing that you might want to
do is add a class to your unordered list
and the class name is list
- inline okay as soon as you save this
and go back in here and you'll be seeing
the
the default classes are gone okay
so the dots that you might be seeing
there it's it's completely gone there
okay that's the one thing now obviously
you might want to do a couple of things
and especially in the menu part or the
top navigation bar although we do have
navigation bar in the bootstrap but
again for some reason maybe you want all
of them to appear in just one line and
yes yep that is also covered that is
class name is list in line item and that
yep you guess that it goes with the list
item all of that so again I repeat the
class name list in line item so what
we're gonna do is we are gonna just
place multiple cursors there and let's
just do that and that is one of the
advantage of using is some advanced
editor like atom or sub line by the way
press my command and there okay and I'll
be adding a class there and the class
name is list
- inline - item now I personally think I
Tim whoops again item save that go in
here and there we go everything is just
one line now I personally think that
there should be some class that should
have been applied to the UL and it
automatically gets all the list item and
gets them in one line because writing
this class name again and again there's
really repetition of the code which I'm
not a big fan but hey this is just the
bootstrap its class written by somebody
else that I'm trying to use in here
okay now there are a lot of things that
you can do in here but that's what we
are gonna follow up right now now there
are a couple of scenarios where you
might want some code to be displayed
there for example maybe this block code
you want as it is to be displayed and
there is no good way of displaying this
block code as it is
so yes bootstrap gives you that option
as well and let's create another div of
container there so it's gonna be simply
div dot container and there we go and
now let's use some of the code there so
let's just say this block code okay
where are you where are you this block
code I want this guy to be displayed as
it is in this division save that and
notice you go back in here you don't see
anything
and HTML doesn't throw up any errors so
this is not going to happen
now what you can do in here is let's
just go in here there is a tag being
given to you that is named with the code
okay and whatever you put inside the
code let me just show you a couple of
bugs they're not the bugs it's some
workaround save that and if I go back in
here notice something is there but
you're not able to see it okay and let's
just go back in here we want this code
to be running in here this doesn't give
us anything so what we have to do let me
just show you a quick trick in here this
guy is actually having a name so it's
end which is ampersand as well LT and
comma okay I say that and I go back in
here and notice it's a block code now
this is so you have to replace all your
special characters with their equivalent
UTF names okay and for this guy there is
an M percent and this guy is GT : okay
and I saved that notice it doesn't gives
you anything although it just throws my
coat code back maybe it doesn't need
that okay and this does our job let's go
back in here and I think why is it not
working okay okay this is problematic in
here for us okay let's just solve that
let's just try to write it again and use
an ampersand again and this is GT can't
save that and there we go might be I
have written something else might be I'm
not hundred-person in here
okay so this is how you write your code
so block code so any anything that goes
inside the code is actually being
displayed and yes there is some default
styling being applied to it but later on
we can change it obviously and obviously
don't forget to change everything like a
codes and backslash to their equivalent
code there okay
so this is one thing that you should
always take care now also there are a
couple of things that you need to be
aware of that are keyboard inputs you
use them very rarely but maybe maybe
sometime you might want to use them so
therefore you should be understand
and if you want anything to be keyboard
specific the tag that you give is KBD
you might have heard about the KB DS or
I can just write k BD there we go the
keyboard tags and let's just say you
want somebody to say hey I want you to
be ctrl + C or maybe just ctrl for
control save that go back in here and
there we go it's highlighted there and
anybody can see that this is a command
this is a control okay so this is all
the fun stuff that you can do with a
bootstrap using the typography there so
I would say this is the only thing that
you need yes there are hundreds of
things maybe still remaining but you
don't need everything to learn there are
a lot of things that you learn on the go
and obviously that on the go will be
covered in the project so this is it
practice it and I'll catch you up in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
