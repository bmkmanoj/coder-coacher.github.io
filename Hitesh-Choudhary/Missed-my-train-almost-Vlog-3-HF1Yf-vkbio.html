I'm already late
the driver is really good he's trying to
really hard so that I can catch my train
but early guard knows I'm not pretty
sure that I'll be able to make it but
let's just see a train station didn't
miss that I thought I missed it but
thanks to a railway station I didn't
missed it
the train was on the time and I'm just
two minutes late but that's fine this
like always says run every single day I
I was running almost 500 meter and I
just caught up the train my coach was
really at the end of the Train but I
didn't missed it
finally I caught that and I'm gonna now
find my seat whose people are still
sleeping in the Train and I don't like
to be in the sleeping people of Ukraine
I'll be staying and waiting for a little
bit more time but I'll make sure that
you catch a vein and railway journey and
it's really awesome I almost missed the
train but I'm glad that they are late
and that's actually a good thing for me
so I'll give you quick shots of what's
inside to be in the train but that's
gonna be super fun
Hey in the meantime I was just waiting
here can you see this guy this guy here
he is I guess from somewhere else but he
speaks sick Hindi that's super cool
because this guy is not from India and
he has learned quite a few he has picked
up few words he speaks it's really nice
I just talked with this young kid and
you know what amazes me I just asked him
what he want to be when you grow up and
all he said to me I don't know never
thought about it and this is something
really an appropriate situation when I
was that young around 12 or anybody in
my class ah just anyone and he's gonna
say I want to be doctor I want to be
engineer and this kid has no idea and I
asked him why and he says I was busy
with assignments homework and other
stuff
I don't get that completely because he
was playing games all all the way on the
train but you know sometimes kids needs
to be kids and they need to say that hey
what you want to be and that's all it
really amazes me that how bad it is the
situation is just got back home and when
I arrived in jeopardy so there was the
surprise going on with the uber so I
thought why not take a sharing cab I did
that and I shared the cab with this / /
/ cute and / caring couple let me tell
you a fact / sweetness gives diabetes so
make sure you take care of that next
time too much of the caring too much of
the cuteness I don't like it and maybe a
lot of people don't like it so make sure
that they take care of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
