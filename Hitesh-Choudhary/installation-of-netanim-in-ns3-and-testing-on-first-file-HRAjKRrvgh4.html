in this movie we are going to learn how
we can install the net nm net nm is kind
of an animation version of whatever you
are trying to do with the industry so
without any delay let's get started
first of all let me go onto the
full-screen version and open up my
terminal it's really simple to open up
your terminal just iter into the search
the terminal will open up let me get the
best possible view so that we don't have
any hurdles in zooming out and zooming
in now whenever you need to install the
industry there are a couple of libraries
which you should be aware of and these
libraries should be installed on your
system but how you are going to find out
that library is being installed or not
for that let's call up our synaptic and
we'll give a sudo permission to snap
tick so that if in case we install
anything then it doesn't creates any
problem let me just shrink it a bit so
that it's much more visible and the
first library which should always be
there is this one QT 4 dash Q make
because we are going to need this
library when you install this I have
already got a go and gone ahead and
install this what you have to do just
simply click on this and right-click on
this and it will say mark for
installation and then click on apply
that's the first library that you are
going to require and should be installed
the second one is this one you have to
type Lib QT 4 - Dave this one and if
I'll scroll down a bit you will find
that this library is installed here it
is lip QT 4 - Dave now dave is not at
all an alone library it comes up with a
couple of other dependent packages also
all the time so make sure when you are
whenever you are confused in this
library or that library just type out
the name of the library and just type
the David will install all of the
relevant packages that's the second one
and the third and the last one is the
XML because our net enemy net and him
produces the xml files and our system
should be able to read those XML files
so this is the library which you need
out there
it's lib XML - - Dave so this library is
being installed on to my system you can
see out here and make sure that it's
being installed and if all of the
libraries are installed let's try to go
ahead and install the net and improve I
will do LS quickly move on to the
desktop where my file is being present
and I'll move on to the NS 3 all-in-one
do a quick LS and here is the file net
nm 3 that one I need to go this time
into the net n now if I do LS I can see
a whole bunch of files what you do you
do not need to be scared of that because
process is really simple you have to
first type make and then clean you have
to clean your make which is a by default
make is a by default program in a UNIX
and once I clean it says you don't have
to clean your make and it says make no
rule to make target ok clean ok the next
step is let's try to queue make the net
n improve that's the command you need to
give it is going to take a couple of
seconds and this time it works really
quickly and if it has being done on to
the make let's compile it and if I will
give a make it will work for a couple of
seconds but definitely it's going to
install in just a few moments ok so I
waited around 3 minutes but don't worry
the video is being fast forwarded so
it's not just the glimpse and I have
installed it so now we have got net and
impro being installed the very first
thing that we are going to do is make
let's make sure that it runs quite night
nice and neatly I'm going to do just a
dot slash net in him and it just talks
you can simply open up your net and him
and can browse to any metonym file and
can make sure that it runs now what we
are going to do to make sure that we
checks out everything
well I'm going to go back into the
directory of the NS three and I'm going
to go into the folder of scratch I'll do
a quick LS and I'll open up my G edit
and I'll open up my first dot CC file
now the reason why I'm opening up in the
G edit because that's the default
installed you can also use VI then Nano
any of your favorite the reason why I'm
showing you on the G edit because you
can understand so that that how
important the IDE is our next step is
going to be installed is going to be how
to install the Eclipse so make sure that
we understand why it is being required
now if I want to produce a net nm XML
file what I have to do I have to use
some of the commands and you can see I
have to type all of them manually and if
there would be an eclipse I just have to
press ctrl shift o after writing all of
my commands it - it would have included
all of the libraries just in the glimpse
like that so what we are going to do
first of all we are going to include a
library that says net annum and s3 slash
net nm - module the dot edge so that's
the one and let's try to move ahead and
make sure that I close it as well and
save it as well okay so let's try to
write some of the code so that we can
get our XML file now before the
simulator runs I would like to add a
couple of lines here and that file is
first of all I want to introduce the
animation make sure that it types them
correct because it's not the Eclipse so
that it can automatically correct so I
automatically suggest me this things so
Adam and what I'll do well give an
argument that is going to be lets say an
m1 dot XML that's the name of my file
you can give any name to your file make
sure that you and coerce them inside the
string so that it gets your proper
output that's it now what we want to do
we want to set some constant values or
some
position value so I'm going to call it
as an MDOT and I'll use a set constant
and make sure that it's camelcase
position I types it correct really
that's important out here it takes
literally the three argument the first
one is going to be the nodes dot get if
I go a bit up on to my screen it says
node create two now don't worry and
don't get scared of this code because we
are going to discuss this code into a
real depth in the upcoming video so
don't get worried about it now first it
takes the argument as note start to get
get the first node which is the zero the
second is the position of X in the
double so I will give a one point zero
and second is the third one is actually
the position of Y of course in double
that's my whole code I'll copy this and
I'll paste it one more time I'll indent
it a bit and the second one is also the
same it gets the position it gets the
node number one let's change the
position of X and VY that's it let's
save this and I guess all of us knows
how to run a code and that's really
simple I will go out of this directory
dot slash - - run and inside the scratch
there is the first make sure that
extension is not there I run this and
I'm expecting it not to produce any
error and I guess no errors only there
are warning we will take care of those
warnings later on but right now I just
want to run my net and impro I'll go
into the directory of net nm run the net
and in just like that open up a file
that says animation once so I'll just
call it as animation and here is my file
that says an m1 dot XML it gots into a
bit pirate folder I didn't expected it
to go there
and I'll open up my file and it gives me
a really nasty dots I'll run this
simulation and here it goes a bit of
advanced animation I'll guess you can
also make sure that animation is being
slowed up or maybe goes down I'll pause
it I'll pause this one and I can adjust
the timing as well and I can again
playback and do a quite a lot of stuffs
I hope you get the first basic overview
about the net and impro so go ahead try
to mess around with install wait do a
couple of things and later on the videos
we are going to do a lot of stuff with
netid impro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
