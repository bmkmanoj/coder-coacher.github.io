Independence Day so it's an Indian
Independence Day in case for the people
who are watching outside of India it's
really an important day for all of us
here in India so what we're going to do
we're going to celebrate it in our own
style by writing some code and basically
what you can see on the screen is the
project by Vincent it's an amazing
getting popularity nowadays it's rather
a little bit old project but getting
popularity nowadays we're going to use
this project and we'll be creating
something like this so this is particle
dot GS in case you haven't heard about
libraries available in Ajax and
JavaScript they are pretty powerful and
amazing and well on steps library I use
at my personal website as well you can
see it just types the thing on the go on
the load there are hundreds of others I
have discussed a lot in my complete
front-end developer bootcamp that you
can see link right now so we're going to
be doing something like this not exactly
same we will be giving it our own touch
and we'll be celebrating it in the
Independence Day style so okay so I'll
give you a couple of assignments as well
in this video so fire up your text
editor and write some code along with me
so first of all we need particles GS so
we're going to go with particle J s go
ahead get that and this should be linked
for github or Apple and just copy that
just click on that and what you have to
do is simply download it on your desktop
you can download a zip here and in case
you don't want to download we'll be
needing a couple of files from it so you
can go into the demo not in the demo
what we need is basically the particle J
s and if you'll download this this is
going to look something like this so in
the J's file one we need is AB dot J s
so you can always copy a raw file or I
would recommend to just download it it's
a very small file and we're going to
need something like this not the star
but something like this which is there
okay so basically whole store is your
heart had just download this from on
your desktop I have already got mine on
my desktop
let me just unzip that so particle dot J
s okay
there we go and I can close my flex box
okay so where are you particle Cheers
there we go so this is how it looks like
and we're gonna take some file from this
and we're going to take the particle dot
j s and basically we're going to take
this app dot J s and a particle dot J is
okay so go into your J's file make sure
you have this guy app dodgy s somewhere
separate and also this particle dot J's
okay so these are the two files that we
will be using and what we can do is we
can create a new folder on my desktop
and I can name it as India Independence
Day or flag something like that flag
it's not a good word because it migrates
to some of the flag alarms you know
encoding programming like that so go
ahead and open these guys okay so we
need particles GS obviously and inside
the demo CSS not the CSS J s AB dot J so
these are the two files that we will be
needing and we don't need anything else
from here okay and I'm going to fire up
my all-time favorite editor so file open
gives me a ton come on there we go and
let's open up a new folder there add
project folder it's going to be on my
desktop and what we're going to do is
flag okay open that up okay so basically
we do have an app dot GS which is just
like that particle dot GS and let me
tell you one interesting thing here
there are a couple of ways to handle
this library basically what it requires
you to pass on this Jason package dot
Jason this JSON object here and there is
a good demonstration and good
documentation here that it expects you
to include your particle GS and app dot
J's file and basically what it needs
this JSON object here and this JSON
object is pretty thorough and pretty
deep you can set up a lot of values here
for example
if you want something like stars so
there are strings here for particle
shape like in circle edge triangle
polygon star you can also insert your
image as well no problem there so
basically this is it now what we have
done here is we have directly included
this particle dot J's which is a
required file we are not going to be
touching it and we will be touching this
app dot J's so in this case it has just
passed this entire JSON object directly
into this file so we don't need to
include that JSON file but if you want
to go with the documentation way you can
go ahead and do that okay so that's all
what we need and we're going to create a
couple of new file and first of all I'm
going to save this guy as index dot HTML
there we go I'm going to be using Emmet
throughout I have this entire video so
make sure if you don't know what M it is
I have a free course or I might go ahead
check that out it's amazing
ok and we're going to need one more file
which is going to be our CSS so style
not like that I'm going to save this as
style dot CSS and that's basically it
and we're going to link this file we're
going to simply say that I need a link
for CSS and there we go all filled up
let's verify it with giving a nasty
color to the body just like always BDC
and we're going to give it amazingly
amazingly harsh to the eyes which is red
so let's start the server ok and again
this is a add-on package and atom that I
use because life is so much easier when
you don't have to hit reload reload
again every single save ok so looks like
everything is connected and looks good
let's get rid of that and we'll see how
we can progress with that so the idea is
really simple we need a flag and flag is
going to have three things the top part
is going to be orange color with some
star icons floating around basically
we're going to be using particle J's so
it's going to look almost like this but
instead of this circle we're going to
customize this so that you can learn the
as well and we're going to be using
stars here so at the top part the stars
are going to be rotating in an orange
bar with white color let's use that and
the center part it's going to be simply
white let's just write in happy
Independence Day at the center there and
at the bottom it's going to be just
green again stars will be floating
around with your help of particles or GS
and then I'll give you assignment okay
so sound good and there are hundreds and
hundreds of ways to deal with this up
but I think the easiest would be to go
with an unordered list so let's have an
unordered list and we're going to need
three items of lis or list elements so
there we go as quick as it can be so see
M it is always helping you around with
that I can zoom it a little bit so that
you can see it properly okay next up is
a you're going to need a couple of
divisions here with a different ID so
let's just have a multiple cursor here
and we're going to have a division oops
and oops come on give me division
command Z and there we go so we're going
to have a div and this div is going to
have an ID and the IDS are going to be
different every single time the first
one is going to be let's give it a value
of orange easier to remember this is
going to be white you can also provide
the classes as well there is no such
thing I hope you understand that that's
the easy part
okay so that's it and I think basically
that's what we need at this point of
time now let's go ahead and do some of
the styling mumbo-jumbo there so the
styling mumbo-jumbo is going to be
pretty easy it's not going to be extreme
we're going to just fill it up and for
the entire screen size we're going to
give 33% to eat so that everybody gets
an equal share okay so first of all
let's do something here so unordered
list first of all let's get rid of the
default margin I like to do that for
body as well but right now I think
getting rid of the margin from unordered
list is okay
now number in the unordered list I want
to target the list element and get rid
of this last nasty bullet things first
of all let's do that so this style is
going to be none and there we go it's
gone just like that okay so next up we
want to give each list item some width
and that is going to be 33% because if
you divide 100 hundred percent of the
viewport height or width we're going to
be just doing like that okay
so let's give it a height of thirty
three point three three you can go on
like that it's going to be a viewport
height okay and we're going to give it
some width as well so it's always good
oops c'mon it's always good to give them
a bit of 100 viewport width okay 100
viewport width and just to give you an
idea what to VR up to right now I'm
going to give a background color of if
I'll give the background color it's
going to just keep get everybody just
the same color so I'm going to be giving
ledges orange here and we're going to
give this orange a background color so
background color is going to be let's
just say red
some of you might be thinking what's
this guy's obsession with the red okay
it's it's not going to show right now
because we haven't set the height for
all these elements so first of all let's
give it some height so that we can see
what is happening so orange and we're
going to have white and what else we
have green I guess so let's give it a
height of whatever I have assigned to
you just use 100% of that a hundred
percent there we go
should be available so see this is the
top bar what we have planned up so this
is going to be this is actually taking
the 33% and that's most important part
here we can just give all these colors
to white and green as well just to see
it but I think you got the idea how the
things are happening here
so 33% at the top middle one 33% and the
bottom one is also
33% and whatever I have assigned you for
the viewport I'd just follow that up
totally and that is why I have assigned
a 100% height here to all of those
divisions okay so that is good but
instead of the orange I would like to
give it a background color of orange
okay so it should be updated not the
coolest orange I could have given it to
it probably will figure out some of the
flat colors from the internet based on
how we go and progress with that so
let's just go with the green and we're
going to have a BTC background color and
that is going to be green automatically
the middle one gets a white so already
looking pretty damn beautiful to me okay
and this guy in the white division is
going to have an H one and H one is
going to simply say happy oops happy in
the pen oops happy Independence Day okay
there we go and okay now this is not
what I want so we're going to use some
skills that you have already learned on
my youtube channel that is flexbox and
you will realize how things are super
easy when you use something known as
flexbox so what we are targeting here in
this division we want to just place it
at the dead center like from horizontal
and vertical horizontal is easy one
which but try the vertical center using
your regular CSS I dare you for that and
you're going to cry after seeing me
especially how I did that with just a
couple of lines of code so let's just
select the white guy because our heading
is into the white so let's just choose
the white and what we are going to do is
just run literally literally three lines
of code to put it at the dead center
first of all it's going to be display of
flex okay say that nothing is going to
happen with that next is going to be
justified content to Center there we go
move to the center now from top to
bottom we're going to talk about align
items so aligned items is
going to be Center and there we go voila
the dot told you so you're going to be
crying out if you're going to be trying
that out with the regular CSS and just
on to the other note I would like this
color to be changed for the h1 let's
just go with the color for blue
I usually don't write these colors just
with the name I use X values but you
know it's independent so we are free to
do so okay so we're basic structure is
ready now it's time to incorporate this
word by instant Vincent okay my bad
sorry about that so what we're going to
do we have already imported the files
which is a pious and particle jeaious
the first step is to include them in our
HTML okay so we're going to be writing a
script here and I need oops command Z I
need a source to follow that up so SRC
and the source is actually particle
first of all include the particle
tickets otherwise things are not going
to look great because first the particle
base file should be loaded up and then
your customization on where you want to
apply should be loaded up so so particle
dot GS okay and I'm going to like this
guy onto the same line save that and
command shift D and then we're going to
include app dot GS okay looks good let's
just verify that there is a particle
stop GS nice catch there I just saved
myself some time and F dot Cheers
okay looks good now we're going to open
up over GS and we can see that the
default is the ID for which it's looking
up is particle dot GS how do I know that
I read in the documentation okay there
we go this is an ID for particle - gia's
you can change that anytime there is no
big deal about it you can change that to
orange and should be looking good
there we go so it's working but you know
what
I don't
like it I want it to be a little bit
more exciting more amazing so I'm going
to be changing it first of all the value
is going to be something like two
hundred yeah that's that's more like it
I like it I don't like these circles I'm
going to be changing that in case you
want to explore more options feel free
to read in the documentation part we
have circle we have edge triangle
polygon and I think star is going to be
good for this amazing day so going to
the shape here is a circle I would like
to change that to star and okay looks
looks pretty good to me yeah I'm happy
with this and I'm pretty sure this
combination of green and white is going
to look damn cool in the green section
so how we can do that that's that should
be actually simply amazingly easy so I'm
going to create a new file I'm going to
call this as green not like that I'm
going to save that as green dot J s
let's set that up and we're going to
copy this all of the file in the app
purchase it there are hundreds of ways
of dealing up with the situation I find
it just like that yours might be a
different approach to solve this up and
this time we're going to be looking up
for green and finally we have to call
this file so I'm going to be just a
command ship D to duplicate that and I
will be saying green dot Cheers and
there we go it looks really cool in the
green I like it we can find actually
good a flat UI colors and we can
actually make it a little bit good
I think this orange is going to look
good so let's just change that flat UI
colors I like this website and style dot
CSS and instead of just saying all the
time orange let's be a little bit more
professional
okay now this looks much more good it's
usually a Safran color but I'm going to
go with that this looks cool
hey it's Independence Day I should be
free to do
you what I like to do okay this looks
pretty damn good now I just need a
couple of more things to be done here
and that should be I would like to get a
font here so let's go to Google font not
fun the google fonts fonts google calm
and the let's choose something which is
amazingly awesome okay this looks pretty
cool okay let's just add this guy and
we're going to do it oops something went
wrong hey Google don't do this to me
come on we are on the recording session
don't do this to me come on Google can
you be a little bit nice and yet this is
going to work I'm going to add this up
and there we go we're going to link this
in our CSS first of all okay looks good
so link this up into not our CSS our
index dot HTML in the head section would
be nice save that now next thing we're
going to do is we're going to go back
we're going to choose the font family
this there is a backup for cursive as
well and we're going to go into standard
CSS and there we go
they should be looking down cool I like
it I like it I can just bump the font a
little bit up and this should be looking
rock-solid
so font size let's just bump it up to 25
maybe nope if you want something big
like 50 how about that yep nope not
happy not happy yep this makes me happy
this makes me happy so very good happy
Independence Day and what else I can do
is I can if I can change yeah that that
actually looks good and I'm going to
just change that to little details
people makes things amazing okay so
there we go we have spent a really good
time in just crafting this not so
masterpiece but yeah you have understood
how you can include the libraries and
all these things I have tried to explain
everything what I'm trying to do here
now here's a simple assignment for you
now go to my website you can see there
is the library that I'm using here which
is type dot J's and in case you are not
aware of this type dot GS is a really
good library you can do a lot of things
with the type dot chairs and just read
the documentation I want you to read
this and then just trying it out and
what your assignment is this happy
Independence Day should be typed up just
like what is it is happening at my
personal website my home page there we
go so it's a pretty simple assignment I
hope everybody will be able to do it so
and if you have done that ping me on
Facebook mail or just in the comment
section in discussion section wherever
you find me so go ahead do that
okay so that's it and for all the
peoples who are already in a complete
front-end developer course this should
be a really nice update you are getting
in there there will be few more videos
added up exclusively in that course so
go ahead check it out it's amazing
course and I'll surely catch up and one
more thing one more thing we forgot that
in case you haven't subscribed to my
youtube channel yet go ahead do that
what's stopping you and I'll surely
catch you up in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
