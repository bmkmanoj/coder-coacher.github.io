master coves I understand that you have
mastered a couple of languages like C
C++ or maybe a bit others but still you
are very intimidated about the Java I'll
make sure that this course will glide
you so smoothly that you won't even
realize when you have started creating
application for yourself as well as your
client but before that I would really
like you to move in the history lesson
of the Java I understand that you are
quite interested in the programming but
Java is having such a marvelous
footprints out there in this history
that these are really need to be cleared
off so let's take a quick lick on the
java history so the Java was not
originally named as Java it was started
as a green project and got started in
the 1991 then the project got modified
and got his name as oak there's a bit
history about this name as well the
developers might say that that the
developers who originally created the
Java were seeing a lots of oak tree in
their surroundings and that's why the
project was named as oak but again the
history got molded out and the project
was named to Java perhaps with a lot of
coffee that the developers were drinking
and who knows what the truth is but
still it's being a myth out there and I
assume that it's a truth out there then
there was a first public release in 1995
and this was the original Java that came
out into the world the Java was having a
fun major goal and that goal was write
once run anywhere you don't need to
compile your source code again and again
write once and just use the use your
software's on any machine like Mac Linux
Windows or any other operating system
the term was really made popularized in
the 1995 that write once and run
anywhere if you have the JVM the Java
Virtual Machine the Java history is
quite a bit out there in the timeline
the first release was made in 1995 and
in the early days that lease was very
subsequent they were very fast in
happening
in 1996 the first version of JDK the
Java development kit was introduced this
was really a modernizing world and a lot
of things got changed after 1996 then in
1997 the JDK version 1.1 was first
released it was really a drastic
improvement in the Java a lot of terms
like inner classes were introduced the
Java beans were introduced the JDBC and
API for talking to the database was
introduced then lots of RMI versions for
talking a lot of things were introduced
their reflection was pretty a strong
thing for making the object orientation
approach a bit stronger then in 1998 the
j2se 1.2 version was introduced now this
was a bit confusing at that time the
j2se the Java 2 standard edition now it
was not bit different from the Java it
was just as standard edition and the 2
after the J stuck for so many years it
introduced a lot of things like swing
graphical API for building out the text
of application was introduced then the
JIT compile time Java plugins for making
the applications to work for a
cross-browser platform and a lot of
collection frameworks were introduced
out there after that the j2se 1.3
version was released now this was really
a drastic improvement from j2se 1.2 to
1.3 and after that the j2se when the two
struck after the j' a lot of things
moved like this way the updation were
out there in the name of version in the
after the decimals like 1.2 1.3 and so
on and the 1.3 version was having a lot
of things like hotspot JVM which was
nothing else you can simply call it as
advanced java virtual machine from the
previous versions sound api was
introduced which was pretty good feature
at that time and a lot of debugging were
made simpler in this version after that
the major subsequent release was j2se
1.4 and 1.5 so let's talk first of all
about 1.4
in the one point for a regular
expression powerful implementation was
done in the Java now you can find
strings and a lot of things you can do
with the regular expressions
apart from that ITV version 6 support
logging API XML support and some script
or graphic and security implementation
were being done in the Java
after that the j2se 5.0 was introduced
now it is also known as 1.5 or 5.0 it
just means the same but really the
developer realized hey we cannot move
out there in just 1.3 1.4 and so on so
we have to make some changes out there
they decided that 1.5 version will also
be known as 5.0 and after that all the
releases were like that like 6.0 7.0 and
so on
the version 5.0 was really the powerful
change in the syntax after this version
none of the syntax of the Java actually
got changed so things got stuck around
after the 5.0 it was having some
generics things some a lot of changes in
the enumerations very well argument and
spatially fought each loop was there and
it was really an enhancement from the
previous looking things and after that
the simple thing got introduced in the
2006 j2se 6 but it was not a much
drastic change out there as compared to
j2se 5 for 'men spaced upgradation as
well as graphical user interface
upgradation but not a drastic at all and
after that the Java got stuck around
no releases were out there drastic
releases small updates and maintenance
updates were out there but then the
history got changes in 2010 in 2010
Oracle bought Sun Microsystems and along
with the Sun Microsystems
their entire projects were also being
bought including the Java and after that
Oracle was kind of a god for Java it
tried to build the popularity in the
Java and finally in 2011 j2se 7 was
introduced it was really D version we
we are looking into the course it's
having the string in switch it's it's
having the try-catch improvements and a
lot of improvement things were being
done in this j2 a c7 version will be
focusing on this seventh version in this
entire course now history cannot be
completed without taking a call about
the future of grades and in the future I
am expecting in this 2014 at the time of
the recording that the j2se eight
version is about to come it's having a
lot of good features like lambda
functions and all these things but don't
get scared off we are not going to cover
lambda expressions because since it's
not yet been introduced but soon I'll
update the course as soon as the j2se is
out there so that's all is a just bit
history about the Java now let's take
onto the new movie and find out what's
out there for you and don't forget to
drop me an email thank you so much for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
