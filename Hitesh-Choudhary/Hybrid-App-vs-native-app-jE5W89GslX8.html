again with another video now in this
video we want to talk about the
highbreed app versus native apps so in
case you want to get started with the
application development we are gonna
focus on that so in this video you will
find out what is hybrid app what is
native app in case if you are a company
which one is going to suit for you in
case you are a learner or student which
one you should really move on we will
also compare some of the pricing points
as well as if you have some experience
which one you should go for or if you
are completely getting started as a new
beginner which one is going to be right
for you so a ton of information is
packed in this video and we are going to
talk about all of them so let's get
started here
so hybrid app versus native app now
before we get started into the
nitty-gritty word of hybrid versus
native mobile application there is one
aspect of mobile that you should always
be aware of mobile phones are very very
personal devices so if you are building
apps for both iOS and Android users
without the same perspective it's not
going to work that's for sure as it
stands most mobile devices use one of
the two dominant operating systems on
the world and Google developed Android
which takes almost the majority of like
49% of the mobile world market share and
on the other hand Apple developed iOS
which takes almost 41% of the mobile
share so these data are very critical
and very important before you want to
jump and start your application now a
native app is a smartphone application
developed specifically for mobile
operating system like if you want to say
think about Swift for iOS and Java for
Android since the app is developed
within the mature ecosystem following
the technical users and user guideline
expedience provided by the OS itself
like the swipe gestures or alignment on
the left side or the center for the
Android and iOS now of course they offer
the fastest and the most reliable and
most responsive experience to the user
app will have the look and feel and
consistency with within the most other
native
which are built-in into the devices
native application have the significant
advantage of being able to easily
accesible and utilize the built-in
capabilities of the user's device itself
like for example if you want to just say
GPS or maybe your address book or your
camera tons of other things well on the
other hand if we talk about the hybrid
applications hybrid application are at
core website package wrapped into a
native wrapper sometime PhoneGap or
others they look and feel like the
native app but ultimately outside the
basic frame of the application they are
powered by the company's website itself
for example sites like Facebook or
Netflix it doesn't really make sense to
launch a native app platform or even to
recompile their app for just the one
feature it's going to take a lot of time
and it's too heavy so it really makes
sense for them to just get started with
the hybrid application now hybrid app
can also use native functionality like
camera on GPS but via some third-party
plugins and a lot of code need to be
enclosed with that while on the other
hand the native application are pretty
easy to use or utilize those
functionality like camera or your GPS
it's pretty easy there ok now let's talk
about which one is right for you so if
you are a company and you're looking to
get started with the app market it's
going to be a good research like you are
already dominant in the web like
Facebook or Netflix and your content
flows like insane like an insane amount
they then having a native app would be
tough decision while hybrid app will
suit you more on the other hand if you
are just getting started for the mobile
market then take some time do some
research like where the maturity of the
audience that you really want to hit is
actually relying whether they are on
Android or iOS like if you just talked
about just random experience let's just
say like in Indian market the Android is
going to be the first choice for
launching your app or if you are if your
target audience is in the United States
then it's going to be for sure
iOS if it's going to be paid up I would
surely go for the iOS first without any
type but if I really want to hit the
of the market with the free team or free
app then surely I would go for the
Android now if you are individual and
trying to learn the mobile application
development then think a little bit if
you are already having a web-based
skills so go with the hybrid apps but in
keep in mind that the salary
point-of-view native app developers are
actually a little bit higher and are on
top of the hybrid app developer but
again if you don't want to switch for
the mobile development market or mobile
development skills surely go for hybrid
apps and just quickly finish the project
and if you already have web-based skills
you will feel right at the home with the
hybrid apps now for the non web
developers or who are just getting
started in the programming now again
think a little bit what you want to do
which one is going to be the thing that
makes you more exciting and obviously
the big question is do you have a Mac No
then iOS is going to be a little bit
bumpy right now I know a lot of you will
come in the comment section below and
will say it's possible to install it
back on a virtual machine or you can use
the very famous services like Mac and
cloud comm yes I agree with you
yes it can be done with a but you won't
be much comfortable there and obviously
if you spend that much amount of time in
learning iOS by buying a Mac if that's
possible then it's going to be a much
more decision keeping in mind that you
have a time constraint there of course
money is there but time is there as well
now if you are interested in getting
started with the Android then there is
no such barrier you can get started with
the Java and there you go now it's
always about what excites you the most
and more importantly what is your target
audience are using that you want to hit
with your app now if your target
audience that you want to really hit is
using the Android most really it makes
sense to learn Android but again keep in
mind that from the salary point of view
with the current perspective of the
market if you look for various the
scales that a lot of company gives out
Android is a little bit on to the lower
side and iOS is on to a little bit
higher side I'm not saying that Android
don't earn money they really do hit
really great and in fact it's more over
a saturated market and a lot of people
want to have the developers with the
Android skills but again if you talk
about the iOS it's a little bit higher
it's like just a close hit there so
there you go now you have a little bit
knowledge and understanding what is the
hybrid app what is the native app I'm
looking forward which one you're going
to start now in case you want to get
started with the iOS development I'll
link down below a great course link and
you can get started with there of course
I'm not saying take the course right now
just read out few reviews check out free
freedom free movies and then decide it
yourself now as I always says if you
haven't yet subscribed to the channel
make sure you do hit the subscribe
button make sure you like the videos and
share it with someone who can get
benefit with that now with this I'll
catch you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
