Sunday life in case fear if you don't
know we do send a live almost every
Sunday so I'm just waiting for the
people to show up and in case you don't
know that how to get the information
about the timings of the sunday life
follow me up on my Facebook page where I
post around two hours or three hours
ahead of this life so hey there everyone
hey Shiva Neal hey any cake face or a
fake art a so I'm trying to wait for a
few seconds so that people can show up
and can get started here and you can ask
all the questions actually I like I like
this concept of getting Sunday life
because it's opportunity to interact
with all of you guys you have the
opportunity to ask questions directly
direct sessions are always the best so
yep so let's just wait for a few people
and you can post on your questions and
let's just try to answer a few of them
okay so hey they should look good and
beard yeah I know I actually did a clean
shave because I was getting some kind of
itching stuff and all that so once in a
while it's good to go clean shave at
least you can recognize how do you look
like so yeah but no I'm not gonna stay
for long in this look so definitely good
morning hey good morning to you as well
- hi Shep O'Neal and a lot of lot of
people are showing up okay let's get
started yes for sure Haley but let's get
started so let's let's look up some
questions and let me just try to look up
I'm so glad I didn't miss the live vid
hey Malark
I hope I'm not pronouncing your name
badly but thank you so much for joining
the life and
so let's take a few good questions feels
really great to talk live with you hey
Naaman thank you so much for joining
live okay so let's take some questions
so Mohammad Sahib asks after PHP what
language should I have to learn next
now I expect that since you have already
learned PHP you must be having knowledge
of HTML CSS a little bit of JavaScript
and jQuery and PHP is always one of the
golden languages which is good for small
scale business
so I would recommend to sharp your
skills in JavaScript and go for es6
version of javascript and look up for
noches maybe or maybe a reactor so that
would be my advice to you okay
so let's ask sir Lenovo IdeaPad 7
generation I 5 to 50 8 GB SSD and a
chibi Ram is it enough for Java it's
more than enough for Java and in fact
any kind of programming and 258 GB SSD
is little bit smaller but I think it's
good enough more than enough if you are
just a programmer and not a collector of
movies and tutorials but anyways you can
buy your external hard disk from Amazon
or wherever you buy that you can just
buy that so having a small hard disk is
not such a big problem because you are
getting 7 gen-i 5 and 8 GB RAM which is
pretty good make sure you also get a
little bit decent graphic card as well
ok please describe your professional
path ah it's a bumpy road for me because
I started as electronic guy first of all
that I moved into penetration testing
then into web development for a little
bit time I did work as an SEO as well
search engine optimization and finally
into the mobile application development
so which it's been quite a long ride for
me
ok sir why app why IT companies asked
for aptitude and reasoning in their
tests very interesting question action
coach were there so why IT companies
asked aptitude and reasoning in their
tests
is it mandatory to go good in it sorry
if I may ask how are you in aptitude and
reasoning I'm pretty decent in aptitude
and reasoning not so good because I
don't like the concept of the companies
that they are looking for the aptitude
and rather not in programming usually
the programming guys do have good skills
and aptitude and all these things decent
skills not so awesome because they do
require separate kind of tests and
preparation but I'm not so good in that
and even I try to avoid those companies
who are looking for aptitude and
reasoning rather than my programming
skills so I usually ditch them I'm
looking for a moreover I'm interested in
the programming companies who are
actually willing to check out what are
my programming skills how I do I write
my code what applications I have built
in the past so it's not something that I
always have to go with the companies
with the reasoning I just skip them so I
just say you keep on happy with those
aptitude skills I'm happy with my
programming skills and there are
companies who are looking for those
skills and I would be really happy to
work with them ok ok so I want to be Web
Application pen testers so Python is
rarely required or not
uncle Pandey asks this ok I would say a
good penetration tester is one who knows
a lot about programming now I know it is
not always compulsory to go with the
programming first and then pen tester
you can directly become pen tester but
the more programming knowledge and skill
you will have it would be much easier
life for you
like for example obviously it is much
easier to hire a person who knows pen
testing and those about let's just say
XSS attack and also knows about
JavaScript and knows how to fix them
what code to write exactly to fix them
so job opportunities really increases a
lot when you know a lot of programming
like a Python and JavaScript and PHP and
all those stuff I know people will
disagree with that but hey we are not
programmers we are
just meant testers but again I'm kind of
a person who always prefer you to go
with more skills the more skills you
will have you'll have much better job
opportunities you'll get high payments
and high options so I would say just go
with that okay help India by the way
that's a nice name I am your big fan
thank you so much Google cloud versus
Azul
some of you might disagree with me here
I would prefer Google cloud I'm not a
big fan of any kind of Microsoft Tech
they'd don't do it just right they do it
really good
No no harm in that but I'm kind of a fan
because I have been with the OpenStack
during my master's during my masters and
I looked up upon to the different kind
of like a bare-metal virtualizations and
all those kinds of stuff funky stuff I
preferred Google cloud or maybe virtual
machines and all these things so Google
cloud would be my choice okay let's just
keep it there please tell me some more
ways to earn money online I have I
actually did a video on earning money
online and I invited a lot of spam if I
just check it right now probably 300
spam comments were there on that
particular video spam and not about the
just general comments and they were
separate so unit just the spam comments
yes there are good ways legitimate ways
to earn a money online but for that you
first need to focus on skills once you
have the skills there's nobody who can
stop you to earn maybe offline or online
so I would say instead of going just for
money money money money money go for
scale scale scale and skills okay I hope
that makes sense okay will there any
machine learning codes coming soon hey
Vinod Kumar thanks for asking this yep
that is planned that is going to come up
I do have some good and great surprises
for machine learning and that's coming
up
so yeah that is going to come up okay
sir testing course versus Java training
I would say they are almost the same
because if you want to be good a tester
you will have to come on the selenium
because manual testing is just okay to
start but eventually to grow up in the
field you have to go with the selenium
and that requires Java or Python
wherever you want to go and I think I
think yes really it's me saying that
Java performs really better in selenium
compared to the Python so yes you have
to go with the Java babe no other option
okay very chipper hi good morning good
morning to you as well how's it going on
so James George Oz is SAS important to
learn no you don't learn SAS you don't
learn pass because these are just
software as a service platform as a
service they you don't learn these
things you just use those things okay
sauce is a big domain it's like is it
good to learn programming no or yes you
need to talk about Python or Java or a C
or JavaScript you don't talk about
programming you just talk about a
specific domain so similarly SAS paths
and all these things are just a broad
categorization you don't talk about them
like that
okay also have you tried pyramid
framework Pranjal asks this no I haven't
I haven't worked much on in fact
anything I don't know anything about the
pyramid framework there tons of
frameworks I'm not aware about anything
but glad you asked
clears of the thing please reply me I'm
replying you help India's you just ask
your question okay
I want to ask how much time will it take
me to learn HTML and CSS from scratch if
I study one hour a day
hmm one hour a day is like very very
less very very less you are not so much
a be calling a steady
I won't be calling you dedicated if
you'll go with the one holiday at least
go for three hours a day and then I
think whether Malik you can be really
good in HTML okay
after front-end which back end to go
with hey Sachin I would highly recommend
to check out my course on react.js
complete react.js that talks a lot about
the backend firebase login
authentication api's so go ahead check
out my react course okay hi sir hi sir
hi James hi James
okay so I'm a big fan you're great thank
you so much for this lovely compliment
there naman okay is there any advanced
course for coupling yes we make Advanced
Course in Cortland is land but I'm stuck
with a couple of authors publishers that
kind of scenario because they have been
asking for my work to be just given to
them and it's a good deal I'm thinking
about it so probably my Advanced Course
in Python will be costing a little bit
more probably like a $80 or something or
because I might be selling all the
rights to those publishers so depending
on what kind of deal we set allowed the
Kotlin course will go there
come on to my stead okay let me know the
scope of angularjs and from where to
learn and we don't have any course our
cash about angular because angular is
such in a rapid development they need to
slow down and I have discussed in one of
the previous videos as well that angular
is a great thing but the only problem is
backward compatibility whenever they
roll out the new version the previous
version just brokes down and that is
probably one of the reason I don't
prefer angular much in my code it's too
much hard it's hard to maintain these
kinds of code so yeah bad bad thing but
yes angular in itself is a great tech
okay so what things should I ask to
myself before choosing mobile app
developer as a carrier I just passed
well luckily you asked this shear sac
Podell I hope I'm not putting down the
name I have just rolled out a video yes
today iOS development versus Android
development I think you should you need
to watch them because I have compared a
lot of aspect like how much do you earn
as an app developer what apps do good in
what market and what are the
obstructions hardware requirement fees
to upload the things I have compared a
lot of things so my computer just there
is a couple of uploading going on there
of new videos are coming up so let's
take more questions ok so a lot of
people are watching 149 people 148 so
far hey guys in the meantime you can
show some love by doing it thumbs up to
this video your thumbs up is actually a
V to understand that yes you you're
liking the concept so book that up so
thumbs up it should be boosted up so
come on boost that yeah I can see your
love coming up 80 ones so there we go
ok Android versus iOS I just made a
video a teach yesterday I uploaded that
so go ahead check that out after this
live of course I have made a power
comparison between Android versus iOS
honestly I'm not a big fan of any one of
them it's just a work for me if the
client says hey work with the iOS I'll
say ok pay my piece and I'm with you if
the client says hey you work in the Java
and Android I just say pay my piece and
here I go so for me it's just a work
they are almost the same for me there is
no such drastic difference apart from
programming the language is different
but apart from that the concepts are
usually the same for example in the iOS
also you just have methods like on
create and on move and all those will
appear you will appear do you will
disappear
in the end ready have methods like
oncreate on start on pause so almost the
same thing what course you prefer
programming or web development if I
would have been big nerd right now I
would have actually got started with the
web development because it gives you
more about more information about
placing the elements the JavaScript
actually gives you more idea about how
the things are actually working by
seeing them live in front of me so if I
would have been bigness right now I
would have probably started with a BEM
development probably my journey was
completely different what do you think
about Python Django framework hey move
it I don't like it much problem because
there are better frameworks that can do
really good in a scalability as well as
handling the loads and everything I
don't work much in the Django so I don't
like it okay so what course you prefer
programming or web development I just
answer that why did you choose react
native over other things like ionic
cordova and native scrim because of the
performance and the ease to learn it
because when you go with the things like
I think it's also good but the learning
curve is steep it's really high and
Cordova is something that I don't like
much it's it's a performance issue
native script is okay but the reason
which actually derived me vishal over
react native is it's react so it's
ancestor which is react and by the way
react if you know that react you can
design some awesome web application you
don't have to relearn everything in
order to work in the react native and
mobile platform so I preferred react
native because I love the react the
ability to scale up everything and it
just
is like a plugin thing you can plug it
in everywhere so I thought it's a good
framework and and actually one thing
that actually got me here is the
Facebook because right now the website
which is handling too much of the load
too much of the active user is Facebook
so they really do know how to manage
load and eventually your website or
whatever the product you are creating if
you stuck around with it it will grow up
like I started my website learn code
online dot and started with a just first
day it was just five or ten users now
it's growing like insane so load
balancing is something that you have to
manage every user should be happy and
Facebook knows it the best how to be
done with that so this made me to go
with the react okay so how to improve
our logics keep on working with them
keep on working with them it takes years
to get better in logic so yes just help
me out on Android app examples I have
actually already rolled out an Android
course so go ahead and check it out
which course you prefer okay answer that
answer that answered a lot of them okay
I'm creating a new web application
should I use JavaScript or type straight
are there any parameter to consider
choosing it known image there is no such
parameters or no such much needed to be
worried about if you are already aware
of the type script go with that but
again because I assume that if you're
talking about the type script you are
already aware about the es6 version of
javascript so we are not talking about
just vanilla JavaScript we are talking
about es6 version at least so I would
say there is no such need to learn
typescript because you can do all the
jobs that you are looking at for already
in es6 using react so you can go with
that but again if you already know types
good then you can I look for the angular
and other things as well so no such big
decision there both can handle node and
everything pro full-power
asked react versus angular I am a big
fan of react but that doesn't mean
sample that is bad angular is also good
but again as I said the rapid
development of the
makes me a little bit worried that
whether things will be backward
compatible or not no such thing in the
react your coat doesn't break that much
help me out on git and github what help
do you need I have already prepared a
video on uploading files in github and
getting fast from github is super easy
so free logs or video please all in caps
Pranay please don't do that all in caps
looks like you are screaming at me don't
do that how to get emails from you about
the offline boot camp hey Sachin I have
just replied to your email about the
offline boot camp right now right now
the boot camps are actually planned for
London and Russia and yes I'll be
teaching in those boot camps in London
and Russia for India as of now there is
no such plan because in India I haven't
got that much of the subscriber base
from India to host offline boot camps
probably we will try that very soon but
I'll have just kept you in my boot camp
list so if there will be email going on
for India for the boot camp definitely
you will get informed with their so I've
already placed you in that email list
when you are going to start off then
boot camps it's already started are safe
not in India yet there will be in London
and Russia so let me know what is your
country probably we can arrange
something ok so develop GSD web
application ok this is I think not
making much sense
what about golang golang is great some
of my friends are working in the code
and they are completely happy with that
but I don't work much about it we
haven't talked much on the go language
so you are providing basic training
kindly provide in-depth real-time
oriented
hey Siva thank you for asking basic
training is actually the base of getting
started if you think that anybody is
going to help you to create the next
awesome project that you're looking for
nobody's going to train you for that
these are the things that you have to
come up with your own and yes I do
provide sometimes extreme trainings but
they are really a little bit costly
session like a thousand dollars per
student and that is also limited for
seven students only so I did a last year
a bootcamp on iOS for that it was a
really crazy insane we just worked on
one application only for I think 10 days
or 12 days or something and almost word
like six or seven hours a day completely
rigorous our training that so I do host
sometimes that but rarely okay some app
the god Tech udemy versus lco feel free
to go anywhere it it doesn't really
matter much but again the only problem
is the credit card and debit card if
you're in India lco would be your choice
because probably you might not be having
credit card if you do have credit card
feel free to buy anywhere no problem at
all how you keep track that what you
learning day by day please tell us also
haha I haven't thought actually might
about much about it that how do I keep a
track of that oh yeah think and make a
video of that okay I want to become an
ethical hacker good check out lco learn
code online dot n okay let's arms please
reply okay come on don't repeat your
questions shout out my name hey prana
power I am shouting out your name okay
hey sir I'm the guy with Microsoft
Technology like dotnet should I move in
open-source hey Saki yeah I would say
probably move on
those probably are not right or not
because I don't know everything but I
would say moving into the open source
technology is actually far more better
in than the restrictive environment of
the Microsoft getting dependent all the
time on Microsoft for the updates and
everything I'm not a big fan of that
please make a video on your entire
journey probably it's not a good thing
because my childhood was rough
completely broke so it's not it's not
going to be a good study it was really
bad terrible so probably we'll do that
someday okay
made by version one website based on
traveling it was satisfactory but how
can I improve and learn more to level up
in version 2 I'll probably talk about
that because I will roll out a new video
on how to improve and move to version 2
okay for video make video for job
interview please know I'm not gonna do
that because once you have the skills
you have a portfolio it's easy to find
job and this is not a job interview
where people just ask you those full and
crappy questions tell me where do you
see yourself in five years or questions
like what are your strengths and
weaknesses bully questions watch out the
AIB videos for fast ok please tell me
about Mac Mini Mohammed shock you've
asked this Mac Mini is a good thing I
have actually two Mac minis lying around
somewhere don't know where they are but
I have two Mac minis in the Mac Mini you
just get a kind of a CPU really decently
powered I did of my first iOS app on Mac
Mini so it's a good device but you have
to buy extra mouse keyboard and screen
for that so make sure you are ready to
invest in there as well
ok sir is there a scope of machine
learning in India there is no such thing
as scope you create scope and you always
move forward that's how the thing works
not like it is the scope if there is a
scope there are probably thousands and
thousands and lakhs of people's going on
with that so don't worry about the scope
anyway
anytime is telescope of see is that a
scope of PHP is there a scope of
JavaScript don't worry about that just
keep on learning and going on with that
okay
so shout out my question first the
difference between system architects a
system developer iris and detailed
questions cannot take that here please
tell me some tips to CSE students and
I'm thinking to prepare for gate and
we'll get em tagged at IIT after four
years we'll be that good sir don't know
about what will be killed in that time
okay a lot of people asking questions
about the freelancing freelancing
freelancing probably I have actually
planned to include some free updates in
a front-end development boot came about
freelancing some good things so yeah
that will be included okay
any plans for coming in Goa okay first
of all you don't write coming like that
it's it's bad okay don't do that
and yes I go as one of my favorite
destination I usually spend two times I
visit go out two times in a year
so yes I am frequent didn't go I love
their beaches are awesome I do stay in I
don't Bowl Beach quite a lot I like that
okay so New Delhi meetup probably we
will try okay Mohammed Al Hussein asked
why not Hindi because I don't know how
to write my code in Hindi as soon as I
learned how to write these declaration
of variables and loops in Hindi I will
definitely start a channel in Hindi till
then it's going to be in English I don't
know Java can i still take your android
course at LC o haiti bug to die debug to
divine surely the java is actually
included in the hell co check out the
curriculum and the content so that you
can know what is covered so java is
covered there what is the feature of
Android pretty good pretty solid mobile
applications will have for everything
okay there are some spammers going on
here so we will be probably blocking
them
is there any option to block them I
probably I'll do that okay you have
girlfriend personal questions please
probably next time you'll be asking do
you drink vodka or why are you going to
Russia to drink vodka or something
probably this can be vodka this is not
actually no personal questions please
it's funny it's fun hey Arwen so it's
fun so sir I'm getting anybody to do a
project in my professional course how
I'm not hearing you okay plans to visit
Kerala oh no no plans for Kerala as of
now there are situations arising to
visit Bangalore because I do have some
friends calling me up there and I do
have some professional meetings there as
well
so probably there are some plans for
Bangalore not sure but no plans for
Kerala James okay so you were on the
trip to China with me
hey it's Meera can hey takane how's it
going on it it's been a while how are
you doing I think you are in the States
right now have you joined up the college
let me know in this in this comment
section which college you have joined in
the states I will be traveling to Russia
if you do have any plans for traveling
to Russia you let me know okay can
Python be used for Android no for every
application there is a separate language
and you have to learn it okay oh okay
let's go there okay let's ask hey they
should tell about your tattoo there is
is my tattoo can you see that I have got
a lot of tattoos how to show this guy
okay now you can see them this is one of
them I do have one here as well so I'm a
fan of tattoos and I do have a lot of
them okay okay IT jobs are safe in India
nothing to say
if not even crossing the road is saved
so I'm not a guy who thinks so much
about safety life security job security
I don't do that I just keep on moving
okay so not a good person to ask okay so
what money is we earn from Android
application the simple general's money
when people download your app or maybe
purchase something from your app maybe
purchase your entire app so that's kind
of money you make okay so let's just
look for more questions what's your
mother tongue there's no such thing as
nothin else mother tongue I do speak
Hindi English and little Spanish i also
do speak my body as well because I was I
was born in Jaipur so yes I do speak
Marathi as well my Spanish is okay not
so good I can I could read it completely
I know every single word in that so I
can read it completely and thoroughly
understanding is not so good speaking is
little bit you know pequeno pequeno so
yeah okay please keep on is it
Illuminati tattoo Orion I know a lot of
people ask me he's hit 11 at each other
because in the videos it's not being
shown in that good way it's a pyramid
it's an infinite pyramid then the
universe inside it so it looks like that
but hey I love it keep showing your love
to hit that thumbs up button
I need that so keep on going with that
take a moment and do hit that like
button it's important okay we have been
going on for almost 30 minutes and let
me know also that if you do like this
Sunday life thing because I love it do
let me know give it a thumbs up okay so
hi sir you are doing a really good job
to encourage youngsters say thank you
ohm Knievel thank you so much okay so a
few questions about my tattoos as well
yes we do like send alive Brennan thank
you so much I also do like it this is a
good way to interact with people you're
not give my answer
you don't give my answer I'm trying my
best to look up for every questions but
sometimes they just goes like that so
happens like that okay
so hello sir I was thinking about
getting enrolled in Android wear that
goes up okay let me search that again
Android of course but I don't think that
it has much content please reply hey
prefer if you are not think if you're
thinking that it's not having much
content you can join up with the offline
boot camps but they are probably a
little bit more costly like around
40,000 or something and I'm trying my
best to give you add the holdable rates
it depends on you if you can afford like
30,000 40,000 feel free to join me in
the offline boot camps they are far more
comprehensive you get one-on-one support
but yes they are expensive so if you
think you want to join that up I'm
thinking also to do online boot camps as
well where I will be coming up for like
one or two or I will take like sessions
of all Cod coatings and everything's and
again that is not going to be like cheap
like 800 rupees or $10 or $20 they are
going to be expensive like 200 or 300
dollars so drop me email probably we can
do that okay what is boot camp
okay surance boot camps are like
workshops or extreme classes where I am
live in front of you
accessible offline and I do teach
programming and Android development and
everything
it's very exhaustive trainings like you
learn like six hours or seven hours a
day and you just repeat what I do there
if you have a problem I am
to solve your problems and at the end of
the boot games like ten days or 15 days
of probably a month you get yourself
like five or six extremely good apps
with good graphics everything so boot
camps are a way to learn easily it's
like a degree but with knowledge yes sir
just like that okay so there we go tell
about selenium tool probably we'll do
that later on cannot discuss selling him
right now because most of the people are
not aware about the testings and stuff
so what was your first Android app my
first Android app was a sleek counter I
just made a sheep are rolling out one
two three when you tap on it it just
goes like that and it's counts one two
three there are a couple of apps on my
Android phone as well I use them one of
them is the Notes app I don't use any
other note app I just use it for my
personal to-do list app is also designed
by me I haven't actually pushed that on
to the Google store
it's the app which doesn't have a delete
feature from here because it's connected
to the firebase I've also made a web
application for that so whenever I write
my to-do list in my phone I'm not
allowed to delete it in my phone because
most of that work need to be done on the
computer and I can only delete that from
the web application so this is the app
but I regularly use it's a simple app
simple to do app anybody can design that
okay where are you working now I'm
working from my home home sweet home ok
what is your best and cool project
you've made in your life ah there are
actually many we have worked for one of
the Canadian clients that was actually
awesome for the medical company rinoa
which was pretty awesome
and that was one of the cool project
very tough medical companies are not
easy to handle that was one of the cool
around the freelancing one or free one
entirely Oh
one was the GUI for aircrack set of
tools that was cool I am done actually a
lot of project so I don't think so any
one of them is good or take my name it
age okay it's probably will be tough
Abdul Wahab Nisa money okay I hope I did
that okay nice hairstyle I didn't cut
them them because they were growing
quite a lot okay so I only occupy it's
my birthday
Ferdie happy birthday
what's your daily routine get up write
code eat exercise sleep simple and on
Sundays do Sunday life okay so okay so
okay there we go there we go can a non
graduate that question goes up can a non
graduate with good programming skills
can land into big MNCs yes a lot of my
friends have actually landed up in Big M
and C's and they don't have a degree
they are dropouts but they made it to
the college so yes it's possible but I
don't recommend and dropping out of the
college and everything I I recommend
struggle a little bit work hard work
harder learn programming as well as to
learn completed college as well so not a
big fan of dropping out go ahead
complete your education okay
so sir your Android bootcamp is enough
to get me a job no course no book no
bootcamp is enough to get you a job
because to get a job you have to work a
little bit extra on that they are good
to get you a path straight forward to
the job but again it will focus hard
enough to complete those apps and even
will make a couple of apps on your own
you are ready and to rock and roll in a
job so yes they are good but a little
bit of your egg efforts are always
required okay
so I've tried to answer a lot of your
questions today we have done a pretty
good job almost 40 minutes
okay so as a complete beginner which
coding language should I choose
JavaScript would be awesome you are my
inspiration thank you
I'm here to support all of you okay
please shout out our Android developer
group Pooja team leader Kiran
Abhishek and sorrow and please motivate
us for our internship hey Weez thank you
so much for joining in I would say
complete your intern show me what you
have got your project and everything
really would love to meet such group who
are actually passionate about just one
thing it's really hard to find all the
group passionate about one thing so it's
good keep going on okay okay are you in
GDG what that Shinichi is I'm not good
in shortcuts okay though my question
wasn't answered I enjoyed this session
okay mother
Malachi for that how MVP is important in
Android I think you are going to ask MVC
Model View controller yes is important
when you have a lot of files a lot of
activity files lot of intense moving
here and there so it's important there
okay so a lot of evil faces by Sandeep
please reply me cloud computing is good
or not it's good it's awesome
EDA place is awesome by the way okay SAS
extension of CSS James George okay now
you're getting me I got you as a
software-as-a-service but now you have
written it correctly previously you
wrote s AES which is software is a
service
SAS s is a extension of CSS it's awesome
by the way and I'm a big fan of not
using the curly braces in SAS you don't
use curly braces you just
indented codes so I'm a big fan of that
and it's pretty easy to learn as they're
I think probably in a day or two you can
learn that probably in a day or two
typos yeah there was a typo but okay
they sorted that out okay should I start
my own development company with my five
friends will it work you will never know
until unless you try that so go ahead
give it a shot
start your company you let me know if
that works out but hey you will never
know unless you get started in that so
go ahead do that okay please keep some
new idea about the developed course our
project for college they are tons of
project if you're not yet inspired to do
something why you have even learned
programming because programming is
something which inspire you to create
something do something so go ahead
try to even learn one more time okay so
I have no job satisfaction I've ever
designed about to do become a VIP
developer okay if you're not liking
designer part go ahead give it a shot in
developer oh okay so I'm from Pakistan
by when I try to register it asked me my
mobile number you can skip that or you
can just register from okay I think the
payment gateway actually asked for
mobile number and it's compulsory
because sometimes if the thing goes
wrong I can actually get you back so you
can just skip that won't recommend that
but you can skip that okay okay so
probably Sidhant are these evil faces
won't work do that okay please reply sir
can I buy a second hand MacBook Pro
surely they are good but don't buy just
too old who are not getting the OS
update just buy which is getting the new
dates like Sierra and High Sierras and
all those so they are completely good my
five year or I think four year old
MacBook Pro is still working awesome and
fine and even I do some time I did
videos on that so it's good I will do
produce good machines ok UI UX designer
opportunities plenty of opportunities
everybody is hiring UI and UX previously
there was no jobs for them but now a
flip kart snap deal everybody is hiring
UI and UX check out the angel list there
are hundreds of job for them ok
how to be a tension-free in life like
you it just is an attitude towards the
life just don't worry too much what will
happen is gonna happen we cannot do
anything about it so let's just face the
situation if it is bad let's face it if
it is good let's enjoy it
so don't worry too much just keep on
going probably I have seen enough phases
in the life that were too too harsh on
me compared to it right now
it's too awesome so compared to your
life which was 5 years back it was too
bad now it's comparatively ok so don't
take tensions whatever happen is gonna
happen so don't worry too much about it
just be happy don't forget to exercise
because that actually keeps you happy ok
ok yes but not I'm currently enrolled in
mark price I extend their set 3 to me is
that good yes it's good my price is a
good instructor and a good friend
so go ahead best of luck with that it's
awesome I recommend to take multiple
boot camps so yeah that is also good so
go ahead in that so you are programming
mkbhd boohoo that is the best comment I
have ever got so probably not so good
like mkbhd is ready
with the red cameras and I just use
these small lenses I don't have a lot of
lenses and all those have a lot of gears
yesterday I posted a video of few yes
literally they were few gadgets on my
table because my table was completely
filled I couldn't put up my macbook and
a lot of other laptops and all those
devices so yes they were few of those
gadgets and people got insane hearted
they were probably off around more than
10 lakhs on the table right now but they
were not off my complete gadget shelf or
rack all of the drawers here and theirs
are completely packed with the gadgets
and stuff so there's no idea absolutely
no idea how much gadgets and how much
devices I do have okay so okay so please
speak my name Gudger duck
hush McCune by probably I'm really bad
in that sorry well developer web
application developer okay I tried my
best gutter there okay so see son did
you ever try with unity yes I did try it
with a unity failed really really bad I
did actually created a few characters
and the physics of the gravity they were
terrible characters terrible design I'm
being honest with you so yes I did try
to the unity not so good experience
I'm learning it I'm enjoying it but not
so good and professional so that I can
teach it yet I'll try my best to get
better in that but right now I'm I'm
cooler than that bad in that okay okay
easy to me good to learn online
programming yes it's awesome don't do
that okay so okay which language to
learn okay we're good okay so our
questions are just keep poppin and I
think I lost a lot of them love you sir
let me - how to get started in ethical
hacking please tell me I'm big fan of
you'd probably get started with my
complete penetration testing boot camp
available at learn code online that's
probably best getting started point
which is the hardest programming
language the hardest programming
language is your first programming
language and I'm not talking about the
first programming language way to get
syntax I am talking about the
programming language when you actually
design something that is actually the
hardest programming language whether
it's JavaScript Java C PHP whatever that
is it's the toughest one once you
complete that project everything is easy
okay okay thanks for giving me reply to
my comment as you said where that car
where did that went as I say in
JavaScript is good for bigness Python
versus JavaScript which is easy and best
both are equally okay depending on where
you want to go because with the
JavaScript you can design some awesome
web application and can see your product
going on there with the Python we need
to work a little bit extra part time job
at home no investment free joining free
ok so we can see there are a lot of
spams going on and specially after how
to earn money online
so hey technically perk don't do that
don't spam on this channel otherwise I
have to block you my request my humble
request to you please don't do that okay
bootcamp on electron thank you so much
for asking yes I'm planning for that
because previously before going for the
bootcamp I have to prepare at least five
or six apps for that before that I
cannot go that because I do I don't do
like the regular Institute's that you
see in India we just teach something
just the syntax and that's it no it's
not my style whenever I teach something
I at least make five six or ten apps so
that student can get idea what they are
learning why they are learning what they
will be producing after learning this so
this is the reason why a lot of people
will yes
the community of the programming guys
like me because they are used to of
learning just the syntax and probably
they don't know about me
this is the probably one of the reason
why my channel is growing quite a lot
now because people have understood that
learning just the syntax won't work out
but usually these Institute's and the
offline boot camps are teaching because
just learning the syntax doesn't make
sense
you need to make projects and that
project should not come at the end that
project should go just a long side with
the training ok and you should make a
lot of them ok ok is mechatronics
engineering good or not hey on this
channel here in this channel we talk
about programming web apps mobile apps
and then put online not about
mechanicals and electronics although I
am from electronics brands but we still
don't talk about it this channel has a
category we just follow that ok please
clear the concept of front-end back-end
I'm not getting that probably I'll make
a video for that I find all your
lectures and videos extremely enjoyable
thank you Ashish kalakar I guess you're
from Mumbai because I do have a friends
from Mumbai and almost exactly similar
ish surname and I love these guys
because no my guys do have a charm
probably don't know why but they're
awesome so do let me know in the comment
section below if you're from Mumbai I
guess that right ok so let's go with
that more questions ok where are you
from I'm from Internet I work for
Internet okay I'm gonna join CSC in
August any advice hey technologies
best of luck for joining CSC it's a good
branch learned a lot of programming
because that's why you enjoy in computer
science but your college is not going to
teach you a lot of programming keep on
subscribing to the channel you learned a
lot ok so IT engineer sir you remember
me I remember a lot of tons of your
email so as she says I'm from Nepal hey
that's good
nice nice
I do have a lot of friends from opal
during my NGA rabii that time they're
nice
boom biker hit like yeah Mumbai people
that cared awesome mo many people are
actually very dedicated towards the work
they are just focus on work work work
and work and probably this is the reason
why I appreciate a lot of Mumbai
it's not like I'm favoring the Mumbai's
or Delhi's or Calcutta it's it's not
like that it's like I have met a lot of
people who were happened to be from
Mumbai and were really dedicated
learners probably I'm wrong probably I'm
wrong but this is what my experiences
okay so keep on hitting the like button
I cannot see people hit the like button
okay do hit the like button I want to
see that graph going up so like that
so OC AGP helping okay what is OC AGP
I'm not good in a shot gets is it Oracle
or offensive security I'm not good in
that it's bad waste good platform it's
awesome platform there's other one as
well powers but I prefer firebase hello
sir Mumbai Mary Jean okay so okay okay a
lot of thumbs ups are coming up can you
speak anything in the I can speak fluent
Hindi absolutely awesome but if I was
just speaking the Hindi probably people
from South and other states and other
countries will not understand me so
what's the point if people don't
understand me
because for me I don't care if it's a
thumb in Hindi English all I care about
is a lot of people are understanding me
and I'm understanding them that's it
that's the language is for okay a b c a
b c s okay a lot of question just went
like that okay so we have spend almost
almost an hour okay
so a lot of questions are coming up and
just going on keep on rolling like that
okay so we have spent almost one hour

questions but I know I have missed a lot
of them because they were just going on

interacting with all of you guys keep
learning
wherever you are learning by the way I
do have a website learn code online dot
and you can check that out support this
channel and do hit it thumbs up do hit
