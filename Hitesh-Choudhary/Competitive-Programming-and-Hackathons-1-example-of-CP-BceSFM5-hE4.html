with another video and in this video I
want to again talk about competitive
programming so in my previous video when
I talked about competitive programming
and encourage to you about first of all
learning a subject and then learning the
data structure then only you can
participate in that a lot of people just
assume that I'm talking about hackathon
and yes I might have miscommunicated a
little bit about the hackathons and the
difference between competitive
programming and hackathon so this is a
take two on competitive programming so
that I can take an example and then can
put my point whatever I wanted to say in
this video so in this video I will be
presenting a simple very simple example
that is usually done in competitive
programming and also I would like to
talk about the difference between the
competitive programming and a hackathon
and how these two are almost together
and how you can understand all of that
so this is take two on competitive
programming with example
first and foremost I might have missed
communicated in the previous video I do
accept it after watching it again I
realized that yeah it was little bit
confusing that what I wanted to say I
Sayed it but didn't made a difference on
competitive and hackathon so here is
your video okay now first and foremost
as always I wanted to do I wanted to put
in sample example so that you can
understand what kind of questions are
there in competitive programming now
after that I'm gonna discuss that what's
the goal or the essence of competitive
programming the difference between
competitive programming a hackathon as
well as some of the other names that you
will usually see like code terms and
things like that so first and foremost
promise me one thing you will not get
depressed by seeing this problem this is
like the most one of the easiest
problems that you will see in every
competitive programming competition or
maybe on the tons of website but some
people I have seen in the past get
really really depressed by seeing this
and assuming hey I I don't know
programming even after making a couple
of projects they see this and they say
oh my goodness I I have absolutely no
idea what they are trying to say in this
problem so I'm really a bad programmer
no you are not since you haven't
prepared for this kind of problems that
is why this is looking alien to you so
promise me you will not get depressed by
saying this problem so watch this first
okay so I hope you have paused the video
there and have tried to read the problem
set now this is well on the common
problem and is the problem that was
presented to filter out the crowd in the
recent hackathon where I went out okay
so let's come back and talk about what
is completed programming and what is
hackathon what is Kota now all these
different names are a way to make
programming s sports now it is something
like you are saying hey that is a code
no that is a program now again fighting
between these two things yes they might
be a little bit different according to
the definitions but fighting again is
this a code or is this a program on a
simple function is not at all a good
thing so first and foremost these all
things are made so that programming can
become fun okay that's one thing clear
out now moving on to the difference
between computer programming hackathons
and code terms are probably hundreds of
other names let's go there
now the computer programming is actually
the essential step in usually the
hackathons because some of the good
hackathons that are being launched by a
variety of big companies they are not
just everybody can show up and can do
their codings and whatever the problem
is going to be fetched to them the first
round or the first hurdle of most of the
hackathon is competitive programming so
that's why I consider them personally as
just one set if you are preparing for a
hackathon computer programming is the
first step then the second step might be
defining the problems in a simpler way
and the third step is actually building
to it so what I have been to the
hackathons these hackathons include all
three parts that's why I consider them
as equally but some of the recent web
sites are like hacker rank and all these
host competition where they do have
certain test cases where you can have a
problem set like this which is seen
which you have seen just a moment ago
and you can write various programs for
them now again if you are thinking that
hey this is the easy peasy program and I
can just write a simple solution for
that then yes it's okay that means you
have a full understanding of programming
and projects as well as data structure
and algorithm and you are able to
understand that that's that can happen
but usually that's a rare case again
computer programming coders are
hackathon these are all
to make fun and if somebody is playing
them just for fun obviously he's there
to show off his skill it is totally okay
for the big nurse to feel like hey I
don't know anything about them but
eventually when you play a lot of these
kinds of challenges it becomes like
normal stuff they always tried to do
like it's a simple it could have been a
simple question but they try to just
somehow integrate that into real-life
situation and make their much more
complex so that's the most essence of
competitive programming so again my
point in the previous video was you
always have to step solution whether you
want to prepare for these certain kind
of I called and levels one hackathon or
level one or completely programming her
level one hackathon is first of all you
need to have understanding of the
subject it can be C++ it can be Android
Java Python whatever that is second is
if you have built some of the real-life
projects they always always do help and
the third thing is your data structure
and algorithm so I keep this one as one
part one part two and the data structure
as a separate because it deserves its
own big spot so this is what I wanted to
say in the previous video and I hope now
with this video it is much more clear
for you again just to quickly summarize
it you can consider competitive
programming hackathon and code terms as
a separate event and some in most of the
big events these are like the levels of
a hackathon to reduce down the amount of
crowd that is coming to them usually it
happens in first of all are there said
like this kind of examples are there
first of all you have to define a
problem now that's is the most office
part and where most of the crowd get
filtered out and then you have to write
a solution for that and based on how
optimized and how many test cases it can
pass on you get selected to the next
round and finally in the third round you
are presented with a comparatively
simpler problem and then you have to
write an exact code or an application
for that so that's how usually hackathon
goes on I can understand the hackathons
that you might have attended might be in
just a university and not be that much
of the big scale so I highly recommend
you to move on to these hackathons like
hosted by the Google or Facebook you'll
see that when everybody takes part they
just put a certain this kind of a
challenge
on to their website and say hey
everybody who can understand this and
can submit the optimized solution will
get an access to the ground too so where
is this round 2 coming up from from
these kinds of problems ok so again let
me be very clear if you're not able to
understand this problem it's totally
fine it's totally ok don't get depressed
if you're not able to understand it if
you are able to understand it
congratulation you can move into
competitive programming for a few while
but I'm gonna still say don't get
involved in too much of the competitive
programming once you have understood few
things of it then obviously move into
the real world building application that
are gonna serve you a lot better
compared to just keep on stacking around
with the competitive programming so
that's it again if you haven't watched
the previous video go ahead watch that
and in case you have enjoyed this video
give it a thumbs up share it with among
your friends so that they can also get
some of the upgrade in their existing
knowledge that's it for this video hit
that subscribe button we are geeks here
we talk all day long about programming
tech design all stuff like that and I
hope you haven't forgot to hit that
subscribe button if you haven't done it
come on guys go ahead hit that subscribe
button and I'll surely get you up in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
