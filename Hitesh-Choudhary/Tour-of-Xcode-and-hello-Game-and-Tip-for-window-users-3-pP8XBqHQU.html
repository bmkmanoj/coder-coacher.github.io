this is gonna be a series on game
development and we're gonna design a
pretty cool game so everybody is excited
and that is a good news so let's get
started and I received a lot of
questions about what about the Windows
users how we are gonna follow this
series so let me clear up a lot of
things the one thing that you require
for this development is Xcode now Xcode
is totally free but only for for the Mac
users and in case you are looking for
any additional Xcode or latest one
usually you find it on the developers
Apple comm a very familiar site for all
the developers so it's available on the
X on the App Store and I have already
got the latest version of the Xcode and
let me assure you it's Xcode 2.1 which
is the latest build of the xcode so this
is the first screen that you'll be
seeing for the xcode and you won't be
seeing the right part because these are
some of the apps that i have already
built up but no we are not going to be
building up app so let's go there now a
lot of people ask me the question that
hey what about if we are not on a mac
now if you're not on a mac first of all
you are going to face a few problems but
let's clarify that on the very first go
so a lot of people say that yes our
entire OS can be used as a virtual
machine and VirtualBox and entire OS x
can be installed on a windows using
virtualization now i don't disagree with
that yes it's completely possible you
may find hundreds and hundreds of
tutorial doing hack intuition stuff but
do I really recommend that option for
development of the Xcode or game in the
sprite kit no at least not personally
that's my personal preferences because
eventually with the time you'll face a
lot of problems like generating
certificates and in terms of others like
that and I believe that somebody is
learning game development or app
development on Xcode a8 or iOS then he's
pretty much serious about getting
started with app development so
definitely he wants to launch the app in
the App Store
I won't deny that it's not possible with
the hackintosh but it's pretty tough and
I would say it's a wastage of your time
so in fact I do recommend if you are
very serious about it go ahead buy a Mac
Mini and it's almost with the cost of a
compute or
top general laptop it's much more
cheaper than the Mac Mac bouquet or
MacBook Pro or just like that and you
can do full stuff full-fledged stuff on
that but again if you just want to give
it a try there is a great option a Mac
in cloud and at the very first time when
I was not pretty much serious and I was
looking to get started in iOS
development
I used this site and in fact one of my
close friend used it still now they have
got a pretty affordable option one
dollar per hour and let's just say you
spend two hours a day two dollars for a
day for using Xcode and all the Mac
application then I think this is this is
pretty good option for you and later on
if you realize that hey I'm much more
serious and I want to go with that I
definitely would say go ahead buy a Mac
Mini or maybe a Mac machine you can also
buy some used Mac as well there is no
problem in that but make sure that it
runs to the Xcode 8 so it should be the
latest updated one ok so right now I do
recommend highly to go for the Mac in
cloud as if you are on the windows who
said they they're pretty solid and they
give you they don't give you the root
access but again you don't need that you
just need an Xcode and that's it so they
have pretty good and if you look at the
features they do pretty good features
SDK for the Xcode and pretty much all
the developers use them and I love them
so this is all about for the Windows
users but again I didn't dedicated this
cities for the Windows users it would be
a little bit Mac oriented Windows users
all come up for you with another series
later on maybe so let's get started with
the Xcode and in this video we will have
a quick tour of the Xcode so this is the
very first screen that you'll be seeing
on the Xcode and I hope that many of you
might be familiar with that in case not
let's have a quick Xcode too so I'm
going to do Xcode project and there we
go you can see we got a lot of project
here we can build single view
application which is majorly oriented
for the app development but we can go
for the master detail your Gmail look
like application or page base tab based
sticker pack which is pretty much fun
and easy but right now we're gonna focus
on the game so let's just click on the
next so we want to design a game and of
course the game technology is gonna be
sprite here there are others as well
like metal OpenGL but now we are gonna
go for the sprite hit in this case and
it's gonna be a simple iPhone rest of
stuff really are same so what I'll be
doing I'll be creating any folder on my
desktop and I'll be calling it as simply
hips let me just hit enter there and
I'll call this as game dev and I'll be
keeping everything here so let's call
this as simply game test and let's go
with that game test looks nice
and I think everything is pretty solid
make sure it's a swift otherwise it's no
use for us and we don't need any unit
tests or anything I like to keep my
desktop clean so game dev and I'm gonna
be saving that I won't be creating any
git repositories now but in case you are
familiar with my other series and
bootcamp sourcetree is what I recommend
for uploading things on the github or
bitbucket or whatever you are using but
you should definitely use some of them
and create and there we go
so this is our very first I would be
changing this to let just say iPhone 7
and now it's doing signing is not gonna
be good for me I haven't signed my phone
yet and I think that's good now let's
just go on a few files here so we can
see a lot of files are there and some of
them might be a little bit different
than what you might be used to so first
of all this guy the hello world is is
pretty big actually we have God's got
some actions which is empty games in
Swift and we'll be talking about what
each this file is what are these so many
functions here but again believe me it's
it's much more easier than it what it
looks like here we go our main
storyboard and we won't be doing much
things here but again we will be talking
about so right now let me give you a
quick tour of the Xcode so most of you
might be aware of the panels here these
are just to close and open these guys
here and I like them and make sure you
have them as well and this bottom menu
actually changes quite a lot based on
what you have selected here like for
example if I go in the scene kit it just
changes with the sprites lights label
camera and all the games related stuff
but on the main storyboard it changes a
little bit like view controller table
view controller buttons text just like
that
and we'll be working most of the time in
the game SKS or the game scene and apart
from that here we got a few options as
well and these options again do change
make sure that you have a quick look on
them in case you are running this for
the very first time so right now I have
got iPhone 7s selected and I'll run the
simulator in case you are not aware what
the simulator is it's a virtual iPhone 7
and all your game and everything will be
tested on that now my machine is a
little bit faster it's having a load of
gigabytes of RAM that's why it's loading
quite quickly in your case it might be a
little bit slower so you need to have a
little bit patience ok so this is what
we have got we can change the labels
here hello world and everything and we
will be doing that quite a lot and most
of the time we don't want to change it
from here you want to change it from
this panel and hello label and hello
world and everything should be changed
from here mostly so we'll be working on
that right now our simulator is loading
it's not that much fast as I was
expecting but yes this is the first time
it's loading up from the next of the
videos I will be keep loading that up in
that pants so there we go
and why it's taking so much at the time
there we go our game is getting started
for the very first time now it will be
just loading up and everything so there
we go our nice hello world and if I
click on that you can see it changes and
this is the very first game you have
design without even writing a single
line of code and you can see at the
bottom there are some nodes there are
some fps going on and notice it changes
quite a lot so this is all what we will
be studying here and this is pretty easy
pretty much fun and this is a fun game
to play around for the very first time
you can click it again and again and can
see that how this pops up and will be
seeing all these effects this is so nice
if you are watching it for the very
first time then I'm pretty sure you're
gonna play it for some time
and by the way command and your arrow
key is responsible for tilting it down
on to the landscape mode and you can get
back there ok let's just stop that and I
would say that was a pretty much good
start within no time they were able
to print out the hello world and I know
we haven't touched check code or we
haven't understood anything yet but hey
that's a good start you have lost your
very first screen you have created a
project I would say that's a good start
and I'll catch you up in the next video
where we'll be talking a little bit more
about in depth and actually what's
happening at the back end so I'll catch
you up in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
