training so we have seen quite a lot
about the containers and it's probably a
good time to move further now what we
are going to learn further from this
video onwards are the CSS properties
officially in the Flex box that we can
apply to the item which are inside the
Flex box so it's always easier to just
start doing it or other than explaining
so I'm going to copy this starting
folder here and going to paste that and
let's just call this as I'm going to
lower the volume a little bit and I'm
going to call this a zero five and there
we go let's open that up and I would
like to fire my atom again
and this time what we're going to do is
let's study about the properties which
can be applied to the item itself rather
than the container but again in order to
apply that properties it is very
essential that you first of all declare
your entire container as Flex so let me
open up add project folder and this time
it's going to be 0 5 open that up and
there we go good to go okay so obviously
the first thing that we need is to have
a lot of items so what I'm going to do
is command shift D to duplicate that for
2 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; 6 maybe just like that
okay let's fire up our server and this
should be good so let's bring this guy
up okay no big deal so far it looks so
amazingly good okay now first thing that
we're going to do is look up for the
container so just like always it's
really easy container and that is going
to first thing that is going to have a
display off flex okay now this is okay
and this is completely okay for us right
now and we do have a display flex here
now we're going to keep this just as
simple as it is for it but for sure we
can add properties like justify content
and align items and all these things and
that is okay you know that about you
know about them pretty pretty good here
now let's try to give it a border so
that we can understand what
is happening there and let's try that so
we're going to put a border and that is
going to be to pixel solid black and
let's also shorten the width a little
bit for example let's just say 700
pixels just like that and should make no
difference okay
now the property that we are going to
learn in this video is going to be the
order property so we have seen that
using the container we can align them
from left to right or maybe totally from
right to left or can push this entire
set just on to the right just like that
now what I want to do later on let's
just say these are my products here and
the client asked me that hey this is my
third number product should be the
number one product and not like that now
in just to do this kind of small thing
you don't need to actually get a whole
CSS or to change the images or whatever
you want to do it it's not like that you
can just define that really easily with
the help of flexbox so let's just say we
are targeting the number three now there
are a couple of ways to handle this for
example I'm going to just say number
three is going to be having a class here
so oops command Z what I meant typing
here so class and there we go so it is
going to have a class of one you can
name it anything and just naming it
class because it's easier to pick that
limit with the help of class but I'm
going to show you how you can pick them
without this specific class as well in a
minute okay now let us say this is my
class of one and there we go now what I
can say is I'm going to say order and I
can only mention this property order
because I have mentioned that display as
flex as the top now first of all I'm
going to say order zero now what is
going to happen is nothing because by
default the order of everything is just
zero so if you want that this guy should
appear at the end
so obviously the zero guys will have the
first preference and the property which
is having the preference of order one is
going to come up at the last so the
third element comes at the last but
again feel free to give it even the
negative values because zero is the
default so you can give a negative value
and bring this guy at the very first
okay so pretty simple task to align and
by this way you can align anything so
let's just say in your image or in your
HTML page you have defined navigation
bar menu controls divisions and let's
just say the client says hey I don't
like this division to be at the top I
want this to be bottom you say okay and
you define a container to the flags and
select that particular division and just
move it to that particular order maybe
it's a minus one one two and not only
that you can define specific order to
each and every guy and they are going to
follow this for example let's define a
class here as well so let's just say
this is going to be a class of two so
now I want that this guy should be the
first this guy should be the second
regardless of wherever they are defined
in my page so let's select another class
here so this is going to be my two and
there we go now again we do have an
order here now this is something that
you have to do as a planning so if I
just say order minus 1 to 0 this is not
going to make a difference here because
this is not how the things works you
have to be planned a little bit so you
can mention that hey this is going to be
a order of -2 this is going to be order
of minus 1 and now you can see that the
3 &amp;amp; 4 are just placed like that okay so
this is my 1 and this is my - okay I
hope you get the idea of how the things
are done in the order and you can
specify all the order properties to
anyone that you like now also there are
a couple of ways if you are good in
little bit in the CSS you can obviously
you don't have to do these kinds of
things you can select the properties
quite easily and let me show you what
what I mean by that let's just say I
want to just select this sixth guy and
want to make it a display flex of let's
just say - a - 6 or something like that
because we can see that our 1 which is
actually if you notice is 3 so 3 is the
first guy okay I hope you get that so
this is this is 3 now I want to make it
a minus 3 there to the sixth guy how I
can do that it's really simple you don't
need to define classes and classes
again again you can simply say hey
there's a container there this is the
container and inside that you can find a
division okay so there is a division
division here and in the division you
can mention the NH I'll if you wish so I
hope it will help me there we go and a
child and I can say I'm looking for a
child which is at number 6 position and
there we go now you can mention the
order property here so oops not like
that order property and I'm going to say
minus 3 and there we go I can actually
close them up it's actually good
practice so here we go and we can see we
have picked it up and this guy is now at
the front so the more negative number
the more it's going to be at the first
on the page so I hope you clear that up
and that is pretty good ok now let me
summarize quickly what we have done
first and foremost part important one is
your outer container should be displayed
as flex to apply all of these properties
and you can select an individual item
can assign it a negative number or a
positive number or however you want to
order these all of the guides the
default order is zero but you can
override that at any time you can
mention specific classes to pick up that
item or you can use your CSS skills to
pick that item up ok so pretty easy and
pretty fun to learn all of this and then
we'll be making some projects or many
bars or navigation bar you will realize
that when we will be changing the things
that home button from front to back or
just like that it becomes super helpful
and super easy so stay tuned we are
going to do a lot of projects on that as
well and I'll surely catch you up in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
