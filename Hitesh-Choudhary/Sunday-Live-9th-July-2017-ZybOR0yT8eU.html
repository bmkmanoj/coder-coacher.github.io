to Sunday live and I'm just waiting for
people to show up I hope the
notification is going for this life too
everybody is mobile and let's just wait
for a few people to come up if you have
come up to join up this live session
here you can simply hit the like button
there and can notify me that yes you
have joined up there so do hit that like
button and we will wait here to go with
this live session and before we go ahead
and wait for the people in question to
show up there let me say that yes I am
late for this live session it is almost
read ish o'clock or 7 o'clock right now
we usually do this kind of Sunday live
at in the afternoon but today I was late
it was it was a hectic Sunday so much of
the work so much of the outside run so
it was really a busy day and I
approached ill apologize for that that
yes I am little late but yes finally I'm
here it's always good to host these
Sunday lives and just keep that belly
icon on that subscribe box notified so
that whenever I come up live you can go
here okay so let's start this Sunday
life and for those people who have
joined up for the first time Sunday life
is actually a way of asking the
questions directly to me regardless of
the topic you can ask questions about
Android your problems if you're facing
an East elation problem or you just want
to ask a little bit advice for what you
should do what programming language you
should be looking up everything related
to whatever there is you're in your mind
so you can ask all of that question as
simple as it sound so let's pick up some
questions and they say if our cheeto
says happy teachers day in India thank
you so much and git repository videos
please yes I have already made a video
on github 101 so search on my channel
sandhya search on my channel for github
101 but surely good videos can be done
right now they are not in the plan or
to-do list but shortly they can be done
very soon and let's ask when is
freelancing video coming and first of
all let me correct you yes there
freelancing is not going to be just one
video it's going to be an entire series
so that I can I can actually give you a
lot more about freelancing how you can
enhance your skills freelancing 101 how
to manage your clients how to approach
the clients how to prepare your
portfolios and all those stuff but let
me tell you freelancing can be of
various types including from t-shirt
selling to selling your coat business
and you're selling your websites and all
these things so we would be talking most
of the time about the programming but
yes that can be done ok so vast hunting
I don't know what that is how can I
start you I UX designer so I am creating
but I don't like coding hey I use it's
okay if you don't like coding as well
it's not like it's the end of the world
coding is just a part of the big game
that is the internet if you are
interested in the UI and UX designer
I would request you to just go for the
Pinterest first of all and try to master
the software like sketch or plasmic
these are some of the software which are
used for UX and UI designer but let's
not forget the big giant here which is
Photoshop I would recommend you to go to
the Pinterest website and search out for
the great mobile app designer website
designs and try to replicate them in the
Photoshop or sketch if you are not good
in Photoshop or sketch or glass make
there are lots of online websites that
can teach you but just for your
knowledge these kinds of things I use
are not something that you can learn
offline from a nearby Institute if you
want to become really good UI and UX
designer you have to move online there
is no more the alternator
I don't have any course for that but
still I would say go ahead
online there will be no teacher nearby
who can I give you an awesome course in
UX and UI design so go ahead and look
out on there are various websites there
are you dasa te udemy and edx and tons
of others first thing is just master one
tool that can be photoshop if you go
with the sketch in envision that is a
remarkable pair but you can also go for
blasts make as well okay I hope that
answers your questions in detail I use
and that was a really productive
question thank you so much for asking
that okay who earns more web developer
or app developer actually nobody earns
more the company who is hiring the app
developer and web developer are gonna be
earning more that's a bizarre question
that's that's not a good question it's
all about money oriented it's not about
who is making more money a ten year
experience a guy in the web development
is going to earn more compared to a two
year experienced guy in Android and it
just depends on project a small scale
project on the mobile earns little so
it's a it's a relative term it's not
about who is going to earn more when the
guy sells juices or when he sells maybe
something else like milk it's not a good
question
okay soon there will be no need of
programmer waiting for the day waiting
for that day when I'll get out of the
job so why do you think that there will
be no need of programmers anytime don't
you see that everything around you
around yourself is getting programmed
including cars like Tesla including your
mobile phones on which you are watching
this video your house is getting
programed every day so then you can turn
on your AC from outside all these things
are getting programmed so yes
programming domain is changing it is
always changing it used to run on
Fortran and now it's running on Swift
and Java so yes it's changing definitely
is it going out of the market yeah I
don't think so okay let's take another
question there sorry I'm not speaking
out now names out loud but yeah that's
okay I hope you can manage that okay
I know Basics in Python can I buy
Raspberry Pi and fry embedded
why not why not until unless you're
gonna try how would you know and how
would I know let me know how that how
did that vent and do notify me what
experiments are you doing with the
Raspberry Pi it's really achieve device
of what it's everything is relative so
it's worth it to buy it so go ahead and
get started
okay Vinod has a very big question so
let's answer that hi sir I have a
question for you I want to start a
machine learning career is it really
requires a PhD degree to get into
companies for the machine learning data
scientist role no not at all because one
of my friend used to work for IMDB and
they used to work quite a lot on machine
learning and all these things and he was
kind of a data scientist there and he
was just bachelors but he didn't
required any kind of post graduation or
something if you want to get started
machine learning there are basically now
there are two enjoyable paths there the
first one everybody knows that you have
to learn Python and apply all those
neurologic sand all those algorithm that
I did studied in my Master's setting up
neurologic straining the data and all
sorts of stuff but nowadays very soon
I'm also gonna be releasing some videos
on Swift now you can apply all that
machine learning using Swift as well and
we're working right now on some awesome
apps that uses the machine learning so
yes that's gonna come up don't think
that I'm gonna leave the machine
learning topic just like that I'm gonna
be taking that up so yes machine
learning will come up on the YouTube and
you will be amazed to see how easy it is
to work on machine learning in the
Python machine learning kit ml kit if
you are aware of the WDC they have
launched two new kit packs one for
augmented reality one for machine
learning and they are remarkably
remarkably simple okay so I hope that
answers your question and please do hit
the like button this is the counter that
I can see there quite easily so don't
hit the like but
it just notifies me that yes you are
enjoying this session the session is
fruitful for everybody and I should host
these more okay sir Android course how
to learn as I begin with syntax and move
to bootcamp I'm not very much clear what
you want to ask yes pal there if you can
write your questions again I'll try to
do that again
Shivani says hi hi there Shivani how are
you tell my name on screen
tell me hi hey yourself hi Bill how are
you I hope that is good for you
more Anna Street tutorials please no no
no not dentistry again in case you don't
know I released out few Anna's three
videos just for fun they were not
professionally designed or something
just for my juniors in the college I
think I was in masters or maybe first
semester of the doctorate I didn't hit
that out rate I didn't I don't see that
out now but I did release that for my
juniors it went viral it went viral I
got approached by a lot of foreign
universities that hey we want any three
classes and all of that
no I don't know what to get started with
hence this is something that I know but
I don't want to get stuck there I also
did receive a job from Amazon in the
States but I'm not interested in to cook
in an is-3 right now
there are far more fun thing for me
apart from industry okay from where to
learn Android development there are tons
of resources to learn it Android
development Vikram I do also have a
course on that it's really awesome
course very much in the budget so go
ahead check out learn code online dot in
but again feel free to look around for
other courses another option as well
this is one that I suggest but again no
problem at all if you look out around
for other courses as well as long as you
just learn it and just make me aware
that you have created some out that's it
okay after Android Java what should i up
for PHP or Python depends on where you
want to go maybe in data science or
other
in there python would be good for the
web development PHP would be amazing
awesome difference between BC and BCS no
I don't talk about the university
programs and the college programs like a
BTech mtech BC a b cs whatever they are
I don't talk about them because these
are some carrier oriented and Kenya
guidance things I don't do that I don't
want to get a blame for hey you told us
to take a beat agate now it sucks hey
you told us to take a BCA and now it
sucks so I don't do that ok let's go
ahead and continue daily text ask PC or
a Mac ok now is the time you can say hey
you are a Mac oriented guy you always
say that mark is awesome and I'm gonna
say it again because I have been working
on Windows for for a long time in fact
for my better part of my life
for a huge part of my life I have been a
Windows user and when I moved and
switched on to Mac what the performance
I see what the productivity increase in
myself that I've seen when I don't have
to worry about the software crashes
don't have to worry about hey which
software to buy which to pilot and all
those crappy stuff and a lot of worries
about will I be playing the games or not
so I have seen an increase in
productivity in myself so I would say
that yes I do love Mac and i would
suggest Mac for you as well ok please
tell me can I be programmer with
commerce why not
programming is a completely different
domain and anybody and everybody can
learn it so yes you can be a programmer
mohit how occupation answers say is hi
Nasser how are you hi sir where should I
start
my learning on scripting language any
website for all my learning hey Balaji
Saravanan sorry if I butchered your name
I really do apologize for that but you
can start with the scripting language I
would suggest Python is really the one
scripting language which everybody
should get started
easy to learn easy to implement and far
more fun so you can go ahead and look
out at learned code online dot in to get
started with Python I do have a
reasonably priced course there and
think you will love it okay I might miss
Sunday outing but not your session it
h-hey Veeru thank you so much this is
something that I would say this is this
is a glad moment that you value my
session so much I always take I try to
make some time I talk my busy day and
every Sunday it's really tough for me to
be so much consistent on every Sunday I
usually try to post the time on my
Facebook page but I apologize this time
I didn't got time and yes the Sunday
lives are gonna be hosted every single
time okay if I can make somebody's life
a little bit better by these Sunday life
Sunday lives and why would I not do that
okay let's take on more questions I am
trying to take every questions now in
much more detail okay hello hello Robin
Ali how are you you looks like a Salman
fan hey there okay drew hello sir I
wanna be a game engineer when I go for
that or I opt for cyber security now
they are completely different domain and
you should first decide whether you want
to be a game developer or cyber security
this is going to be a personal choice
both of them are fantastic carrier
options and if you'll choose any of them
they are gonna serve you amazingly for
the cyber security you have to go into
completely different learning curve and
for the game engineer game developer you
have to look on for unity your game
engines or all these things so first of
all you decide yourself which one do you
like the most and if I'll say you have
to work on it
365 days on one domain which is going to
be it cyber security or game development
which one do you like the most so judge
it by yourself first of all okay I'm
confused between Java and Android I've
done MS CCS I learn Java should either
an Android - why not if you have learned
the job already it's actually a perfect
time to imply
that Java because what you are doing
with learning the Java right now
probably nothing or just making some
websites right now is a good time to
learn Android by the way I do have an
awesome Android course Amit you can
check that out if you wish you can learn
anywhere else as well but I would say
yes go ahead learn that okay how to
prepare a resume a fresher Android
developer I think but I will answer your
questions in a separate video so do
check out my channel because that is
something which is already in the to-do
list of the videos so I will I will show
up how you can prepare for a resume a
for an Android developer and that's
surely gonna come up okay where can
learn good Java online I do have a
website so Mia if you do remember a
learn code online dot in you remember
that okay
so let's ask a few more questions
somebody says hi hey other hi to you as
well
what language I need to we have two that
went up what language I need to make a
music app if you are looking to launch
your music app on website I think
react.js would be awesome but in fact in
if you are looking it to launch up on
Android Java or Kotlin would be awesome
if you are looking to launch app it on
App Store
obviously Swift is going to be a choice
which web development we start front-end
or back-end I think you're looking up
which one want you to start first I
would say if you are a beginner go ahead
start with a front-end development first
not the backend okay that's our best
choice what should i do to get a job in
mobile sector
I like coding I have learned Java and
Android what should be my next step your
next step should be creating complex app
app that uses databases especially the
firebases or parse or back-end less
services and like that authentication
system once you have that make sure that
app reaches to the Google Play Store and
that is going to be a good starting
point okay make videos on general IT
trends like Hadoop etc hey to shower I
usually like to make videos on the
domain horn which
really good not on any domain that is
out in the market there are hundreds of
domain out in the market on which I'm
not so amazing not so good I might have
tried them here and they're here in vial
but I'm not so amazingly awesome in that
so that's why I don't do videos in that
because I might have a little bit
knowledge about it but I haven't done
any project I haven't done anything big
in that so that's why I usually avoid
that topic okay I entrusted cyber
security sir how I improved my knowledge
I completed MSC IT that's a good you
have completed your masters
congratulation for that but the domain
that you are the knowledge that you look
out in the universities and college is
completely different what is being
served and required at the corporate
sector here in the IT world so go ahead
look out create an account on bugcrowd
or hacker art I try to read out the the
vulnerabilities that has been found out
by other guys they are really amazing
blocks and amazing details there so go
ahead check that out first of all and
try to find out these such wonder
abilities another website that's one way
of getting improved in cyber security I
hope this answers to your question
Prabhu your name is just similar to our
rain the minister there and he is doing
an amazing job I hope you will too say
okay hello hello Chetan dear and let's
ask a few question is there any future
of data analysts in India why not it's a
new domain it's getting just started
it's gonna just explode in a few years
so yes data analyst is a good thing but
you should be really good in all of the
things like SQL your excel sheet and a
lot of algorithms as well because theta
and Isis is something which is relied on
a lot of data algorithms okay JPD
dot-com says are you Indian did you had
any doubt yes I am purely born and
raised in India now okay and recently I
got travel I got a chance to travel a so
much abroad and I'm really happy for
that I do have some other plans as well
purely purely Indian don't you see my
skintone there it just looks like that
okay so what are the opportunities ahead
glad you asked that we do have a laugh
lot of opportunities coming up at
YouTube channel as well as at learned
code online we recently hosted a
competition for project based where we
asked people to write blog for us one of
them has already got selected one girl
is still there who is shortlisted and we
are about to send email to her she is
writing amazing there is also one more
guy who might get a chance to work for
us but it's in a little bit confusion
let's see if he can work according to
our standards or not but the future
competitions are also going to come up
these competition will be of prize money
of worth rupees 10,000 and maybe more so
these competitions will be available for
everybody on YouTube on learn code
online wherever you are doing you will
be assigned a task you will be given a
few days to complete that task related
to web development and if you complete
that you will get full credit for
creating that project as well as you
will get a money for 10,000 rupees as
well as you will get a work experience
letter from the company so a lot of
opportunities are coming up these are
just planned there are few competitions
for Android as well that are going to
come up in which you will be supplied
some api's we are working on it and with
that API whoever is going to create the
most beautiful app is going to win the
prize money things are not being done
for the Android yet so how much prize
money what are going to be API what we
have to create all these questions will
be answered later on but yes the prize
money is going to be really really high
so that helps a student to motivate that
and if you like the concept of hosting
these kinds of competitions for
everybody on YouTube give it a thumbs up
so that I can see that yes the bar is
raising and I know some of you have
already clicked that but I hope I can
see the numbers raising up there if you
liked this competition thing
yes I can see so it's rising a poem that
tries quite nicely okay keep hitting
that if you like that and yes you heard
that right it's gonna be almost 200
dollars in USD it's gonna be ten
thousand rupees in India so hope you
like the competition cheers for the
competition okay you can write down in
the comment section as well that you
like the part of the competition okay so
write down in the comment section that
competition is good okay
so let's ask okay there are a lot of
thumbs up and I do really say hi thank
you so much for all of these thumbs up
for the competition details will be
given to everybody on YouTube channel so
make sure you do it the subscribe button
and by the way in case you are thinking
how the money and everything will be got
going on to you it will be given in the
cheque format so hard cash there we go
and you will be given some amount of
time and the announcement will be done
publicly so that all of you can see the
project okay so any free servers in the
market if I are you looking for the free
stuff free stuff is bad most of the time
especially in the servers so don't look
out for the free servers in the market
they are bad instead just pay like 800
or thousand rupees and just borrow a
server for at least five hosting for I
would say a year that's actually
reasonably priced sir did you ever used
see shop I've never seen any see shop on
YouTube on your tutorial sir are there
any disadvantage of using sea sharpens a
marine than Java in Google hey Jay Kevin
I have used c-sharp I would say that
it's an amazing language and I used it
unique during one of my unity course
which we were building up and we sold
the exclusive right to one of the
university so yes I have used c-sharp
it's amazing haven't used that in the
xamarin there but I think I prefer Java
over the xamarin
and you might have heard me saying that
I don't like Java but over the see shop
I would prefer Java but again a c-sharp
is amazingly fast and unity so I would
say check out a unity as well for the C
shop ok bootstrap or foundation
bootstrap any day any day
just ask me what we were gonna choose
bootstrap or foundation I would go for
the bootstrap any given day ok ok so
happy to see you live I'm in last
semester of my master study in
telecommunication in Poland interested
in UX and UI but don't have proper guide
to learn and develop skills guide guide
me please hey sit but in congratulation
you're about to complete your masters
from Poland that's actually nice country
I really want to visit someday but if
you want to get started with the UI and
UX I would highly recommend to check out
the sketch along with the individual
sketchup is a tool by which you can
design UI UX go ahead make a search on
the Pinterest about the best UI and UX
designs try to copy them first a layout
exactly same on your sketch audio
envision and then you can take out some
courses at udemy they are some fantastic
course on UX so go ahead try that out I
don't have any course how to get
restaurants and homes API for iOS app
how to get restaurants in homes API I
think you are saying home kit but I
don't understand what you are saying
with the restaurant there is no
destroyed kit
ok so please make a video in Indian
language I don't know what the Indian
language is because we are in a diverse
country where we speak hundreds of
languages so I don't know which one of
them is Indian as long as I say
something you understand it that's what
the language is apart from that I don't
think language is something that is a
barrier if you know how to write this
comment which in English says please
make a video in Indian that means you
can understand me so
that's it that's it leave this topic
here okay
let's go and thank you thank you to you
as well J Kevin okay and let's house
okay there we go so I have a lot of
questions going on there so I learned no
GS what does it scope how many projects
have you created or have tried to create
okay there we go bad connection okay now
it's fixed now it's good connection back
what is scratch scratch is software ish
thing to learn programming for the kids
it's for the kid in sixth or seventh
standard not for you I hope you're not
in the sixth or seventh okay how
difficult is it to learn I us there
after Android I would say Kailash if you
know Android it should be a matter of
just seven days or eight days to learn
iOS and iOS is far more easier than
Android yeah that is true
Android faces Android actually users
face a lot of problems compared to iOS
it's far more easier and yes I know
people will just rant on me for that
that hey you don't like Java you don't
like Android but I have worked on a lot
of projects on Android projects that
generate a lot of revenue every month so
yes I have worked on Android on projects
that generate a lot of money but if ants
if you ask me as from a programmers
perspective I would say iOS is far more
better okay what is the future in
JavaScript
amazing amazing future location have
absolutely no idea how javascript is
becoming so much powerful in the backend
in the front-end in iOS in Android
pretty much everything so you have
absolutely no idea how powerful it is
becoming okay why company pay low salary
on your first job even if I have better
knowledge and industry experience from
life project hey Amit this is a very
very relative question industry
failure low because you might be having
a lot of experience but still you might
be having a lot of experience with the
live project but working in a company
environment and finishing on that those
projects which client just say hey do
this you might be knowing that this is
bad for client but still doing that is a
different kind of experience so that is
why you get low experience just in your
first job or low payment in your first
job but after that it just thinks
because you have worked a lot in the
experience so just switch your first
switch is going to give you a lot of lot
of money there how to find good paid
website to learn java please suggest
them some of them I'll suggest one of
them they're in code online dotter okay
how to correct indent in telnet I have
no idea politically for the telnet sir I
have learned JavaScript now what next if
you are good in front-end web
development I highly highly recommend
Vishal to go ahead check out my react.js
course on learn code online Totten
this is one of the finest course
available on the planet for react.js
people are really happy in that course
and have created some awesome projects
we are building 10 projects in that so
go check it out
shivaji third ask angular or react I'm a
react fan but that doesn't mean - hey
Toria angular angular is also awesome
but it's not backward that much
compatible so I prefer react and
specially the fact that react you don't
need to learn things like other
scripting language like typescript and
stuff for the angular you can just work
with the JavaScript in the react so
that's why I love it ok
view or react why react because I can
make an awesome Android or iOS app with
the react ok the questions are just
flooding I cannot see any one of them ok
they are just keep going keep going keep
going let's try and go back there a
little bit to answer a few of them Sarah
my I am expecting class on DevOps DevOps
is amazing awesome I will try my best to
take that in my too
and host a class for that okay but as
you might have some of the idea about
iOS 11 is on the way we already do have
an awesome amazing course on iOS 11 that
includes machine learning augmented
reality face detection and a lot of such
amazing things are gonna come up in the
iOS 11 course so that's going to come up
and scope of Java I am about to create
an awesome video about scope of every
single thing so you will be getting a
scope of Java scope or a JavaScript
scope of C's go before trap scooped up
everything so let's just make a video on
that okay so we are getting okay
don't just stop liking this video if you
have joined it just right now to host
that thumbs up we really need your
thumbs up okay
so yep that increasing thumbs up is
increasing I just love and I see a lot
of love a lot of likes there you can
actually send me a smiley of love if
you're enjoying this here so go ahead
send that so I can see you're active and
you are just doing that okay so what to
learn after Android I would say Ravi if
you are pretty much good in Android it's
probably time to move into iOS because
these are two dominant mobile world
somebody is honking I just hate those
idiots who honks quite a lot okay there
we go
so there we go love is coming thanks
Chum for that okay they are come on
don't honk that much okay
hey or yes augmented reality is plan to
come up in the next iOS course sir any
plan to publish your own programming
books
hey naman I have been approached by two
publishers recently they are they are
forcing me to write they're really
giving me good payment as well but I
prefer to make videos actually honestly
because I could write book when I am
little old and grumpy so I can write all
of my books
that time but still I'm young I'm
energetic I can record more videos and
can directly come live at the people
here so there is no such plan of writing
the books but if I'll take some
vacations maybe I'll sit on a beach of
some good awesome place or maybe just my
favorite city Paris or Switzerland I'll
take a take a month off we'll stay there
and write a book that might happen okay
but as of now there is no such plan okay
the big one with that the big one thumbs
up for it eh sir hey punkers thank you
so much for that
Rajiv says I have attended your workshop
on hack track at Kerala hey you are one
of the very I would say an amazing
awesome father so far and I would say
thank you so much because I think it's
almost two years or three years that I
have taken any offline workshop after
that I have taken a lot of boot camps
but now I moved completely online after
that so you are one of the lucky guys
who actually attended my eight our two
days workshop I hope you have enjoyed a
lot because still a lot of students just
love that okay and a lot of thumbs up I
love that should I learn nodejs what is
it used for
go ahead check out my node.js course
free videos there for you it will give
you idea what you can do with that okay
Baran Kumar asked said I want to be
Android developer so which language
should choose 4 please tell me sir you
are great thank you so much my rule you
need to learn Java for that but I will
suggest something better for you go
ahead check out learnt code online dot
in there is a course with just 800
rupees you will be making 10 awesome
Android apps as well as you will be
learning Java at that as well and I
don't think so any offline Institute
teaches you Java and Android in just 800
rupees that teaches you firebase login
system and make
and apps if you have such classes
offline available go ahead take that
okay so can I do projects with you hey
mitten if you have something I really
don't share my project workflows just
like that because I do work on sensitive
and big scale projects but if you have
something on which you want to hire me
or something I would really be happy and
even if you don't want to hire me if you
want to share some details and want to
my guidelines that is going to be
completely free so yes I'm always open
to look out for the new projects and
something amazing
so always open there sir you are best
Mallick thank you so much Malik the
booth and are you planning for where the
thatment
where did that went forgot that okay
there are the questions going on okay
could you suggest me a mobile lab that I
should develop using firebase and
Android as a major project I would say
get a clone of Twitter or maybe
Instagram that would be the amazing make
a clone of Instagram but instead of
photos let allow people to share their
audio that would be amazing I would
really like to check that out looking
very well yes I have been working out
two hours a day yep regular constantly
got rid of a lot of extra fat that I had
man things are looking good so yeah I'm
getting fit again after a lot of
struggle on and do take care everybody
do take care of your health it's really
really important so I would say apart
from programming and everything just
make sure that you take care of your
health
always okay so let's have a few more
questions okay how to crack competative
programming c'mon competative program
questions again up work or fiber upward
fiber you just get paid around $50 $200
at upward you get started from one $50
and if it's a speck up project and what
I mean by stuck a project stuck up
projects are those which has been
handled by some of the other developers
and now somebody wants to handle you to
handle them
these are stuck up projects and they
easily gives you two hundred to five
hundred dollars for just a couple of
days work
so yes up work any given day okay sir
when Android course starts Android
course is already there you can start it
whenever you wish it's in the video
format go ahead check out learn code
online dot m and here is the one good
question caught in all java there's a
lot of ways I would say get started with
Java because it's easier to move from
Java to Catalan I think if you are a
little bit decently good in Java you can
move into the Kotlin within a week yep
have a break have a drink break this
looks like a vodka doesn't it okay let's
take more questions okay so do you have
a node.js course yes I do have a
fantastic node.js course at learn code
online so you can check it out can you
please prepare tutorials for react
native that is in the next to the list
after is 11 that is going to come up a
react native in fact I do have like 20%
of the things being prepared already for
the react native some videos already
have been recorded but in the meantime
iOS 11 came up so I start that project
and jumped back into iOS 11 okay so you
drink alcohol I think it's a water-based
alcohol but if I'll be drinking alcohol
do you really think I would have been
talking in so much of the senses I would
have been just saying there's procedures
Esposito again and again if I would have
been drinking this much amount of
alcohol at least okay
so why you always fear the same t-shirt
there is a good and amazing story behind
that to me okay there we go
a question being there my friend is
calling me I'll just close that okay so
I would say that this is it you smoke
weed come on
