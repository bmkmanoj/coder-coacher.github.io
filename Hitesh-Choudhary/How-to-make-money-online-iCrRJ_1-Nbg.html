again with another video in this video
we will talk about how to make money
online and let's have the customary line
that you see in every video every blog
post hey by the end of this video or
reading this blog post you will make
$100,000
why just hundred thousand let's make it
a million dollar billion dollar a
trillion-dollar here's the proof my bank
account my credit card statement I made
so much of the money by sitting at the
beach drinking my beer and all that
money just flowed up because I knew an
awesome trick online these are all scams
everybody knows about that but still
they get a lot of hits and all these
videos really just see the number of
because at the bottom of the video or
try to see out how many hits that blog
post has taken by simply writing how to
make money online we will explore what
are the official ways of making money
online and what are those scams and how
you should actually be aware of these
kinds of scam roll that intro and let's
talk about it
now just toss that video this one and
try to search on the YouTube how to make
money online the few 10 or 20 videos
that you'll be seeing are having more
than millions and millions of views or
just look out onto the Google for the
blog post there are thousand billions
gazillions of posts saying that hey I
can teach you how to make money online
and we all know these are scams so what
are the actual ways of making money
online now if you want to make money
online there is no secret or magic
ingredient magic sauce that you'll just
press a button and there we go job done
no there are two basic requirement to
make money online
the first one is skills second is hard
work
yep it is not like that money will grow
on the trees and you can make money
online with just a click or just a press
of button or by just doing some random
surveys no it doesn't really happen like
that again keep in mind two big things
having skills and ready to do hard work
yes of course you can make money online
I'll probably discuss a couple of days
that I think are good ways of making
money online but again make sure you're
ready to do extraordinary hard work
along with awesome skills okay so I have
actually categorized this video in a
couple of ways by which you can make
money online now one of the very good
way is freelancing and yes there are a
lot of websites like freelance up work
or Fiverr a lot of other websites are
there which which can offer you some
work but again that work will depend on
how much skill you have to offer how
much at a low price you can offer those
skills as well as in what amount of time
you are ready to do the work so all of
this is a combination and trust me when
I say you need awesome skills yes you do
need awesome skills and portfolio
because freelancing is not about just
getting a job in the company it's
actually little bit harder than that
because there are let us say a job is
being posted on an online website there
are thousands and thousands of
freelancers who
to take that job now among those
thousands of people you have to stand
out how you can stand out
you should have awesome skills so focus
some time on learning that skill also
when you have bid it on that project
your pricing should be competitive from
other people and I have seen people like
for example let's just say I charge $200
for a single page or 2 page website
there are people who are ready to do the
same work in hundred dollars or maybe
twenty dollars or maybe even ten dollars
but again the potential employee chooses
you based on your portfolio how much
good work you have done in the past if
not you have no work in the past make
sure you create a fictitious portfolio
where you have showcased your skill and
this is super important and this is just
one way of dealing with that now there
are a lot of opportunities being posted
on such website like making apps for
Android for iOS for react GS and tons of
other technologies in case you are
missing dotnet or Java yes they are also
there so everything has the category has
a pricing point you can get registered
on those websites and can look up for
the project but the big hurdle is the
skills your skills should be awesome so
focus at least a couple of years in
enhancing your skills now I'm not
selling anything in this video where
ever you want to take the skills from
offline Institute online courses or
maybe wherever you are want to learn or
maybe just you want to learn by your own
make sure you learn something and
prepare a portfolio for yourself for
example you are learning Android go
ahead no problem at all just make sure
you have a couple of apps lying on the
github or some ATK's or maybe it's into
the App Store or Google Play Store
wherever it is so this is the number one
way now I will also bring up your one
point here about some of the people who
have approached me that hey I know
typing skills can I get a job online
with these kinds of website I would say
yes and no because the thing what I want
to say here is this is a tech channel I
encourage people to get friendly with
the technologies to learn tech thing to
learn programming and hey on those
freelancing website there are hundreds
and hundreds and thousands of people who
know how to press a finger on the
keyboard
yes that
little bit harsh but that's the truth
and there are a lot of companies who
have actually hired these kinds of
people who are doing all the DS kinds of
typing job and probably a lot faster
than you so instead of wasting your time
in just typing something I would highly
recommend to learn some programming
skills and offer them on those
freelancing website ok a page enough of
talk about freelancing and programming
what are the other ways by which I can
earn money online now yes I'll come back
onto that now one of the other way is
writing blogs and how does that blog
earns now usually that kind of blog
earns why advertisements now there are
two kinds of advertisements first one is
by the Google Adsense yes Google does
offer you a little bit amount of money
yes I literally mean little bit just
pennies and you can also reach out to
your local companies and agencies who
can post a little bit ad on your and can
pay you monthly like $100 or $50
whatever your agreement goes on now this
highly depends on what kind of content
is bare on your blog site how much
updated is your blog site and how much
regular readers on your blog site now
it's not like you will just throw up any
content on your blog site just copy and
pasting from here and there and you will
get a high ranking in the blog content
is always King and will always remain
king you are watching this video because
I am giving you something valuable I'm
teaching you something valuable and
that's the only reason why you're stuck
up here you are stuck up on some other
blogs which gives you official updates
maybe the phone reviews is the first one
to review all the phones give you the
detailed specification again hard work
comes at the roll
so yes blogging is another way by which
you can earn money but that's a little
amount of money but of course as the
blog blog grows up quite a lot and you
have got regular visitors like regular
users after a few couple of years you
may expect a good amount of decent
income via blogging but again your blog
should be awesome the reader should get
some value out of your blog it should
not be just copy pasting this stuff it
won't work
now these are the two ways that we have
discussed so far freelancing and
blogging what
of the other ways I can make money
online and yes the platform you are on
right now YouTube is also famous from
money making money online now let me
also warn you here now YouTube is not an
easy game and it's not probably for
making money online just try to imagine
you see your favorite TV channels the
YouTube channels like TV f4 AIB you have
been quite familiar with them now all
these channels do you think they are
making a dozens of amounts of money
online probably yes because we have read
it somewhere on the blog or have bought
some YouTube videos but what you don't
understand is behind the scenes now just
try to imagine the amount of money that
they have invested in cameras and lenses
in microphones in acting's their
computer bills their electricity bill
this all adds up quite a lot in the
production value what they produce in
the YouTube channel so YouTube yes
definitely it's a good way of making
money online but if you'll be getting
started on the YouTube for making money
probably I think that you won't be
staying for long because just try to
imagine even with the 50,000 subscriber
it's not good even to buy the length in
the camera on which I am shooting so yes
it's a good way but once you have to
reach at that point again not everybody
is mkbhd or Casey Knight stats so you
have to be really cautious in making
money online now there are dozens of
other small categories that I would put
all of them together which are like
there are some fake I would like to call
them certainly fake fake websites that
say hey just watch this much of ad for 3
second and will pay you for that usually
these are just scams and on top of that
yes there are also website we just say
hey take this survey per day and we are
going to pay thousands or billions or
millions of dollar by the end of this
month
I don't think so they are very useful
there are also ways like shortened link
URL they are just pennies I and I think
somebody somebody is so much of
hard-working person he shouldn't be
wasting time in those kinds of things
instead just try and learn something now
also by the lost of this I would put
these affiliate and referral
as well now affiliate is one good thing
by which you can make money and in fact
most of the YouTube channel make money
by affiliation program let me tell you
what the affiliation program is
affiliation is something known as hey
buy this and that's it now what happens
behind the scene when you refer somebody
to buy something that person gets a
legislator mount of discount or maybe
some benefit and on return the companies
paid this guy like me let's just say M
and M is Amazon affiliate and I say hey
by this lens this is good now what
you'll get if you'll buy from my link
let's just say this is all fictitious
situation I'm not linked with Amazon yet
so this is the length just buy it and
since you have used this lens and you're
referring it that means it should be of
good quality and when you buy it from my
link I get a small cut from that don't
worry your prices don't regularly raise
up because I'm getting a cut it's all a
good Commission that I get directly from
Amazon so yes affiliation is also a good
thing but in order to earn from
affiliate also you need to have either a
good blog where people can read about
legislate lenses and you are providing
some good valuable information and then
people are buying it so definitely
that's the vent way of earning it let's
just say your YouTube channel is doing
pretty good you want to earn money from
it you have a hundred thousand
subscriber Amazon is one way of making
money
so these are some realistic thing that I
wanted to talk about how to make money
online just remember I know this is a
long video just remember that there is
no such magic if you think that it is
too good to be true it probably is a
scam so there is no such shortcut of
making money online it requires really
good hard work effective skills and
patience a lot of patience you have to
stay online for a long time probably for
years and years to make money online it
is not easy so go and focus first on the
skills once you have skills and
especially this is a programming channel
focus on learning programming and make
learn to make apps or websites and all
these things then you can offer your
skills to other people and this is
probably the easiest way to earn money
online now I know a lot of spammers will
come up at the bottom of this video
and we'll post hundreds of link that hey
I have learned this much of money check
out my link don't do that please don't
check out on those links I'll probably
try to clean those links up but okay
let's end this video I know this was a
bit long but this is a serious
information that need to be passed to
everybody okay so no more scam eating
focus on learning skills focus on hard
work and probably probably within a few
years you'll be making hundreds and
thousands of dollar for sure okay
I'll surely catch you up in the next
video and in the meantime coming down
what are your thoughts and I'll make
more videos of such kind just notify me
in the comment section what more videos
you would like me to do okay I'll catch
you up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
