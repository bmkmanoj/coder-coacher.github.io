again with another video and in this
video we are talking about the recent
controversy of the Facebook so in case
you are a little bit updated about the
international news which is more
international it's like a global news
now and in case you heard a little bit
about it recently Mark Zuckerberg came
on to CNN and admitted that yes our data
was misused in a really big manner and
we admit that and we don't deserve the
chance to serve a billion user if we
just cannot fix this up so it was a
really big issue and I really wanted to
make a video on it as well as try to
UNMISS defy the things because a lot of
people are not aware what is actually
happening and how it became such a big
news so in this video I'll unmask defy
it for everybody so that everybody can
understand that and also would like to
put some of my parts into let's get
started
in order to understand what actually
happened you have to first be aware of
what is API now in case you do not aware
about what is API I'll put a link in the
description about my previous video go
ahead watch that first so that you can
understand what actually happened now
just on to a very side a short note API
is a way by which a company legally
allows you to access some or some part
of the data so that you can use that now
in this case if you look at the
developer's website of the Facebook you
will be amazed that what kind of
information you can access now in some
of my offline boot camps recently we
designed one of that for react native
and we developed an app in which you can
just access anybody's of course with
permission your date of birth your
interest your likes and we were just
scratching the surface tons of
information is there on the Facebook
about you and you have willingly put
that information out your likes your
dislikes what kind of songs you like
what kind of bands you like what kind of
political interest you do have your
regional geography your gender I know
it's getting scary but all these
information is already available and
through the developers API you can
access that information and can use it
however you like now obviously there is
an audit scheme with the Facebook they
just check it out what kind of your
privacy policies are and what
information you are using there so
obviously they do check but obviously
there are always slips there and
sometimes a lot of them are missed now
in case you are not getting connected
with me right now go to the Amazon visit
any product come back onto the Facebook
and you'll be seeing the exact ad or
advertisement for that same product so
this is all already being tracked quite
a lot and this something happened
recently which Facebook had to came out
and admit this so let me tell you what
exactly is the incident here so if you
have been around with the Facebook you
know that somehow Facebook was in
controversy that Facebook advertisement
and polls and posts have affected the
u.s. election now this is not just about
the US elections these Facebook post
memes on some political parties and
people actually do affect elections and
the reputation of the party all over the
globe and it
something that everybody knows so
recently on 17 March some big media
houses media papers recently announced
that a company can bridge analytic ah
has admitted that we have the access or
the information of more than 50 million
users and they are using some kind of
algorithms machine learning and a tons
of other things to just manipulate the
things about your likes and dislike and
based on that they are somehow affecting
the elections here now Cambridge
analytic ah is a company which is mainly
for a data mining also you can call that
as a machine learning company and based
on their algorithms feedback and user
data they are somehow mining that what
could be the users interest what we
should serve and what kind of
advertisement could be could be post
there now for me honestly the 50 million
data is like overhyped thing I don't
think that that's kind of a big amount
of user base they do have but again I'm
nobody to in a position to say that but
I do have some speculations here now if
you are aware of app which was known as
this is my digital life now it was
designed by Alexander Coogan who
designed this application and this
application was installed by all over
270,000 people now this 270,000 people
data which was collected through this
this is my digital life everybody who
downloaded this app and used this app
willingly gave that information to
developers like Alexander Kogan who in
houses uses the developers API of
Facebook and legally got all of this
data which was meant to be for their app
now after that Alexander Cogan sold all
this information to cam bridge and the
Latika which was further used in the
election campaign
again this Cambridge analytic is the
same firm which is known for data mining
and a political engagement and kind of a
IT cell for various big organizations
and political parties including the
Donald Trump and maybe it has rumors
that it has been connected to a variety
of political parties in India as well
but again there is no certain proof for
that so I am just making it speculations
here but yes this is completely truth
that the developer Alexander Cogan
his app this is my digital life was
entire data was being sold to this
company so yes they do have good amount
of data to make a lot of lot of machine
learning algorithms and judgments so
that they can make a lot of judgment
about here this app this is my digital
life came into existing in 2014 and in
2015 2015 allegedly Facebook went to the
developer Alexandre Cogan and say hey
you have acquired this information in a
completely wrong manner which is against
our privacy policy so you need to delete
this now fun thing is this was just the
conversation which is kind of a media
that it happened there are no proofs
about it that it didn't happen or how
actually Mark Zuckerberg met them or it
was an email conversation there is no
proof about it any of the news channel I
have been following this story for a
long time I haven't found it but since
I'm no journalist here I'm just sharing
my thoughts but I have radium online and
since following this story for a long
time so this 2014 app and allegedly by
Facebook this was dumped down in 2015
still is resurfacing in 2018 and all
these controversies so now that you know
that how your data was misused and the
privacy policy was broken by one
developer just single developers now
imagine the power here just a single
developer and this has affected so much
that Mark Zuckerberg had to came out and
had to admit that yes this was something
done wrong on our hand and we are trying
our best to just solve this so this was
a statement directly from Mark
Zuckerberg I'll post on a link below of
the CNN interview that Zuckerberg gave
and made all these points just a valid
there now comes of the interesting
question this psychographic evaluation
of your likes dislikes what bands you
like what political party your you like
your geographical location all these
things fetching them into machine
learning and doing a psycho evaluation
of what could your interest be this is
like little bit over high because it can
be done via various other means as well
but the point is a lot of people are
worried that our information is is onto
the words that it's leaked out every
single time and we just face the
consequences
now let me tell you that digital way or
this online coming onto the Internet
one way journey the moment you have made
an online account on any website maybe
Twitter Facebook maybe just your bank
account which move to online everything
is already online and this is just one
way we cannot go back so if you are
thinking that I'll not go online and
we'll be safe this I think is not at all
a choice now you are already online
whether you like it or not the best way
to secure now is to just make sure you
are much more aware about these incident
and stay updated so instead of just
sitting at your home expecting that
everything is right you should be going
more out onto the web and reliable media
resources so that you can get much more
updated things like that and you are
aware of what is actually happening so
obviously the question as a developer in
mind is what Facebook is doing further
so that these kinds of developer doesn't
surface anymore as well as developers
like you and me who are always working
on the good stuff actually doesn't
really get affected so in return to that
reply of that there is not full yet like
statement out there but it's like
speculations and most of the like in
words in the media that Facebook is now
introducing a very strong audit and if
you need more information apart from
your email and name this is like the
basic regular login stuff apart from
that if you need any information there
will be a very strong audit for that and
if you found that this is not for us the
developers will block your keys and you
will not be able to access it also they
have made one more announcement that if
some app is not being used by the app or
by the person for more than three months
it is going to like cut off from their
server so a lot of steps are being taken
care of ously this was the first really
big incident but really there are still
three questions that Facebook is are
trying to just solve at one time the
first one is data privacy the second one
is fake news and the third one is fake
profiles now we are all aware of the
situation that what is happening with
the fake profiles and I would like to
just address this one big issue which is
fake profiles and fake identity fake
users this is like a big issue now
because you know a lot of people are
using of making these fake profiles on
YouTube
on Twitter on Facebook they are just
wearing a mask of anonymity and doing a
lot of bad stuff because it's so easier
to say bad words or curse word to any
people who is online and you're hiding
behind a mask you can just put a comment
there or maybe pose down a tweet there
it's so easier so I would really like to
look forward that how this big issue of
anonymity freedom of speech as well as
fake account these things are taken care
of this is this is right now a really
big issue on the online and also I would
like to know your thoughts on this fake
profile and fake news and anonymity
issue about this what are your thoughts
onto this now I know this video is more
over about the general information that
I wanted to pass on about this recent
cam bridge Facebook issue this is a
really big news and a lot of people are
not understanding what is happening so I
just here tried to give you a big
narrative of what is happening and how
things are shaping up obviously if you
need more information on that you can
hit down the comment section below and I
can put down more videos on that so that
I can help you in order to understand
this so that's it for this video we
mostly talk about programming and tech
stuff on this channel mostly sometimes
designs as well but these are some of
the big issues which actually need to be
broken down and you need to understand
what power comes up as a developer and
what actually can be possible with the
help of these datas and machine learning
and api's and all these things so that's
why it was covered so that's it for this
video in case you have enjoyed this
video do share it on Facebook and
Twitter as well and I will surely catch
you up hey if you are enjoying it - hit
