welcome back to hollow world series a
series where we are talking about
prerequisite of the programming and how
you can get started in the programming
of any kind of language out there in
today's topic we are going to discuss
focusing on choosing the right operating
system and choosing the right IDE before
we get started into the programming so
let's get started out here if you are
watching this video for the very first
time do remember to check out the entire
series on the YouTube because I have
created an entire series out there
talking about all of the programming and
there are a couple of videos that I have
already recorded so go ahead check them
out so if you are watching this video
out there I'm assuming that after a lot
of headaches and doing some talks with
other professional programmers lot of
internet reading of the blogs lot of
watching of the V YouTube's
you have finally decided what
programming language you are going to
choose maybe you want to go into the iOS
Android desktop web application anything
but now you are focused on that now what
should be the next step before you get
started out here now the next step is
should be choosing the right operating
system for your programming and choosing
the right IDE for that so before we get
started for that let me give you a quick
example now I was in my hometown and I
was looking for the other youtubers to
get collaboration with them for entire
series of the programming skills or
maybe a couple of videos out there so I
went to a nearby Institute out there
looking for some Android developer out
there and I heard about this Institute
and who's gonna name it but I heard
quite a lot about good words about it I
went out there to talk the professor out
there that hey we would like to
collaborate with me for a CDS or maybe a
couple of videos giving some valuable
tips to the student and the moment I saw
him he was working on the mic Microsoft
Windows 7 I immediately dropped the idea
now you might be judging me based on
that but some of his computer were
running XP where the users were just
practicing and his own computer was
running Windows 7 now why I dropped the
idea because I have a special type of
audience out there
my student always expect that I'll be
working out on the latest technology out
there with real-world practical and
crisp example without hassle and daesil
and well the key point is working on the
latest technology out there I'm not
saying that he should be having a Mac or
he should be having the latest studio
Microsoft I'm not expecting that but at
least he should be updated on the
operating system also he should be aware
of the latest trends about how the
materialistic design or the things like
that are working out there so the whole
point is choose write operating system
for your programming out there if you
want to be a iOS developer and you are
working on Windows 7 or 10 out there you
can work out on that there are some ways
by which you can do do that but of
course you are wasting a lot more time
out there and similarly if you want to
work out on the Android you can be just
working on iMac or maybe Windows it's
equally good but spend a good amount of
time in deciding write operating system
for you let me give you another example
maybe you want to automate a lot of
Linux stuff out there for the linux
administration or for some server
administration and you might want to
learn Python but of course you have
installed the Python on the windows and
you are working out there and writing
some script out there there is no harm
in that you are for sure going to learn
that but I would say there is a better
option you can just install Ubuntu or
Kali Linux or anything like that and you
can get started by writing the script on
that environment on which you are going
to work day and night out there so
always do spend a lot of time in doing a
good research of what kind of operating
system you are going to work with and on
to a quick tip if you want to go into
the iOS choose and choose Mac now a lot
of people will jump on hey I'm going to
work on hackintosh but yes you can but
that would be a waste of your beautiful
mind and your resources out there so go
ahead to the Mac if you want to an
Android no problem you can work on
Windows or as well as Mac as well but I
would highly recommend a Windows for
that again if you want to work on the
pen testing there are a lot of operating
system Kali parrot and
of them so do research on that with that
now let's move on to the other part of
the game that is choosing the right IDE
now again I'm going to start with an
example let's just say you choose an
online course out there or an offline
course and teacher is saying hey you
know what I'm gonna start with the Java
and open up your notepad and write this
script out there or the entire code out
there again a bad choice why who on this
God's green earth write the program on a
notepad or a text pad in this era if
your teacher is doing that I guess he's
not updated and he might be usually
working on he might be usually working
on the things in 2000 or 2002 or 2005
things have changed drastically now and
you might want to spend a huge amount of
time in choosing the right IDE for HTML
and PHP there are tons of free options
out there like bracket atom and a lot of
other good ones are out there
similarly for Android you might want to
write the code in Android studio out
there or Eclipse out there or Xcode
always spend a good amount of time in
choosing the IDE you will be spending a
lot of time and you don't want to make
the syntactical errors out there ID
helps you to get rid of all those nasty
syntactical error that we always miss
like adding semicolons forgetting the
ending brackets forgetting the closing
braces out there and a lot of things
like that so always my tip would be
spend a good amount of time in figuring
out what should be the operating system
and what should be the IDE for your
chosen language I know it's very really
tough to decide all of these things
first of all but you will be glad that
you spend a lot of time out there ok so
with this I would like to say that
please do hit subscribe to my channel do
hit the like button share these videos
or entire playlist out there if you
think that someone can get benefit from
that with this I'll catch you up in the
next movie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
