you know in the comments that I am
available live to you all not so far
this is like different life I usually go
like through my software but this is the
first time I'm getting light directly
through my browser this is kind of a new
feature being rolled out by YouTube so
hi God not your how are you hello here I
can actually see the light chat here
directly yeah that's good
I'm her mother hi technische I come on
IRA will I go cool okay so a lot of
people are there hi chef Ruthie okay now
it's going like really fast
hello a lot of heard a lot of people are
live here so I cannot see like how many
people are watching it I don't know
where that is
it's really hard to find that I hope
everybody is good and rocking the things
first of all let me make a quick
announcement that it's almost 8:30 it's
been three months of the consistency so
all those people who have been following
me on the Facebook I recently started a
trend that no matter what's your choice
of languages programming is whatever
that is me will be doing every single
day of learning whether that's in one
hour or two or whatever that is and
you'll be posting on my facebook come in
day one day two day five like that it's
been three months not even a single log
not even on Sundays and this is
absolutely insane consistency and hard
work so congratulation for all those who
have been following me along on this I
really enjoyed it I myself feel a very
great achievement all of that so
congratulation to all of that it's been
three months
absolutely insane let's pick up some of
the questions so hey I'm older I'm 14
good for you you have started really
early so also here on this channel about
programming so this should be really
good I hope my audio and everything is
very good for all of you so let me know
in the comment section how the audio is
going on I think it's decent enough or
good enough let me know
okay so everything is superb so thank
you what our opinion about choosing
Android as a career it's really good
option good option
I don't really say that is anything bad
in that I highly recommend that all of
those who are thinking that we should go
into Android it's a great thing but what
I would recommend you to is explore that
if you want to choose just Android
explore that to the maximum possibility
that can be possible creating apps that
use a GPS cameras front camera back
camera things like snapchat clone tinder
clone or maybe others like that maybe a
news API use that at least learn at your
best about the usage of API in the
Android so go ahead do that
now sometimes a is flutter flutter
yes weather is good there are a lot of
things
I'm meeting about the flutter it's not
like I have still jumped out of it and
keeping a close eye on the project I all
the time read their blogs and stuff I am
waiting for the flutter a little bit to
make sure all of that because a little
bit on to the watching side on the dart
I'm not sure how the project is going to
roll up in the future so that's why we
are waiting for that okay Abby Abby
shakes things is how to make a career in
information security and ethical hacking
a couple of videos are actually lined up
for information security as well
probably you're going to see them
tomorrow and day after tomorrow I have
two advices and few things that I wanted
to share with you about information
security so definitely you should keep
an eye on this channel I hope everybody
is aware that and this YouTube thing is
not gonna give you best notification for
all of my videos even though we have hit
the bell like if you are interactive on
my channel posting comments and hitting
likes and all of that then only they are
going to give you updates for that so I
hope you're aware of that okay let's
pick up which country you live I live in
my hometown is in Jaipur which is in
India and I do roam around quite a lot
in Europe as well that's my favorite
place to hang around mostly in the Paris
in Switzerland so that's where I do roam
around a couple of other countries
outside
I should go Neil how are you hope we are
doing good how about tutorials on PHP
using machine learning as of now the
libraries and packages are not
supporting much on to this machine
learning stuff so PHP and Java has to
wait a little bit right now Python and
art are the only rock-solid language for
machine learning in fact just right now
I was doing a project on that so
probably will share updates on that very
soon so let's get quickly go on to that
so it's really great really fast I'm not
able to read any of that is it - way to
go up a little bit
are you married no I'm not okay he-hey
please okay
mango DB it's not mango DB it's MongoDB
sir why audio is not good obvious I
think it's decently good I'm using a
direct output from my built-in mic from
iMac because when I use this pleuity it
makes an echo is sound so this is it
what we have right now so I hope you can
bear with it okay so mean DB DB means
database we are talking about the
database here buddy if you are not even
aware of the DVS database I think you
have to learn quite a lot probably
already knew go ahead explore a little
bit so audio is good thank you so much
sone 10 some 10 us a syrup says USA New
Mexico ok so your New Mexico that's a
good place little bit hot but so there
we go did you delete your Facebook I
know there is a trend going on saying
delete your Facebook
I'm not involve them I'm not gonna be
deleting my Facebook already people so
much bother about it like this obviously
it's a matter of concern that a lot of
data was misused but if you are going to
download like any random app here and
there things may get wrong it's it's
like yes it was and if a responsibility
for Facebook but again it was the data
was lead to
for the people who are using any given
random act like this is my digital life
I'm no condition I would be downloading
such app so this was it and now I'm not
going to be deleting my facebook it's
like a channel it's my way of connecting
with you guys so obviously hey I can see
the light counts is going down so thank
you so much hitting the like button
there I saw that just rising up thank
you so much sure how was vit hey tej how
are you how's it going on I hope you are
doing pretty good I saw your DP on the
whatsapp it's really nice if you wish I
can show that on public as well yes the
idea was good I enjoyed that absolutely
amazing event for all the teleports do
you have an FB page yes I do have a FB
page it's named as get a strawberry page
it's really really white we had a page
at the end of it but yeah that's it okay
let's pick up more questions as well I
need to block a couple of people as well
here if you don't like the stream or if
you don't like me why even you are
watching that wasting your time you
could have really enjoyed some things
they are served in strange kind of
people your whatsapp number please I
would rather prefer to be interactive on
Facebook page and YouTube live and in
the YouTube comments as well I would
like to share my already I don't use my
phone down much so about EWS career high
Simon s is amazing like if you are
planning to go into AWS and all these
Amazon Web Services mailing and hosting
and everything it's good it's rock solid
I don't have any course or anything on
that but that doesn't mean it's a bad
choice it is absolutely fantastic you
should definitely go into that Melo code
Ian's sponsored a super chat thank you
so much well thank you so much for your
support
funny let's pick up more questions okay
there we go
just found somebody who I can block
let's pick up an hamakom blocking okay
so far Lee later on a the Bakken and
this is best for PHP framework
codeigniter or level I would give a
slight edge to level here's the last
nice little monkey Chow sponsored a
super chat thank you so much sniffing I
would give a little bit choice or an
edge to lateral because it's really like
much more easier and much more like a
lot of things are already cooked down in
level so I like it
what about dotnet please advise me thank
you so much Arabic for super chat love
dotnet dot it is amazing and recently
one of the people say I don't work on
dotnet much so that's why I don't like
really like to talk about it because I
don't have much working experience and I
only talk about the stuff which I have
working experience and as you can see I
have pretty good experience and variety
of wide range of tech but not in dotnet
yes it is good I don't have any like
really good amazing crowd or anything
for dotnet or client work so that's why
Shivam Tucker says hi video I should um
how are you okay please talk about
internship at LSE other weights lco
learn code online it's gonna come up
very soon we are planning something
really big and amazing Orland put online
it's gonna take a while
I have a kind of a person who like to
take his time and brush up the product
or whatever I'm doing
whether that's take a lot of time I
would like to give that there amount of
time so it's gonna take some time but
obviously it's gonna be like very
amazing it will come not very soon not
in a couple of months but surely it is
going to come and what I am planning to
do is internship should be something
like this which is it should be
life-changing if somebody is working
under me obviously he'll be learning a
lot and I want to just give him an
internship which should be completely
life-changing I repeat - salut
thank you so much for the super chat
love you guys and please upload more
videos on WordPress I do want to upload
more videos on WordPress but actually
things you know when you upload videos
on something a specific topic like
whether it's WordPress or Adobe XD the
view count actually goes trust
and I see everybody's needs to grab much
more audience so that's why I usually
stop this kind of things and move them
on to like a learned code online
platform or things like that but if I'll
get enough demand shortly I can add more
videos on that so let's pick up more
question and okay somebody say is
hashing click and that's nice
do you know Tamil I really wish I really
wish to learn Tamil that's really one
fascinating language and really wish to
learn it one day because you know when
you're from a background of Hindi
understanding things like Gujarati and
Punjabi is so easy for me and I believe
if I know some language like Tamil it
would be really easy to go and do
survive in the South I really wish that
this is amazing unfortunately I don't
know it right now but I look forward
that if I get some time or maybe some
like boot camps for a couple of months
to learn Tamil I would absolutely love
to join it Marathi are my very close
friend is from Hofstra so I do though
few of the Marathi words like I can
understand a little bit of it not much
where it's I think it's easier Marathi
is easier so I haven't say that it's
easier to learn machine learning we will
shortly talk about machine learning
probably from the very first week of
next month
it's gonna be an amazing amazing thing
for all of you so stay excited for that
thank it is you're not hitting the like
button there I really wish to see the
light counted go little bit up so hey
guys go ahead and hit that like button
so come on just hit that we want to see
a little bit rising okay there we go
okay let's pick up on Django verses
node.js for big nerd which will be
efficient it's from mother hey it's just
it just went up so no J's and Django
both are amazing but here is the fact
that I have seen actually stats on my
website and couple of others persons
which I had taught Django is actually
super easy for beginners to get started
so it would be really amazing for all of
you to get started with Django but again
PHP notes yes they are all amazing but
since there is so much boilerplate code
available in the
it's so much easier that's why people
feel really comfortable when they get
started with Jambo if you'll talk about
any seasoned developer is gonna say to
you hadiya's Django was amazingly simple
and it's really super easy hey thank you
today in the bundle for a sponsor a
super chair thank you so much for your
support so yes I would highly recommend
myself also that learn a little bit
about - not much a little bit and then
move to Janko once you are able to
understand the Django basics like log in
log out your database interaction and
to-do list in the interaction then it's
easier to move anywhere whether that's
Django or it's no js' or PHP it's super
easy let's speak up more question
ethical hacking and earning yes ethical
hacking and learning are pretty easy I
have couple of videos to you just for
tomorrow to talk about these stuff but
here's one of the easiest way is bug
hunting and then there are a lot of lot
of CTF capture-the-flag competitions so
you can go for that as well okay some
people are watching even from far away
from Pakistan United States
thank you hey hey all of you so xamarin
if you are already into dotnet stack it
makes much more sense for you to go for
salmon envy if you're already into
dotnet stack it doesn't really make
sense for you to go into other curve and
go for react meteor flutter or any of
that you can go for examine it but if
you are not at all developer in dotnet
it makes much more sense for you to go
into the act native or other things that
you might have heard about them your
course procedure please it's available
at learn code online dot n you pay just
one time and you get access for all of
the courses for three years I think it
is more than enough time to learn any
one technology okay so there is a
question there is a paid question bias
to make the dry Python or r4 share
crypto Jane Curtin license I would go
for either now are is actually much more
simpler and let me harness fear you know
you don't have to load these libraries
and stuff that is actually much more
easier but on the other hand I
personally believe personal thought
again
that if you go with the Python Bay you
can use your existing Python knowledge
if I write your base like Django can
also be learned you can also go for data
science you can use numpy and us
matplotlib Seabourn tons of stuff and
other libraries as well so I personally
am a fan that if I would be giving a
choice like R or Python I would be any
day picking up Python because R is not
so dynamic in other things it's dynamic
off obviously but I would be choosing
frightened for that but it's not choice
again so I am late to the party hey
Ravindra Joshi you are not late we just
got started he will be hanging it on
here a little bit this is like a pure
nerdy taught programming stuff and how
about so yeah it's going pretty good
hey Suraj Pradhan thank you so much for
the super chat love you know how to
start earning as a freelancer with
Python and Django there are so many
projects of freelancers up work and
there are a couple of other websites as
well there are so many projects pista
cute question
sponsored question by the Prakash
Kushwaha hello big city boy that's nice
thank you should I learn ionic or react
native now both are amazing first of all
but here is a quick thing that is going
to help you to decide in ionic you also
have to learn type script which is like
a superset of JavaScript so you have to
learn one more language for that but in
react native your existing es6 knowledge
your JavaScript knowledge is gonna be
more than enough that's it ionic is like
very big to learn react native is a very
small one you can if you have experience
in development of other things probably
you can finish it like in in a week max
so I would recommend react native if you
don't have much time or all these things
but again I think is also a good but I
would recommend you to go for pre acne
if that's actually better not in like
performance in anything where it's
easier to learn hi this thank you for
coming to my college ki IIT University I
enjoyed it
I attended your event and it's still
good thank you so much makeup Rhea I
enjoyed my travel there this was my
first time travel to Risa this probably
without you two men you are in white I
would have never visited Orissa honestly
like this is amazing I would love to
visit at one more time especially during
some festival season or something yes
sure engine Shukla says how you always
have the news of the new tech I do have
my friend encircle all in please that
community like one of my friend recently
them Samson he is right now in IIT ten
bath for a recruitment drive so I
regularly chat with him see all of his
update I do have my friends at Facebook
in the headquarter in the US and Google
I have links in French so I am all the
time hanging around with these people
who have like the first Rehan resource
on the tech news so that's how I get it
my French my community is all around the
tech so it's not like I have to dig up
for the news
it always is rolling around me and
that's what I share very in fact
sometime I'm really late for making
these videos I do have these news really
a long time so technical Babaji that's a
nice name sir I am also from Odisha
please come in this city I would
laughter I recently was there but I
would love to be back in Ibiza okay I
shouldn't sing say is do you left did he
left InfoSec because of money no money
was good InfoSec it's not like it was
bad so it was good decent money was
there but I realized I could earn a
little bit like lot more into the
development phase and it's much more
challenging because you have to take
care of the developers you have to take
care of information security and
everything so I found development is
much more challenging as well as new
things are here so that's why I chose
them and it's not like I have completely
left the InfoSec I still be in
reasonable touch with all of those guys
but I enjoyed the development or you're
gonna find such a humble crowd we see
the chat here you see the number
likes here the comments section so
humble developers will say again
everybody is humble but this development
community is so amazing so thankful I
genuinely who's hotter do you say thanks
to each and every developer who is
trying to be developer always already
developer sir please tell us how to add
Adobe XD to enter it studio it's it's
not you don't add that you look like
Mark Zuckerberg wearing this t-shirt no
I'm nowhere near he's like long face and
stuff like this t-shirt is is not even
same actually if you if you'll notice
closely this is a darker shade of the
grey he wears a lighter shade obviously
you need to pay a little bit a wrench in
there here's a good question Robin
solution says why Indian client don't
paint freelancing this is actually a
myth because I do have some Indian
clients as in the clinch do require more
revision for free but they actually pay
a lot and in fact if you get a client
who is in your city on the freelancer
you will be paying like 10,000 or 12,000
or maybe 15,000 for a website but if the
client is directly in your city you can
actually charge him a lot more maybe
25,000 rupees okay after PHP does the
question by the rungy 5x5 it's a
sponsored question what after PHP
angularjs node.js or I would highly
recommend to stay with PHP a little bit
while because if you have if you are
using PHP try to go with the PHP MySQL
may design a couple of projects so stay
there for a little bit while until
unless you have designed a few projects
and instead of going into angularjs or
node.js let me tell you one thing which
can make a lot of money for you is learn
to design
plug-ins for WordPress it sounds like
boring and stuff but let me tell you if
you're already into PHP it would be
super easier for you to do this learning
WordPress plug-in development and it you
can make insane crazy amount of money
it does require a lot of hard work and
stuff but obviously it's really amazing
but in case you want to choose anything
between angularjs or not yes I would
recommend nodejs just like nodejs for
that but I highly recommend to move
further more into PHP it's not like PHP
is going anywhere it's gonna stay here
for a long long time so moving into
WordPress and plug-in development can be
little bit good for you so I hope that
was a reasonable answer
okay how to learn all jeaious frameworks
I have absolutely no idea how to learn
all gs framework I'm not even close to
learning like a few percentage of them
there are so many there are a lot of
them which I personally want to learn
but due to like busy schedule this thing
is rocketed has given a rocket growth to
my personal things as well so that's why
I'm not getting much time but yes I
would like to learn especially these
decks table base I hope you never heard
about electron I really want to learn
that it probably gave me a week or so
with that framework and I would be
nailing it down but I'm not getting much
time I need more time or maybe I can
make a clone of me do you talk about
technology do you work on any technology
I hope it looks like you haven't visited
learn code online dot in about my work
on the technology and also probably you
haven't visited my github repository
where I have a lot of code so on the
YouTube actually I don't touch much of
the code part I do have like Redux and
videos on that but yeah any good course
for Python or data science in Mumbai - I
don't know about much of the local
institutes in Mumbai but I would highly
recommend you to wait for a few days
probably from the April first week or
second mean just wait for a few things
we are coming up with something amazing
in which we want a course on how to
develop WordPress theme and plug-in for
that kind of course it would require a
lot of work probably a month and a half
to prepare such course so
you can see it very soon not in the
first list of the priority but yeah I
also want to make that because in order
to make such course you have to prepare
like three or four plugins first we have
to develop them then you have to break
them down so that you can teach somebody
how to make these plugins so it's it's a
lot of work probably we will be doing
that
I'm not saying will not be doing it
surely we will be but not immediately
very soon okay
Aman Mehra says boom boom to us well
that's good okay Python web development
versus Java web development which one to
learn I would say go for Django Python
web development is super easy I don't
know what Java is super easy to learn so
okay let's pick a couple of more
questions they notice we have is we have
spent almost half an hour here so one
light for 30 minutes of streaming and I
think this YouTube streaming direct
YouTube streaming is much more efficient
it's not laggy at all as compared to my
other streaming things so I think it's
better I hope you guys also liked it but
if I mean they come in as well okay the
pussay is thumbs up thumbs up to you
okay after the IPS today in the bundle
it makes much more sense to move into
react native you'll be absolutely loving
it after react it's amazing so this is a
sponsor chaired by Kaku bollocks so hey
you shout out to Kaku bollocks 420
that's sponsored chat ok so there is a
sponsor chaired by uncle Sharma project
slash competitive coding which is more
important
fan thank you again let me tell you my
perspective about competitive coding and
project competitive coding is absolutely
addictive here it is addictive I would
recommend you to once you have played
like a couple of competitions or solved
a couple of challenges leave it as soon
as possible it's addictive it's fun it
surely is going to improve your
knowledge and your
but it's far more important that you
move into project size because project
are far more challenging like in
computer coding you just have a couple
of sets and that's it these are the
rules in the real world clients project
the rules also change every now and then
so once you have done like couple of
coding or if you don't even do the copy
of coding that's completely okay because
a person is not going to give you a job
based on like I talked in the IIT
Roorkee that competitive exam nobody's
going to bother much about that
obviously if it is a big giant
competition like Google or Facebook one
that really matters a lot but in order
to crack those also you have to first
very good in making project so I
personally give a lot of weight edge to
building up projects as compared to
competitive item it's very addictive
it's a lot more fun but he has not every
fun thing is good so just move on to
something which is much more productive
and all of that so okay so let's recap
or questions tell about what finally a
project a lot of things if you hadn't
two masters or something designing
something using natural language
processing or something would be really
amazing for your career
as of now so there is a good question by
car gage Patil he says what to choose
between react and angular and thank you
so much for sponsorship here I would
personally go for react and again as
before the only big reason for that in
the angular you have to learn JavaScript
es6 and typescript then you can go into
angular so there's one new language that
you have to learn which is type spit a
lot of people will also say that
typescript is almost JavaScript it's
kind of a superset of JavaScript but
there are lot of things you have to
learn in the typescript as well while on
the other hand that react it's a very
small framework you can master it
probably in C or four days there are
just are there are products and States
and all of that it's very small and you
can use your react knowledge in to react
native as well that can design mobile
apps as well so my favorite like as
business perspective or as a job
perspective my favor will go for react
definitely check out the react native
and react course at learned code online
dot M the URL is courses
let's speak up any expert advice on
where's that any expert advice while
building career in here
but it's absolutely nailed down on your
Python or our whatever you are working
on because you'll be working on a lot of
concept that includes numpy pans and
data so nail down your Python the path
the Python skill that I learned they ago
in my engineering is still helping me
out so go for violin is Python good for
high frequency training
thank you for your answer hey should be
ended I actually I didn't got what kind
of what do you really mean here about
high frequency trading
I'm not honestly I'm really sorry about
that but I don't want to put up wrong
advice here I have absolutely like not
clicking what does it means about high
frequency trading instead of giving you
any land of advice I would like to keep
my mouth shut
instead of just any throwing any random
words there so I'm sorry thank you so
much for the sponsorship here super chat
but I would not give you any advice
because I'm not aware about high
frequency trading and instead of giving
random advice I would like to be shut
here it's okay I hope you don't mind
that okay so after Android course from
lco go for this as there is a chat
application building course so I think
that would be really amazing it's an
intermediate course so after the Android
course it really makes a lot of sense to
move into that course you'll be learning
about how to integrate a Google login
Twitter login phone login like when you
enter a phone number a password is being
asked for a four digit verification code
is being sent you'll be learning all of
these things in here is it this is a
ninja infinity war trailer did you saw
it yes I saw it I'm planning to watch
the movie as well being an Avenger fan I
would be going for that so there's a
question by Shiva me Bonnie
and she says scalable Android app Java
Cortlandt react native now honestly I
think you are looking for a business
solution I personally would go for react
native and there are reasons for that
there are reasons now with the react
native first of all I just need to grab
one T which is expert in Java
that's it that's not a big deal nor
effective the perks are already expert
in that so as a business solution I
would just keep a team on react native
and that team will be writing a single
code base which is obviously easier to
manage and through which you can design
your Android apps in iOS app as well so
all the users are getting exactly same
feature if there is a new update you can
run most of those update through servers
so you don't even have to just send an
update to your users they don't need to
just update your app you can do those
few updates on your server so I would
say react native is pretty scalable and
is a good business solution these hands
are amazing there is a strong reason why
a lot of big companies are moving on to
react naked the next option would be not
Kotlin would be Java because it's easier
to find developers on Java and obviously
as a business solution I would recommend
react native if you are building
something personal on your own it can be
done in Java as well but still because
obviously I think you want something to
go for an iOS as well so I hope you
understood things here okay let's pick
up more questions here Thanks thank you
so much package Patil I hope I was clear
on to that
why didn't you came onto YouTube FanFest
my target audience is not on YouTube
FanFest if I would be going on to
YouTube FanFest probably I'll go as a
fan probably a fan of BB is amazing
storyteller but my target audience would
love to listen to me is actually in
engineering colleges so that's why I was
hosting my own kind of a fan fest in vit
more than 800 people were there not mere
buyers on the fan fest but honestly
geeky all those geeky guys will have
programming and a child on that not in
the Pinterest
that's for entertainment I would myself
go as a fan of somebody so that's why I
didn't been there yourself
my fans are actually in the engineering
colleges that's where I would love to go
are you a messy fan no no no that's not
a question you answer publically because
this is
a big debate and I probably can get a
lot of unsubscribe button if you choose
any one of them so no no I know talk
about the football and Messi I don't
want to get that that's really a messy
thing so let's go upon ok that's I live
from whit city I live in the beautiful
city in Jaipur which is in Rajasthan
amazing city you should definitely visit
it sometime
ok love from Kashmir thank you so much
I'll bet shake thank you so much you
live in a really beautiful city a little
bit messed up but it's still beautiful
ok let's really fast
I am from Jaipur hey I am from the
airport after completing web development
in elsi or what should I do
I would recommend if you want to go
further into web dev Jango would be good
or if you want to move into app
development react and react native
should be the next choice so there are
two paths going on right now in front of
you one is going completely into web
which is jangle then other one is into
mobile development which goes will react
and react native so choose from you love
from Tamil Nadu
thank you so much it's amazing please
anytime you want to go into Tamil Nadu
there is a large love that comes up from
that part of the country I love that
love from Kolkata thank you so much I
guess you were there in my Kolkata talk
I don't enjoyed the city there's lots of
amazing clicks and that scaled my
ranking onto pixels as well 20:38
on a global ranking so thank you so much
for those amazing clicks let's pick up
more questions a few more them further
future of letter question from Pakistan
welcome on board first of all from
Pakistan for the flutter I would be
still meeting a little bit while because
I'm not sure that what could be like
really the next future of the flutter I
would be waiting for a little bit then
I'll be moving into Sutter the PUC's
Bengal or visit I was in Bangalore few
days ago tomorrow also I do have a
travels like you really want to join on
my facebook page I do visit Bangalore
quite often come check this girl once
as soon as some college invites me there
and I will be there sir okay
actually I just went to a site moment I
really love this chat and all those
people who are worried about the future
that they want to learn something this
is kind of a onions you don't get like
anywhere I'm really blessed that this
kind of audience who is worried about
their future and learning about dodo
chat or PHP it's completely okay so I'm
really blessed and thank you all of you
for being an amazing audience like I
don't know any other UT bill has done
such meaningful and such amazing lovely
audience or not but this is you can
check in the comments as well like there
are all programmers love you guys like
we could have found these thank you guys
all those geeks we are hanging it
already yourself love you all okay so
let's give a couple of more questions
and there we go so Dell XPS or MacBook
Pro MacBook Pro buddy heavy day MacBook
Pro you can have just one laptop and
just forget about anything
okay so copy pasting syntax is good or
not for well friend it is because copy
is like anybody can do that but which
code to copy bear to copy what to edit
is something we programmers only can do
so that's the important part
so back in JavaScript vs. Python easier
one - little bit tough but more like
demand and such things is JavaScript how
do you get clients please answer as of
now the clients are approaching me
directly sir it's very fun previously I
used to Baird and all these links and
pulling some strings and all that but
now luckily I want to a position where
clients are directly approaching me
almost every week I am getting a client
notification that
I want to build this I want you to work
on this I want you to lead my team I
want you to just visit our office or
something like that so I doesn't love it
hey other but so thank you so much
horses but yet does learn could online
have that development course you haven't
change it good online so far there is an
amazing bestseller complete front-end
developer course and learn could online
go ahead check that out
visit the courses tab their courses
don't learn code online so go ahead
visit that you will be amazed by the
courses and how affordable they are you
are going to love that so let's pick up
on mold buttresses any tips for 14 I am
14 the first tip is don't drop out don't
even think of dropping out complete your
studies
the second tip is keep learning
programming as a hobby and I think
that's it okay so run-ins I'll just say
is you're amazing thank you so much
you're amazing as JDK 10 just a quick
note on JD get in JD Keaton is not a
full fledged release it should have been
like something at a point development
because major release is about to come
it's not a full fledged release it's
like the mini one okay there's nothing
much in there so how can I contact with
some expert how can i how can I contact
with some expert coders you just hang
around in the community like this
channel are probably on Stack Overflow
this is how everybody does that or
attend a lot of conferences that's how I
do
is a company name is good for to work
with I cannot name that company but it's
not it's not a development company or
it's not making any product sir okay
after my board exam I have time three
months plate what can I do in that time
programming related you can pick up any
courses from the article online they are
very affordable and all you can learn in
three months probably you can learn
easily whether the penstocks equipment
your company name my company name is
learned code online incorporation
registered and Delaware United States of
America and I do have other company as
well igneous technologies which is
English technologies Private Limited
registered in India okay so let's move
on there are a lot of questions so you
answered my question I can die in peace
now no don't die don't die we need a lot
of programmers so please new-made don't
die we need a lot of programmers hey
Chris Bohemia bohemian that's a nice
name thank you so much for a super chat
future of testing I was making a video
just few hours ago about one thing on
the test thing about Android specially
so probably you can see that editing out
of that probably tomorrow it's recorded
but few things needs to be done and
edited so let's pick up a couple of more
questions web development versus app
development the borderline between web
and app is merging down quite now and
the proof is flutter or react native all
of that so both of them are amazing i
highly recommend to start with web it
gives you a lot of advantage like if
you're calling yourself as a programmer
and you don't know how to make a
two-page website what kind of
programming you are every programmer
should have a basic knowledge of HTML
CSS that's what I'm saying here okay so
it's the question certificate from learn
code online
yes certificates are also included in
your price it's mentioned in the FAQ
under every course page let's pick up
couple of more questions
internship from Amazon or Cisco if you
are getting a chance go for Amazon
it's awesome so I have both the
internship offers go for Amazon one so
Kaku bollocks is there to learn GS from
really scratch for react native I highly
recommend to visit learn code online dot
N or rather specific courses dot learn
code online dot n there is a separate
JavaScript course as well and then you
can move to D Act course in react course
the advanced JavaScript like es6 and all
those are also included so I highly
recommend to check out learning code
online dot in it's not account its dot
in its in India so it's not in passport
genius is complicated no it's not that
much complicated it's a middleware and
it's like almost every middleware that
we use in node it it is not that
hard
why are you feeling hard in that that
speaker real-time data is easy to
install in realm or firebase both serve
different purposes in realm you prepare
app as offline first and obviously elm
and firebase both are available for all
of the platform Android iOS we actually
get there everything but in realm he
used that for offline purposes while try
base cannot work on offline so it's what
you really want to do and installation
is all easy for real-time anything but I
would give a slight edge on firebase I
use both of them how is an app named to
learn code it's decent
I would not call it best because
programming is like mathematics
it looks amazingly awesome and somebody
else is doing or you are just reading it
out but you are going to only learn
programming when you will be doing it on
computers you need a keyboard you need
to type on that and that's how you learn
there's no base so all those apps or
anything that are just showing you all
these things on the text xx we don't
learn that way so whatever the app is I
don't want to be him anybody but
whatever the app is it's awesome
whatever that is but you only learnt
programming when you sit in front of a
computer write some code makes
stay going to stack overflow copy some
code paste it there and edited there
that's how everybody learns there is no
shortcut for that okay will you be our
mentor on 30 and 31st on smart india
hackathon there's that question it just
goes like really quickly about is that
in case you want to invite me on later
this really we ever meant around 30 in
21st of smart in a hackathon 2018 I
don't know what 30 and 31st you are
talking about is it March April May
whatever that is but surely Pradeep if
you want to invite me you can drop me a
mail at a page and the rainy day shotty
calm or can pick me up on my Facebook
page they show the page I would love to
do that obviously you have to manage my
travel and stay that's something you
guys will be sponsoring so make sure you
got aware of that and shortly then you
can drop me an email if the dates are
free I would love to be a part of it
okay so hit ish can you see hi to my
friend
Anil Amit hi crazy coder so crazy cooler
say is hi to annal another Amit I hope
you are doing good and keep Rocking
okay please come to Delhi waiting for
you hey uh I don't have any flights from
Delhi as of now because I don't know why
but this year all of my flights are
routing either from Mumbai or from
Bangalore so pharoah's say is greeting
from Amsterdam ah if I would be
Amsterdam like I would probably be in
May in absalom I would be giving
definitely a post on my Facebook so we
can surely meet there
lovely place I love the absolute cycling
in Amsterdam is like everybody should do
that so let's pick up a few more
questions hi - meetup at Bangalore we
recently had a meet-up in vit which is
like knee empire to Bangalore probably
if I'll give some invite in some college
I'll make a big scale beat up there as
well
okay so how to use firebase with node
just this module in the GS the exact
same for the web the JavaScript one can
be used with the node as well so you can
do that I haven't personally done that
because with the node I usually prefer
MongoDB or something when you're having
a space to install node why to rely on
anybody else database to just have it
like I would prefer a more good easier
than they would personally so I am an
easy student I am also an easy I was
also a easy student interested in
programming how can I do masters and CS
most of the colleges do accept you in
the CS department if you are coming from
electronics I didn't face any problem in
getting my masters so obviously you can
do that so let's make up no js' or
Django both are amazing start with
Django it's easier that's only the
region in save the smiley high score ah
by a sustainable it was like 50 or
something let me also mention okay there
is a question from Shiva Shiva thei jesh
were already sorry for butchering your
name mr. Reddy I hope you don't mind
that means that for website for college
project like Research Forum there I
should be able to manage files like PDF
and dot what's your suggestion if you
want to go for something like that and
it depends on what amount of PDF you
have firebase can be easier option but
if you have a lot of things to upload
like PDFs and dots you're saying you can
use the free tier of firebase they give
you some amount of storage as well but I
would recommend you to just use
something like Dropbox or Google Drive
and use their idea to have PDFs and Docs
and apart from that for rest of the
queries and forum you can go for the
easier way if you want to go with the
completely obviously means type and
everything rapid I oh I think you are
aware of it if not go in search for
rapid dot IO that's really an amazing
service there's also an online version
of post
if you want to go with that but I think
just a stock website where you can have
Research Forum or something
WordPress also can be a good solution
for you so I hope this answers your
question I think what place can be a
better solution for you but if you want
to go for that I'll check out rapid i/o
as well okay I see a robotics expert
okay so it's really going fast sunshine
I don't know how it goes like really
really rapidly if they shouldn't release
an app with a firestorm Peter I think
you're talking about five stores yes you
can but keep an intact keep in mind that
the more queries you'll be firing it can
generate good amount of bill per year so
make sure you're aware of it there's a
question good question about nickel your
thoughts on future of scholar language
in India honestly let's be honest here I
haven't worked on scholar like any time
in my whole life if I can remember that
correctly so but yes I do have couple of
friends who are still working on Scala
and recently the trend is actually going
a little bit higher but if you are just
starting from the scratch and trying to
move into Scala there are better option
this doesn't mean something Scala is bad
but personally since I don't have much
experience in that I am just telling you
everything about based on what I talk
with my friends this trend is going a
little bit up but not much so Scala is
not kind of a walking as compared to
like we are needed over machine learning
or even a PM or selenium these kind of
testing framework are much better so I
hope you get that
you
if you have something a PHP why don't
you use any kind of rock-solid database
which for which you don't even have to
pay much so not a really good idea well
this is tell me how to become full
Android developer go ahead visit courses
not learn code online dot n there's a
full-fledged course very portable in
just a price of a t-shirt and you can
just that any machine learning curves
are coming on lco as you know I don't
reveal what's coming up on LSU as in
advance but yes there are gonna be a lot
of good news and upcoming months but as
you know I don't ever ever ever reveal
what kind of course is coming up or what
I am working right now because there are
personal rules on that I hope you don't
mind that so I cannot answer this one
yeah can you come in my college as a
guest lecturer yes surely if your
college can invite me I can surely come
obviously you have to manage my travel
expenses I would prefer to just come and
go in the same day because when I leave
my office it's a lot of expenses that I
personally have to manage because it's
loss of my work but surely I can visit
no problem
which stream to choose other than web
development there are a lot of streams
you can go for a UI UX design app
development testing with selenium appium
you can go for networking you can go for
pen testing you can go for your Linux
administrator Red Hat and all these
stuffs endless possibilities web
development is just one and then there
are like front-end and back-end in web
also so possibilities are endless it
depends which one is suiting you so go
ahead check that out of linux
administration go for cisco go for UI UX
which is walking by the way go for
machine learning ai possibilities are
endless so it's not like just maybe
there okay react or view is angularjs
losing its demand no not at all it's not
like I don't like angular so it's losing
its demand it's not angular is still
having a lot of demand
but yeah instead of react like in react
and view I would be personally going for
react because it's like he obviously you
make components and be use and react all
of them but Jax is little bit better
scikit-learn versus tensor flow for
machine learning both you cannot survive
without both of them scikit-learn is the
first one it should be the first one so
go for that Research Forum for PhD
scholar and student full-fledge it
website better than WordPress like what
technology should I use to create this
website okay for PhD scholars the first
good thing is you won't be getting much
of the traffic sort or worry about that
because there are very few scholars and
PhD I remember it when I was doing this
stuff in NS three first of all thank you
so much for the super chat mr.reddy the
first thing is you won't be getting much
traffic so don't worry about that if you
want to create a like full-fledged blog
or kind of a forum for that but I would
recommend you is go for MongoDB as a
database because I think since you say
that better than WordPress you don't
want to buy anything you want to build
everything from scratch I would be
saying that as the database use MongoDB
because in case in the future you want
do anything more there are like objects
you can create them so that would be
good you can either go for react or
angular if you already have JavaScript
knowledge go for like something known as
react that would be better for you and
have that so and if you want if you have
like really good budget I would highly
recommend to go on AWS Amazon Web
Services absolutely you're gonna be
walking there there will be no problems
your problems at all
managing all the vulnerabilities and all
these things could be cycling completely
if you just configure it correctly so go
for Amazon Web Services and I recommend
to choose the react stack because in the
future you can use your own react code
in react native and future you can
release your apps on Android and iOS
with almost same code so I would
recommend go for react and plug it in
the database something like Mongo all
MySQL as well if you wish to I had
Mongo so go for with that I think
choosing reacted Mongo
that's in that resolve a problem and
then we can have like components and
components and components like creating
and obviously you would be giving like
logins and stuff as well so that would
be really super easy use any kind of
like plugins or something like that so I
would highly recommend that
so we act with bongos would be really
good
okay so MN will command will say is
thank you so much for the super chat
thanks mate from Sydney for motivation I
am 33 learning C from your online forum
the scratch what should be my next
target to become a programmer brief
pathway please okay let's pick up a
couple of pathways for you now you are
already learning C that means you are
not aware about the syntax or the words
when I say variable loops function this
doesn't scale that's that's there's like
basic we have setup now there are a
couple of spots in front of you the one
path goes for the web development side
in that you can take up my complete
front-end developer course and you will
be able to make any front-end on the
website just anybody if just say this is
the website you'll be able to replicate
that and you will be able to code that
after that you can go for Django so
you'll be able to design database and
linking it with them with the persistent
storage so that's one path complete
front-end developer and Django there is
another path which also goes with
complete front-end development and Rehab
GEOSS and react native this part will
allow you to go obviously complete
front-end development is necessary and
then you can move on and go for back-end
using react so there is a full-fledged
website full stack and with react native
you'll be able to design iOS and Android
app as well so that's one part there's
another path there are all things in the
in the programming world another path is
to learn Java after C you don't
necessarily need to learn there but
after that you can learn Java you can go
either in Android development or
that's like pure native Android
development and also Java has like a lot
of programming opportunities still so
that's your one path and also you can
now go for Python after the C once you
complete that and you're aware about
loops and function it would be really
easier for you to switch into Python and
after PI them you can go for very hot
and trending topic like machine learning
and AI as well I hope this answers your
question is probably not you can rewind
this light shed on 257 minute and can
just be watch that again so thank you so
much 23 years not at all
I really big 8 you are completely okay I
have trained people who were like 43 and
they are still rocking quite well into
the web development thing so I would
really love to see what you are building
up with the next course that you are
taking so hit me up on my Facebook page
I would love to see what you are
building up and keep going so let's pick
up more question meet up at butch catch
how to make professional PBT I don't
make them I use online versions of that
know like last time yes I miss like two
lives before this and the reason was I
was traveling I was in the flight both
the time this time so that's my life
sorry about that sorry I wanted to go
live but you know the connections at the
airport and how much disturbance they
have didn't have that okay so I think we
have spent almost an hour and my code is
still making I was in the middle of
writing some code for upcoming projects
that you all of you are gonna be seen on
to a very psychic note go to learn code
online dot in there are a few games
available for you one of them is ninja
and another one is same as smiley so go
ahead you can also play them and give me
feedback that how these at games are on
my Facebook page
join me about Instagram as well at hit
h-01 for one it's awesome at Instagram
as well and still on Facebook Facebook
I'll be working I hope all of you are
working regardless you like my curves or
not you can visit on the learn code
online dot in courses usually if you
don't like them the target is to learn
so wherever you want to learn whatever
the sources or books our courses are
make sure you do buy them you learn them
that's the most important part of this
channel keep on going keep on learning
hit that like button smash that
subscribe button as well and bye bye
goodnight ciao keep rockin guys keep
coding let's end this ice cream thanks
you
good night good night guys let's end the
stream keep coding and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
