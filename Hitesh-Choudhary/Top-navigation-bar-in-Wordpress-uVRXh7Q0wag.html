with another video let's continue our
WordPress series further and today we're
gonna talk about this top navigation bar
a very less used feature but it's
amazing once you get in habit of using
this particular top navigation bar your
life is gonna become much more easier
and much more awesome I would say this
is the most under seen feature of the
WordPress but trust me in this video I'm
gonna make sure that you understand how
powerful this feature is now let's just
go ahead and before we move further let
me just move on and show you this and if
you'll just click on this LC o or
whatever your website name is and you're
gonna hit visit website you are gonna be
taken onto the front-end part of the
website now we have chosen just the
default theme the 2015 theme it looks
decent because the image is good but as
soon as you go at the bottom side this
doesn't look much amazing and you might
be thinking hey my WordPress website is
not looking that awesome now this is a
quick misconception that you have to
clear it out whenever you are going to
install anything or you're gonna put any
images or context or whatever you are
just looking on to that it will not look
good by default so you have to tweak out
a little bit in whatever the theme
you're using if you can tweak out from
the code perspective it's gonna be much
more awesome but no need to go and worry
about much of the code stuff we're gonna
do a manual manipulation in the colors
and everything here now with this I
would also like to mention that if you
want to make your website look amazingly
beautiful then images do play a big role
yes CSS is important but I mean images
always play the biggest role there now
in this particular series as we'll be
progressing further I will recommend you
a couple of resources where you can just
create beautiful and amazing images so
simply so quickly without learning about
Photoshop or any other software it's
just online stuff very quick and amazing
if you're watching this channel of
course you deserve that your website
looks amazingly beautiful rest of that
will come up later on right now just
onto a quick example this all blog is
just basic theme this is the most basic
theme I could have ever
on the on the WordPress site but it
looks beautiful and I think you can
agree on that this is all looking
beautiful because the images are
amazingly designed so make sure when
I'll be recommending you the images
software's and everything you always
upload images after editing not before
that okay so let's just go ahead and
talk about this first of all we're gonna
go back on to this part so this top
navigation bar is super important and
play a little bit to roll into your life
as well as you'll be progressing first
of all as you click on the WordPress
there is nothing much interesting on it
it's just about wordpress.org some
documentation in case you want to design
some themes or plugins nothing much
important for us the home button is
actually a transformable an entire bar
will change based on the context on
which page you are what has the bottom
display and everything if you'll click
on the visit website it will take you
onto the front-end part and same many
changes back and takes you directly to
the dashboard to the themes widget areas
and menus and this is super simple
because let's just say you want to
directly go into the theme section you
can directly navigate and just change
the theme I think this is a really
really handy feature now the next one is
this guy that says refresh I can and
everything this is for the updates if
your website will be showing any update
it will come otherwise it will go
automatically off and the next one is to
moderate the comments right now we don't
have any comments and therefore it is
not there the next one is super
important you can directly create a post
media page or user from this icon now
let me show you how quickly that is let
us say you are on two front end of the
website now let's just say you want to
create a new user on your website later
on we have a full section dedicated
about what users can do and what type of
user you can have first what you're
gonna do in the regular case you're
gonna go into your dashboard okay then
you're gonna go into users and then you
can click on the add new user and from
here you can make any new user now what
you can do if you are in a habit of
using this navigation bar just rectly
click on the new and you're gonna click
on the users and there you go saving
click efficiency is a
in development or encoding so make sure
you are in the habit of using this
navbar okay and just onto a side note
again as you will be progressing into
the course we will be uploading more
plugins and sometimes based on the
plugins new features are also available
on the top menu bar or nav bar now on
the right hand side you'll see that it
says howdy hit H our very very signature
greetings by the WordPress and this I
can might not be appearing on your case
now this is this is going to appear from
a website known as Gravatar and Gravatar
there we go and you have to create an
account and just upload a photo
WordPress automatically links up your
email wherever your email is gonna be
used this Gravatar will be always gonna
be there create like five wordpress
website with the same email your
Gravatar will automatically being
important there very simple nothing tuff
just sign-in using WordPress and just
upload your photos nothing no big deal
there there we go so this is the basic
one and again of course you can edit
your profile in case you are looking for
that
like I user name your first name last
name basic stuff you already are aware
of that and this is the email which is
responsible for bringing your Gravatar
here and this is simply cool and it also
says it here you can change your
pictures using Gravatar or can generate
password or can log out from every
session so this is the basic overview of
how the navbar appears now also finally
I want to make sure that you get one
more update about this top navbar which
a lot of people miss so let's just say
we are looking forward this and this is
a hello world post automatically
generated let me click on this so you
think that this is a great post and you
I might want to edit this post now
notice the contextual top menu bar is
directly here with a button that says
edit post again I can click click on
here and I can just directly edit this
post for example I will just go on to
the lorem ipsum website okay let's just
generate as some lorem ipsum and so that
it can look good a decent one we're
gonna copy this
we are gonna go in here onto our website
and we are gonna paste that directly
there we go lorem ipsum we are gonna
update from the right-hand menu bar and
that's it we are gonna go directly onto
the view post now I am in a habit of
going back and forth from the navigation
bar but you can also hit the preview
changes and can directly go there I like
to just pick this menu bar and notice
directly now in case you are not aware
and not familiar in using this top menu
bar what you would have done in that
case go to lco directly go to the
dashboard then go to your posts click on
the all post and maybe you have like
hundreds of posts then you have to
search on to three it scroll through it
and then just have to edit it I find
this completely completely useless I
always go on to the front of my website
with this navigation bar always on and
whenever I see a blog post that needs a
little bit additive I just click on here
and saves a time seems a little bit
seconds of my life that's amazing so we
will be working on these such features
and also in the upcoming features
upcoming videos we are gonna learn how
we can create these posts what our post
pages difference between them and a lot
of such thing ok so I hope you have
