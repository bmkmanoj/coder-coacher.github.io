training in this video we're gonna talk
about two things and some of you might
behave you're just going step by step we
want to talk about one thing at a time
you told us earlier but again
trust me working on these two character
sets is actually far more easier if
you'll understand them all together in
this one lecture these are known as
character sets and range and again they
will make much more sense as I will
progress and will show you directly
instead of giving you theory about that
okay so let's just say we do have a
character which says a road here and
then we have a code here okay so you
want to match them here but again you
know what the problem is the first
letter can either be a R or can be a C
so we haven't seen anything like that we
have just gone through with something
like dot and then simply say code
so our OD e in this case and they
obviously are gonna match but you know
what I want to match either code or Road
but I don't want to match something like
do de something like that so I don't
want to match this do de now here we're
gonna learn about something known as
character sets and then I'll talk about
the range in a minute so just bear with
me so these character sets are actually
being denoted by these square brackets
make sure they always come in pair and
this is one one T half now the one very
very very important thing about these
character sets is whatever you're gonna
write inside them it's always either one
of them or either other one of them like
for example if I just say R and I put a
C here notice right now it's matching
both of them but they are two different
matches notice we do have a global being
turned on so it's gonna match it here so
I'm gonna turn it back on and we'll try
to explain a little bit more in detail
it's very important here now what does
this character set simply means I'm
gonna match a character and I'm not
looking for this will make much more
things understandable if I just say RC o
ody II notice it's not matching the
entire world rco de it says I'm going to
choose only one character out of that
bracket it can be either R or it can be
C notice very important concept here the
square thing which is known as character
set says you can put as many character
inside me as you wish but what I mean is
this part here totally along with the
bracket means one entity it can be just
one literal character it can be either R
or C since you have written one of them
but you can put more of them like I want
to match like do de so you can put a D
here as well now it's gonna match that
but again do take care this is a very
serious stuff a lot of big never make
that mistake they see they simply assume
that it's gonna match our CD and if
there is like are indeed so I'm so gonna
match that no it's not gonna match that
it only picks up one word out of our C
and D so this is known as your character
and this is really powerful
you're gonna look forward for a variety
of such things as we move forward here
I'll present a couple of more examples
of this as we progress but right now
just to understand that it is here so
you can put up something like you are
looking for something like it's very
common to have such things here so let's
just say you have some similar words and
what are these let's just say this is a
wat and this is a wait some words I know
these doesn't make sense but let's say
you want to match any both of them here
so how you're gonna write a simple
pattern for this so obviously we know W
H is gonna be there for a moment let's
just keep a dot here and T but obviously
the dot here doesn't make sense because
we are not looking for WH ot if that is
here so for example if something is here
I like WH ot I don't want to include
that whe ot so obviously in here I would
just change this immediately with a
square bracket here character said and
I'm looking for either a match if it is
having a also match if it is having a e
so either one of them and notice here it
is not going to match this guy because
here it says you know what I'm looking
either for WH e T or WH a T not both of
them okay okay so this is over one thing
we have learned
the character sets next we are gonna
learn about the range which is really
really powerful here okay so you know
what I just want to match something like
a ZZZ and I also want to match a this
here okay so this is really common and
this is there are hundreds of ways of
doing this stuff okay so we're gonna put
this guy and we also know that this is
always gonna be here so what we need to
put here is a and also this smaller guy
so that it can match his either from
capital letter or can be small letter
okay great but you know what I want to
match if the first word can be anything
like it can be n Z's I know this word
doesn't mean anything
but as real progress with the examples
we are gonna make some meaningful stuff
as well now I also want to say that you
know what I want to say this as well
if that makes any sense or edge and this
as well so this is really funny to have
this obviously writing such characters
for everything is not at all possible
here it comes over guy which is known as
range now range is denoted by this - and
there is a very interesting thing about
this - this - doesn't mean anything if
it is outside the character set if
you're gonna put a dash here
it just means literal - it doesn't have
a special meaning but if you're gonna
put it inside these square brackets
known as character sets it means special
thing here it simply means that I'm
gonna select anything from A to Z notice
they are in capital A to Z so this is
just selecting again important part is
it's gonna select only one word out of a
and Z a - Z so this is a range A to Z
you can also mention like lowercase a to
Z now it's looking for two characters
inside the character set uppercase a to
Z and then the second character is can
be a to Z again out of the uppercase and
lowercase there can be only one word
here okay so that's why it's going on
here okay
now since we have do have this kind of
thing I notice it's just selecting all
of that let me get rid of that for a
minute and this guy also now let's just
say we want to match something let's
just say we
have a phone number let's just say four
four four then a - four four four and a
- and five five five let's just say this
is the phone number we want to match it
how we can match it using character set
and range let me show you that now
obviously we learn better ways of doing
that as we progress but right now in
this range I'm gonna put zero to nine
here and notice it matches everything
here but let's just say I want to match
exactly this pattern so I can say the
first letter or the first character here
can be from zero to nine second also
zero to nine
third also zero to nine now notice I'm
putting a dash here then zero to nine
three characters after that all of them
are 0 to 9 and then a dash and three
here so notice we got a perfect match
for a phone number which is 4 4 4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 even don't know if that exists
but again this is a perfect match this
is not a best way of doing the things
but surely we are gonna learn on the
other interesting options
okay so ranges here are from capital a
to put a dash that is range - capital Z
or it can be from lowercase Z - a
lowercase a to Z but here's a common
mistake that everybody does the ranges
of the numbers is from 0 to 9 so it's
gonna match from 0 it's we're gonna
match 1 2 3 whatever it comes a lot of
people does this mistake that when we
have one like let me just give you a
pause a moment here let's just say I
want to match from B to Z naught e to Z
or maybe C to Z I can put C to Z okay
that's completely valid it's gonna match
not a not b but from Z to C to Z but
this doesn't work in the numeric case if
you want to match something like 50 to
99 you cannot do that okay very very
important point you cannot match from 50
to 9 it is always going to be 0 to 9 if
you're gonna put something like 20 to
maybe 25 what you are saying here is
actually match either two or match from
zero to two and either match of 5 so
completely change come
lately mind-boggling and yes the
complete meaning of this syntax is being
changed its now divided into three parts
to the second part is zero to two and
the third part is five so yes these are
some important points that we do have to
take care I know this is a little bit to
take at the very first moment but yes so
let me summarize this what we have
learned in this video first of all we
have learned about the character set
inside the character set you can put any
character that you want to find out you
can just put a B and D and the important
part here is let's just say I have a ll
oh here the important part is when you
have a character set it just looking for
one thing whatever you have put inside
it's looking for a or B or D also in
case you have put something like this a
to z and A to Z it's looking either for
an uppercase a to z or lowercase a to Z
not both again upper case lower to Z or
lowercase a to Z so this is how it works
it's gonna look for all the options here
you can put more here like for example
you can put a here and one more like
it's gonna be looking like B so now
notice here it's looking for either
capital A to Z or A to Z lowercase or
electril a or a little B okay I know
this is a very complex example but I
want you to teach in a very thorough
manner of this ok so this is our first
thing that we have learned that we do
have a character set and dashes main to
range so you can put zero to nine this
means an entire range of 0 to 9 again we
do have we are allowed to have a range
from H to Z but we have not allowed to
have a range from 22 to 25 it doesn't
work
numbers are always from 0 to 9 ok so
these are a few key words and from
gotcha points oops point as well about
the regular expression we learned about
character sets and range that's it for
this video and I'll catch you up in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
