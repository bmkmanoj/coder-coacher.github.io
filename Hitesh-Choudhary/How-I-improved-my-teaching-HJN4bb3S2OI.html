again with another video and in today's
video we're gonna talk about how to
teach like a pro now this looks like a
very simple topic and I used to just
think like that it is very simple to
teach because you know the technology
and that's all about it but I was
totally wrong and I felt it up I felt
about that I was wrong about the
teaching is so much easy after taking a
workshop and that workshop was related
to photography and I want to discuss
about these things so in my early days
you might have noticed that my content
was good my content was awesome and I
used to know a lot about technology like
Python pentesting add development and a
kind of other stuff as well but my
delivery was not up to the mark and I
just admit that that I I never thought
about it all I all I was caring about is
simply that how I know the technology
and that's about it
but I was completely wrong and I
realized it a little bit later and as
you always as yo you know this stuff
that to solve the problem the first step
is to recognize that there is one
problem that's that's the major step and
I never knew that this problem was there
and I actually now I feel that some
teacher are struggling because students
don't like them or maybe they are not
delivering the content they know a lot
of stuff and all the stuff and what is
the problem that they're facing the
first problem that they're facing is
that they are not knowing that there is
one problem that they are not delivering
the engaging content and stuff so how I
realize that so let me share it with you
that first of all around three or four
years back I was really good in
technology especially in the Python pen
testing stuff and web development and I
thought let's make some videos and all
that courses for that and I did that it
was really great
a lot of people loved my courses and
everything but I was not getting the
enough attention of the viewer and
somehow I was not happy with my courses
the technology was awesome the course
was well prepared
everything was so good about it but then
I realized that one thing that I'm
lagging around is delivering the content
in such an awesome and professional way
that I'm delivering it now and how do I
realized it recently about almost seven
or eight months back or almost a year
back I went up for a workshop so I was
getting a little bit bored I was making
a lot of content videos and some
projects from up work and freelance and
then I realized that I need to take some
hobby and I went ahead and looked up for
some workshop on the photography and you
might have noticed my content creation
making my video stuffs and everything is
growing upon because I like to challenge
myself so I went down to the workshop
for a Lightroom workshop it was awesome
and I joined in
I was completely new in that although
I'm a tech guy I know software's and
stuff it's very comfortable for me but I
went on to the Lightroom stuff and then
I thought hey why not to join a
Lightroom workshop and I thought my
photos gonna be look awesome
and I'm gonna be learning it so quickly
the moment I saw the instructor he was a
very very experienced one and he started
to deliver that and he was doing so
awesome job with all of his photos color
Corrections there are ISO adjustments
and them then the skin adjustments and
everything was so awesome and I was oh
hey that's so cool I can do that when I
opened up the Lightroom and I try to did
that that was the toughest thing I ever
him even imagined so then I thought
about hey what's wrong going on with it
he was doing it so awesomely and I am
NOT able to do it and then I suddenly
strikes it strike to my mind that hey
even my students might be feeling the
same for me developing an iOS app is so
much cool I can do it with a flow vidiq
oh it's no problem at all but when
student might be doing the same thing it
might be some trouble with that and I
need to actually rethink all the things
that I'm delivering and I'm teaching and
that is the point when I realized that
how I should teach keeping in mind that
student might be a new beginner because
still it has been almost a long time but
still I'm not getting very good in the
Lightroom and the same thing might be
happening with the people who are
learning the HTML and CSS so I thought
hey let's just flush it out all the
things and let's just start with a fresh
mind fresh concept fresh bootcamps
recarey column design and pretty much
everything and then I thought about what
are the problems their student might be
facing what are the common questions
student might be facing and how I can
deliver in such an engaging manner that
student might feel that hey all the
problems that we are going to face
they're gonna solve that and that's the
thing when I realized that how should I
deliver my content and I would like to
say a few words to all the people who
are already teacher now your teacher
that's great that's awesome but you need
to understand that you need to focus a
lot on teaching as well because teaching
itself is a different art the reason why
students love some subject in the high
school and some not is all because of
the teacher all the subjects are good
but that's all about the aura of the
teacher how the teacher is delivering
the content it's all about it believe me
it's the toughest thing knowing the
technology is pretty much easy but
delivering the technology in such an
easy and precise manner is the toughest
job in the world you can trust me on
that and after that I actually thought
that the amount of time that I'm going
to be preparing for exercise files the
curriculum design for entire course that
I will be recording I'll be focusing
equal amount on the engaging delivery as
well that's super important for me now
so I take the notes all the way along
that what are the problems that usually
not I am gonna be facing but what a big
nerd can face I look at on all the ways
all the commas that you can misinterpret
all the wrong installation that you can
do for my technical stuff and related
other things so definitely I would say
all the teachers are there that somehow
you are doing something wrong there and
that is why you are not getting that
engaging delivery it helped me a lot and
it's always good to admit the things
where you are wrong just admit that
because once you're gonna admit that
you're gonna evolve
that's the whole point here so these are
some of
a few tips to all the teachers out there
and along with the students as well that
a lot of efforts is being made in
putting the course content and
everything make sure that you always
keep in mind always I'm making sure that
I'm delivering my content in much more
engaging manner much more precise and
everything is neat clean and smooth out
there so I hope really it helped this
video really helps some of you out there
and in case you want to tag your teacher
along with this so that he can actually
learn a little bit about and in case in
the future as well I'll be posting more
videos about the teaching tips and other
as well because I think the number of a
problem that most of the people are
facing is not finding the good and the
correct teachers as well let me know in
the comments down below that what are
the subjects you loved in the high
school and was the teacher was the
reason about you loved the subject or
not so let's discuss it in the comment
down below make sure you post down your
comments there and if you liked the
video give give it a thumbs up if you
did it liked it no hard feeling I'll try
even better I'll catch you up in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
