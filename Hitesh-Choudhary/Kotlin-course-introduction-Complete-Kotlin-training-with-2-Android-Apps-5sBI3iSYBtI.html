this is the course introduction video
that will help you to figure out what
you'll be able to do by the end of this
course and how the curriculum of this
kosslyn training is designed we will not
leave you along with the Catalan we
would also like to step up the game a
little further and we'll also design two
basic app in Android completely using
Kaplan so that you can understand how
Catalan is utilized in Android as well
the entire curriculum of this Kotlin
training is designed properly after the
research so that the right amount of
knowledge is served to you at right time
so that you can grasp that the section
one of this course is really basic this
will be your first introduction and
first face-to-face with the Catalan we
will discuss what Kotlin is why it has
been introduced and you'll also know
about what all the tools that you
require to code in Catalan will also
configure our tools so that we don't
waste much further time in the later on
in the course and everything is properly
set up every language has some basics
and so does the cotton in section two
we'll be talking about all those basics
that are required for the Coughlin's
things like variables and constants
numbers and strings will be discussed
we'll also discuss how Kotlin is able to
handle the null so nicely it has been a
problem in Vedas or the languages but
Kotlin handle smells really nicely so
far in this course we have been using
the repeal which is read eval print loop
which is really good in writing quick
codes but not at all a feasible scope of
writing the code so in this section
you'll be writing your very first code
in the Kotlin file and you'll also learn
how to create files and write your code
in there
section three is all about conditionals
every programming language need
conditional we cannot just write code
with execute execute and keep on
executing we need to check some
conditions whether user has logged in or
not whether this token was missing or
was it there whether the user is trying
for looking at weather of this city or
that city so we have to make decisions
at every point of time we will learn how
the decisions are being made in the
Kotlin using if-else when and a lot of
other syntax and don't worry we have
some great exercises in this section so
that you can brush up your skills as
well section 4 is little advanced
compared to what we have done so far in
the section 4 we are going to discuss
about little bit more advanced data
types like arrays and lists but don't
worry these are pretty simple and pretty
easy to learn we are also going to talk
about loops because once you have an
array you might want to loop to an array
now don't worry in case if these terms
are little bit intimidating to you don't
worry everything will be covered in
detail we'll also learn about the
functions and how functions can be
configured and design in Kotlin and
these are the most basic steps in order
to design Android steps once you have
learned how the functions are being
designed and are being called life
becomes so much easier
in this section we'll also learn how you
can integrate java seamlessly in the
Kotlin so now we can use the power of
java as well as Kotlin and can merge
them together and create fantastic apps
section 5 is about object oriented
programming and yes you guessed it right
we are going to talk about the classes
object inheritance abstract classes and
all stuff which is very important as
very powerful now not only those
examples I'll walk you through that
sometime it's always good to restrict
our options as well I have a very good
example of an airline system where some
time it's good to reserve an option that
only three types of seats are available
for the user to pick up now how we can
do that you
the nm is discussed quite a lot in
detail in this section this is one of
the fantastic section of this course and
I really really think that you are going
to enjoy the most in this section by now
you will be able to fully comfortable
and think a lot in the cart and
designing functions designing classes
making objects from them and you'll be
quite a lot of comfortable with the
Coughlin's but now I want you to take
one step further and want you to
understand that how the Kaplan is
integrated with the Android will be
designing to basics app basic apps in
the Android
although these apps are not at all
advanced I want to make a disclaimer
there where these are good enough
advanced enough to understand that how
Kotlin can be integrated how the
functions are called how the things like
on when you click on a button or tap on
a button in the Android how functions
are being called how you can identify
anything unique on your mobile devices
like button or text view or text fee so
these are going to be pretty fun
exercise and by this by the end of this
section you will have two apps video so
this was just a brief overview of what
is about to come in this course I hope
you are really excited for this course
as I am really excited I hope I'll be
able to serve you properly with the
Kotlin and you'll you'll face no problem
at all but in case you find any problem
mention them in the Q&amp;amp;A section and we
can discuss that so let's get started
