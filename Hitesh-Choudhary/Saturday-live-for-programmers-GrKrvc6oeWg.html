without a video and I hope that
everybody is here and we are waiting for
people to show up and just to have a
chitchat with you guys so hey you know
hit a call maggot how are you hey Kunal
Monica how are you so we're gonna wait
for a few minutes and let me also in the
meantime post on my facebook as well so
life is happening so girl and I guess I
said I'm confused about web hosting and
domain setup and putting on life stuff
how to learn deployment stuff deployment
is actually pretty easy I don't know why
you're a little bit confused with that
it's fairly easy so we're going to wait
for some time so that people can show up
it's Saturday we always do Saturday life
whenever I'm at the office we do several
I so it depends on where you want to
load your stuff like it's just a cPanel
or databases
the tricky yes there is a whole
different setup that you have to learn
if you are moving on to AWS or hello
kuso yes that is the complex part but if
you just want to go ahead and just want
to float it on to any cPanel for Cody or
big rock or Bluehost or host get er it's
ridiculously simple so let's pick up
more question and just for an update we
have rolled out an amazing course on
machine learning at level online it is
right now in an early-bird face and is
going to remain in ugly bird face till
we are gonna hit 100 users into the
course so it's only available for 100
users go ahead check that out at some
massive course and still I'm putting up
a lot of content in that so go ahead
check that out
it's amazing codes at least check out
some of the free preview videos and
decide it on your own so let's pick up
more question
Galarraga says I want to use Furyk ooh
yes here oh cool I think
I'm not gonna say super easy it is stuff
for big nerds but not much it's just a
steep learning curve once you cross that
then it's completely okay yeah YouTube
does allocation and I don't know why
people are showing up probably YouTube
is not sending any notification today I
don't know what's the reason I guess
machine learning new course heading up
more courses that are affordable and
less extremely high quality so my focus
is not shifting towards learning online
as compared to other clients and surely
you're going to learn that a lot so what
do you think about Indian engineering
colleges hey guys if you're out here you
can share this that yes I'm like you can
hit that like button as well probably
YouTube hasn't sent any notification
today and that's why we are having
pretty much low ground
the viewers anyways it's all good so
yeah it can be can we make full-fledged
full features happen react native yes of
course you can there is no issue in fact
some of our trends are running totally
on react native the good part about the
react medium is that you can include
things like MongoDB maybe MySQL maybe
firebase anything with that and that's
make a full pledge adapt and especially
the context API oh that's a lifesaver
now in case you're not aware of that
very soon put up a video on context API
and the react need in the context API is
amazing and it will reduce down a lot of
work because you don't have to use
reducers and all these things from very
small cases so it's good ok so let's
pick up I think video quality is too low
you can pump the video quality but I
think that setting button and
unfortunately that light usually goes on
YouTube in 720p only it's not HD but
this is what we are having as of now ok
ok what can we are using I am using a
webcam logitech webcam that's what I'm
using so
ranjit says family with little or no I
don't code much into that in fact I
don't get much of the clients in that
song
I'm not aware of it okay so let's pick
up more questions I am making to-do app
for learning nodejs that's amazing
let's look like for that I thought
should must is hi sir I'm a really big
fan I think soon as this makes me really
feel happy that so many people care
about me it's all of anything experience
YouTube is like amazing amazing my
facebook as well so that some people can
really show up there
so wait for a second till the meantime I
can post on my facebook that yes I am
live it's Saturday and there we go looks
like a slow internet connection
I am live my youtube channel let's pick
up a link youtube.com slash today I
cubed
let's hit publish okay so hopefully
Facebook will send notification and it
says video quality is very poor I don't
know why isn't that the case actually
this time I'm using the direct inbuilt
feature inbuilt feature of this YouTube
in a Chrome browser so probably that
might be one of the reason usually I do
live from open broadcast software that's
actually much more better so I think
that might be one of the reason for that
Amal model from scratch or tensorflow
group identify I don't need to do
everything from the scratch tensorflow
has everything probably made up eg AHA
says I want to change my email please
let me know how to do that we don't
support changing of it because that's
the base of taking the individual users
that's the main idea are using so why
people are complaining about my video
quality is prove it
let me check it from a mobile phone
probably I can check it from another
let's check why the video quality is so
low there we go let's check it out why
the video quality is so poor it's
usually it usually doesn't
happen okay so it usually doesn't okay
yeah it is poor and okay you can bump
that up to 1080p hit that your settings
icon you can bump the quality right now
as a default it's streaming into just
360p as a default I don't know why but
you can bump the settings into 1080p and
then it's gonna roll out a lot so going
back onto some of your questions
what is SVM SVM is simple vector machine
and it's a topic in machine learning
technically there are a lot of
mathematical mathematic terms in more
like a support vector and stuff I
recently rolled out the complete SVM
tutorials section in my machine learning
so you definitely want to check it out
if you're interested in SVM lets him
that I talked in there was a classifier
not the SVM regressor so
it's a hey bitch how are you hey Alan
I'm good how are you doing sir you're
great t-shirt secret I'll probably keep
that for a white stone so that we can
hit that and then we can talk about it I
think a bit of college for a mobile app
they're only India or outside there is
no specific college which is gonna teach
you like in four years we're gonna just
trainee on mobile apps no it doesn't
happen you have to learn these things on
your own usually what are your thoughts
on graph QL and rest the graphical is
growing yet it will grow quite a lot
because now we have to answer a lot of
questions that the default and MySQL can
not answer but it's not it's very
specific use case scenario as of now but
I'm pretty sure it's gonna grow in
future but now I think graph SQL is
something which you should be in touch
Goodreads say so how does how do you get
started in freelancing no mean stack for
the six project um and Android three to
five projects with firebase freelancing
is all a game of how good you can
understand the project needs and what is
your portfolio so it's it's not there is
a precise recipe that anybody can give
you have to spend a lot of time in
bidding and talking to the client and
all that so yeah it's not a game where
you can have when will be the
programming myth video be out eagerly
waiting that's actually an interesting
question that I can make a video about
programming myth now that's an
interesting tower best no SQL DB there's
no such thing as best or worst it's
usually they use case scenario a new
technology that's working out in market
like MongoDB or Postgres
all them are amazing we can find the
property for that and where you can have
looking good resources that's the case
networking versus programming I'm not
much of a networking guy and most of a
programming guy I like the program stuff
so I usually go from that
okay so let's pick up on question the
video is tagging but you might be
lagging at your side because here I can
see the stream is pretty good although
there's no option to check out if my
stream is good a lot hey youtube come on
my previously broadcast software was
much better than this and probably I'll
be using that only so I have absolutely
no idea how to check out anything in it
as a matter of fact I uh this is the
second time I'm trying to use this
inbuilt chrome feasible life and the
prank was quite good yeah that prank
okay let's talk a little bit about hey
how many of you liked the thing which I
did on the YouTube about the artificial
intelligence for making Android app so
let me know him in the comment section
the hey guys did you liked it or not it
was a little bit me being a youtuber
versus developer your view or make a
video on it the booth thing because you
cannot be just a youtuber I don't know
how people do that because usually when
people somebody's on the YouTube he's on
YouTube to show something probably
that's a video making skills photography
programming or probably's daily life is
interesting he's a biker he has a lot of
stories to share it's not like this you
can be youtuber without having any skill
you come onto YouTube to present
something to show something it's a
straight it's an open stage where you
can just say whatever you like to say so
definitely I would say that it's
something that I love it okay how do you
become mobile forensic expert go ahead
check out fill polls trust work it's
amazing book it will help you to become
it's not just a mobile forensics it's a
wide range but again fill polls fries
for the guy who nails down when it comes
to mobile forensics it's a great car so
okay so a lot of people like the prank
on this thank you so much for
appreciating that and taking that in a
light way because you know now it is
if you do any kind of fun stuff or
comedy stuff people sometimes take it
really in a bad sense I'm really happy
that I have good community that
supported it to any well okay so loved
your prank thank you so much but is the
future of Python it's amazing you know
it's growing quite a lot especially with
machine learning and everything is
screwing with Python now you can build
up your websites your Django so yes it's
going quite a lot and okay now now the
questions are actually in a limited time
so I can read a lot of them yeah based
facial recognition algorithm actually
honestly I was just reading about that
on the tensorflow about the mechanism
and how we can treat down there Gotham
solve that so yes I am also reading a
little bit about that tensorflow is
really great resource if you want to
read more about it I was just doing that
so I haven't much idea about it which is
the best one and without even the
features on which on basis of that I
should be comparing them I was just
reading about that before studying this
life what is tensorflow my dear friend
tensorflow is something which you learn
after you learn machine learning basics
and data science once you master
things like numpy is panda Seabourn and
couple of libraries like a linear
regression and all that in machine
learning
after that you learn all of that so so
just some magazines for latest news
honestly I have stopped reading all the
magazines like probably years I haven't
read a single magazine everything is
online so you can either just subscribe
for an online magazine or things like
that so reading the blogs a lot of blogs
are there from officially from sue F
from Google from Facebook so a lot of
news updates comes just right there and
I'll have to read so that makes me
updated learning paths for machine
learning hey Gabby shake I think I have
already created a proper and a very very
amazing path for bigness for machine
learning highly recommend to check out
machine learning course at learn code
online it's really a precise path to
after completing that course you will be
able
into any algorithm specific and cracking
the internship for a machine learning
would be a piece of cake after
completing this course you will be
almost ready to get hired as its unit of
the / of course you you will need a
little bit of your own research work and
reading things whatever the topic I'm
touching around but after that I think
you should be completely ready to heart
get hired as the junior data analysts
and something like that so so new AI is
amazing I am making terms of a show
everyone I would love to check out a few
of them send me an email or on the
facebook facebook is actually better way
so send me a link to some of them on the
Facebook I would definitely love to
check them out it's always fun to see
what others are creating and have a look
on them how to build a music streaming
app like seven music streaming apps it's
it's long topic I cannot discuss that on
it's simple just a half an hour life yes
you do require a lot of multi-threading
x' and all of that C++ is really boring
a lot to learn
no it's not boring it's it's one of the
programming language that got me at
Amazon I enjoyed that it's it's fun it's
much more better than C I would say that
your t-shirt look very cool thank you so
much I like my t-shirts I like them a
lot I hear them in every single day
every single video so I love them okay
okay so what should add 2017 CSD
graduate do to get a job development or
comedy programming I never just see DSL
go well I think explore a little bit
more languages first of all it's not
just you are gonna nail it down just
with the help of C of course it's a good
language but explore a little bit more
you are you are not peeking out the
boundaries so go ahead climb that
boundary since I look around them there
are lot of good languages like Python
and just having a knowledge of TS and
algorithm is not going to get you
anywhere
surely it's helpful when it's not just
every
okay Swapnil thank you so much for super
chat and do you know any Android
competition coding platform hub I would
be a little bit tricky here Google Play
Store Android competition is something
which is open and market like just to
give you an example just like YouTube
YouTube is an open competition if you
know your camera stuff if you know how
to be presentable and how to track the
crowd and everything you are good to go
everybody's going to like you similarly
on an android competition your Google
Play Store is the place where you might
want to do competition create an app
create a feature that you think is is
something both competing and just upload
it and share it with your friends an
online world is really brutal it's going
to clearly tell you whether you are good
in it or not and that's why we do
competition we need to learn about how
good we are inside in technology or not
that's really cool your views on on 2034
delivers I think they're talking about
year 2030 it would be really really
exciting I see yes of course I see but
2020 is gonna be really far away I can
see a lot of progress can is going to be
done in the field of having a single
code base for everything I think that's
where we are moving as the developers of
course the thin machine learning AI
probably not change technology is gonna
is gonna blow out quite a lot Belle but
again it's not like them the person
gonna be like anywhere not at all but
yes hey which will thank you so much for
the super chat thank you so much for
your support
hi this can you give an idea about
opportunities in IT industry except of
the purse plenty plenty of them Network
guy is needed your hardware guys and
Mina your testers are needed on design
UI UX these are like few of them then
there is a pen testers there are regular
testers using cell
so it's a huge combination until now
unless you have like a big team you
cannot build up a big product sometimes
people does but most of the time it's
all about stuff like that so yeah it's
it's girls like that electronics guy to
see yes yes I am one of them so it's it
is possible linear regression I have
talked a lot about the linear regression
and even the mathematics part of it then
the theory part of it that the coding
part and implementation of it onto a
very huge data set bear in my machine
learning cooks so go ahead I highly
recommend to take advantage of the
earlybird deal that we are running as of
now there is a man standing behind you
okay hey man if you are standing behind
me and Ross says do you remember me yes
that's why I'm picking up every single
time what you are saying I didn't
everybody okay okay so what do you think
about JavaScript it's still good it's
still amazing and I really like I don't
like much of the JavaScript part I like
the es6 which is the advanced version of
javascript almost I like that part
because a lot of things which were
confusing in JavaScript are fixed using
es6 version and that's why it has been
used in node.js reactive you angular
pretty much em again
you got me happy a beautiful day huh
thank you so much I hope you like that
it was pretty fun it was really fun
to even make it it was so hard to
control the smile I smile throughout the
video it's so fun a lot of people
approached me some of my friends and
developers actually a couple of my
friends our developer needs they send
this that hey we are having a new update
and make their entire team to watch this
video I had a good laugh at office it
was good it was good fun sir is it April
Fool or is it like a fool is I make a
lot of people are confusing about go
ahead watch my I have watch my channel I
have a video
artificial intelligence can make Android
out so it's there it is rupees 2000 the
discounted price of course yes of course
it is discounted price it's an exclusive
course and it's very more work than what
you're paying obviously we will be
rolling out some of the offline boot
camps through the course and the pricing
are going to be like we are planning it
to be around 25,000 so it's much more
advantageous to learn online okay so can
you come to a small level conference
held in a small Institute in beacon in
Vivek I would love to come to pickle a
because the food is awesome there but
it's really hot there and recently I
faced some of the health issues because
I traveled to a nearby college and it
was extremely hot so I got dehydrated
have to rest for a whole day almost so
during extreme hot time I like to avoid
as much of the travel but surely we can
see what we can do and surely you can
mail me and we can see that the wrong is
it okay where is it
am i late where the f-word notification
of YouTube today YouTube didn't send out
any notification to anybody and that's
why we are having limited audience here
but that's a good thing the number is
never was a big thing for me because I
always look for the people who are much
more interested in the tech compared to
a huge crowd because even though they
are limited in numbers but they makes
much more sense ask meaningful question
which I love personally so it's not
about nobody I you to really bad that
you didn't set out notification today
and all those guys we're watching here
till now go ahead hit that like button
the light count is very low here so you
can bump down a little bit
I still cannot see come on guys hit that
like button okay so which will charity
says Java and very ui/ux for a job after
BCA without MC yes you can obviously get
a job it just PCA you don't need a
degree for that but the question here is
Java versus web uie expert
now Java is obviously a vast technology
and these are completely two different
thing and you really need to make up
your mind where you really want to go
because with the UI in the UX you
learned a lot of concepts first the lot
of tools like sketch Adobe XD maybe
Photoshop maybe Illustrator to present
your designs and on the other hand Java
is actually totally a programming based
so your question is really really apart
there's one side going up here one side
going up here so first make up your mind
where you really want to go it's it
should not be something like Java makes
more money or UI makes more money it
should not be never like that because
you'll be staying throughout your life
with that one technology whatever you
are going to be choosing up so yeah make
sure you make up your mind
hey where it is how are you how's the
project going on LC your versus your
youtube income you do is income is still
smaller very teeny tiny part as compared
to lco and in fact it is not even
comparable to any one project that we
are doing in any given month well it's
all fun so income is not about a big
issue I am good here coming with another
big project I am email I'll email you
soon I'll be waiting for that mr. Vegas
looking forward your previous video is
really pretty hit we checked out on that
typing thing you know and I would be
really happy to feature another of your
project it you can mail me Shirley
College for only mobile app development
engineer or sir I already answered that
buddy you like a website or LC you
obviously LC you it's it's something
which is very close and I can control a
lot of things here so give you a mobile
number yeah sure write that 9 8 9 8 9 8
9 8 9 8 9 8 0 0 so you come on why do
you need my mobile phone when I'm just
in front of you thanks a lot you're
awesome
thank you so much data science data
science a question mark what is the
question in that
you watch Saroj synopsis a good guy I
see some of his video
I like his hairstyle he makes really
good videos so definitely isn't worth
watching channel sir can I use other
website code can copyright and comment
please answer I cannot it's just late
upper hull thank you so much for the
super chat
I really appreciate that hello should I
move to react native from Android for
future security
no Android native is not going anywhere
I don't say that at all but for the
client perspective if you want to serve
more client then obviously react native
something like that serves a better
business decision so that's why we
actually moved in a house on to react
native Bishop says thanks for coming to
be ID I absolutely enjoyed the vit the
team was awesome so much fun there I
would really like to come back any given
thing even if I'm busy I would
definitely take some time and come back
to that College especially the teammates
and the dev space guys actually had to
take me quite a lot it was always thank
you so much Rohan can take her I guess
you're from Mumbai because one of my
friend is also from home by having the
same setting so thank you so much for
this supergiant I really appreciate that
how did this is bro I need a suggestion
what suggestion you mean I'm all here to
give suggestions here thank you so much
sitting for super chat I really
appreciate that thank you so much
shout out my name Mahindra your friend
okay that's nice me rapper hop says
thank you so much for supercharged says
Python is help to learn Java and
JavaScript I would say that any language
you learned is going to help you to
learn other language it's not just
Python or C once you understand the
basics and we have created like a couple
of projects in any given language
whether that's Python Java or JavaScript
whatever
as you're starting with any of them it's
surely going to help you to understand
other language as well so make sure you
learn anything for us don't just go like
hey I should be very picky about just
pick a language and go with it obviously
you can switch later on but the concepts
that you're gonna learn in Python are
surely gonna helpful in any language
move into PHP Java because it's all
about understanding of programming hey
tell me which question which you made
you happy only tech question it's not
about just one question I love to answer
all of them it's it's equally good I see
something weird on LC oh okay let me
just check if what are you talking about
it's working fine here and yeah let me
check that him cognitive over it's
working fine yep everything is all good
yeah it's it's all good I don't think so
anything there is an issue and probably
I can run a few tests as well but as of
now I can see everything is going good
at learned code online no problem at all
and let's just check out yeah internally
also it looks all good thank you so much
Rahul for the super chat I really
appreciate that April Fool I like that I
like that thank you thank you
I like that prank it was well made man
mate I appreciate that because you know
this is the thing which I love about the
tech community you made a fool out of me
I made a little bit for trying to do
that and it was harmless no nobody was
hurt
it was just a nice Apple food that you
made it on me and I tried a little bit
on you as well that's what I love about
the programming community we are never
harmful to anybody we don't like to say
like me
bad curse words we just like to be
friendly about anything and we always
care about other people and it gave me a
big smile when he even made me a fool so
this is the thing I love about the
committee such as things is how to learn
ml machine lenny visit learn code online
dot in and we have rolled out a new
course so yeah why choose dot in domain
instead of dot-com domain for l co
dot-com domain was not available and I
love the name learn code online I think
I don't have to use even as any tagline
with that so I think learn code online
was the perfect name I could have that
it would be available on anything else I
would have cared at but I didn't count
the dot-com but anyways it doesn't
really matter if it's a darthian calm
it's the content on the website that
matters
hey rappers thank you so much for a
supercharged Android app what I should
what I choose Android studio or react
now both are good but with the react
actually your web development skills are
quite handy so that you can make easily
the UI and the backend part as well on
your app so I think if you're a big nerd
and already have skills like HTML CSS in
JavaScript react native makes much more
sense but if you're just getting started
and you say you want to say that hey I
want to be a hundred percent secure and
future proof go with the native it's
it's always going to be there so I'm
suffering from low confidence to go for
an internship give me some advice
the learning curve or overtaking of
anything is always going like this and
then like this
so hunting unless you have reached to
the peak part of your fear it's it's not
like in a word so go ahead go out at
least you're gonna get a no that's the
max nothing more bad can happen
remember your college-y was they were
much more humiliating is there any site
to improve my Android coding skills for
coding hacker rank code chef would love
to get some Android challenges or puzzle
no they are not as as of now I know it I
don't know everything in the world but
just
talking about what my knowledge is
Swapnil here I don't know much about the
websites which talks specifically about
Android challenges I think you're going
to face much more challenges or if you
want to have like something build a copy
of YouTube it has a lot of feature if
you are able to copy YouTube and even
able to upload that on github I think
you are unstoppable or make it alone or
make Google clone so I think that's the
biggest challenge you're gonna face
there are no small website in fact I
would recommend while you are wasting
any your valuable time and just solving
a small challenge like that something
big and it's going to give you a huge in
the portfolio qualification for
internship on lco so far we had just one
two interns actually one is still
working for us remotely of course we
like this work and he is still working
for us and the second one he actually
got shifted in London because one of my
friend actually needed a worker
that'd be me then and he got shifted
there and from that point of movement he
is there so we just work on how much you
know that's the most thing we don't care
about degrees portfolios and I think we
just sit right to you and just ask like
show us what you have got and that's it
because here we are not here about
taking interviews and stuff we have to
work on something so that's what we care
most about here mlah course hey code
everyday cook were learning code online
ml course is already out after Java
which language should I learn stay with
it for a little bit while it's not like
I don't think so you have mastered
already Java so Java the complex game
stay with it create a few Android
project or something like that
so go with that Ravindra Joshi hey Tommy
the doshi
nice question with the guitar there you
should try key be a Python framework
create cross-platform native app yes I
am aware of the key B or key my whatever
they call that but
now I'm a little bit worried about how
is it in perform in everything I haven't
seen much of the real-world aspects of
it I'm not saying it's bad but I haven't
given a much shot surely we'll try that
thank you so much woman for the super
chair I appreciate that pollen says
hello sir and new to programming I want
to work in AI how can I start now the
path of learning the AI starts with the
data science you have to master Python
you have to go with numpy and at least
you need to be able to understand
because a lot of mathematical algorithms
are being implemented there we have
created a just right course for that a
machine learning that is going to get
you started with the e I so this is
course is actually a perfect getting
started path whether you want to go into
machine learning data science or
artificial intelligence this course is
your pipeline you should get into it and
then the things will become much more
easier and you will be able to
understand the things so I highly
recommend to check out at least the
course at learn code online okay okay
let's pick up a couple of more questions
okay okay somebody says Hirsch say is
every answer in Google everything is
there already in the world that's why we
call it research everything not search
because anything is there if you search
it it's there but the way because you
know for every problem there is a
solution on Stack Overflow and anybody
can copy that solution but the point is
not just the copy of that solution the
point is which code we should copy and
which code we should edit so yes
everything is available online
everything is available offline as well
but where you are getting connected
where you are able to learn where you
are able to filter that information and
picking up that that's the art so
everything is there everything was there
everything will be there it's not a
matter of that learning MATLAB will be
helpful depends if you are doing your
masters or PhD shortly it's not not much
it's a MATLAB is a software which is
much more popular in education sector as
compared to industry but shortly it's
helpful but there are other options now
which are easier how to choose good
color for website you might want to
check out a couple of courses on color
theory there are already some pre-built
templates like my Adobe gives me really
good amazing templates or the color
picker like this is the color theme you
should choose always go for that
romance' is involved into LC o ml course
thank you so much you are going to
absolutely love that and there are a few
updates that are about to come in that
as well so keep on learning you are
gonna enjoy that a lot
ok please on where is the question ok
job opportunities in HTML and CSS this
but this vid only because HTML and CSS
is something which I think every not
every but almost every school student
also knows so you might want to explore
things just the HTML CSS not at all a
good idea explore a little bit more
probably's sass or power the JavaScript
jQuery bootstrap so explore okay quickly
get job that's which one that's not a
good start because quickly is not a good
thing quickly get job coal Java or web
dev for fresher web development is
actually much more faster as compared to
the Java because there are a lot of
companies which are which are working
totally on freelancer and these
companies to require a lot of web
development for handling their projects
so that's why it is easier for a web
developer to quickly get a job and buy
quickly I mean first of all you have to
master it's not like it's going to
happen overnight you have to spend a lot
of time in building websites and
projects and portfolio but it is
comparatively java it is much more
easier to get hired ok ok so ravine
governess a is a ravine codices enroll
ml course cut some amount cash back from
free charge
yes pre charge is giving some cash backs
on our website we are planning very soon
to extend that deal on to a big scale so
that students can get benefit let's see
when we can do that we are trying our
best everywhere so that we can serve the
students as best as possible so yeah and
congratulation for enrolling into the
course okay so okay I think I got some
important email let me check that out
just wait a second sometimes emails are
pretty important and uh yep
okay need to get back to work and
something is broken
okay I hope this is not applicable but
this is hey Bruno
thank you so much for super chair all
those guys who are making super share I
wholeheartedly appreciate you guys that
you show some love it's not a matter of
money it's a matter of your appreciation
whether that's the minimum or a big one
it's always appreciation that I will
feel like that uncle Sharma is
interested in knowing my personal
meditation okay it's gone
personal married life no I'm not married
what about digital marketing digital
marketing is something that we use go
ahead a lot but as of now we are not
planning much to roll out the course
into that we do have other plans and as
you know always I never ever reveal what
kind of project I'm working as well as
what kind of course I'm working I like
to show my work first and then talk
about it I like this strategy a lot this
sort of saying hey I'm gonna come up
with a course come up with a course and
then later on come up with a course
probably I like to just present my
course and just say hey we came up with
a course I like this way so you know
action speaks louder than words so
that's what I personally follow every
single time so that's why I don't
discuss which course I'm working what is
the future coming up and all that Robin
the Joshi say so are you single heroines
sorry not interested in anybody who is
asking me and it's a boy sir I think it
has a light I hope you will because I
know you have
a good sense of the immerser evil
pronoun birthday is a tournament again
the super chair I thank you so much for
the super chat mister Azam says hey I'm
from Pakistan hey how's it going on I
have heard that Commission's are getting
better in fact it's not a little bit
high hope it does okay
hey I'm from Bangladesh hey thank you so
much for joining us from Bangladesh it's
really far away from here about Red Hat
certification they are good but make
sure you don't get into the dump
business if you want to pass on those
examination read them probably get
failed one time but at least go with a
legal base and not with a dumb face okay
so now Surat says I am from India I am
also from India and I'm problem that
Rohan Conda girl says what is the
super-stacked this guy just made a super
jet is asking what is super chat so when
you donate a little bit amount of money
or maybe epic amount of money and ask a
question that is a super chat for those
people who don't know but I'm pretty
sure you are making a super chat you
know that that was hilarious under the
first jobs sustained in future in Emily
wood obviously in order to work on the
machine learning you meet their workers
these are the guys who analyze the data
but end and they are developers without
like the basics of Python you cannot
survive much in ml so will you update
about description of ml course yes the
description and probably a few more
sections will come up that's why it's an
early-bird like it is still in the
development phase once the course will
be out properly there will be a proper
promo video on the youtube as of now
this is like we are putting a rate like
this is what we have and your pay for
that but surely there is going to be
update and things like that
so that is why there is no description
right now there is no predict wasted and
stuff it is for something like those
people who know really that yeah
I want to let machine learning so that's
why this course is right now for them we
just make a separate from a video and
every detail that you really wanted so
yes we will update that okay how about
building decentralized app it is but it
is really tough it is tough because you
know we are habitual of building an app
in our present scenario decentralized
apps are designed and coded in probably
a completely different ways so he will
be doing that probably very soon
okay so let's pick up a couple of more
questions how to become data signs make
a video on this hey pooja pooja Mishra
if you want to become a data scientist
or got to get into data science you
should definitely check out our course
of machine learning so let's pick up a
couple of more questions can you see
okay it's going lamp really fast hey
guys you can hit that like button and
can show some of your love let me see
the light count going up in the real
time okay there we go now I can see that
hey guys come on hit that like button
there we go finally open a number
starting a software company is stuff hey
young man it's it's not that tough it's
actually easy it's gonna be much more
easier if you know a lot of stuff so
that's the way this interesting question
react native is better with Expo yes of
course Expo makes a lot of things
easiest so that's why we prefer that can
I get a job in Google without degree
that is gonna be tough that is gonna be
tough I'm not saying it's impossible
it's surely gonna be tough because most
of the time we would like to work with
the people who have high profile degrees
or probably high profile name in
computer world so that's how it does
okay there's an interesting question by
Nikesh Party he says hi this is any
future of web development because many
of developers are making websites much
much cheaper
yes that's an issue which we get quite a
lot there's a robot that says I am
Shakur
please come live tomorrow also I will
try probably an end of life so I was
talking about yes some developers make
website extremely cheap because probably
the country they are living in can have
a lot of multiplication of dollars so
that's why it's affordable for them or
probably they don't invest much of the
time in those websites we face also this
kind of problems but we just honestly
say that it's the quality that you are
getting with us as compared to like if
you just want to have like a three pipe
a website obviously go for the cheap one
but if you want to build any customized
solution may be some CMS or something
then we show our real stuff that what we
are capable of and that's what we do
because client need a proper work it
doesn't need a cheap work big client
needs proper work rohan says i bought
full stack development course are very
excited you're gonna love that you're
gonna love that for sure please what's
the difference between C and C++ that's
that's now the question I'm gonna answer
it
my parents not allowing me to enrol for
the front-end development course on lco
family matter keep me out of the family
matter please for god sakes
Shelly Kumar says why are you not
picking my question there is your
question buddy it's just a line why not
to go with typescript hey I never said
you should not go with typescript surely
you should you should if you're
interested go for it okay Python is good
for app development I haven't used
Python for any of my app development so
I'm not a good person to answer this I
usually use JavaScript or the native
like Java or Swift so I have never used
vikon for after the
okay so let's pick up a couple of more
questions okay so hit H can you tells me
how to develop the logic I hit something
like asking can you tell me how to think
that Charlie can be taught well it
cannot be answered in just a line it's a
process okay so today Bitcoin technology
very popular yes of course technology is
something which keeps on evolving keeps
on moving because a lot of like a lot of
sharpest mind on the planet mostly like
to work on technology especially the
computer technology so that's why it's
evolving at a very fast rate like a lot
of the finest mind that we see on any
country likes to work on computer so
that's why it's growing very fast if I
enroll Python course from where did that
go if I enroll Python curves from lco
what I'm gonna learn invitin we do have
a transparent policy at learn code
online all the topics that you're going
to learn and will apply everything is
mentioned in the course labels and we
try to make that as elaborate as
possible after learning the Python you
can directly move into machine learning
or Django so you can learn your back-end
development you can learn machine
learning data science artificial
intelligence and everything like that so
yeah go ahead and do that and I just
realized that I should be I should
rename my course from machine learning
boot camp to data science and machine
learning boot camp because it makes much
more sense and space much more clear so
these are the things which we do when we
have earlybird course so these are a few
things that we analyze and do the things
that's why it is an ugly word the
content is going to remain exactly the
same but it's like what should be the
best name for it what should be the best
description how elaborate we can have so
that we can answer all of your questions
and stuff like that ok so ok so we have
taken a lot of questions I think I
should really go it's getting ready ok
so let's just end this here I was a
pretty good fun although YouTube
I really hate you you didn't send a
notification for my life really really
bad YouTube do something about it but
thank you so much all of you for joining
up into today's life go ahead let me
check out our discourse on machine and
try to take advantage of the early bird
as quickly as you can so that's it for
this light thank you so much for joining
up before you sign out do hit the like
button so that I can see the light count
going up please guys
bye my good night hey I wish a hey
Richie hey pally power still on
shabam goodbye good night to all of you
I hope just work hard guys we need to
work a lot more than what we are
existing ly doing it go ahead keep
working keep writing some code and make
your life better you sure I can do that
work for yourself first at least so that
you can make your life better and your
family so keep on working hard keep on
working for your dreams and I'm pretty
sure you're gonna achieve that so that's
it for this life check out the learn
code online dot in and check out our
machine learning course
bye-bye good night Sindhu but I could
not calm a girl babble I mean she was
the only kill shot caller Koopa theory
that's nice name now good night good
night everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
