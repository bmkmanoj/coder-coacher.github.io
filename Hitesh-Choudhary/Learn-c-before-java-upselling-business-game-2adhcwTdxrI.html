with another video now you might have
already seen this topic that I have
discussed quite a lot in my previous
videos but finally I have actually
bursted out why this thing is happening
so C++ is not related to Java and it has
been a it's kind of a myth that has been
going around all over in India and in
fact it's been out there in some of the
other countries as well so let's find
out why this myth is going on let me
tell you very frankly in here at the
very first thing in here that C++ and
Java are not brothers and sister or
brothers and brothers they are not even
related to kind of a cousin thing that
they're completely different to
different persons completely different
but why everybody is saying that you
first need to learn C++ in order to get
started with Java and there is a very
cool incident that happened yesterday
and I want to share it with all of you
so that you can decide for yourself that
what part you need to actually take in
order to learn programming and specially
to move into Java so let's get started
yesterday I was at my friend's house and
it was kind of a meetup thing because it
has been quite a long time that I have
been in the town so I went to his home
and his younger brother wanted to learn
Android and I told him that hey but it's
a good approach if you want to learn it
if you are passionate about it you
should definitely do that and being in
the house in person he was taking
advantage that are by he was trying to
get as much as information as we could
get from me so instead of convincing him
that he can go with alternative paths
like react native another I told him
that yes if you want to learn Android go
ahead get started with the Java this is
the first step and then you can move on
to Android it's pretty easy and I told
him that whenever you are going to learn
Android don't just learn the basic
syntax of course they are important but
at least make out a few apps the apps
that should bare minimum should have a
login system
and should be connected with somehow the
database firebase or anything that's the
minimum roach of learning okay so this
was pretty decent advice at least I
think of it and then he asked me that I
am NOT able to find out any good
instructor for Android I told him yes
this is the fact not everywhere you are
looking at they are not good instructors
available for example you are in some
part of India which are not that much
advanced then you are definitely not
going to find a good instructors for
Android or Java or for iOS this is a
common thing but I again a Austin that
hey you are a pretty good visual learner
you learn quite a lot from YouTube you
watch a lot of YouTube and in fact I
have seen some of his previous works
that he has done pretty good job with
Photoshop in editing a few good photos
so I told him that hey you are pretty
good at learning online why don't you
try with the online code and he said no
I'm not comfortable with that I would
like to learn in person with somebody at
it okay completely your decision so he
called up a few Institute's and I would
like to see I would like to tell you
that what entire thing happened it will
clear up all of your mind that why these
Institute's and everybody else is
forcing you to join in for C++ and Ben
Java so for this I would like to change
location sit back nicely and want to
share it so let's go there
so my French younger brother told me
that hey I do have Institute in mind but
they don't teach Android they do teach
Java and I told him hey not to worry too
much about just get started with the
Java and eventually maybe you'll find a
good Institute who can teach Android
pretty good way but again I told him
just keep in mind that you can always
switch on to online and can learn from
the best so I asked him up do you know
the Institute he says yes I know it some
of my friends have done and stayed at
good words about that so on and all
there is positive publicity about this
institute and of course you guessed it
right I'm not going to name anything in
here so I asked him hey why don't you
just call him and ask him where is the
next batch when is the next batch and
when can I join him so he said yeah
that's a good thing so let me just give
it a call he
call the Institute and Institute guys
say that yes we do teach Java and we
have a pretty good market reputation and
you can join in but yes there's a buck
so my friends younger brother ask him
what is the fees of your Institute to
learn Java and he said fifteen thousand
rupees yep they're expensive and you can
get an author encodes for a fractions of
second and you might be thinking hey I'm
too much buyers for online course no I'm
not selling my courses I'm not forcing
you to buy my courses I'm telling you
just you can do it for much cheaper and
greater quality there but again let's
leave that topic I know I know that's
too much but okay so he said fifteen
thousand rupees and we are running a
discount so we will give you a one
thousand rupees or fourteen thousand so
I said your choice buddy if you want to
go there just go out there now the
things became a little bit tricky so the
Institute guy said but before learning
Java
do you know C++ and he said do you
really know C++ because in the Java you
need C++ and the point is when you
pressurize somebody to up to a extend
level he's going to just get afraid and
you say now that that's kind of a human
nature if you'll ask anybody like a web
developer having a five year of
experience do you really know HTML and
he's going to say nope I don't know it I
don't know it so this is kind of a game
there that these kinds of people are
playing in around now I just simply was
there and I asked my friend to call
again and say do C++ and Java use same
compiler and he said no they don't use I
know it and then I told him that why
then they are both are related if they
are not using the same compiler how can
you say that these languages are are
related to somehow is the C++ extended
version known as Java no of course not
Java is a complete different language
but what they people are trying to do is
save a lot of time for them because if a
student is already good in C++ he knows
the concept of loops functions
object-oriented programming like classes
and objects and polymorphism
is ready to go in any language why Java
he's ready to go into JavaScript in
Swift maybe in PHP he's ready to move on
in anywhere so what they're trying to do
is they are trying to upsell a simple
course of C++ along with Java and there
you go earning more 10,000 rupees and
amid the sleeplessness everybody knows
they're going to be upscale of a course
of C so they are going to say first join
our C course for let's just say five
thousand six thousand I don't know the
rate of that course but yes that's
upscaling market being going on and then
I we again charge a little bit about the
online course because it's a good
discussion everybody wants to have this
kind of discussion with me so he told me
that a online learning what do you think
about online learning is it good or not
because in some blog he read that online
is not that good for learning imagine
that doctors are learning every
surgeries online how they're going to do
and how they're going to perform and I
told him that that's kind of a rubbish
comparison you are trying to make and
that reminded me of one of the incident
when I was talking to a head of
Department image in the engineering
university I told him that penetration
testing is a good domain he said no
penetration testing is not a good domain
because you are testing the stability of
a house by a bulldozer trying to hit it
I said that's a bull comparison how can
you compare to it these two things we
are testing the stability of the house
by hitting it by a bulldozer no
penetration testing is not comparable to
that scenario an exactly same thing if
you're comparing that somebody is
teaching a surgery online by the way
just onto a sidebar yes highly qualified
professional doctors are guiding
professional qualified doctors to do
some special kind of surgery by online
that thing is happening but let's leave
that off-topic in here so yes I'm quite
in a good favor of online learning
because of two good reasons first it's
much much less expensive compared to the
offline trainings and second most of the
online training comes up with the
money-back guarantees and you can
the stuff and third most important part
is you cannot always find good
instructors wherever you are living you
have to move on so again let's leave
that part that I am fully biased about
online learning I'm not biased I'm just
thinking broadly how the things should
have been happening so again I finally
thought that here this is actually the
thing which is happening this is an
upscaling market and why the people are
being a kind of also being given that if
you know C++ then you only you can move
on to Java so again I think this is what
I think and let me know in the comment
section if you think that I'm thinking
right or wrong or what do you think
about it this is completely upscale
market which is going on you don't need
to learn C++ to learn Java it's a
completely different language and at any
point of time you can directly get
started with Java if your instructor is
saying that hey you need to first get
the concept ask him to get started from
the scratch because they use completely
different compilers okay let me know in
the comment down section below because
your comments actually helped me to
create more of these videos they gave me
all the time lots of more topics and I'd
love to discuss it video let me know in
the comments section and I'm reading all
of your comments and I'll catch you up
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
