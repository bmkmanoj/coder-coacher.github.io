with another video this video is a 38
special video and I do have a lot of
answers to your questions as well as
there is a special announcement with
this video that will help you to earn at
learn code online and yes that's the
great news because we are about to host
some of the project-based things and we
will avoid that those projects to the
students who are enrolled at learn code
online as well as we are going to host
some competitions that will be available
for all the people learn code online as
well as all the youtubers and there is
going to be a prize money involved as
well so let's get started and talk in a
little bit more detail about what that
all is coming up
when I started this channel there was no
such expectation that I'm going to be
hitting a mark of 30,000 I was expecting
in a range of 5,000 to 10,000 that this
is going to be where my channel is going
to stay because programming community is
a very small community it's not like a
big community now a lot of people does a
mistake in understanding the community
that what we are building in this
channel with other channels as well now
there are hundreds and hundreds of tech
channel around and all those channels
there that they are focusing on is
really good thing they are focusing on
mobile domains unboxing the things and
talking about what's happening latest in
the tech they are also tech channel but
inside the tech channel I have actually
picked up a very niche domain here that
is very small community of programmers
yes all those other peoples are tech as
well they are they love just technology
and gadgets but BICS channel is not
about those gadgets and everything and
there are a lot of other youtubers who
are doing a pretty amazing job in
unboxing the things like unbox therapy
mkbhd and a lot of other guys this
channel was much more oriented about
programming and to my surprise I didn't
knew that a lot of people want to learn
programming and are interested in that
and the thanks to that we have now grown
into a family of 30,000 subscribers and
all thanks to you because it's because
of you only now to my surprise one of
the subscriber actually wrote down in
the comment section below that you have
hit 20,000 from 20,000 to 10,000
subscribers in just 10 days
and I would call this as a really
welcome surprise because that's really a
fast number of growing up the things so
I will answer a couple of questions that
is being thrown at me pretty regularly
so this is kind of a Q&amp;amp;A session as well
as there is an announcement of upcoming
few competitions so that you can start
preparing right now can start learning
right now and can earn reward money of
that so let's first take the Q&amp;amp;A section
now one other question that is pretty
common here is asking how much am i
earning from YouTube now YouTube is not
something which you should be focusing
on earning because yes it's a decent
income enough to pay maybe my one month
or two months of the internet bills but
apart from that the earning from YouTube
is no such charming thing it's not about
earning first of all for me I can live
without the YouTube earning as well but
if you are just starting the YouTube for
earning purpose eventually you will be
looking out for the sponsors
aggressively whatever they are just
giving you you will take them and
regardless of how their product are how
the things are going on with them you'll
just be sponsoring them in your videos
but this channel is not about taking
sponsorship from those peoples and just
shamelessly saying out that this is good
this is good just take this for like
take this for like no this is more about
adding value and trying to make sure
that you understand programming and
related tech accordingly so no I don't
take much of the sponsors although I'm
being approached by a lot of sponsors in
the recent week actually almost six or
seven has dropped me email that they are
looking to sponsor this channel but
again I'm not looking forward to work
from them if they are not so good if
they can provide some value for the
students or can give away for the
students definitely I can collaborate
with them but apart from that if they
are just give will be giving me money
that hey just put out our name and say
that you recommend that no that's not
I'm looking for and probably not in the
near future I'm going to be doing that
the next question that is being thrown
at me tell me something about
freelancing now with almost 500
five-star ratings on the freelancer
websites like Fiverr freelance and
upwards things are really good with the
freelancing as well so definitely am
planning very soon to start a series on
freelancing 101 so that it can help
people to earn from the skills that they
have but again the number one focus
should be on learning the skills first
and earning at a secondary stage because
the more you will be focusing on
learning the technology it would be much
more easier to earn big amount of money
so yes definitely that also
under the plan the freelancing 101 where
we all be just talking you about how to
get started in the field Lansing how to
get your first client and what are the
problems that you usually face and how
to roll out an entire business model of
freelancing work so yes that's going to
come up very soon hey why are you not so
active on Twitter I'm not so active in
the Twitter and I admit that all the
Twitter is a really good way of getting
connected with the people probably in
the future I'll do that but right now
it's really tough for me to manage
everything because social media is kind
of a magnet and you just happen to spend
a lot of time there so that's why I try
to avoid them I just go on to Facebook I
do maintain a Facebook page as well as
my account but account got filled with
the 5,000 friends and now Facebook is
not allowing me to add more friends so I
do manage a page as well so yes
definitely in the future I'll try to get
on to the Twitter but it's really hard
to manage these social media for me
along with YouTube the Facebook my
clients freelancing stuff courses so
it's pretty much a lot of things going
on for a one-man army so definitely in
the future I will try to get on to the
Twitter but as of now there is no such
plan I'm more actively looking into the
comments section of the YouTube rather
and I'm looking up for your suggestions
your questions and trying to answer them
either directly there or maybe in the
upcoming future videos as well are you
an iPhone user or Android user I was an
iPhone user til iPhone 6 I guess and
then I moved into I 1 + 3 T so right now
currently I'm an Android user and I'm
enjoying the experience so far but most
of my most of the time right now my
daily driver is an Android so yes I'm an
Android guy right now but again there is
no such thing as Android as West or
iPhone is best until analyst it just
performs really well and just serves me
what I need which is male most of the
time so Gmail app is awesome that I use
and right now I'm an Android user the
next question that is being thrown to me
at my Facebook page quite a lot of time
is aha why do we actually travel so much
now a traffic is something which is
really fascinating for me I love to
travel I have traveled at a various
weird places in the
tree as well as all over the globe as
well so traveling is one of my favorite
things just like some people are fan of
gadgets
some people are fan of Java some people
are fan of iOS that's why I'm a big fan
of traveling because it gives me a
little bit more clarity of the idea and
again you get interacted with so much of
the culture that I can even make a full
video series on traveling and what are
the benefits of the traveling and yes I
do travel a lot recently my travel was
Egypt and Jordan which I enjoyed a lot
there are few upcoming plans to travel
alongside with the boot camps as well so
I will be keeping about where the travel
plans are going on and how am I doing
with that so keep stay there and I'll be
talking about that now coming up to the
LCU part which is learned code online so
what kind of future things are going to
be hosted at learn code online
now previously what I was doing whenever
I needed a helping hand for writing
maybe blogs or some text or to design
some graphics I was posting all these
things on to the freelancer and upwork
website so that I can get a helping hand
up in affordable range but later on I
decided that why to just post all of
these work on the freelancer and other
website I cannot first of all my student
that if they are free and ready to do
these work for X amount of money and if
you can provide me some portfolio or a
peers work or maybe just want to give me
a sample then obviously I can give that
project to you and to my surprise it was
really an amazing response recently I
needed a helping hand so that we can
write some blog post on the recent blog
at learn code online so that we can
serve more users about some information
now it is not always necessary to make
videos on some small topics rather
writing a blog and putting that
information is far more easier in that
case so I thought that let's just post
an email to few students that hey if you
are ready to do this kind of job for
this kind of amount of money I just let
me know in the mail reply back and to my
surprise I posted that for in the
morning I didn't clap that night so in
the fore of morning I shot that email
and to my surprise by I woke up at 10 o
clock in the morning and everybody was
just shooting me up the email
few of them were really amazing few of
them were not so amazing I will talk
about that later in one of the video I
have a video plan for that but yes that
was an amazing response so I have
decided that I'll be posting all these
future works and projects to the student
for X amount of money and probably you
can help me with that now there's one
more exciting update here which is about
earning money with the competition so I
have decided that we will be hosting a
few competitions for the learn code
online competitions like making an
awesome graphic or making an awesome app
or making an awesome website and based
on who's website is going to be the best
the cleanest code possible being written
there will be rewarding some money and
certificates as well the money is going
to be very higher than what you are
paying at learned code online in buying
the course on an average it's just like
eight hundred two thousand rupees on an
average for a price of the course the
prize money is going to be started from
two thousand to ten thousand or maybe
more based on what kind of competition
is that so right now is a good time to
get started learning wherever you want
to these competitions will be
independent of variable you are learning
it doesn't really matter you might be
learning on other website or learn code
online it will be independent of that
and will be hosting down these
competition shortly I will come up with
a dedicated videos talking all about
these competitions in detail so stay
tuned
do hit the subscribe button for knowing
more these competitions and why we are
hosting these competitions
instead of giveaways on this channel
that is also going to be discussed later
on but I think this is a pretty long
videos and conversational videos rather
than my other videos so keep learning
and I'll be making separate videos
explaining these things in detail there
is a lot of things going on so
definitely we will do that later on but
thank you again thank you so much for
making this channel a really good hit
and we have hit 30,000 subscribers so
from my whole hearted this is a very
very awesome thanks to all of you for
making this channel possible and even a
6 channel so thank you so much and I'll
surely catch you up in the next video
till then keep learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
