with another video so you want to become
an iOS developer you gone ahead and you
have bought a course which is 30 hours
long and you might be thinking that hey
this course is 30 hours long if I spend
1 hour daily with until it is I'll be a
great iOS developer is that true so how
much the truth is behind such a concept
and how much time does it take to become
as developer what are the tips for
becoming an iOS developer and what are
do's and don'ts to become an honest
developer talking all about this in this
movie let's get started out here ok so
first thing first I'm gonna give you a
lot of tips in this movie that will help
you to become a great iOS developer the
tip number one is going to be something
like have patience you have bought the
course that's great it's a great way to
get started out there I'm not saying by
Michaels although it's a great course
but I'm just saying you have bought a
course anywhere out there that's
completely good and it's a right way to
get started out here but if you are
assuming that I'm gonna be a great iOS
developer with a matter of days that is
a wrong concept out there it is not a
matter of days what makes you a good
developer what makes you a great
developer is the time that you have
spent in programming so don't expect
there is going to some magic that's
going to happen after taking this course
no it's not going to happen yes for sure
you are going to learn iOS developer
with that course on my course out there
but you need to have patience that's
going to be tip number one if you don't
have patience you can never never become
a great developer that's harsh
but that's the truth if you don't have
patience now tip number two is code
daily now you might have heard this term
quite a lot by me in a lot of courses by
me or by any other developer that if you
are not going to code daily at the
beginning stage you are not going to be
a great developer coding really it takes
a lot of time to grab into the mind but
it takes really quickly to get out of
the mind so code daily no matter is it a
Christmas Diwali or any other
or whatever it is just at least for 5
minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes solve a
small problem but code daily now coming
back on to the iOS section now if you're
thinking that the 30 hour course I'm
going to take and it's going to take
just 30 hours to do and I'll be a great
developer after 30 hours maybe after a
month now it is somewhat true but not
perfectly true why now let's just assume
now the course that you're watching is
legislative trade yards but it doesn't
take 30 hours to prepare that course and
deliver that course it takes months and
months to design and prepare assets and
things for that course almost 2 months
or maybe sometimes 3 months as well so
it's going to take some time to you now
my best advice would be to have an iPad
or a screen audio mobile device or
anything just watch it out there and on
your PC or computer just make sure you
do exactly what it is being shown in
that particular course or tutorial again
I'm not saying it should be my course it
should be done with each and every
course that you're taking maybe an
online tutorial maybe a YouTube tutorial
anything but make sure that you just
perform exactly what it has been
performing now at first it might look
like hey this is just a variable
declaration or this is just a loop I can
do that but believe me when you write it
by your hand it's much more complicated
that you're thinking so always in all
ways
just put it on to one screen or pause
the movie go back on to your editor
Xcode maybe you are learning anything
out there so go ahead just do exactly
what is being shown out there then again
go back plate a little bit and then
again perform now this is going to take
a little bit while a little bit more but
believe me you don't have to rewatch the
movies if you're going to perform like
that so that's going to be my another
tip do exactly what the instructor says
to you so believe in him and just go out
there okay now how much time usually my
students take to make sure that their
app reaches to the App Store or to the
client that they are trying to deliver
usually it takes around five to six
month and you might be saying hey that's
too much of the time but believe it or
not that's the truth in just a couple of
months or maybe one month or two month
you actually learns about the basics of
the things
like how to set up a table view or how
to set up a recorder for your app or
maybe for cameras and things like that
so within a couple of month you just
learn only those basics including the
Swift and everything so let's just cover
up then the two month now in the next
two month you are actually spending a
lot of time in solving the problem for
the app that you really want to design
and yes it takes another two month out
there so once you have designed a couple
of apps that uses a lot of feature that
you want to give into app and solve a
lot of problem of course by using stack
overflow by friends by instructor and
tons of things like that then after
again it takes one more month or a
couple months more to actually reach out
the client and to make sure that you are
ready for the development of such a
scale out there again a lot of people
say hey it's going to happen magically
but nothing magically happens in the
code v code alike or instructors like me
code out really fast and charming like
that why because we have practiced a lot
we have over 10 years of experience out
there or maybe some might to having a 20
years or 35 years of experience they're
just like pros in that on top of that
still we do make mistakes that's the
truth we try to eradicate the problems
as less as possible but still a lot of
our code are kind of a mess even
sometime hard to read by ourself but
still we try to make sure that we when
we prepare a video for you for let's
just say a login system or firebase
system we try to make sure that yes this
is going to get a flow like that and yes
now let's just do it so again it's a
whole lot process than you are thinking
I hope these advice are really really
helpful for you for getting started in
iOS developer I'm really excited that
you are getting started in iOS developer
in case you need a little help I'll put
a link in the description below and with
just a little out a minimum price you
can get a fantastic and a killer curves
out there that took a lot of time to
design out there but again do subscribe
do like and post your comment what mode
you want to see or what more advice you
want to see out there on this channel
till then see you and catch you on the
next movie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
