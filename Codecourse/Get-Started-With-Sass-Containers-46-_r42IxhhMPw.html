laid we're going to start building our
components and we're going to start with
our generic content container and make
this look as nice as possible and during
that process we're going to learn a few
SAS techniques so we're going to learn
things like nesting we're also going to
look at nesting things like hover so
pseudo selectors and we're also going to
look at placeholders as well which is a
really efficient way of using or reusing
rather CSS styles or SAS styles so to
start with we're going to write the
mark-up for our container and then we'll
jump into styling this so for our
container then we are going to have a
div with a class of container this is
going to contain some content so for
example a paragraph in here with just
some lorem ipsum let's say 20 words and
at the bottom of this we're going to
have a footer so we're going to have a
div with the class of footer and we're
also going to have an unordered list in
here with some links but we won't
include that just yet we'll add that in
in just a moment so let's just write
some content and our footer for now so
i'll say this is a footer and as you'll
imagine at the moment it doesn't look
like much we just see this so let's get
started on styling this but before we do
that we want to lay this out in a nice
way so we're going to have a new folder
in here and we call this components
that's just going to store any
components within our site individually
so we know exactly where to go when we
want to modify them so in here i'm going
to create a new file and this is going
to be called container scss don't forget
that underscore prepended there and in
here then we can say container and we
can start writing styles this is going
to get like I said more into some sass
things that we can use so to start with
will define
brown color a border radius and a box
shadow to our container but I'm going to
create variables for these inside of our
variables file just so it's a little
easier to modify them if we need to so
I'm going to create a new section here
called container and inside of here I'm
going to define the container background
color and for this is just going to be
white we're going to have a container
border radius so this is pretty much
solid if we want to change this across
any components that may be a like a
container we can use that as well and
we're going to define our container
shadow which is just going to be 0 on
the x-axis two pixels on the right it's
going to have a zero spread and the
background color or the shadow color is
going to be black we'll have a point one
on the Alpha Channel so now that we've
done that let's apply them to our
container with in here so we're going to
say background color container bgcolor
we're going to have our border radius
which is going to be five pixels on all
edges of our container will say
container border radius of course you
could use this value alongside any other
values for this property which we will
be looking at in a moment and we can
define our box shadow as well so we'll
say container shadow like that it's
obviously because we have watched still
running we have changes detected to this
already so when we refresh nothing
happens because we obviously haven't
added it to our appt s CSS file so let's
include this now so we'll import that
will do this just down here import
components
container like that so now we have a
fairly nice-lookin container we still
have a little bit more to do here so
what we'll do then is back inside of our
container SCS far we're now going to
look at nesting selectors now ordinarily
if you wanted to say apply styles to
something within a container you would
do something like this so we're going to
be creating a content div in just a
moment you would say that you want the
content element within container to have
these styles but we can get rid of that
all together now we can easily just nest
our selectors and these will
automatically be generated with CSS or
to CSS so we can define that we want the
content and the footer to perhaps how a
padding 20 pixels I'm not going to
define a variable for everything here
you can go ahead and decide what you
want to find variables for now we don't
have this content Elliott element at the
moment this is going to be just here so
we're going to say content I'm actually
going to place that paragraph within
that content so we have two elements
within this container we have the
content which is going to sit at the top
and the fitter and because we've applied
the 20 pixel padding to both of them we
now see the following so this is hitting
hitting the top a little bit but don't
worry too much about that that'll
rectify when we have our navigation at
the top so we've got all this working
what we'll do now is any paragraph
elements within our content we want to
basically have no spacing at all so no
padding and no margin so we could of
course say that we want content p to
have padding of 0 and say this element
did have padding and margin we could
define both here but what we're going to
introduce now is a placeholder and this
is going to be stored under our base
folder so I'm going to create a new file
under here and i'm going to call this
place holders door SCSS will include it
into a plot CSS so we don't forget
so this is place holders perfect and
inside of our place holders file we want
to define a place holder and we do this
with a percentage sign and then the name
of the place holder so no spacing for
example and no spacing is just going to
be a generic placeholder that's going to
get rid of padding and it's going to get
rid of margin as well so we can now use
this inside of this container to say
that for the paragraph element we want
to have no padding and no spacings it's
almost like importing these styles into
this selector and to do that we use
extend so we're going to extend no
spacing now all that's done is it
supplied them styles within here to this
so when we refresh we see an error which
is fairly useful and that's because this
is called placeholder not placeholders
so we'll just change that and when we
refresh let's just go and check this out
placeholders save that and there we go
so all good to go so we've now got the
paragraph with no spacing at all and we
will now want to style the footer of
this so we're going to again nest this
so all of these are directly nested
under container to anything within
container I'm going to change the
background color of this again you could
define a variable fit if you wanted but
I'm just going to say f nine fa fa for a
nice color a nice gray color and we are
going to set the border radius on this
as well and we're going to do this 00
and then we're going to have the order
radius on the bottom left and the bottom
right so otherwise this will overlap and
not look great now we already have a
container border radius property or a
variable rather so we can just reuse
this like that so let's just refresh and
see what this looks like so it looks a
little bit nicer you might not be able
to see this depending on your monitor
contrast but it's a nice gray color and
what you now want to do is create a
border on the top just to define this a
little bit a little bit nicer so inside
of variables then we are going to create
container footer top-order variable and
for that we are going to set this to one
pixel solid and the color of this is
going to be EI te Ed so now we can
refresh here we haven't defined it
inside of here yet so let's do that now
so border top and that's a container
remember what we call it footer top
order again it's entirely up to you what
you define as a variable you will you
might want complete control newmont
variables assigned to the most common
things or them or everything it's really
entirely up to you so we've now got a
nice border at the top there so the
container is starting to look pretty
nice let's finally just update this
paragraph just include a margin bottom
of 10 PX I know we removed it here but
when we go ahead and add our buttons in
a little bit later in here when we get
to them we want a little bit more
spacing from this paragraph here so what
we're now going to look at is including
in this footer an inline list of links
and this can be a little bit messy and
tedious when you're just writing plain
CSS but we're going to make this a
little bit nicer but to do this we're
going to create an entirely new
component called an inline list so under
our components directory let's create
inline list scss and this is basically
going to be a ul with a class of in line
so let's include this into app CSS again
so components in line list and for the
inline list we want another place holder
and this placeholder is just going to be
called inline list and the reason we're
doing this is this is going to help us
if we ever want to manually define the
Styles anywhere but basically this
inline list placeholder will look like
this so it will be again
a percentage sign in my list from this
we're going to extend another place
holder which is that no spacing
placeholder we have up here so we won
our inline list now unordered list i'll
link list items to have no padding at
all so here we can say that we want each
list item to be a display of inline
block and we want the margin right on
each of them list items to be 10 pixels
and we're not actually created the
mark-up for this yet so let's go ahead
and just do that now so inside of index
let's get rid of this footer and let's
create UL with a class of in line let's
create some list items with some anchors
in so we'll just say item one and we'll
do the same for each one here so now we
have a unordered list with three list
items so what we're going to do now is
within our inline list CSS we want to
extend the placeholder that we've
created extend inline list and then for
each of the list items in here we're
going to set the font size 20 point 9 m
so we're not controlling things like the
font size from our placeholder this is
purely just not visual but it's purely
structural so we're displaying them is
in like blocks we're setting the margin
on them but for the actual inline list
component we're setting things like the
font size and then we can nest further
so we've got two nests technically here
the outer then the first nest and the
second nest so this will be an unordered
list with a class of inline any allies
within that going to have a font size of
point nine ms and the anchor within the
list items themselves are going to have
a text decoration of none so now that
we've got that in place we have it
including in apt is CSS and we'll see
them go in line like this so it's pretty
nice now that's just a generic component
really for any inline list we could use
that for
links in our footer we could use that
for links in our header we could use
this pretty much anywhere the point is
now we have a component which is nicely
defined uses this inline list
placeholder which we can also use for
other components not just this inline
list component so we have the
reusability of code and the flexibility
to do what we want here obviously this
might require some minor tweaking if you
wanted to do something else but the
fundamentals are here that we can reuse
this as much as we can at the moment so
the next thing that I want to do then is
when I hover over these I want the
background to change to a darker color
I'm not going to define that within my
inline list component because that will
mean that then all in line lists will
have a hover we might not want that so
what we're going to do is we're going to
define this under our actual container
so we're going to say any inline list
within a container and any anger within
that we're going to give a padding of
five pixels on the top and the bottom
and 10 pixels on the left and the right
just to space that anchor out a little
bit so it's more clickable and then
we're going to give these a border
radius of 6 pixels and we'll see why
because what we're now going to do is
have a pseudo selector which is hover
and you'll notice this is defined in a
slightly different way usually reduce on
the night a hover like that but because
we're using nesting here we need this
ampersand here to signal that it's a
pseudo selector so these won't have
changed too much they've just spread out
a little bit more so we're defining this
remember within this container not
globally for inline list and when we do
hover we want the background color to
change 2444 and we want the color of the
text to change to white so now we have
the following so really nice inline list
which is a global style and then we've
specifically styled these in line this
within our containers so that might felt
like a lot of work but you can now see
the benefit of doing this how much clean
the code is rather than just having lots
and lots of lines of CSS we've got a
reusable component here we've got
reusable placeholders here and we've got
more variables which you can obviously
add to if you want to go ahead and just
quickly update so next up we're going to
look at styling the buttons which we are
going to place just under here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
