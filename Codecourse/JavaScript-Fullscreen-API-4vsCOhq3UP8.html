fullscreen API and how you can trigger a
full-screen view of just about any
element on a page and the first thing
that we're going to do as you can see
here is make a video fullscreen so as
you can see I have a just video we can
play this and I have a button down here
regardless of the controls here which do
have a full-screen trigger I can hit go
fullscreen and that will take me into
fullscreen I can just go ahead and
easily exit it with either clicking this
pressing the escape button so we're then
going to build up something other than a
video to go fullscreen so just a normal
container and this works in pretty much
the same way so there isn't really much
of a difference and obviously we're
going to talk a little bit about browser
compatibility and how we do things
differently in other browsers okay so to
start out we're not starting out with a
completely blank page but near enough to
it we've basically just got a normal
document here and I've linked in a
stylesheet and a script so if you're
following along go ahead and do this and
inside of both of these files these are
empty so we're going to be building up
these from scratch so the first thing I
really want to do is include a video and
we're going to look at how we make this
fullscreen using an additional element
so an anchor which probably makes more
sense
we'll make this video go fullscreen and
this doesn't have to be a video element
it can be anything but we'll focus on
video just for now so let's go ahead and
add controls to this so you can play the
video and do what we want with it and
let's give this an ID I'm just going to
call this element the reason I'm calling
this element is because we're going to
be switching over to an element other
than video later so we'll keep the
naming the same so we don't have to
change the JavaScript too much so inside
of here let's have a source and I have a
folder called video and I have a video
called cat that MP mp4 in here if you're
using browser like Firefox this won't
work because it's an mp4 file but in
other words just go ahead and grab a
video and you can test this out so when
I hit refresh now you can see we've got
a rather large video here so let's just
add some styling just to combat this so
I'm going to target element and I'm
going to set the width of this to
perhaps 40%
so when we go ahead and refresh we now
have a video on the page perfect so we
can trigger the we can trigger full
screen and you've obviously seen this if
you've watched any videos on any
websites you'll see we can just trigger
with a full screen just like that and we
get a full screen view of the page now
we want to add a link that does this
without having the controls so for
example we could just get rid of the
controls you may have an instance where
this is necessary you might want to
build your own controls that control
every aspect of this player or you may
just want to have a particular element
go fullscreen which will focus on next
but it's pretty much ties into that so
let's create an anchor here and we'll
just say go fullscreen and we'll just we
don't need a teacher for this let's give
this an ID of fullscreen okay so now
that we've got that we need to go ahead
and write some JavaScript to trigger
this we'll do it the simple way first
I'm using Chrome so I'm going to be
using the WebKit implementation but
we'll also look at other browser
implementation as well so the first
thing I want to do is just target this
element if you're using jQuery or
something that's absolutely fine this
will work exactly the same way as long
as you've selected your element in
jQuery you do something like this I'm
going to be just using plain old vanilla
JavaScript so document.getelementbyid
Emeth 'add and then choose that element
name
so it's element so we can test that this
is properly selected if I just bring up
my console and I'm going to type element
here and there we go we know that this
is the element that we're targeting and
we'll be using the console throughout
the tutorial as well so we also want to
obviously grab this full screen link
because we need to be able to add an
event listener to this so let's just
target that okay so now what we want to
do is we want to attach the event event
listener so we're going to say add event
listener and that's going to be on a
click we have a closure just here and
then just to test this out I'm going to
console.log it worked or something like
that so let's click this and we
see in the console it worked perfect so
as long as we're at this stage we can
now start to put this element fullscreen
so let's look at a very basic example of
how we do this using the WebKit
implementation then we'll create out if
else if else which is really annoying
but we'll talk about that later so let's
do this now
so we target the ELINT we've already
targeted the element we can just say
element and all we do is we say WebKit
request fullscreen now notice the small
s here I've been quite how many times
putting the s in capitals
unfortunately the Mozilla implementation
of this does actually have a capital S
which is really confusing so it's a
method here on the element now when we
click the event listener now this is
going to take that element fullscreen
and you can see I've got my console open
here as well because I already had that
open the beauty of this is that if you
do want to you can inspect this and you
can start playing around with things
while it's in full screen so that's
really really handy a really good thing
to know
so let's come out of full screen then
and let's introduce some other
implementations here if I open Firefox
you can see that we've got we can't see
the video because it's not supported but
if I hit go full screen at the moment
this doesn't actually work you can see
here we've got a type error element that
WebKit requests full screen is not a
function so what we can actually do is
depending on what browser that you're
using this and Mike Microsoft
implementation or Trident implementation
for this and as well as obviously WebKit
and the standard implementation as well
which is just request full screen
without any vendor prefix what we can do
is because we've got our console open we
can say element dot and then we can just
check what's available to us so we can
say let's say WebKit request and you can
see it there it's already there so if I
hit enter and you can see that that's
the native code that will trigger this
so we can actually use this to detect if
it's available
so rather annoyingly what we sort of
have to do here and this does get a
little bit messy so it's a little bit
hard to read but we can say if element
dot and then we can check
implementation so I'm going to say
request full screen which is our
standard implementation then if that's
available I can run the request full
screen method at the moment that doesn't
exist within Chrome so it doesn't work
but if we add an else if here and we say
elf else if element dot WebKit requests
full screen we know that's there
so we say request WebKit request full
screen so now that works it takes us
into full screen so let's now add some
more just in case you well you probably
will want target as many browsers that
do support this so let's go for Mozilla
now so if that's available and remember
this only I think it only has an
implementation with a capital S which is
pretty annoying we can check this in
here so if we type element dot Mars
request yet looks like it only has a
capital letter implementation which is
pretty annoying it gives us a lot of
inconsistency but that doesn't matter
too much somos request fullscreen
perfect so last but not least
or I guess least if depending on your
opinion at the Trident or Microsoft
implementation so let's say MS request
fullscreen element dot MS request full
screen now I'm not going to be testing
this on on my pond Internet Explorer
we're just going to stick with Chrome
and Firefox so this worked on Chrome we
know that let's head over to Firefox now
although the video isn't supported
because it's an mp4 we can still hit go
full screen and you can see that that
does take us into a full-screen view
with a much larger notice here of what's
happening and this is really important
actually because it's really important
that this is taken seriously because
what you're actually doing is you're
taking over the users screen they could
have a small
no open that triggers something
fullscreen that's going to that's going
to completely fill up their screen so
this gives it this sort of gives you
clear in structure and press escape at
any time to exit you can remember the
decision to deny or allow fullscreen for
the particular host you're on in my case
I'm just working locally so that's a
really important thing there so I'm
going to exit that so just briefly
sticking to that same subject of
triggering fullscreen when when things
like fullscreen coming to mind
I think pop up so remember sort of 5 odd
years ago we had the problem of a mass
amount of popups on on pages so adverts
being put fullscreen and sort of
confusing everyone and this is really
important for accessibility as well so
what we're going to do here is I'm
actually going to try and trigger this
video fullscreen I'm actually gonna add
the controls back in here because I want
to just play the video so I'm going to
try and trigger this now to make it
fullscreen and I'm going to do that
using the console and we could do this
in the file but I'll just show you from
the console anyway so let's say element
dot WebKit request full screen and let's
run that method and let's see what
happens it says undefined so let's try
this in Firefox here so let's say Mars
request full screen so we get undefined
and we actually get a more useful
message here so let's have a look at
this request for full screen was denied
because element Mars request full screen
was not called from inside a short
running user generated event handler now
that's a little bit of a long-winded way
of explaining it basically that means
that a user has to click a button in
order to trick a full screen they must
click something I this button that we've
implemented it into our code to trigger
a full screen extremely important
otherwise what can happen is you could
land on a website boom they could put
something fullscreen could be an advert
it could be a video it could be
absolutely anything but you've now just
had a full screen activated without your
permission
very annoying so that's the reason that
that happens so if you are wanting to
trigger full screen automatically you
can't unfortunately so we've looked at
video now let's take a look at actually
triggering a normal element on the page
so let's get rid of this and let's
create a div with an ID of element just
so that the JavaScript that we've
written still works and let's just write
something in here so hello I am some
text so now according to our JavaScript
implementation here we are getting an
element we are getting the fullscreen
button
we're waiting for a click and then we're
putting that element into fullscreen so
let's check out how this works so we've
just got hello I am some text go
fullscreen and now you can see that this
does actually work we've got this it
looks rather odd at the moment but we'll
talk about how we can remedy this we've
got this text here which is effectively
gone full screen and we have all the
normal controls we can still inspect
things it's pretty cool
and the same works with Firefox as well
let's just refresh this and hit go full
screen and we're in full screen you'll
notice though that the if we just do a
control a you can see at the top here be
well they're small but you can see hello
I'm some text up here so what we really
need to do now is for the purpose of
both WebKit in this case we've only got
this very small it here we need to work
out how to style this element so again
I'm only going to be working with
Firefox here and I'm only going to be
working with Chrome in terms of these
examples but you can find information on
other browsers elsewhere so we're going
to style this full screen element like
this so we can take something like width
100% height 100% so WebKit at the moment
is the only browser that doesn't
automatically put what you're doing or
what you're making fullscreen 100% width
and 100% height now at the moment I've
got the element set to with a 40 percent
I'm going to get rid of this otherwise
it's going to actually make it 40
percent of the full width so let's take
a look at how this works I'm going to
hit go full screen and now you can see
we've got a full
all height and full width of this text
here and you can see the text just up
here
so what we're now going to do is look at
implementing the mods fullscreen
selector there's a couple of things we
need to do here as well so let's say
oops
more's full screen and let's say
background white and let's refresh and
hit go full screen and there we go we've
remedied that it looks a little bit
braver that's just because we've got
this here if I hit allow we're back to
normal so you can add whatever you want
to this container and it will appear
full screen you might want to tweak this
for other browsers just so you get the
full experience across browsers that do
support this but generally we've looked
at to sort of the major browsers in
terms of supporting functionality like
this and they're both fairly easy to get
get started with this so that's how we
put elements in full screen with the
full screen API there's a lot more you
can do here depending on what browser
but go ahead and play around with it and
see what you can do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
