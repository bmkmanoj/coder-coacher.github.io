modifying dates if you already have a
date set your of course at some point
going to want to modify it this could
involve adding two days two years
subtracting two hours it really depends
and this is entirely flexible there's
nothing in in terms of that you can't do
so we're first of all going to look at a
complicated example and then we're going
to go on to look at a simple example and
this involves using the date interval
class so let's create a new date time
instant just here and we'll look at
adding on a specific interval so at the
moment if we just divide them on this
just so we can check the date that it
currently is it's currently the 15th of
august at 2016 and we're at ten o'clock
so if we wanted to increment this maybe
by ten days two years two hours we can
go ahead and do this using date interval
so to do this we say date add and then
in here we use an entirely new class and
this is a new date interval and into
here we pass an almost cryptic looking
set of letters and numbers so basically
we start by P this stands for period
then we give the number so for example
10 and then we give the signifier which
is like days months years whatever so in
this case I'd say 10 d which is 10 days
then if we wanted to choose the time we
can say T and then again the same thing
so two hours maybe so this would
increment the current date that we have
here by ten days and two hours so
remember we're starting on the fifteenth
and we're at ten so we should end up
with 25 or the 25th and we should end up
with twelve o'clock and there we go we
have now what we can also do is we can
subtract dates by using the sub method
so in this case we're on 15 before so we
should end up with a fifth and we were
on 10 before so we should end up with
eight so there we go or on the fifth and
we're at eight o'clock in the morning so
now that
know how to do this this is overly
complicated but why have I showed you
this if it is overly complicated well if
you need very fine-grained control over
how much your incrementing by this is
very helpful and what we can also do by
the way is completely get rid of this
and we can go ahead and do the same here
so we can subtract two hours as long as
we've got the P there we get rid of the
P you'll find that we get an error and
you can do the same so we can add on as
well so we're keeping the date the same
but we're incrementing by two hours now
the reason this works like i said is
because what we can do is if we want to
increment by two hours then what we can
do is in here maybe go ahead and say
hours and here we can say hours equals
two so it really depends on your needs
but this is tends to be a little bit
better in terms of very fine grained
control now a better way to do this if
you just know exactly how many days or
hours you want to increment by this is a
very human readable way to do it so what
you can do is say new date time and this
is if you assume that you're starting
off in the current date and time you can
enter the constructor say plus two days
five hours for example so in this case
if we just do a VAR dump on the date we
get the following so we were on the
fifteenth but now on the seventeenth and
we've incremented this by five hours so
this helps but what happens if you have
an already existing date that you've
created that you want to either
increment or decrement by the way to
decrement this you just you've minus it
works in exactly the same way so we're
now on the 13th okay so to do this then
we have a date time let's say we have a
date time and we've gone ahead and set
the date into this so we may have said
something like date set date and then
gone ahead and given a date just in here
so say 11 16 and we have the following
now what we can do is up here say
something like date modify and then we
can do exactly what we just did passing
into the constructor so we can say well
I want to see what the time is or the
date isn't too
days time from this in that case we have
the 18th from the 16th so as you can see
this is pretty flexible you'll be very
surprised at the amount of control you
have over this there's nothing you
really can't do but I have a warning
about modification and we're going to
take a look at this now and it may seem
a little bit strange so let's start from
scratch and let's just go and modify
this date so let's say modify and we'll
maybe add two days just on to this like
so now let's say we wanted to keep this
original date this is the current date
and then we wanted to say well a new
date here is in two days so what we
would end up with is the current date
and time and we would end up with the
date and time in two days time so we
just have two days so you might think
well now i can use date and you date
independently well let's take a look and
do a VAR dump on the new date this
should be what we expect so we're
currently on the fifteenth of august and
we've incremented this by two so we're
now on the seventeenth now we would
expect the date here to be the 15th when
i refresh you can see it's the 17th what
is going on here all we've done is we've
reassigned the date here the modified
date to a new variable so why is it
modifying this one well that's because
this is passed by reference which means
that as soon as you call this method it
will update the original one as well it
will still set this one but it will
update the original one so this is not
good so how do we get out of this well
what we can do is say new date equals
clone date so this will make a copy of
it which won't be passed by reference so
we now have a new date just in here and
because we've cloned this we can now say
well the new date which is currently the
same as the date up here we just want to
modify that so now if we check out our
new date we get the following so the
17th as we would expect but now when we
go back to the original day we have the
15th so things like this can get really
confusing and it can really break things
if you're not careful
so that is pretty much it from modifying
dates and times there are other things
that we can do this but again we'll
probably look at these throughout the
rest of the series and of course if you
do need to do something very specific
there's always the PHP manual to help
you out but that is pretty much it for
modifying dates and times</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
