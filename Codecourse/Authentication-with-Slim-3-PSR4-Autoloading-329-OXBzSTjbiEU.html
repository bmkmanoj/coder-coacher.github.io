to auto load any files that we create
we're going to be creating middleware
we're gonna be creating models we're
going to be creating validation rules so
we need some way to actually
automatically load these in and the
answer is psr-4 autoloading which sounds
pretty scary but it really isn't so if
we had over to compose a lot JSON we're
gonna set this up and then we're gonna
look at an example of how this actually
works and why we're doing this so inside
of here we want to say Auto load and
then we choose what we want to also load
or how we want to auto load and we want
to auto load using psr-4 so this is just
a convention for name spacing so we now
need to choose a name for our
application now in my case I'm gonna
choose app but you might want to do your
business name or anything else so in my
case this app now we need to give this a
back slash but we also need to escape
that back slash so we use two
backslashes now we need to say well
where do we want to auto load our files
from well I want to auto load them from
the app directory here okay so now that
that's done what we need to do is dump
our auto loader
so using composer you want to say dump
auto load o and that will go ahead and
generate an optimized that was the O
flag Auto load files perfect so now
let's just take a really quick look at
an example of this working so in app
let's create a new folder called models
and let's create a new file in here
called user dot PHP so now that we've
created this file this has a namespace
based on its directory structure so to
name space a file we say namespace app
and then models and then obviously we
have a class name of user so app here
models here and user the name of the
file and that means that when we want to
use this much like we've seen with slick
all we need to do is we're gonna kill
the page here and we're gonna say user
equals new app models user that is why
we do it now this means that we don't
have to manually load in every new file
we create it's Auto loaded in based on
the namespace because it knows where to
look so now if we just do a var dump on
user we'll see we head over to our
application we see an object and it is
in fact that correct class or object now
so that's psr-4 Auto loading is going to
come in handy when we are creating all
of our files within here I'm going to go
ahead and delete that models directory
because I don't quite need it yet and
now we pretty much have everything set
up ready to go and in the next section
we're going to focus on controllers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
