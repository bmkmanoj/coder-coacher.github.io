this beginner's Java series in this
video we're going to be continuing
exactly where we left off in the last
one we're going to be inside our main
method here and we're going to be
working with we could just gonna be
working inside this main method we're
going to be learning about variables and
the basic syntax of Java so let's go
ahead and delete this system.out.print
line that we have let's just make some
space so we can see easier so we're
inside our main method the entry point
of our program now let's learn some of
the basic syntax of Java the first thing
we can learn about because it's pretty
easy is comment and obviously if you've
ever seen code before it doesn't matter
if you haven't when you're making code
you need to make comments in the code so
anyone reading it can basically
understand the code you're writing and
see what's going on without having to
sort of analyze the code and see and see
what you've actually programmed so a
comment is basically something that the
Java compiler ignores it doesn't affect
your programming anyway it's literally
just help you read the code bear and we
could do comments two ways in Java we
can do two forward slashes like so and
you can see it becomes grayed out like
this and then you can write comments
here and when you do the two forward
slashes you can write a infinite amount
of characters on this same line for just
containing whatever comments you want
and then as soon as you go to the next
line you're back to normal Java where it
will attempt to compile whatever is on
this line here but after these two
forward slashes everything you write
here is not going to be compiled it's
just so you can read the code bar so
that's the first way you can do a
comment the second way is if you want a
multi-line comment and it's basically
kind of like you can picture them like
brackets you have an opening comment and
a closing comment so the opening one is
a forward slash and a star and you can
see when I do this these become grayed
out as well
as if they're part of the comment that's
because everything after this forward
slash start will be a comment until it
reaches a closing star and a forward
slash and netbeans tab that kind of
Wiggly
let me just delete that there we go so
everything in between here for any
amount of lines is going to be a comment
and that's with the opening comment and
the closing comment which is /and the
asterisk and the asterisk and closing
/and in NetBeans if you just do a
forward slash and the asterisk and hit
enter it's going to automatically make
that closing one at the bottom for you
so those are the two ways you can do
comments so now we can actually learn
about basic variables in every Java
program you're ever going to make you're
going to be using variables and
variables are basically a word in Java
like we assign a variable to a specific
word that we can choose and then
whenever we type that word it's going to
be referring to that variable and it can
be there's syntax for the variables but
it can pretty much be anything excluding
some special characters so I'm going to
type the syntax for a variable in this
little comment here just so we can
remember it and it's basically we first
type the variable type there's lots of
different types of variables in Java we
need to state what variable type is
first then we need to give it a name and
then we can this bits optional we can
either end it there with a semicolon or
we can add the equal sign and then
assign it a value and assigning the
value is optional we can just declare
the variable and end the end the line
with a semicolon and then assign it a
value somewhere else or just use it or
never use it although that would be
useless but it's something you can do in
Java so after you've done the variable
type and the name you can do equals and
assign it a value depending on what the
variable type is so let's go ahead and
do the most simple variable type in Java
or at least in my opinion and that's an
integer variable an integer in
mathematics is a whole number it has no
decimal places it's just a whole number
so we can go ahead and write int which
stands for integer you can see it's
highlighted blue this is an inbuilt
keyword for Java and it int is a
variable type it means when we write
this word this keyword it means the next
thing we're going to type is going to be
the name of
integer variable with declaring an
integer so the next thing we need is a
name
so because of my lack of imagination I'm
simply going to call this my number and
now is a good time to tell you about
naming conventions in Java for when we
make variables and this applies to
methods as well although we'll look at
those later when we make variables we
use this thing called camel casing and
camel casing is where you write a
variable named B you write you start the
variable with a lowercase so if this is
it for if it's more than one word so
alright let me try to explain that about
it so let's remove this basically if I
have a variable wanna call it number we
can just leave it as number but if we
want a variable to be called more than
two words because we can't have a space
we can't call it my space number because
this space isn't allowed in the Java
syntax we basically start the variable
name off with lowercase and then any
preceding words we need the variable to
have we do an upper case like this so my
number like so there's nothing that
stops you from doing it like this with
the capital or just doing all lowercase
like so obviously all lowercase doing
the camel casing makes it easier to read
there's no real reason for not starting
it with a uppercase letter but this is
the Java naming convention and it's
basically if you look at other people's
code on whatever source you'll see this
naming convention here so integer with
declaring the variable type integer then
we do the space and now Java's thinking
the next thing I'm going to see is the
name of the variable that is my number
so whenever we write this my number
we're referring to this variable here
now you see it's greyed out it says well
one my number is not used and also we
haven't actually assigned a value to it
so we can do another space and do the
equal sign and then we can give it a
value obviously it has to be an integer
value because that's the variable type
we've declared so we can do any whole
number we can assign this to any whole
number like so up to obviously a max
size limit but pretty much the
memory the memory space put aside for
integer variables in Java is quite
significant so in a normal program you
won't really go over the max limit for
an integer and if you do there's a
different variable type for if we need
an even bigger integer so just to
clarify the syntax once more we declare
the variable type int then we make a
space we give it a name we've called it
my number with this thing called camel
casing where we make sure every
consecutive word the star that is
capitalized then we put this equal sign
which means assign the value on the
right-hand side to the variable on the
left-hand side and this works in lots of
areas of Java the variable can be
already declared for example we can
reassign my number down here we don't
need to do put the int part again
because we've already declared it typing
this variable type is called declaring
the variable so once it's declared we
can use it wherever without having to
read eclair it without having to retype
this bit so we can come down here and
assign it a completely new value and
then we could do this we can do this as
many times as we want we can just
reassign we can use this my number over
and over and over again you see if you
double click a useful thing in NetBeans
it highlights all instances of that
variable just so you can read it more
easily so you can see here that we can
reassign it a number of times and we can
what we can do now is I'll actually keep
this here because it will be a good way
to demonstrate it we're going to go
ahead and do our system dot out dot
print line if you remember from the last
video this is the way we print stuff out
to the console down here in Java we do
system to out print line and then we can
simply write my number and that's going
to print out the value stored in this
variable here so if we hit run you can
see it prints out a thousand and if we
go ahead and copy this and then paste it
in between each line
you look kind of messy but hopefully
I'll make some gaps here okay so we
assign we make a variable called my
number we give it the value of a
thousand we're then going to print it
out we can then give it a new value
print it print it out again new value
print it out etc and when I hit run here
you can see that it's just going to
print out each time with the new value
you give it so this is just
demonstrating that once you've declared
a variable and assigned it a value you
can assign it and reassign it and
reassign it over and over again for
whatever purpose you may need it for
so hopefully you now understand the
basic syntax of Java oh and one thing I
didn't mention is the semicolon it might
be might seem obvious but if not I'll
explain it at the end of every operation
you do in Java there for example if
you're declaring a variable or if you're
printing something out you end it with a
semicolon
and that's because when Java compiles it
doesn't ignores white space like white
space doesn't mean anything and like
these return breaks here don't mean
anything to the Java compiler so we need
to make sure we end each line with the
semicolon so that we know so that Java
knows there is like we're going on to
the next line we're doing the next thing
to show that whitespace is irrelevant I
can show you like we can delete these
here and as long as there's a semicolon
and Java knows the next line it needs to
do obviously this is incredibly hard to
read and would be very impractical to do
so we use the returns and whitespace to
help it to be more human readable and
the semicolon is so that it's Java
readable so in the next tutorial we'll
be looking at more variable types and
we'll be looking at mathematical
operations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
