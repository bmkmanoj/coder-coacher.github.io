and we're going to be checking if the
two new passwords that the user
specifies so password and password again
actually match and obviously this is
relatively straightforward we want to do
is we want to say if dollar underscore
post password is equal to dollar
underscore post password again and
that's all we need to do now we might
want to take into consideration users
that may be accidentally place an extra
space at the end of where they've
entered their password we could really
say this for any any data so for example
if if we user was to enter into a space
if the user was just to say enter
password and then accidentally press the
space key and enter another space then
you know that would be treated
differently to something that was the
same string but with with without any
extra whitespace and you'll see that
we've used empty here to check empty
values empties great because it takes
into account any white space as
something being empty but here we need
to be a bit more careful so I'm gonna
say if trim password is equal to trim
password and what trim does is it just
removes white space from the left and
the right hand side we do have L trim
and our trim but I'm just going to be
using trim so if they're trimmed
password ru password with any extra
whitespace on the left over hand side is
equal to the password again is not equal
to the past but again
what do we want to do I would leave us
there what do we want to do well we want
to append an error because it's not it's
not they don't match so your new
passwords do not match perfect so else
we want to do something in here so what
do we want to do we want to check else
if something and that is whether the the
password is greater than six characters
and that's important so let's just say
if the string length of the posted
password is greater than six or is maybe
say it's less than six then we do
another error so or we append another
error to this error right so we'll just
take the same text that we used here so
your password must be at least six
characters that's fine again you see
we're copying and pasting which is
somewhat bad but you know we can we can
fix that at a later date
and that looks like it's it so let's
just go ahead and test everything out
just to make sure there's no errors or
anything I'm going to go ahead and enter
an incorrect current password to
matching new passwords now your current
password is incorrect notice that we
haven't returned an error saying you
know your two new passwords are too
short or anything like that let's just
go through some of the logic here so we
are initially checking the password now
if the passwords do maps then we go in
and we look at these if they don't match
we only act or append one error so if
they do match we then go into these
checks now the first check is whether
the passwords match if the passwords
don't match we do this now the reason
we've got this else if is because we can
only we only then need to if the two
passwords match we only then need to
check
one password field otherwise we would
have to do and and string length of
posted password again is less than six
so as long as they match we know that
they match so we can only check we only
need to check one of these so let's go
ahead and try this again with the
correct password I'm just gonna choose
say I and I change password your
password must be at least six characters
let's go ahead and enter password and
two different new passwords your new
passwords do not match go ahead and
enter my password again and this time
choose a new password so something like
password one password one change
password no errors so we now are at the
stage where we've checked more or less
all the possible combinations of
entering different you know different
things in fact we've covered them all I
believe and then that's it we can now go
ahead and you know start to change the
user actually change the user's password
so now let's go ahead and just output
any errors that we see and you know how
we've done before so let's go ahead and
do this so we don't need to do this up
here we need to come down and do this
under the header so we need to output
any errors that we have gained up here
so I'm gonna say if now what do we need
to check we need to check if the posted
data is empty so let's just go ahead and
reference this so we've got here if
empty post is equal to false and empty
errors is equal to true then we register
the user otherwise we output any errors
so we'll take the same logic as we have
done here so this is if empty
if the data that's been posted is equal
to also easily put a false so if we have
if we if we have posted data so if it's
not empty and if the errors are not if
the errors are empty so if MIT errors is
true this means we have posted the form
and no errors okay otherwise what do we
do well we said otherwise if empty air
is equals false because otherwise else
could mean that we've that we have well
essentially this is you know this would
just this would just sort of do
something even if we haven't posted so
let's go ahead and just say else if and
here we're doing else if empty air is is
equal to false so there we go so if if
that then we just output errors so this
is whoops this is if we've whoops this
is if we've got no errors this is if we
have errors so we echo out errors
remember we have our output errors
function that we created earlier and
then we passed through an array here so
errors okay so here is where we post
stuff so we'll just go ahead an echo
okay otherwise we up our errors and
that's it so let's go ahead and refresh
and see how this works click Change
Password and it says feels marked with
an asterisk so incorrect are required
and your current password is incorrect
so we're echoing out you know these two
errors here if we go ahead and into all
the correct data so password one
password one it's just as okay so we'll
you know will just be will just be read
changing the user's password and then
redirecting them here
okay so now what do we want to do well
we'll leave that to the next part of
this piece of the tutorial
but what we're actually going to be
doing is we're going to be going and
creating a Change Password function
passing through the users ID passing
through the new password that they want
to change this to and then we're going
to be redirecting and showing the user a
success message so we'll do that in just
a moment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
