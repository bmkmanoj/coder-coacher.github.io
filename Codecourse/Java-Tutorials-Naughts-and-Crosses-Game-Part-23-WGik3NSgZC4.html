2 of the knots and crosses going to
answers so what we're going to do this
time is we're going to actually create
our play method so what this is going to
require is we're going to need to create
a current player we're going to need to
create the check queen method and we're
going to have to create a method to
attempt to change it so what we're going
to do is up here I'm dhitha jbutton our
grid go to sleep public it which is
going to be an array it's going to be
our board goes new int nine and then
we're going to create a boolean 2
1,000,000,000 1 equals false and public
hint current in current player equals 1
okay and so what we can do that is we're
going to use a current player to change
which players actually being played
we're going to say in here is if attempt
change and perhaps can click ID then
that's going to be a successful a
successful move so now we need to create
the attempt change method so public
boolean attempt change int square um
wise where's that throwing in our of
Misrata okay let's hang in tidy so what
we're going to return from the attempt
change is whether or not the tile or the
square selected is actually free so if
board
Square doesn't equal zero return false
return true so just above return trip
gets a Ford square equals current layer
okay so if we just tidy that up slightly
okay we will actually add one more
method in here and but that's when we've
actually created our image icons which
don't exist yet so there's no point so
if we come back up here to play and once
we've actually played the move we can
say the current player need to swap so
current player equals current layer is
equal to one ? to colon one now all that
basically is is a single line statement
that says if the current player is equal
to one then the current player is equal
to two else is equal to one so that's
about four lines of if statements in a
single line so just tidy sup the code of
it it's what we need to do now is run
check with clearly we've not actually
got anything to do with the check win
yet so we will actually need to fix that
so once we've done the check win and if
we can't actually move then it's an
invalid move so there's no point doing
anything really so what we need to make
is our check wit now the check win is
actually going to be a fairly large
method because it's going to include a
lot of this statements so you're going
to include eight I believe one after the
other the public void check win
quick okay if board 0 equals board 1 and
board 1 equals board to and Ford to
doesn't equal 0 win 0 so just create a
method here public void win in square
okay so weak lastly we'll just tidy this
up window okay so we'll copy this method
so one tooth on to start with and we can
just go through and change your values
so here I'm going to be 3 equals 4 and 4
equals 5 and board 5 doesn't equal 0 and
then here just going to be 8 8 equals 7
and 7 equal to 6 so what this is doing
is it's going to be checking the
horizontal wind conditions of our board
so actually inside this is statements we
also need to update the wind condition
to win five and win 8 for the two extra
statements so as these are checking the
horizontal so if a horizontal rows got a
line of three in it that is going to win
it so now when you do the vertical so if
we just copy and paste that entire
segment just create a little line break
here show us the difference between them
okay and so we're going to want to do
for this
is bored 0 equal to board 3 and board
three it's equal to board six of the es6
and board six dozen equal zero then win
six okay now we're going to do board 1
equals board for board 4 equals board
seven and board seven doesn't equal zero
then win seven now the final one is
going to be win 8 and it's going to be
bored 2 equals board 5 or 5 equals board
eight and board aight doesn't equal zero
so that's our vertical wind conditions
as well so that's going to check the
vertical rows to see if we've actually
got to win now go down here and I'd be
sure ok so that's going to check to see
if we've got a win there so there's only
one other way you can win in knots
crosses and that's the diagonals so if
we'll just copy a single fact copy two
of these statements and put them here
now the top one is going to be if board
0 equals board for and board 4 equals
board eight and i'm bored aight doesn't
equal 0 then win with condition eight
and then the other one will be if board
6 equals board for and board 4 equals
board to and bought two dozen equals
zero then wind condition to so well each
these statements is doing is it's
checking our integer array which we've
created here which is going to be our
board which is going to be by default 0
it's making sure that each one of those
cells
in the wind the wind conditions is equal
to each other and that they aren't equal
to 0 because if they're equal to 0 then
nobody's actually moved okay for pimps I
bored yeah for int I equals 0 I is
listen or dot length I plus plus what
we're going to do here is the draw
condition so if no square on the board
is equal to 0 and we haven't won then
withdrawn so if Ford I equals 0 okay
just exit the method and then here if
not one bra okay so we need to create a
method down here called draw so public
void draw okay we'll end it there so in
the next the next method or next episode
we're going to just finish it off we're
going to add images to our buttons we're
going to have a graphical displays to
who's got which square and we're going
to add the ability to exit restart draw
win etc</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
