is running we're now going to take a
look at how we can actually connect
using a specific user name and a
password if required and automatically
select and use a database when we sign
in so we obviously have databases with
our applications and that's that part of
things but let's first focus on how we
use a MySQL command line interface so
the first thing that we do is we type
MySQL so let's go ahead and say MySQL
and what we then do is supply the you
option and this is the user that we want
to sign in with so at the moment my
default installation has a root user
with no password so hitting Enter on
this command will go ahead and sign me
in to the MySQL monitor and we can go
ahead and just do what we want to do now
with that user in mind if I was to go
ahead and exit and just clear the screen
and I wants to do my SQL you root and
then Appy option what this will do is it
will prompt me to enter a password so if
you have a user account with a password
you need to go ahead and use the P
option now in my case there's no
password for this account so I can just
go ahead and hit enter without typing
anything and this will sign me in as
usual now if we want to go ahead and
automatically select a database just
just exit from here and clear the screen
if we want to automatically sign in and
use a database immediately we can go
ahead and do so now this don't confuse
this with actually supplying a password
so this is my database name here so what
I'm saying to this to the monitor now is
I want to log in with the user root I
want to supply a password and then I
want to immediately select the database
called database now in this case we
don't have a database called database
but let me go ahead and just choose the
database that does exist now when I go
ahead and edit enter here it prompts me
for my password and go ahead and hit
enter and what this will now do is it
will sign me in and I'm now using the
database that I've provided with the
command so that's how we sign into our
MySQL monitor using a user and password
and automatically selecting the database
that you want to work with assuming it
does already exist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
