and you can actually download this
template from the course downloads so if
you haven't done that already go ahead
and grab this put it in a file called
index.php and then make sure you can
access it within your browser and at the
moment all this does is go through to
sign up PHP of course that could be
anything it could be a proper route in
this case we're gonna just test our in
this file as you can see at the moment
that file does not exist so the first
thing that we're gonna do is create that
file just in here so let's say sign up
dot PHP and let's just take a look at
the form as well you can see that the
forms here we've got a method of post
and we've got an email address field in
here obviously in reality you would have
more fields in here but really this
doesn't matter for the purpose of this
video now we're also pulling in Twitter
bootstrap as well just from MaxCDN and
that just gives us this nice nice design
it's not really important so what we now
need to do is implement the client-side
part of recapture and by this I
basically just mean the JavaScript and
then the element that we use to register
the actual widget so you can see that
the key is already included just in here
so you don't need to do anything with
that first step those two paste in this
JavaScript so just before the end of the
body just there we're gonna go ahead and
implement that script in there so that
won't have changed anything on our page
at the moment but now what we're going
to do is we're going to place this
element where we want it to show so I
want it to show just after the last form
field in this case it's the email
address and I wanted to show before the
submit button and remember our key is
just in there so now we can see we have
our recapture form on the page what I'm
just going to do temporarily I'm just
going to add some styling to this so we
can see that we've got a class of G -
recapture so we can just go ahead and
set a margin on the bottom 10 pixels
obviously you can do this an external in
an external style sheet that would be
better
we now have a fairly nice-looking form
without reCAPTCHA a little bit of margin
on the bottom so the next step then is
just to take a look at what happens and
what we have available in our post
superglobal when we submit this form so
to do that I'm going to do a var dump on
dollar underscore post so what's going
to happen then is I can enter an email
address here for the purpose of this
video we did obviously don't need this
information when I hit sign up you can
see that we've got our email and we also
have this G recapture response that has
been automatically appended to our form
so that's then being sent through and
that's hokum we can then send off to
Google for verification and we do all
this on the back end so the next step
then is to actually take that value and
go ahead send it off to Google via API
and verify it so you wouldn't only have
things like your email in here so I'm
just going to put this in here we're not
actually going to be using it but you
would do your validation of your normal
email username password whatever and now
we're gonna use curl to send a request
off to Google's API so let's create a
curl instance here with curl in it and
we're going to set some options here so
we we're gonna set these in an array so
he's use the setup command that we use
array we pass in the curl instance and
then we have an array just here so the
first one is curl option return transfer
and we're going to set that to one the
next is the actual URL so it's curl
option URL now where do we actually send
this request to well if we head over to
the page here you can see that the step
two we need to send it to this URL and
we need to send these two items the
user's IP address is optional I'm going
to leave that out but I'll show you
where you would put that anyway so
that's the URL we need to send to so
it's Google comps recapture API site
verify the next step is to say that we
want to use post data so we say curl opt
post and we set that to one and now we
need to set our post fields which is the
secret
and the response and then optionally the
IP address so it's curl opt post fields
and this is going to be an array again
so let's pull this down and the first is
the secret the second is the response
which is that response that we saw in
the post superglobal and then
additionally you can send across the
remote IP in whichever way you're
grabbing that I'm going to leave this
out for now but at least you know you
can implement it later so the secret is
basically our app secrets you don't want
anyone to see this and the response is
that response we got through in that
post when we actually submitted the form
here so what we're going to do is just
remind ourselves of that I'm gonna kill
the page here I'm gonna do a var dump
and dollar underscore post so let's
click this and we've been asked to
select all images with pajas great so
let's have a look there that looks like
a pie and we're through so that's so so
it's G recapture response and you can
see that long string in there that's
what we need to send through so let's
paste in this and access that key
perfect so now what we want to do is
actually grab the response that we get
back from Google so we're going to
create a variable called response I'm
gonna say curl execute I'm gonna pass in
our curl instance now this is a JSON
string so we need to JSON decode it now
by default this will give us an object
if you did want an array back you can
just pass true as the second option so
now let's do a var dump on response and
see what we get back and providing
you've done everything correctly you
should see a response here so I'm gonna
ignore the email for now and we need to
take two items with a commercial lorry
that looks like one great so the hit
sign up oh yes of course we are dumped
out there so let's just refresh that
great so we have success true so what if
the
do go wrong well in that case it would
either be if I fail the check or I don't
fill this out so if I hit sign up now
you can see that we actually get success
false and then we have a list of error
codes within an array here so what you
can do is you can loop through them or
grab the first one redirect the user
back and show them an appropriate
message now I'm going to try and fail
this so commercial lorries these are
definitely not commercial lorries so
let's hit verify Oh it's asking me again
so that's how we go School Bus these are
not school buses and we'll try once more
but if this still won't last through
that's fine okay fine
so let's ignore that for now but
basically you'd get a list of errors in
there and you can redirect off if you
want so what we're gonna do then is just
quickly we're gonna say if response
success or you could check for a faulty
value here you would redirect with an
error now otherwise down here you would
register your user so again we're not
gonna cover this but to go ahead and
redirect or do whatever you want here to
tell the user that they've failed it's
they can try again so that is basically
how we implement recapture without
pulling in the external library it's
pretty straightforward the user hits
this it's appended to our form we go
ahead and you know select things we'll
ice cream and all that stuff so hit
verify we hit sign up and we get that
success</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
