called array access in order to make it
easier for us to bind and resolve
classes now before we get into that back
in our container test I'd just like to
mention that our code coverage isn't as
high as it could be in other words we
haven't tested everything that we could
have tested and that's because I wasn't
really trying to test the class I was
just trying to give you a taster of how
you would do it and how you would go
about it so with that being said we're
going to create one more test I'm going
to call this public function test array
access works as intended and we're just
going to write this test really quickly
we're going to say this container bind
foo and we're going to bind that
actually let's call it let's call it
cooks to avoid confusion and we're going
to bind that to this bar class down here
and actually I did that wrong we should
be doing it using this method and you'll
notice that it looks kind of like an
array and it's the name array access and
we'll be getting into how it works in a
couple of moments we just need to
quickly say object equals this container
cooks and we're going to say this assert
instance of our object so if we run this
we're obviously going to get an error
cannot use object of type as array and
that's because we haven't implemented
array access yet so let's do that last
container implements array access and we
need to add a user statement for that
now if we go to our browser and hit
refresh we're going to get this error
and that's because the array access
interface contains well if we refresh
again for abstract methods so let's add
those quickly we have offset yet which
takes one parameter we have offset set
or
takes key and value we have offset
exists which tanks key and finally we
have offset unset which takes key and I
think they're all spelled correctly
let's check yep
great so in offset get we're going to
resolve resolve the class and return it
so return this resolved key enough set
set we're going to bind the dependency
so well by the class this band value key
value offset exists we're going to
return array key exists key this
bindings offset unset we're just going
to unset this bindings key so if we run
the test now we get green perfect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
