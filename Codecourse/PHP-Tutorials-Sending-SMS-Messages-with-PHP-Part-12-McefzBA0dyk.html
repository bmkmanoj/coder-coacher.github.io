welcome to this PHP tutorial on sending
SMS or text messages using PHP so what
we're going to be doing is we're going
to be signing up for a website that
allows us to send text messages we can't
do this solely with PHP we have to have
some kind of platform to do this through
and we do this using a site that allows
us to purchase credits for text messages
and then access their API now if I just
go ahead and open up my web browser I'm
using sourced SMS the reason being is
extremely easy to use and it's really
really quick to it you know like sign up
purchase credits and get the API going
and it's relatively very straightforward
so what I'm going to be doing is I
already have an account so I'm going to
be just taking you around how you would
register and about purchasing credits
just so you're aware and then I'll go
ahead and login and we'll get down to
the PHP part of this so obviously you
would go ahead and you'd sign up as
usual and you would also then select a
bundle so for example you might want to
purchase 50 or 100 credits and then you
could use them just you know send send
you know messages they have a page on
pricing and cutter and and coverage so
you know you can find all that out all
the information here so I won't go
through absolutely everything but go
ahead and take a look here and the costs
are clearly outlined and the text per
message as well it's obviously the more
you purchase the cheaper it is okay so
we we also have a developer section here
and this just goes through the API how
we can use it give some examples I'm
going to be going through the
nitty-gritty and how we actually do this
on our own terms so we can go ahead and
we can implement this into any system we
like so you may have a system that you
you know want to authenticate use with
or send them out some information or a
code or so
thing I'm going to be sort of taking you
through the more technical side of this
and showing you how to set it up how to
actually send a message as well okay so
let's go ahead and take a look at this
there's some information here get a free
test account with ten credits so I guess
go ahead and follow them instructions
and get your test account I think that
really helps because then you've got ten
you know text messages essentially or
SMS messages that you can go ahead and
test with obviously you know you might
not want to initially purchase a bulk
amount of text messages okay so the sign
up process relatively straightforward
I'm just going to go ahead and log in
you can see that I'm already logged in
here I've you know just been signed in
already
I've sent one text message that was just
an example that I used before I start
the tutorial but now we're going to go
ahead and look at the the code side of
this now if I just go ahead and
duplicate this tab and head back over to
their home page they've got some
interesting and useful information in
the developer section which we've
already gone over so we can download
some pre-built examples here but what
I'm going to be doing is taking you
through this from the start to try not
to go ahead and copy and paste these
examples it's really good to sort of get
to know how to use these and that makes
it a lot easier to incorporate this into
your own system eventually so what we're
going to do here is instead of
downloading these examples we have an
API tab within our control panel if you
like and this just outlines all of the
data that you need to pass to their
server and you can see here that we've
got a URL that we will pass specific
data to which will then send a message
so we need to make sure all this
information is correct we do have this
really useful well the really useful
ability to change this 0 here to 1 and
what that does is it allows us to any
information to be fed back
so it basically display displays any
information back from source SMS so
without further ado let's go ahead and
start to actually build out our PHP page
and actually send a text message
now obviously you guys aren't going to
see my file
and you're not going to see you know the
text message come through but I'm going
to take you through how you know we are
sort of look what what we're looking for
and what conformation we're looking for
to see if the text has actually been
sent so obviously you'd go ahead and try
this out with your number and receive
the message on your phone but if you do
run into problems then there's certain
things that we can check so we'll be
briefly touching on them as well so
obviously the first thing we want to do
is open a PHP tag we're going to specify
just a few variables or a couple of
variables first and then we're going to
create an array of all this data we're
not going to do it like they've done it
on the site in this tab here in here
these are just the examples of which you
know variables need to be stored so
we're going to be doing it slightly
differently so let's first of all go
ahead and create a variable called URL
and we're going to include here the URL
that we need to you know parse all this
data to so let's go ahead and copy that
and paste it into there okay so the next
thing we're going to do is create a
variable and empty variable and this is
going to be the query string that we
pass through to this PHP page here so
I'm going to say fields underscore
string and I'm going to make that equal
to null or set the value of null to this
let me just go and tidy this up and
we're done
so what we're going to do now is we're
going to create an array of all this
data that we need to send and I'm going
to I'm going to implement this data
within here obviously if you'll create
some kind of like contact form or you
know you're doing this backend for
example if someone made a correct
purchase or something all this data
would sort of be injected in via however
you're you know retrieving this it uses
information but I'm going to be sort of
plugging this in hard coding in for now
so let's go ahead and create this
variable I'm going to call it fields and
it's going to be an array so I'll pull
that down we're going to create the key
and the key and the value for each
element here so the key is obviously the
you know just the elements reference if
you like so I'm going to say from first
of all
Alex oops now all of this data that I'm
typing here is
or here it's exactly the same as this so
from from from is just what appears on
the phone when the message is received
so I'm just going to say from Alex I'm
going to go ahead and just tap this over
a bit just so we've got enough room keep
it tidy and we need to do all of these
as well so I've got them written down
next to me I'm going to go ahead and do
them all and explain them as we go along
so to some of them are very very you
know obvious so this is the number that
we are sending this message to so I'm
going to go ahead and type in my mobile
now it's important to note that this has
been done without the without the
country code now you're not going to be
able to see this because I've I would
have blurred out obviously I don't give
my mobile number away on my cell phone
number away but this is done without the
country code because we're going to
specify this a bit later on instead so
here we're going to say message this one
is very obvious and all I'm going to do
is just say hello there okay so the next
is the username in the password that you
have with source SMS another password
isn't as obvious so the username mine's
just oops PHP academy' and the password
which is specified as P word isn't the
password it's the API key so now I'm
going to go and show you how to get your
API key so if we go over to main you can
see here we've got the credit status
blah blah blah and here we have our API
key and this is the password that we
send as the block this is the data that
we send us the password so that's the
API key just there now we have this
value hash which is basically an
authentication how can I say okay
authentication process on their end so
this is always going to be the same so
if we go over to the API tab we just
basically copy this
and that says here authenticate server
requests so we don't need to edit that
we keep it the same and there's no need
to change this now we're going to
specify the country code so in my case
I'm in the UK so it is four four and
then the last piece of information that
we need is the well whether or not to
display the information and for now I'm
going to put one because it's important
that I see back that the the message has
been sent correctly okay so I'm going to
go ahead and just print our on this
these fields and we'll see this data if
we go over to here there we go
so we have an array with all these bits
of data and now what we're going to be
doing in the next part of the video is
we're going to be looping through these
using the URL encode function the PHP
URL in code function which I'll briefly
explain in the next part and then we're
going to be we're going to be sort of
creating a query string out of these
that we can then pass through to the
source SMS API and we're going to do
that using curl so I'll explain that all
in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
