to the if statement that we're going to
cover here and that's called the switch
statement now you might not use these
often but they are more flexible and
sometimes clean a solution when your if
statements are potentially going to get
a little bit messy so let's take a look
at how this looks and then we'll build
up a kind of real world example of this
so this is a switch statement notice
it's pretty similar to an if statement
where instead of if we just use switch
now inside of this this isn't a blocker
that's going to be run if this evaluates
to true what we're basically doing is
we're taking a value into here and then
in here we set a series of cases where
we do something if these match so in
this case we're gonna say case 1 well if
that's the case we want to run something
here and then down here we want to break
so this might seem a little bit odd but
let's go ahead and test this out so
we're gonna echo out here the value is 1
so if what we pass in is 1 so this is
the kind of condition then we echo this
out and then we break now what we can
also do is set a default but we'll take
a look at this in the browser and then
we'll have a look at that as well let's
give that a refresh and we know the
value is 1
now if the value is 2 none of these
cases will be met because we only have 1
in there and we don't see anything but
that is where our default case comes in
where we can do something here and we
can go ahead and break if this isn't met
so it's kind of like an else within an
if-else statement so the value is
unknown for example let's give that a
refresh the value is unknown because it
doesn't match this case so of course
what we can do is go ahead and duplicate
this down and have case 2 the value is 2
and as you would have guessed we get
that out because the value that we've
passed in is 2 and again if we choose 3
the value is unknown now what we can
also do is use comparison operators in
these so let's take a look at kind of
real world example of what we might want
to do now let's say the weather
that we get from anywhere is currently
sunny and what we're gonna do is set a
color to a default of null and based on
the weather we're gonna set a color that
maybe we want to display to represent
the weather so in this case an
if-statement would be a little bit messy
because we would have to do if else if
else whatever so we're gonna say switch
and this time we're gonna do something a
little bit different we're gonna say
switch true now might seem really weird
but what we're doing here is we're
saying we're passing in a true value so
all of these conditions or cases will be
attempt to be evaluated so in here I'm
gonna say case weather which is a
variable we're using outside of here is
equal to sunny then we want to do
something in here so we're going to
break this and then in here we're gonna
say well if it's sunny maybe we should
set the color here to blue that we've
defined as a null up there we've already
looked at null as well okay so now if
the weather is cloudy maybe we want to
set the color to gray and then down here
once again we break that now you can add
default in here I'm not going to but we
can kind of get the idea from this
example now we can echo out the color
and we should see the color depending on
what we've chosen for the weather so now
when i refresh we see blue if I change
this over to cloudy we see gray
brilliant so the way that we've set this
up is quite common if we have a more
complex way to check things rather than
using an if statement which can start to
look a little bit messy this is a little
bit easier to read so that is why we've
done that okay so that's all we're gonna
cover for switch that is pretty much it
you won't always need to use it but like
I said these things start to get a
little bit messy if you are using if
statements and at least if you see this
now you'll recognize the syntax and
you'll know why it's being used</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
