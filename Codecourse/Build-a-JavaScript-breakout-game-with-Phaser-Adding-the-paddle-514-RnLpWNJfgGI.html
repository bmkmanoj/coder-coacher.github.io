pretty straightforward it's going to be
exactly the same process that's adding
our bricks but of course with a paddle
we only have one of them so it makes it
a little bit easier so the first thing
I'm going to do if you haven't already
copy over the paddle graphic that I
supplied as part of this course and we
already know that the first thing that
we need to do is head over to our
state's head over to boot and go ahead
and load this asset in or this image in
so we're gonna call this paddle we're
gonna reference the paddle PNG and
that's loaded in now and we can create a
prefab for this paddle now we don't
necessarily need to create a prefab for
this paddle but I like doing this
because when we eventually start to move
our mouse we want the logic that
determines where the paddle should be
inside of its own class it's always
nicer to kind of break these things up
so let's go ahead and just copy the code
that we have out for the bricks it's
gonna be pretty much similar and let's
go ahead and create this paddle j/s
prefab okay let's change the name over
to paddle and of course we're gonna do
exactly the same thing here we're gonna
reference the parent constructor passing
in the position that we want this to be
in and of course we reference the paddle
graphic that we've just pulled in now
we're still gonna enable physics on this
because of course the ball needs to
bounce off of the paddle what we're also
gonna do is just change the anchor over
to this so we're gonna set this to and
you'll see this often created 0.5 and
0.5 just so we can position it correctly
within the world now immovable is also
true this doesn't necessarily mean that
we can't move the object but if for
example we didn't add the fact this was
a moveable when the ball hits the paddle
the paddle would actually kind of drop
down and leave the screen so we want
this to be immovable even though in the
update method that we're gonna look at a
little bit later this is going to
actually be able to move okay so now
that we've done this what we can do is
over an hour game go ahead and import
this paddle and we're gonna do exactly
the same thing here as we did before set
up paddle I'm gonna go ahead and create
that set up paddle method and of course
import that and add it to our world so
to do this then we're gonna say this
paddle and we're gonna assign this to a
new paddle like so and we're gonna go
ahead and pass in this game because we
know that that
is required as part of a phasor sprite
we're gonna say this game world center X
because we want the paddle to be in the
center by default and we're gonna say
this game world and then the height but
within a minus 100 that's just going to
be 100 pixels from the bottom of the
world now at the moment we look like we
have an unexpected token so let's just
add that comma in the paddle is not
defined so at the top here of course we
want to do exactly the same thing and go
ahead and pull the paddle in like so
give that a refresh and it looks like
brick is not defined see why that might
be
of course we've probably left something
in here to do with a brick and of course
there we go so you probably noticed that
let's go ahead and export the paddle
glass that we've just created so at the
moment then the paddle isn't visible on
the screen what we need to do is over in
our game as we set the paddle up we're
gonna say this game add existing and
we're going to go ahead and define this
paddle like so give that a refresh or
wait for it to reload and you now have
your paddle at the bottom of the screen
and you can adjust where this sit so you
could say something like minus 200 if
you wanted this to be a little bit
closer to the items here it's entirely
up to you
so that is pretty much it we've added
our paddle in and we're ready to move on
to the next part we're going to look at
actually moving the paddle along the
screen using the mouse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
