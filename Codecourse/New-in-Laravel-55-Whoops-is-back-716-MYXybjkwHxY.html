but laravel 5.5 will ship with a new
error handler now it's not technically
new because this was actually around in
laravel 4 and was removed in laravel 5
so if you have worked with laravel 4
previously you will recognize the error
handler whoops so like I said this comes
with laravel 5.5 so of course we don't
need to go ahead and install this let's
just take a really quick look at what
this looks like just in case you are new
to this and we'll see what it can do
it's a lot nicer and it's a lot clearer
exactly what's happening so this design
has obviously evolved it looks a little
bit different from the laravel 4 days
but we have the exception up here or
whichever error we are throwing we have
a stack trace down the side so it's
really easy to go ahead and just check
out where this error originated from of
course we have the error here with the
line and lots of context here as to
what's gone wrong and we also have the
environment and details as well which
can be incredibly useful so once again
there's not really much to say about
this but whoops is back in now eval 5.5
and it should help you debug if anything
is going wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
