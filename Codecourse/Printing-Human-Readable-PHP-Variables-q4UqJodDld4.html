print our within PHP and how it's really
useful when you are developing so let's
take an example let's create an array
and we're gonna output this in a human
friendly readable way so let's create an
array here and we'll add a couple of
elements to this so items and we'll add
a couple more elements within another
array okay so obviously looking at this
code you know exactly what it is you
know the elements within it with the
nesting you know that you know the
elements are available at a particular
key however if you're working with an
API or you're working with a class and
you're not sure what this returns so you
have an array returned or something like
that or an object returned you're gonna
need to examine it in some way so we'll
use this an array as an example let's
take a look at how we do this so we use
print our so let's pass in what we want
to output in this case it's our array
and you can see that we get out this now
this isn't much more readable let's say
we're working with some kind of API and
we have lots of data within here this
could easily fill up the page and just
look a complete mess so what we can
actually do is we can add pre tags in
the front and the end
now what pre tags are let's just comment
in fact let's just remove them for now
you'll actually see that on this page
this is just being output like this but
if we were to review the page source you
can see that the formatting is already
there what pre tags do is preserve the
normal formatting for you so if we do
add these pretax here like so and you'll
need to put an echo here what this means
is is that we're now echoing out not the
return value of this but we're adding an
echo so we have an optional parameter
that we actually want to return the
value by default this is set to false
but we want this set to true so print
our is now going to return the value of
the human readable out
and then we echo out surrounded by
pretax and then obviously commas here
just not concatenate but work with the
echo to append these so now if we
refresh we see that we get a human
readable version of that array again
particularly useful if you're working
with data that you can't immediately see
the structure of so that's print art and
how we use it to output a human friendly
readable version of a variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
