image to our page so it fills the entire
background of our viewport you can see
here I'm moving this this my browser
around basically and the ratio of this
image is staying exactly the same all
it's doing is its covering the
background as best it possibly can
depending on the size of the viewport so
that's what we're going to be looking at
we're also going to be adding this text
here at the end of the video just as a
little bonus so let's first of all talk
about the actual image itself so I have
one image here that we're going to be
using this is just a photograph that I
have scaled down to 1200 by 900 pixels
and I've also exported it so it has the
lowest possible file size that still
maintains its original quality so I'll
leave you to play around with this in
whatever image editor that you're using
but part of doing this is making sure
that this image isn't going to load so
slowly and that you harm your users
experience and make sure that the image
is suitable to use as a background image
so once you've done that we can go ahead
and actually start to work on the code
here I've just basically got a standard
document laid out here and I've linked
in this main dot CSS stylesheet and
that's in the CSS directory here and
like I said just a moment ago I've got
my image within this IMG directory in
the same folder so we can set that as
the background so the first thing that
we want to do is apply some styles to
the body of the page and we want to
define that we want a background image
on the body
obviously usually what you would do is
you would say something like background
color and then you could give a color
here and that would change the
background of your cutout of your page
fairly straightforward but this time
what we want to do is instead we want to
define a background image and we need to
load in the URL that we want
to apply this background image so we
need to go back a directory because
we're currently within the CSS directory
and then we need to go into the image
directory and we need to choose that
image there so it's freedom jpg now if
we take a look at the background now you
can see it pretty much looks like the
effect that we're going for however the
only problem is is that what's happening
at the moment is this is actually
repeating itself and it's staying at it
as its original sort of size like this
so if you can see here it's not looking
great sort of repeating now you can
obviously use background repeat' like
this and then you can say no-repeat or
you can include all of these in one
shorthand property but I'll do it like
this for clarity and that will go ahead
and get rid of that but you still
haven't solved the problem of having
this as a as a as a any just filling the
entire background now we have this CSS
property called background size and this
allows you to specifically define the
background size so I could say for
example background size and I could
choose say a percentage value here and
that would be useful in some cases where
we want to fill 50% of the parent
container in this case the parent
container or the container that we're
applying this to is the body and you can
see there it is showing a 50% but we
don't want to do that what we want to do
is we want to use one of these special
properties and we have things like
contain and this allows us to contain an
element within something in this case
though it's not really working we have
issues with applying this to the audio
element anyway because we've not defined
a height and a width for the body
element if for example we were to define
the define the height and the width on
the audio is 500 pixels you can imagine
that that would then fill that in and so
if you just if we just inspect this here
and we choose the body you can see here
that that basically just fills in as
much as it can and again this is useful
in some respects but we're not going to
be doing that either what we're going to
be doing is we're
using cover now what Carver will do is
it will cover it as much as possible
maintaining the aspect ratio but so the
height and the width of this is outside
of the container so we don't see any of
the background behind it for example
that white that we saw a moment ago so
now what's actually happening is as we
move around you can see that this is is
looking good
now I it's almost like I just lied
because you can see we've got this white
bit here but that is not to do with the
background size property that's not the
background sizes properties fault this
is because our body is currently ending
here so it's doing its job absolutely
fine it looks fine here it's not doing
its job properly here because the body
is not 100% height so what we need to do
here is we need to target the Oddie and
the HTML elements and we need to define
a minimum height here of 100% so that's
self-explanatory a minimum height of
100% means it has to be at least 100% in
height and therefore we get this
affected despite the fact that the
viewport mark might be here down here so
it's we still get this nice effect like
this so this has solved the problem of
having our background size like that
this is how we're viewing it as it is at
the moment though and that's pretty much
it for the background so we've created a
background image that fills the entire
viewport which ever viewport that is so
now that we've done that the little
added bonus we're going to go ahead and
add some text to this to see how we
might do this on a page this is really
just for fun and just playing around
with things so you know don't take it
too seriously there could be other
content on this page but I'm going to be
pulling in google fonts here so let's
check that out in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
