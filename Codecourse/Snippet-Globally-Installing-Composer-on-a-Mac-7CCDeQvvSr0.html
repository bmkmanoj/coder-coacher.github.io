installing composer globally on a Mac so
I'm gonna walk through some of the
common problems how to actually get this
set up and then finally we're gonna
resort to using homebrew if nothing else
works so the first thing is of course
the reason we'd want to install composer
globally is because we don't really want
to every single time we download this go
ahead and pull in the composer PHA our
file and have to run that on its own
it's a little bit longer and kind of
gets in the way if you need to pull in
lots of dependencies so at the moment I
don't have composer installed globally
at all so if I go ahead and run it here
of course it's not going to work if we
just go over to any kind of directory so
let's go over to dub dub dub and make a
directory in here just called test maybe
go into this let's pull down composer
just to make sure now when you are
running this make sure you always come
over to this page first of all cause
just as a warning here the install code
is subject to change I'm gonna go ahead
and pop this all in here go ahead and
run this to unlink or delete the
composer setup file and of course from
here now I can either run composer or
PHP composer or PHP are to go ahead and
run composer but of course it still is
not installed globally so I'm sure you
know this if you're watching this video
we're I'm gonna show you how to set this
up now okay so let's go back to our home
directory here now the first thing we're
gonna do is go ahead and echo out our
path just to make sure that we have user
local bin inside of here now if you
don't see this in here at all you're
gonna need to export it to your path and
then go ahead and refresh your bash
profile so to do this you would go ahead
and export path and in here use dollar
path and then in here you would just
define user local bin and that will go
ahead and add it to your bash profile so
your bash profile lives within this
directory that we're in just at the
moment so to kind of refresh this what
you need to do is just run source and
then bash profile if you want to go
ahead and open that up in your favorite
text editor go ahead and have a look in
this file and you should see in there
now so that's the kind of first step
we're now going to do is do exactly what
we're going to do here but we're going
to copy this over to that directory so
there's a couple of additional options
we need to pass in when we are
installing composer now the first line
here just goes ahead and pulls down the
composer setup file the second one
verifies it which is really important so
let's go ahead and pull this over as
well that's all fine and the next one is
the actual setup itself now by default
this will copy it to the current
directory which of course we don't want
so we're going to go ahead and run this
but we're going to provide a couple of
additional options so the first one is
the installation directory of course we
now know that what we're going to do
because we have this in our brush
profile we're going to go ahead and
install this to use a local bin now
really importantly if we go ahead and
run this that's gonna work fine but
let's just open up a new tab and we will
go and look inside of there so let's go
over to user local bin and of course
that should be without the home
directory in there let's go ahead and do
a listing on this and you should see
composer just inside of here but it's
got a PHR extension so now what we can
technically do anywhere is run composer
phor even if it's not within that
current directory but that's not really
what you want so in this case let's
rerun this command and also give in the
file name option and go ahead and call
this composer and of course what you
could do is rename that file but this is
generally a little bit easier so that's
kind of redownload did it and if we go
ahead and do a directory listing over
here you can see we've got composer and
composer dot PHA R so now that we've
done that let's finish up by just
unlinking or deleting the composer setup
file and now pretty much wherever you
are so if we go over to dub dub dub test
we can run composer and we now have it
installed globally so that will pretty
much be ready for you to use wherever
you want now now a lot of composer setup
stuff is dependent on your version of
your operating system and also the
version of composer itself so the other
option is to use homebrew now we already
have
homebrew downloaded and installed so
what I'm going to do is just come over
to here and I'm going
remove composure and I'm going to remove
composure top tha ass they're no longer
in there if I come back over to that
test directory and I run composure we
now see there's no such file or
directory so the other option then is to
use homebrew go ahead and install it
using this command and just go ahead and
simply run through install composure and
that will pretty much handle everything
for you okay now that's done you might
need to follow any other instructions
that were given over here but if we come
back over to our test directory that
we're already inside of that we can go
ahead and run composer even though I've
deleted it and we can now have it
installed globally so they are a couple
of options to get composer installed
globally hopefully that helps and you
can now just use composer on its own
which of course is a lot easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
