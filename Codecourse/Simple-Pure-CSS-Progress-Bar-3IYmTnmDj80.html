creating a progress bar with CSS so you
can see it here on the screen we're
going to take a quick look at it in just
a moment and we'll I'll show you which
elements of this we're building up and
then we'll just dive straight in and
build the write the code for this so we
can see here that we've got this like
outer shell area and this is one element
in itself and then we have this fill
inside which is another element and with
this what you can do is you can go ahead
and control the size of this fill so you
can see the fill just in here at the
moment I have a style attribute on this
now this is useful if you want to
control this with JavaScript or you're
pulling this from a database and you
just want to output it onto the page as
a number percentage you wouldn't
necessarily want to do that with CSS you
could do but in this case it's perfectly
acceptable to have a style attribute and
have this in there second of all when I
do change this you can see that it
animates that's just watch that again so
if I just pull that away you can see
that animating up as well so we're using
CSS transitions for this so that's
pretty much how its structured and how
it works let's go ahead dive straight
into the code this is very simple to do
let's go ahead and build this so we're
gonna start out with a blank document
here if you don't already have this go
ahead and write it out we also have a
stylesheet linked in here this is just
called app dot CSS and it's living in
this CSS directory so we're gonna be
writing one of our styles in there so
the first thing I'm gonna do because
this percentage bar is going to take up
a hundred percent of the width of any
container that it's placed within I'm
going to create a wrapper on my page so
we've got a div with a class of wrapper
and that's gonna go inside of there
obviously this progress bar is going to
be placed anywhere on your page so we'll
just fill the contents basically so
let's just quickly create styles for
this this isn't actually part of the
progress bar it's just an example so
we've got a 500 pixel wrapper so now
what we want to do is just look at the
markup for this so I'm going to create a
div with a class of
progress bar and then inside of here I'm
going to create a span with a class of
progress bar fill so progress bar fill
there we go so a span with the class
progress bar filled we don't need to
pull this down onto another line we can
just keep it here of course there's not
gonna be any text in here either so now
that we've got this we all see have
nothing on the page we just have the
mark up here so we can play around with
this now developer tools if we want to
but let's go ahead and start the outer
shell so that's this progress bar class
so let's go ahead and say progress bar
and the stones that we're gonna enter
into here are we want it a hundred
percent of the width remember I said
that it's gonna fill hundred percent of
whichever container it's in we're gonna
give this a background color as well
obviously these colors are entirely up
to you but I'm gonna write the ones that
we saw in the example a minute ago so
for this case it's easier easier OE 0
it's a gray color we're also going to
give this a little bit of padding so
we're gonna give it three pixel padding
because we don't need fill to go to
right to the edges of this container and
then we're gonna give it a border radius
of three pixels so that just rounds out
the borders so you can see here if I
just zoom in we've just basically got a
gray rectangle I guess with both border
radius on there but we can do a little
bit better than this so we're gonna add
a box shadow that's going to give it a
nice shadow in there make it look inset
and just adds the effect of this of
course you don't have to do this if
you're going for a more flat look so
we're gonna have a box shadow we're
gonna use inset here to say it's going
to be an inset shadow we're going to say
0 pixels on the x-axis one pixel on the
y-axis I'm gonna have a three pixel
spread that's just how much this shadow
spreads out and then we need to choose a
shadow color in this case I'm gonna use
the RGB a function so it's red green and
blue and then an alpha channel as well
all this allows us to do is say 0 0 0
for black and then point two for the
Alpha Channel so we have some opacity
here so now when i refresh you can see
if we do min we've got
nice inset looking thing so it makes it
look a little bit more real if you like
so we're now going to focus on this
progress bar fill span now the reason
I've created this is a span is because
it's not a real element we want the
progress bar to act to sort of a real
element on the page and the span is just
not really that relevant
so we've chose a span you can you can
give this a an element type of Divya if
you really want to so let's say progress
bar fill now we need to give this a
height so I'm just gonna give it say 22
pixels
do whatever you want let's give this a
background color as well I'm gonna give
this background color of six five nine
CEF which is the same as cornflower blue
it's quite a nice blue color so we can
already check out how this is looking
well we can't actually see at the moment
the reason being is that we don't have a
display of block on this so display
block that's just because it's a span
element it's when i refresh here you can
see this has filled the entire container
by default because we we don't have a
predefined width on it it's what we
could do is to start with we could
always give this a width of zero so it's
always at the start but I'm gonna assume
you're going to be controlling this
either by saying style equals and then
giving it a percentage width or defining
that width in CSS but like I said before
you probably wouldn't define this width
in CSS because you'll probably be using
javascript to control this or just
outputting this onto the page so we've
got a width of 30% obviously that's just
going to give us an exact percentage
here because we have 100% width here but
now let's take a look at just adding to
this so we'll say border radius of three
pixels to match the outside border
radius so that just rounds off the edges
a little bit more so looks a little bit
nicer and finally we're gonna add our
transition so at the moment if I change
this width to say 60 or whatever percent
it just jumps straight up if you are
constantly updating this value you might
want a little bit of animation in there
to make it look a little bit smoother so
I'm gonna say transition and we're going
to transition on the width so this
allows us to basically say when the
width changes we want to transition this
now we choose our animation properties
so we're going to say we want the
animation to last 500 milliseconds this
can be anything at one second if you
want whatever you want
I found 500 milliseconds worked nicely
and then we choose the transition type
and that's ease in out you can have
anything you want here so you can have
ease in you can have linear it's
entirely up to you but I think ease in
out for a progress bar does look quite
nice so we've got our Styles done let's
just test out this transition so let's
say you are uploading a file with
JavaScript and you're constantly
uploading this percentage value if we go
to 50 you can see that animates nicely
if we go all the way to 100 we now have
a nice animated progress bar with CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
