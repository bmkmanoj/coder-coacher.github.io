demonstrating SQL injection and we're
going to be building writing a little
bit of code just to demonstrate how we
can actually delete this table via a
query to this orders table here so we'll
get to understand how serious SQL
injection is and if you've never heard
of SQL injection either this should
clarify exactly what SQL injection is
and then of course we'll go on at the
end of the video to talk about how you
can take some very basic steps just to
protect your queries so the theory
behind this is we've obviously just seen
this table here this is an orders table
it has a user idea of product and a
created at date so I've just created
five records in here just to demonstrate
I've also got this users table it
doesn't have any data in but it doesn't
really matter too much we're not going
to be directly querying this table we're
just going to be deleting this as an
attacker so what I want to do is within
my code I'm already connected I've
created a new work or instantiate a new
PDO instance I have connected with my
username and my password this website
database and now what I want to do is I
want to be able to take in an order
number within the query string here we
can pick that up using the get super
global what we're then going to do is
place that directly within a query
execute that query and then we'll
actually look at how we can delete that
user's table
what will then do is will recreate the
user's table and then we'll look at how
we can prevent this so the first thing I
want to do is just a quick if statement
to check if this get this key this order
key exists in the get super global array
what I'm then going to do is just store
this in a variable just here so I'm
going to say order and in here or say
order so we now have this order that we
can then place within a query so all I
really want to do here is just select
all the data in that table where the ID
matches this and then I'm going to put a
limit of one on the end of this and
we'll see why we're going to do that in
a moment so create a
a string just here now pull this down
just for ease of visibility of this so
I'm going to say select everything from
orders just a very basic query nothing
special and obviously could be better so
I'm going to say wear ID equals now this
can be just a number so we're ID equals
1 and then I'm going to do a limit of 1
so I'm going to do is I'm going to place
this order in there now as it stands
this is we're not actually running the
query yet but this is an unprotected
query completely unprotected if we were
to run this query we're not escaping
this here we're not doing anything we're
not using prepared statements which
we'll look at in a moment so if we run
DB query SQL this is then going to run
that query and there we go done so let's
just output this so we can see that
we're getting this result so I'm going
to call this a query and then down here
I'm going to do a print our on query
fetch object so let's take a look at
that in the browser and there we go so
we've got this object out you can see
that we've got our user our product and
if we change this order we obviously get
different information so this is
typically how you might do things if you
are selecting an order it could be
selecting a user it could be selecting a
topic anything you're doing this this
relates to pretty much everything now
because we're doing this query and we're
not escaping anything what we can
actually do is inject SQL into this so
we need to take a look at what we
actually want to do and I'll demonstrate
that within this actual query so order
at the moment is just a number
you expect a user to enter a number so 1
2 3 you don't expect them to type in a
string we're obviously getting an error
here because nothing's found you don't
expect that well the queries failed
because we put a string here we haven't
added single quotes around this but
we're basically expecting this to be a
number you may not see anything wrong
with this query but what's actually
happening here is we can alter the value
of order to change the structure of this
query so let's
for example order and I'm going to type
this directly in here we're going to get
rid of this let's say order is the
following string 1 and then a semicolon
now what this do what this will do is
this will end this particular query so
this would now what we're looking at is
multi queries a multi queries are
basically the ability to query a
database but separate queries via a
semicolon so the string is 1 semicolon
and then space and then drop table users
and then another semicolon and then 2
dashes
now 2 dashes is a comment if for example
I was to copy this and go ahead and
paste it into sequel pro you can
actually see here that we get this gray
sort of area here and what that's going
to do is it's going to select everything
from the orders table where the ID is 1
regardless of whether that exists it
doesn't matter this this will still be
run now what will also be run is this
which drops the table basically deletes
the table and there's no warning there's
no confirmation it will just delete the
table
so let's actually try and run this and
see what happens but I'm not going to do
this within here I'm going to actually
do this as an attacker so let's cut that
so we can paste it into the query string
in a moment and let's place the order
back in there so we're going to keep an
eye on here because what we're
effectively going to do is refresh after
we've run that page and this user's
table should be deleted so in here I'm
just going to paste that in so one
semicolon space drop table users
semicolon space - - and there we go now
that selected what we needed but when we
refresh inside of sequel Pro you'll see
that the users table has been deleted
this is a massive problem you can see
you know you could technically issue a
command to drop all tables now just very
quickly I want to talk about emissions
if you're setting up a database user
this is a good time to start to think
about
what permissions you need do you need a
database user ie when you connect to
your database here you wouldn't
obviously use the root account if for
example my account was Alex and I had
say a password in here would you want to
give this particular user the ability to
drop tables probably not because this is
the user that you using within your
application is very rare in fact
probably not you know probably never
need to do this at all you'd never need
to drop a table from your application so
you can disable the permission to do
that and that would have saved you a
lost table now apart from that we don't
just want to talk about permissions
because we need to talk about actually
how we're going to protect against this
kind of attack that's really really
important so what we're going to do here
is we're going to look at first of all
casting this order to an integer and
then we're going to quickly look at
prepared statements with PDO
so in this case we know that the order
number is always going to be an integer
we know that it is 1 2 3 is never float
is never an array it's never any other
datatype it's always going to be an
integer so what we can actually do is we
can cast this to an integer by placing
this in front of it now what this is
going to do is it's going to mean that
whatever we put in here will actually
let's take a look so let's kill the page
just here and let's echo out order now
without this we know we just get rid of
this line here without this we know that
when we do that we get this string here
we know that that's a problem we've just
seen that it actually goes ahead and
deletes the user's table and in actual
fact let's just create that user's table
again so we know that this deletes it by
if we cast this to an integer let's take
a look and now when we echo our order
what we get there we go we just get 1
now the reason we get 1 is because there
is a valid integer here so it
effectively just remove the rest of this
and therefore you have prevented that
SQL injection from taking place so let's
get rid of this now and let's talk about
how we can use prepared statements
because you may in fact have say an
order as a string it could be
it's very unlikely it could be a
username that you're importing it could
be anything so now we're going to look
at prepared statements to protect if you
can't cast to a particular data type and
just remember that casting to a string
isn't going to help you if it is if it
is going to be a string so casting isn't
always the answer so we are executing
our query here but we're not going to do
that anymore we're not just going to
blindly execute our query what we do
want to do though I'm going to bring
back this and just in fact now I'm going
to get rid of that for now just down
here what we're going to do is we're
going to use a statement and this allows
us to use the prepare method within PDO
so I'm going to say DB prepare and then
I'm going to prepare that SQL now this
has validated but it hasn't actually
executed this query yet now we're not
going to just blindly insert this order
into here what we're going to do is
we're going to use something called a
place holder and this will just be a
effectively a variable name if you like
of what you want to find later on so
what we're going to do now is down here
we're going to say statement equals
statement execute so that on this line
here when I actually execute we're not
running the query at all when we execute
we can pass in an array with the place
holder that we've given and the bound
value so in this case I'm going to use
the order key because I've called this
order and then I'm going to place the
value in here which is order so now
what's going to happen is we'll do the
same thing as we did before remember
we've recreated the user's table I'm
going to run the same query like so if
we head over to sequel Pro and refresh
you can see that that table has not been
removed but you could go on and within
PDO you could grab the data from this as
normal so for example we could say print
our statement fetch object like so if we
just get rid of that like that there so
we've now done exactly the same thing as
we did before but this time we've
protected against
this kind of attack so my advice would
probably be always use prepared
statements where you can now the mysqli
functionality within PHP doesn't allow
for multi statements by default whereas
PDO does so you may find that when
you're using MySQL line use query the
query method you won't actually be able
to execute multi line queries so you
will actually get a multi queries so you
will actually get an error back but that
doesn't excuse the fact that you should
be preparing everything so it's probably
a good idea to always do this to help
prevent SQL injection so we've looked at
a couple of examples here and we've
looked at how we can protect against
this we've learnt the basics of SQL
injection and we've looked at dropping a
table through a query string whereas
before it may have not been protected so
that's SQL injection in a nutshell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
