welcome to this tutorial on fade in fade
out and delay now the reason I've chose
the combination of functions or
animation functions in jQuery to make a
tutorial on is because these are really
interesting functions that can be
combined to create a nice message that
will appear and then disappear now we've
already looked at hide and show as well
as toggle however if you wanted to fade
something in or in fact scroll something
up or down which is another function
that you could go ahead and search the
jQuery documentation for then something
called the delay function is really
interesting I'm going to show you the
general concept and how the function is
appended to the element and how it
interacts with the element and then I'm
going to show you an easier way to do it
so the first thing I'm going to do is
just create a form a basic button and
then a div area underneath so let's go
ahead and create an input type and this
is going to be button the value of this
is just going to be save almost creating
a mock-up save button and then we're
going to have on click and that's going
to call a function and the function is
just going to be called save we're not
passing any parameters to it because we
don't actually need to for the purposes
of this tutorial now let's go down and
create a div and that's going to have an
ID obviously because we need to
reference it to put some text in and I'm
going to call that save feedback now
what's going to happen is we're going to
press the Save button we're going to get
some save feedback so let's just go into
our browser we're going to click the
Save button we're going to message just
under here saying thanks your profile
information has been saved or thanks
your information has been saved
something like that and then it's going
to well it's going to fade in it's going
to delay for a couple of seconds which
I'm going to show you how to do and then
it's going to fade out again so quite
useful animation technique okay so let's
go over to o the first thing I'm going
to mention is I'm actually going to hide
this div initially and this is going to
allow me to actually fill the div with
text before we fade it in and this is
really important in terms of animation
to make everything look not
let's just go up to the top of our page
and create an area where we can write
some CSS in now you'll notice I'm doing
this in my page I would never recommend
you actually put your CSS code in your
page always link it to a stylesheet
externally but for the purposes of this
tutorial it's quite short and neat so
you'll have style type equals text CSS
we have hash save underscore feedback
and we're going to give the property
display the value of none okay so that
automatic automatically going to be
hidden obviously it's hidden already
because there's nothing in it but this
is just going to make sure the actual
div itself is hidden okay so we need to
call a func well we're calling a
function called save so we need to
outline that let's go ahead and write
function save in our J funky is file and
in here we would presumably if we were
saving information in this way we would
do something like an HTTP request here
as I've shown in other tutorials in this
jQuery basics series now down here you'd
want to do the confirmation message so
this is just really just what you'd
actually do so ignore that if you like
okay so we need a dollar sign because
we're referencing a particular element
on our page and that is hash save
underscore feedback now as you've seen
before we can do dot HTML and this will
actually fill the div with some data so
I'm going to say your profile has been
updated now let's go ahead and preview
what's going to happen here because
actually you're going to not see
anything happen and that's because we've
actually hidden our div like I mentioned
earlier so it's important to actually
actually fill the div before we show it
now we can use the fade in function
which is extremely useful and looks a
bit better than the show function on its
own so this will just fade in the
contents of a div or any other element
without actually using the swipe effect
that we've previously seen so let's go
ahead and say so
feedback dot fade in and then we can
give it a time in milliseconds how long
you want it to fade in for so I'm going
to say 500 that's quite a nice time okay
now we can come down do exactly the same
thing so we can copy and paste this line
and this is the long way to do it so I'm
going to show you in a moment the easier
way to do it which looks a lot neater
and we can do it all on one line so now
what we want to do is we want to we'll
get rid of that entirely we want to
delay okay so inside of here we need to
give an amount in milliseconds again and
I'm going to say mm which is two seconds
so we can copy and paste this one now
come down paste that in and we can just
change that to fade out and that's kept
at 500 so extremely easy the first thing
that's going to happen is the safe
feedback div is going to be filled with
this text and then we go and fade in so
we essentially just pop that into the
div we fade in we delay which will
actually hold the execution of the
animation by two seconds and then it
will fade back out again
so hopefully where some of you've done
it everything right it should look a bit
like this there we go so it faded in
held for two seconds and then fade it
back out again it's a really really nice
script now well just quickly to mention
you might have seen websites such as
Twitter when you click on a Save button
you'll see a things scroll down from the
top and then it will scroll back out
after a certain amount of time or when
you click on it now using the similar
cut a similar concept to this it would
be the same skill level involved I guess
you'd need to know some CSS but that's
not a problem you would essentially
create a div that was at the top of the
page that was constantly hidden and you
can actually use the scroll I think it's
scroll out function but go over to the
jQuery documentation and search for
scroll and I'm sure you'll see something
it works in exactly the same way so you
can just substitute these in
and you can show that thing at the top
of the page you could then probably have
a link on there and a link to another
function to actually hide that div or
you could have it delay for a few
seconds so it's the same concept applied
to most animation so it's really easy to
actually take this and apply it to
something else so now we've got the
problem that we've referenced this safe
feedback div for different times and
ideally we want to reference it once and
the way we do that is we get rid of all
this so we'll rewrite this in a minute
what you can actually do is bind
functions on the end of each other so
they'll be done in the order that you
bind them and they will be done as they
would be as you would be calling this
safe feedback div so we say safe
feedback dot HTML and at the end of that
we don't use a line terminator here
obviously we just use a full stop and
then we do what we wanted to do so fade
in 500 dot delay 2,000 dots fade out 500
now we've just removed four lines of
code and the extra effort we've gone to
to reference the safe feedback give each
time we've just bind it onto the end of
this initial reference to this div so
you'll see that when we go and refresh
the page click Save you can see that it
has exactly the same effect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
