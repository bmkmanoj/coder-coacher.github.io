how we can upload files we have the
ability for the user to clear a far very
easily we have the ability to shrink
images on upload so this doesn't
actually shrink the image it just
uploads the far to the CDN and gives you
a URL back we have things like cropping
and we'll look at the mobile layout as
well that's really important so if a
user is uploading from a mobile or a
smaller device okay so first of all
let's just head over to the
documentation I'd highly recommend you
come over and look at these options as
well of course we're not going to cover
everything but we're gonna cover what I
generally consider to be the most
important things and they're things that
you'd probably use the most so different
sources then we know that when we click
choose afar here we have all of these
sources but of course you might want to
limit this to some extent so how do we
do that well there's a couple of way
that we can define the options so if we
just head over tabs which is the upload
sources you can see that if we scrolled
down we have these just here so we know
the names of them at least and what we
can do is either globally or locally
define these options so it's really up
to you how you do this and you've
already seen me use some of the global
variables just up here but of course
what we can do is locally do these here
as well now it really depends on your
needs if you have different requirements
for different upload buttons then you'd
want to define them locally just here
otherwise if you're saying to yourself
well I really never want to allow say to
upload on any of these except a link or
a drag-and-drop upload or choosing a
local file then you can go ahead and
define this globally so for the purpose
of this let's just define this globally
so we just simply pull over this global
and in here we just choose what we want
so for example if we only wanted a URL
and file we just go ahead and define
this here and when we go ahead and
choose it again you can see that we only
have two of these just here so you'll
notice that the order of this is
important as well if we just change this
around to file and you're
well you can see that the order changes
that's really nice as well it's a nice
touch and kind of gives you the ability
to put the one that you want as a
priority or one that you probably prefer
as a priority so again really
straightforward if you check out the
documentation it's pretty obvious that
you can do this so the other thing I
like is the ability to clear the image
so let's just jump over to the top and
we'll go over to the general
configuration here and you can see if we
just go down we have things like
clearable so we can set this as a global
or as a local using a data attribute so
for example if we wanted just this one
to be clearable we just say data
clearable and we set that to true so all
this is going to do is when we do drag a
file over you can see that we just have
the ability to remove it pretty
straightforward and we can just cancel
it saves the user having to maybe
refresh the page if they don't want the
profile image in there and really just
enhances the user experience so again
that's a really simple option and
there's tons of things down here that
you can do so definitely check out the
documentation now going on to some
slightly more advanced things like image
shrinking now we're going to talk a
little bit more about this later when we
speak about the upload care content
delivery network but we're now going to
cover things like image shrinking and
cropping so if we go to say manual crop
in the manual you can see that what we
can actually do is define this here so
for example data crop so let's just pull
this in now so data crop so by default
this will be disabled but what we can do
is allow for a free crop or we can
choose an aspect ratio or size so let's
say for example we wanted to check out
what free cropping can do well if I go
and upload a fairly large picture what I
can actually do now is rather than that
just being uploaded you see I dragged it
over but now we see crop and add this
image we can actually just freely crop
this there's no constraint we can
choose any portion of this image now
what's gonna happen is when we hit done
that's going to go ahead and upload the
file but when we hit save notice that
this has been appended on to the URL
that we saw before so whereas before it
was just the UUID now we have some
additional options and this is the point
this is the content delivery network
doing this on the fly so if we pull this
over now you can see that that crops to
exactly the region that I chose when I
uploaded so this is really awesome
because it means that you are uploading
the whole file you're not actually
cropping it and uploading the cropped
version if you just go ahead and get rid
of this last part we get the original
image so again we'll cover some of these
options a little bit later but just so
you know that's exactly what's happening
so for shrinking for example let's go
over to the documentation again and
let's search for shrink so shrink images
before uploading this is slightly
different so we can see here sometimes
you don't need high-resolution original
images to be uploaded at the same time
sending larger images can be expensive
or too slow for the user so what this
will do is it will shrink it before it's
uploaded so that's different from what
we saw earlier so let's see how this
works then we use the data image shrink
property so let's get rid of cropping
just for now but of course you could
combine them data image shrink now let's
say we want a maximum let's make it
quite small because that image that I'm
uploading is actually quite small and
let's go back and drag this over there
we go hit save
you can see there's no difference in
this URL so I'm not actually using the
properties of the content delivery
network but if we paste this in you can
see it's significantly smaller so you
got to be really careful about this if
you say have a preferred size that's
great but keep this relatively big so
you can manipulate it later but
obviously be wary if users are uploading
very large files is probably going to be
a bad experience for them waiting for
that image to upload although it is very
fast uploading say a megabyte megabyte
and a half our size with upload care is
really quick anyway so that's pretty
cool we've looked at the difference
between these two and really the good
thing about this is the content delivery
network so when we come back to that
later we will see exactly how that works
the last thing I want to look at though
in this part is the mobile layout so
what we do is when we do work with a
mobile layout anyway we obviously have
our meta tag just here if you're not
sure about this basically this will just
set an initial scale and basically allow
on a smaller device it will allow this
to nicely scale and respond so what
happens then when we go ahead and open
this on a desktop or a very large layout
well looks like this pretty
straightforward really easy to use but
when you are viewing this on a smaller
device you can see here we get a really
nice layout so imagine you're on your
phone or a very small device you have
the option to pick one of these so local
fast for example you can choose the
local files normal and of course this
will just look like it will on a mobile
device depending on the kind of
operating system or browser that you're
using and again just really easy to
navigate we can just go ahead and choose
whatever xr51 and it just works really
nicely so if you are playing around with
this and you're thinking about
integrating into your site check it out
on a mobile have checked out already on
mining it does look and work really well
okay so we've covered some of the
options but more interestingly we want
to go ahead and look at things like
customization so we want to look at
customizing this button we want to look
at customizing this little circle here
we can do that all with CSS and then
lastly we're gonna look at the content
delivery network and how we can really
just adjust the images in the best way
possible so let's jump over to styling
we're going to look at styling this
button and also the upload circle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
