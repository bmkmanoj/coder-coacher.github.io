the here dock syntax which makes it a
little easier for us to output large
chunks of text where we want to mix up
single quotes double quotes and the
complex expressions that we might need
to output within a string so basically
the helix syntax has a very very
odd-looking syntax but once you're used
to once you fundamentally understand it
it's going to make outputting within it
a lot easier so we'll go ahead and look
at how the syntax looks some careful
considerations that we we need to be
careful of and then we'll look at mixing
up single quotes double quotes and
complex expressions so to create a or to
create a string if you like we're going
to go ahead and create a variable will
just say string in this case now the
syntax does look strange it's three less
than signs than an identifier much like
you'd find in a variable so it can't
start for example with an integer
anything like that we want to start with
a string you might typically see it VOD
something like that output like that but
we can choose anything we like really so
you know it doesn't really matter we use
EOD for now just because it seems to be
listed in the documentation as an
example like this so what we're going to
do now is and we're going to look at a
consideration here because this this
this is actually entirely valid syntax
but it will error so what we'd normally
be able to do is just output for example
a value in between this now what's going
to happen now is we will get an error in
the browser and I'll explain that in
just a moment when we refresh we see
that we get this error now it doesn't
make too much sense in terms of the
actual error itself but basically with
this syntax we need a new line after the
the ending identify and before as well
so this would also be invalid so it
needs to have a new line identifier here
so we've come down a new line and then
it needs a new line identifier
afterwards so in this case what I'm
going to do is I'm actually going to
close the PHP tags here you see we've
opened one we've never really closed
these because we didn't need to
but now I guess is a perfectly valid
time to close these and of course if you
didn't you could just come down a new
line like this now you'd probably
struggle to find that this would be a
problem in a normal application because
you're never really going to have a page
that just contains an output like this
with no line break after or new line
after the ending identifier so you'll
never really find this a problem but if
you do come across this error that's why
so now if we return to the browser and
hit refresh you can see that we don't
have an error now we're not actually
outputting anything at the moment so
what we could do is either down here
output string which will output the
contents of this variable which is our
our hit up syntax and the contents so
that outputs Alex or we could just go
ahead and pop an echo just before this
so what we're doing is we're setting a
variable to this value and we're also
echoing out as well and of course what
we could do is just remove the variable
declaration altogether and just output
what we have here so now let's take a
look at what we can actually do within
this syntax so first of all it's useful
to note that we can multi-line without
it looking a mess we can of course
multi-line with a normal normal output
like this like this but it does look a
little messy so if we use this syntax we
can just use this and output what we
want and it's useful for outputting say
chunks of HTML that would otherwise look
a little messy like this so in the case
of mixing up single quotes double quotes
and complex expressions here doc
basically behaves like a double quoted
string but obviously we don't have
double quotes so there's no need to
escape them so in this case what we can
do is we can say my name is Alex and I
live in London doesn't make much sense
in terms of the double and single quotes
but it does give us an idea of what we
can do within
the here doc syntax so if you find
yourself having to skate maybe switch
between single and double quotes
concatenated and it starts to look a
little messy you'll probably agree that
this looks a lot lot cleaner so what we
can also do is we'll say we'll define
this array that we defined in the last
tutorial and we can say something like
and I am for iron then we still need to
use our complex syntax we still need to
use our curly braces but we can then
define an age in here so we can mix
these up without it looking a complete
and utter mess so that is basically the
hid ox syntax you know there are some
considerations but there's a lot of
information in the PHP manual if you go
ahead and look that up so that's how we
output things there are as we've seen
some limitations but if you find
yourself mixing up single quotes double
quotes complex expressions anything like
that then it makes sense to go ahead and
use the hit Ock syntax</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
