about all of the different things that
we can do the sass to make our lives a
lot easier we're going to look at a very
basic example just so we can get to
grips with the command line and the
different options that we have so what
we're going to do then is start to lay
out our directory structure and then we
can run a command to compile a CSS file
so you can see that in my root directory
here so I've just called this sass I
have an assets folder which is currently
empty
I've got a public folder which is my
public directory that the user will land
on so we're going to be in our browser
heading over to public I have an index
file here so an index.html file it's
just a basic document layout so go ahead
and create that if you'd like and what
we're going to be doing is inside of
assets we're gonna be placing all of our
sass files and that's where they're
going to live they're not gonna live
inside of CSS what we're going to be
doing then is taking them assets
compiling them and then putting the
resulting CSS file into our CSS
directory and that means that you can go
ahead and write all of your code and
then just compile it and you you end up
with one CSS file so it's a lot more
efficient so to start with then let's
head over to the terminal and let's just
run sass h that's going to give us
different options that we can use with
the command line tool so you can see
here that the usages sass which we've
already run we from the help command on
here then we have our options and then
we have input and output so by input
this is going to mean one file that's
going to pull in all the rest of your
files and then output is going to be
that CSS file
so it's SAS input and then CSS output
and then we have options that we can put
in between which we'll be looking at
very briefly so for example we're going
to be watching for changes so we don't
have to run this command to compile our
CSS every single time so let's get
started then by creating a very basic
example inside of our assets directory
an inside of assets things like
JavaScript would live as well and
anything like that so we're going to be
creating an
you folder in here specifically calling
it styles this is where all of our
styles are going to live so let's create
a new file in here then and I'm going to
call this app s CSS so notice the final
extension that's pretty important we're
going to save this and we can write
anything we want in here so let's start
with a really basic example let's create
a paragraph element on our page and
let's just put some text in there it can
be anything at all so heading over to
here we obviously have no style sheet
currently linked into this index.html
file so let's go ahead and link one in
it doesn't exist at the moment is going
to be in CSS so let's say CSS app CSS
that will never need to change you only
have one CSS file within your project so
we obviously don't have any stars on
here at the moment but what we're going
to be doing now is writing a little bit
of code in here and going ahead and just
compiling it just to test things out so
let's write some very basic code in here
just as we would with in CSS now it's
important to know at this point I'm
using the S CSS syntax rather than the
sass syntax and if you head over to the
sass website you can flick under the
guide between these two just to see what
they look like now I personally prefer a
CSS syntax over sass syntax just because
I feel it is a little bit more natural
to write if you're coming from CSS it
just makes it a little bit easier and it
doesn't make any difference to the way
that your code is output you can just
see we're omitting the end semicolons
and we are getting rid of the brackets
as well and just indenting here instead
so just a note there I'm using the S CSS
syntax so for the paragraph then let's
go ahead and change the color to red so
we'll just do that as an example
obviously when we refresh we don't see
any change because our app dot s CSS
isn't loaded into our browser and even
if it were it wouldn't work because it
wouldn't be able to read this I mean it
probably would be able to read this but
when we get into more advanced asked it
wouldn't so what we need to do is
compile this file and place it into our
CS
directory let's head back over to our
terminal and just clear this so remember
we have SAS then we have the options
that can go here we're not gonna be
doing that just yet we're gonna be
passing in our input file and then
telling SAS where to put our output file
so we're in the root directory so we
know that our input file is within
assets styles and it's app that is CSS
and our output file is going to be CSS
or rather public CSS app dot CSS so when
I hit enter there that's going to go
ahead and compile that far so you'll
have noticed that a couple of things
have happened here we've had a few files
or directories being created we have
this sass cache which you can pretty
much safely ignore and you're not going
to want to upload this your web server
either and if you're using version
control make sure that's ignored we have
our app dot CSS file which has been
created as expected so we just see the
CSS written in here as normal obviously
there's no difference from this to this
because we're just writing plain CSS but
obviously when we get more advanced and
we use things like mix-ins and
placeholders and variables you'll see
this just transform into a normal CSS
file so now obviously on our page here
we can see that we have read text as
expected so that is how we go ahead and
compile our sass files to CSS there are
a couple of other options that we can
use we can watch for changes as well so
we'll take a very brief look at this and
we'll be using that as we go through the
series so we don't have to keep running
this command because it would be pretty
annoying to haven't have to keep running
this every time you want it to compile
so if we go to sass h again just so we
can grab this now if we go up here you
can see that we have this watch option
so this watches files or directories for
changes etc etc the location of
generated CSS can be set using a colon
so what we have to do is we have to pass
the watch option in but then we have to
set
do these with the separate these for the
: so we've got our input and our output
which is pretty straightforward so we
want to do then is say SAS watch we do
exactly the same thing so remember we're
going into asset stars app dot s CSS so
assets Styles app dot s CSS and we have
a colon there instead of a space and we
have no spacing at all and we want to
place that compiled file into public CSS
app dot CSS hit enter and now SAS is
watching for changes so this will just
sort of hang here until any changes are
made so for example let's close up our
app dot CSS file let's say we wanted to
change this paragraph to blue now what
has happened here is I've already saved
this within my text editor and SAS why I
saved three times but SAS has detected a
change
so change detected to this file it's
gone ahead and written that app dot CSS
and that and that map file in there and
obviously when we refresh we see them
Styles updated so this is what we're
going to be using when we go through the
rest of the series and learn everything
we need to know about SAS and build up
that page that we saw in the first part
so this is a really nice thing to have
because we don't have to worry about
recompiling and that is pretty much it
on the basics of how to use the command
line tool we're now going to go ahead
and start to build up that page that we
saw earlier and go ahead and learn
everything we need to know about SAS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
