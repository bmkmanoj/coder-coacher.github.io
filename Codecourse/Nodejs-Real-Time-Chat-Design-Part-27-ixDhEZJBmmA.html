do here is focus on the styling of the
chat app if you've already got some
Styles in mind and you've already maybe
built
stars for this you can go ahead and skip
this the only important thing to
remember is that when it comes to
actually implement in the JavaScript
you'll need to choose the you know your
selectors based on your class names or
your IDs or whatever that may be
so we'll be go ahead and doing this you
know basically from scratch and we'll
build up the way this looks so I'm
starting with a page called index.html
and I'm just going to go ahead and
define a basic document and a head as
well and then we'll give this a title
okay so the title will just say chat and
let's go ahead and define the body and
within here we'll go ahead and we'll
create the markup and then we'll just
start to style things up so I'm going to
give this a wrapper with a class so the
whole wrapper is going to contain this
chat and that's just going to be chat so
we can target that within our CSS
stylesheet when we implement our
stylesheet now the first thing that we
need is the ability for user to enter
their names this is just going to be an
input field this is going to be a type
of text it's going to have a class of
chat name and we're going to enter
placeholder as well just as an
instruction to the user what they should
enter okay so the next item that we need
is the actual message box itself now
this is just going to be a div and we're
going to apply some sort of overflows on
this just so we can get you know a real
sort of chat looking window and we'll
just call this chat messages so we'll
give this a class of chat messages the
next thing is obviously the ability to
enter actually something to chat about
so in this case it's just going to be a
text area I'm going to go ahead and give
this a placeholder as well and that is
just going to be type your message okay
so the last thing is just going to be a
div and this is going to contain a
status so we want to go ahead and create
a div here
and this is going to be chat status and
inside of this will go ahead and say
status and then here we'll put a span
and the reason we do this is because we
only want to change what's in here so
we'll keep this as default as idle like
that so that's all we need to do for the
actual markup so let's preview that it
doesn't look very nice at the moment but
we'll go ahead and rectify that by
creating a style sheet and adding that
to our page so let's go ahead and save
this inside a new folder called CSS and
we'll call this main CSS so we'll go
ahead and link that in here so we say
link rel equals stylesheet and we supply
where that is that CSS ford slash main
dot CSS you can call this whatever you
like but this just implies you have a
sort of global stylesheet for your site
so let's go ahead and just you know
crack on with actually starting to build
this out and the first thing I'm going
to do is just apply a general font to
the entire page and the text areas as
well so in this case I'm going to say
body text area and we may as well so
input as well and we're going to choose
a font of 13 pixels and we're using the
font shorthand property here this is
going to be TREB you trebuchet ms' and
will provide a sans-serif fallback there
and that's basically it for the the
actual font of the page you can see that
now we've got a nice font for each of
these items including the text area in
the input so that just makes it look a
little bit Pleasant a little bit more
pleasant
so the chat class itself there's not
really much we want to do here in terms
of the container we just want to give it
a max width of 300 pixels and this can
obviously be entirely up to you by
default it will just stretch across the
entire page so what we've done by doing
this is if we just inspect this rather
than having this full length element so
we've got a div a block level we've now
got this blue area here which is a
maximum of 300 pixels but of course you
know this can completely change
depending on your requirements so feel
free to play around with it
now what we also want to do is apply a
border to the messages text area and
name sections or classes and just to
sort of frame these and contain them so
we have chat messages chat text area I
don't know if I gave that class I didn't
chat text area and we could of course
target this with text area but we want
to be a little bit more specific and
make this a little bit modular so chat
text area and chat name so we want this
to be or we want this to have a border
of one pixel solid and sort of grey
color so again using the border
shorthand property and we want this to
be like BBB in fact we don't need to do
this with the text area we can maybe
target this just a little bit separate
no we can so let's say chat text area
like that so now you'll see that that
looks like this so we've now got borders
around each of these so around chat
messages we've got a border it doesn't
look great at the moment cause there's
no height around chat name we've got a
border as well but again this is only
around the actual element so we need to
you know increase the size of these
it'll be a width of 100 and also the
text area as well the status we just
leave down there as normal okay so what
we're now going to do is just build out
the chat messages section because this
is the soft most important part so the
check the message area will be the
container where all of the messages will
appear and we're going to give this a
width of a hundred percent remember
that's relative to the container it's in
which is a maximum of 300 we're going to
give this a height of 300 so let's just
take a look at how that looks
chat messages there we go so that looks
like this let's just pull this down so
we've now got this and we can sort of
resize this input field here in this
text area just to sort of fit this kind
of design so we now I've got a sort of
baseline to work with and now the chat
messages is also going to have an
overflow on it of a scroll because if
say you've got you know 200 messages in
the Cheria a user might want to go down
and scroll and view more
so we're going to say we want to
overflow on the y-axis and we want that
to scroll so that basically just means
if there's too much content in this area
it's going to overflow into and it's
going to give give the user a scrollbar
and we'll also want to padding up ten
pixels on here so let's just go ahead
and test this so inside of chat messages
I'm just going to go ahead and just type
in hello and a break just to literally
test this out and we'll just go ahead
and copy and paste this down a few times
okay so that should give us sufficient
scrolling so you can now see that we've
got a sort of scrolling area here and
that lets us you know go back and view
previous messages the latest messages
will always be at the top so now that
we've got that let's just undo all of
that mess and go ahead and continue
styling so we're going to style now we
can get rid of this class as well we can
go ahead and style the other two
elements which is the area that the user
enters their name and the area the be
you know into their messaging so that is
chat message and chat name and we'll
focus on the chat name for now so the
chat name remember is this input you
know element up here so what what do we
want we want this to be 100% as well so
that basically looks like this so now
reaches almost 100% but because of the
padding on this element that's not
pushed out quite far enough so when we
go ahead and apply the padding to the
chat name that will then push that out
of further 20 pixels because we've got
member left and right padding which adds
up to 20 so we've now got something that
looks a little bit nicer and we'll go
ahead and modify these borders in just a
moment
we also then want to go ahead and focus
on the chat text area so with the chat
text area we want to go ahead and do
pretty much exactly the same we want to
give this a width of 100% and padding of
10 pixels so now you can see that that
again fills this section quite nicely
but let's go ahead and just get rid of
these gaps here and make another couple
of tweaks so under chat name we want to
go ahead and we want to set the border
bottom to zero now we'll just basically
get rid of the border
I'm also going to set a margin of zero
so we won't get this tiny gap just here
so that just sort of nicely lines up
with it then so we've just got a line
there and that's it so that's all nicely
lined up let's do the same for the text
area as well it's pretty much the same
just the opposite so we have a margin of
zero and we also have then a border top
of zero so that then does more or less
the same thing like this so just sort of
nicely lines everything up what also
going to go ahead and do is we're going
to set a max width on the text area and
the reason for this is that at the
moment I can take this little corner and
just drag this out over here like that
we can disable that but what I want to
do is allow it to be pulled down but not
across because it's it doesn't seem you
know necessary for it to be pulled
across this way and so I'm going to go
ahead and set a max width on this of
100% select and what that will do is
that will not allow me to check it out
but will allow me to drag it downwards
which is fine you know we want our users
to be able to enter more message if they
want so that's quite useful let's also
go ahead and just color the chat status
so we'll put that as maybe I don't know
some BBB or something like that maybe
just to match the borders and that's
pretty much it so that's a sort of
grayed out now another thing that we
want to do is just get rid of this blue
focus line here for this element and
this element and so we can go ahead and
change that so let's go ahead and say
chat text area and chat
name and we basically just say
outline:none
there we go so we now have a
nice-looking or a nice enough looking
chat area but what about the actual
messages inside of it well let's go
ahead and add some example content
because what's eventually going to
happen is JavaScript is going to come in
and it's going to loop through the
messages that are returned back from
nodejs from the MongoDB database and
it's going to go ahead and actually you
know add markup to this area and he's
going to be
gives with a class of chapt message an
inside of here we're going to go
basically have a name and a message so
Alex hello there and we'll just
duplicate this down and say Billy hello
and yeah that should do for now so there
we go all we want to do here it's a very
very very minor change is under here
let's just say chat message margin
bottom and 20 pixels or something like
that on 10 might be more appropriate and
there we go so that just spaces things
out a little bit so that's all we want
to do but it's good to bear in mind that
we will have this markup in here at some
point so you can go ahead and start out
however you feel or however you wish so
at the moment that's going to be empty
and we have finished the design for our
chat interface so next up is actually
going ahead and setting up our nodejs
server and also looking at a little bit
about MongoDB just so we can get to
grips with how data is stored and how
we're going to pull it back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
