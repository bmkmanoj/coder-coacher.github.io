MAMP and you have your web server
started we know where our document root
is so now it's time to just speak about
text editors and then we're going to
create our first couple of PHP files so
in terms of a text edit then you're
going to need a text editor like sublime
text or atom now these are fairly
similar I happen to be using sublime
text so I'm going to be using that
throughout the series but it really
doesn't matter what you use there are
other text editors and if you're already
using a text editor then feel free to
use which one you feel comfortable with
okay so once you have downloaded either
sublime text or atom just so you know
atom is free and sublime text is free
but you have to purchase a license to
remove a intermittent warning as you
save files so there's not really too
much difference here but I'm going to be
using sublime text so once you have
downloaded either of these I'm going to
go ahead and just open this up so this
is now sublime text and what we're going
to do is create a new file save it in
our document root and then we can access
that from within our browser at this URL
just here so let's create our first file
then I'm going to create a new file here
and I'm going to save this out
immediately what we're going to do is
we're going to come over to our
applications we're going to come over to
mam so that's where our document root is
remember and we're going to come over to
htdocs so this is where all of our files
are served from so the first file I'm
going to create is one dot PHP you can
call this anything you like but I'm just
doing this to demonstrate so inside of
here then if we just go and make sure
this is saved out head over to the
browser and refresh you can see that
file in there now so we can click on
that and we're now inside of a PHP file
any code we write in here we will see
the result of that inside of the browser
now what we can also do if we just head
back is create a new file and I'm going
to demonstrate the index dot PHP file
now throughout the series I'm going to
be working with an index dot PHP file
there's a subtle difference between the
naming of this and any other file so
let's save this out in the same
directory let's head over to the browser
now refresh on here
now you notice that we get a blank
screen what actually happened is Apache
has picked up on the fact that you have
an index.php file within your directory
and it's automatically running this
despite the fact it's not in the URL so
for example what I can do is I can come
over to index.php manually like so and
we're now on the same file so this here
is the same as this if we have a file
called index.php but what we can also do
is access one dot PHP on its own and
we're now within one dot PHP and
anything we write in there again we will
see in the browser so let's test this
out with index.php and then we'll go
ahead and update one dot PHP as well so
inside of index dot PHP I'm going to
start by creating a starting PHP tag
this is a less than sign a question mark
and then the text PHP we're going to
come down a couple of lines and we're
going to go an echo something out so
echo will basically output to the page
very very simple
so within single or double quotes and
we'll speak about outputting a bit later
and the difference between single and
double quotes we end the line with a
semicolon most commands or lines in PHP
we end with a semicolon
or get used to this later on as we look
at more things we can do with PHP so in
here then we're going to just say hello
and that is it so this is now valid PHP
file and it's going to go ahead and
output hello to that page let's go over
to the browser and refresh and we see
the text hello brilliant so now if we
come over to index.php this proves that
when we land on this it's the same as
directly accessing index dot PHP it's
the same file but what we can also do is
if we have other files we can come over
to these as well so one dot PHP we know
that we haven't written any code in
there so we can go and update this as
well just to get used to this
so again let's start out our PHP file
without PHP tag and let's go and echo
out something in here so let's just say
one just so we know which file it is so
over to the router give that a refresh
and we see the following so we can now
access the two files that we've created
and saved inside of our document
rooo so for this course then this is
pretty much all you're going to need to
know about creating files I'm going to
be mainly working inside of an index.php
file but we are going to be creating
some directories we're going to be
creating some more files but now you
know exactly how to do this and we can
get on with the rest of the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
