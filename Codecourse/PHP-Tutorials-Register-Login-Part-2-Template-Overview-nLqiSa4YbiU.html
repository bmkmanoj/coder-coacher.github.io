are going to have a brief overview of
the template that I'm going to be using
throughout the series it's a very basic
design you can see in front of you at
the moment what we're going to be doing
is in another part that in the next part
of this tutorial we're going to be
cutting this up so in this video we're
going to move reviewing the markup we're
not going to look too much at styles or
anything like that but try to understand
the markup and the styling if you don't
already understand the front-end side of
development but we'll be reviewing the
markup so feel free to skip this if you
you already accustomed to HTML CSS
things like that and yeah so essentially
this is what we're going to be building
our site on the reason I've chosen such
a basic template or created such a basic
template is just because of how
everything's laid out we've got the menu
at the top here including a logo which
is just text at the moment we've got a
header for whichever page we're on at
the moment on template dot PHP which
just houses the markup and styles
there's no back end code and we've got a
content area here which is going to be
things like the registration form any
error pages or you know anything like
that now we've got a widget sidebar as
well which you can see separated by this
dotted line and this is going to house
the login form to the username and
password that users going to be able to
type in it's also going to house things
like you know how many users are
currently active on the site or how many
users are currently logged in just just
things like that so you know we can we
can duplicate this if we want so let's
jump right over to the markup and have a
look at everything now in here
okay so we're you I'm using HTMI html5
semantics I'm using an html5 doctype
don't worry too much about this it
doesn't make a difference I'm just using
this for the semantic element it's just
a lot easier to describe I'm attaching
or linking in a style sheet which is
screen dot CSS you can see here it's not
a long stylesheet at all there's a few
things in here
you know after you've downloaded this
this template which is available at the
PHP academy' dork forum you might just
want to have a look through it so you
know look at certain properties and and
and everything like that if you're not
accustomed to CSS so yeah we've got the
the sort of head area here that how you
know we've got all of it let me just
line this up we've got this head area
which is essentially all of you know
things like the metadata the style
sheets the title and this is going to be
included in its own file so we're going
to break this away and store this in its
own file and it will look something like
this eventually I've just pulled this up
in and it has an example of what we're
going to be doing in the next part so
you can see here we're just including
includes for such head dot PHP which
essentially just replaces all of this
and puts in so then we've got our body
which comes all the way down to here and
inside of our body we've got a header so
this is this area that you can see up
here all up here and in here we've got
an h1 with a class of logo and this is
specifically styled a block of text
we've also got a nav again another an
html5 element and we've got an unordered
list with our menu items and these are
styled just to show in a row basically
so go and have a look at the stars with
that as well now one thing I haven't
included on here is some kind of
polyfill to allow Internet Explorer I
believe seven and eight to deal with the
html5 semantics so you'll need to go in
and and and perhaps develop this in
another browser until you feel
comfortable enough that you can go and
do that research on your own but either
way that's just a quick note I've got a
div here which is a rather on semantic
element is essentially clearing the
floats from here this is somewhat
considered to be a bad way to do things
because it's having extra markup if you
see this it's basically clearing the
floated elements Hicks we're floating
each one of these left so they sit next
to each other and this basically clears
it so if you go over to the Styles you
can see we've got
a class of clear somewhere just find it
other is at the bottom so clear clear
both sits clearing left and right
floated elements and that's the end of
the header we've then got a div with an
ID of container and we've got an aside
and then we've got our main content here
this of course could be wrapped in a div
itself a container itself but I've just
left it floating around so aside is
basically another html5 element we've
got a div within here
cut with a class of widget within this
class we've got a header and then an
inner area so if I just go ahead and
like copy and paste this down and I go
ahead and refresh you can see that that
basically just duplicates that that you
can see so we're going to be using the
top one here further the login form this
one for how many users are registered
with the site etc etc and these will all
go in there in separate files which will
include perhaps based on a condition so
if the user is is not logged in we might
want to say include this particular
widget that shows a login form or if the
user is logged in we might want to show
the particular widget that greets the
user and tells them they can change
their password log out etc and like I
said before we've got this down here
which is just the header for the page
and then some area so essentially all of
this here goes in the header you can see
the last thing we include is the aside
and then from just after the content
from here is included in the footer and
that's all all put in footer dot PHP
this here obviously we have a footer I
didn't explain that bits fairly
self-explanatory
so essentially what we're going to end
up with is a page looking like this let
me just type it out in a sort of mock
form so we'll include let's just say
template forward slash header.php might
not be called that when we do it
but it does demonstrate what we're going
to be doing so what this is going to do
is let me just tidy this up a bit what
this is going to do is it's going to
allow us to if we then want to go ahead
and create another file we include the
header we include the footer and
therefore we don't actually need to go
in and duplicate the mark-up so if we
need to check make a change to the
header somewhere we can go in and make a
change to the header or the sidebar or
there some metadata add some metadata
the same of the footer so we're making
it a lot more flexible by including our
header and a footer as sort of templates
rather than duplicating pages so
hopefully that makes sense and in the
next part of the tutorial we're going to
actually be cutting this up and looking
at the directory structure of our of our
login and registration system as well
so we'll be able to cut everything up
and make sure that we we start to work
on a really good ground for building
this up and making it a lot easier for
ourselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
