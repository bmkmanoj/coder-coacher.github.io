create a dynamic countdown which is then
going to redirect us to a website now if
I click back in my browser you can see
how this is gonna work but just refresh
what the script is essentially doing is
it's counting down the page isn't
reloading but this number is changing
now as obviously as soon as it hits zero
we're gonna be redirected to a page of
our choice which is the PHP academy' dog
landing page now the way this works is
we use jQuery so if I just open up a
blank document we're gonna start okay so
the first thing we want to do is set up
our page as usual so I'm going to create
my HTML tags my header tags and my body
tags
now what this countdown is really useful
for is you've probably seen it on
websites where they redirect down and
you have to wait or maybe watch an
advert while you're while you're waiting
to enter a page so it's really useful
for things like that now we're using
jQuery so what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to create this outline of this script
include and I'm going to set the source
to jQuery jQuery GA s now I have this
file saved on my computer but it can be
downloaded from jQuery comm and the type
is text and JavaScript as if you were
praying a normal JavaScript area to
write and this is all we need to include
our file now the next thing I'm going to
do is script type equals text slash
JavaScript but this time I'm going to
leave this section open in order for me
to type my code in here okay so we're
gonna create a div and the div is gonna
be called box and this is just going to
allow us to update this div area in here
consistently or constantly for the
countdown so we need to dynamically
change it without being able to refresh
the page and this is perfect
obviously using javascript we're using
the help of jQuery now the first thing
we want to do is set up our document
loading so document dot ready and then
inside here we're gonna say function and
we're gonna create a block here in which
I and our text is going to go so I'm
going to put a semicolon on there and
down here our code is going to go in
here okay so let's just come down to
here okay so we're going to create a
couple of variables first and this is
going to be number equals ten and this
is the default value we're going to use
to count down from so we're going to be
counting down from ten and the URL
that's just going to equal nothing for
now come down a couple of lines and
we're gonna create a few functions so or
a couple of functions rather the first
thing we're going to do is create the
countdown function this is the actual
this is the actual function that's going
to you know every second it's going to
update that update out div and
eventually it's going to redirect okay
so I'm going to create the function
we're going to call it countdown and
inside here we are going to set the
timeout first of all and obviously we're
using the function countdown so we're
setting the timeout of the function
count now which is too long we're
currently inside and that's going to be
a thousand because a thousand
milliseconds is a second so every second
this is going to this function is going
to repeat itself now what we want to do
is we want to update our div which is
called box and we want to set the HTML
value of this div now I'm going to say
redirect
redirecting in an amine so plus number
plus seconds so let's just tidy this up
a bit okay so what what this is doing is
what it's taking the number here that
we've set up here and we're saying
redirecting in something second now we
need this number to change each time and
the way we do this is we just say number
minus minus so this is going to decrease
the value each time this countdown loops
and it's looping as many times as we
want with the interval of a thousand
milliseconds which is a second now we
tell what what we do is we'll just
preview that let's go back to our page
and refresh ok nothing at the moment
obviously we need to call this function
so count down and let's refresh
redirecting in 10 seconds and you can
see this is gradually counting down so
we've got our effect everything's
working but at the moment we've got no
if statement or anything like that to
say when we need to redirect as you can
see it's already gone into minus figures
and this is not what we want what we
want is as soon as it to get as soon as
it gets to zero we need it to redirect
so with a simple if same when we can do
this we just say if number is less than
zero
just in case it misses it we don't say
equals just in case we say window dot
location
equals URL now the URL is up here at the
moment is set to nothing but in another
function we're going to create in a
minute we're gonna allow the user to
specify that themselves so yeah and then
we're just going to say number equals
zero to make sure if the page is loading
what's gonna happen is if the page loads
to the sorry the URL that's being
redirect to if that takes a while to
load the time is still going to count
down so the users still gonna be seized
of minus 1 minus 2 we're gonna make sure
the number stays at zero
I'm just for neatness really so let's
refresh that I know we need to come down
here and we need to say count down okay
so I'm just gonna pop EUL and I'm gonna
say it should be Academy dog okay so
let's refresh
that's redirecting in 10 seconds so it's
counting down as we want it to when it
hits zero it should stay at zero and
then it should redirect to PHP academy'
de org and there we go now let's just
say that when the user calls this
function we don't want it to hire just
necessarily redirect to PHP academy' de
org and we don't necessarily want it to
redirect in 10 seconds we want to be
able to create a function that's going
to be allow the user to say say 10 and
specify a site of their choice so we
need to create a new function that's
going to be able to change these
variables up here these global variables
up here so this function is going to be
cold let's just go up here and create it
we're gonna call this function redirect
okay I'm gonna have a couple of
parameters in here the first one is
going to record that is the number and
the next one is the URL so we'll say
number and URL now in here we want to
say number equals number and URL equals
URL now what this is doing is it's
taking the parameters in here and
setting these global variables to what
we specify and then all we need to do is
run the countdown function so you can
see the way that that works if we come
down here we can test it and I'm going
to say redirect I want to redirect in
three seconds and again I want to
redirect to PHP academy' de org so we
can see we will go back and we refresh I
have maybe not let's just have a look at
our code and review this
okay so I think what what we might do is
we might just change might just change
these in here I'm gonna cliffs one go to
and I'll call this one none and we can
just change these maybe they're
interfering so let's just test that its
refresh okay yeah so it's worked so we
redirect in three seconds to PHP
academy' to org let's just double-check
and we can change that and then it works
so obviously these are parameter names
here were interfering with the actual
variable names that we've already set so
let's redirect in five seconds to google
doc hold it you can see if that works
and we can refresh go back and refresh
okay so five four and then I should
count down and we should get a redirect
to Google okay so yeah it's worked so
you can see how easy it is to achieve
that countdown effect like I said this
can be used for a variety of different
applications as you've seen in my
example we do have a PHP academy'
landing page so visit PHP academy' to
organ bookmark this and you can access
variety or variety of different areas of
PHP including the forum if you're stuck
with any tutorials you can get on there
and get some help ok thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
