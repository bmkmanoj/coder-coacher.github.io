character encoding and why we should
define a doctype within our markup when
we mark up a page now you can see we've
got an example here of a sentence or a
couple of sentences and basically we can
see that we're trying to use a specific
character and this isn't being
represented very well so human
readability is affected here so this
part here should be an e with a little
accent above it so the reason this has
happened is because we haven't defined a
character a specific in character
encoding for this page and therefore the
full character sets not being
represented now what we actually need to
do is go in and head over to our markup
and we need to actually define a meta
tag so we'll go ahead and create a meta
tag here and we'll use the charset
attribute here to go ahead and specify
the character set and we're gonna choose
utf-8 the reason being is that utf-8
allows for all characters in the unicode
character set to be displayed so let's
go ahead and do this now so we need to
go and say meta charset equals and then
we give this a value in this case it's
just going to be UTF - 8 so you can go
ahead and look up more about utf-8 or
just character encoding in general if
you don't quite understand but basically
this is going to allow this extended
accented character to be displayed
properly so if we go ahead and refresh
now you can see that that's now
displayed properly and this will be the
case with different character sets as
well so depending on what you're
actually displaying this file you might
need to change this is just a quick tip
on why you need to set a character set
for your page and how it makes a
difference when you're trying to
represent as many characters as possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
