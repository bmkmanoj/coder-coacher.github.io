actually going ahead with this tutorial
is to be able to obviously first of all
access the local web server have MySQL
installed and obviously have PHP
installed also along with apache or
whatever server you choose Apaches most
common and it's easy it's easy to work
with on your local machine so what we're
going to do is we're going to be using
PHP myadmin
to administrate our database if you like
and it just provides us an easier way to
do so so when you can download PHP
myadmin and literally just copy that
over to your htdocs directory or
whatever the directory name is called
that you're working with and then you
can just run it login with your
credentials which is usually either root
as the username and nothing as the
password or root as the username root as
the password but you have to check with
with whichever package used to install
Apache MySQL and PHP so we'll be
creating our data table in this in this
part and inserting some records and then
just seeing how everything looks with
our column names and then we'll go into
working with PHP and actually extracting
this information if you like from the
database so I've created a database
called app it's fairly easy to do so
let's go ahead and just delete this
database and we'll look at how we would
do this from the start so as long as
we're on the databases tab I'm going to
go ahead and create a database called
app I'm going to go ahead and click on
that and it now gives us the message no
date tables found in database and I can
go ahead and create a table so I'm going
to be creating a table called people and
this is going to store records of just
basically a list of people so I'm going
to insert a couple of records here and
I'm going to say I have five columns so
the first the first feel so these rows
here are columns or fields whatever you
want to call them and first is usually a
unique identifier now this doesn't have
to be a numerical identifier it could be
anything but I'm going to go ahead and
I'm going to set this to auto increment
this AI stands for Auto increment and
primary one this is the primary key of
the database now we're not going to be
delving into advanced
database design or anything like that
but generally having a an index in your
database
for speed reasons and the ability to
just keep track of which record has
which I didn't unique identifier for
example we're going to be entering the
first name in a last name here but
that's not a unique enough information
to identify a user so an auto increment
ID will be and by Auto increment this
means that for every record we insert a
pointer is kept of which is the next ID
to be inserted so you'll see that when
we insert the first record this will be
at 1 the second record we insert will be
at 2 and that's from wherever you insert
data from whether it be from PHP myadmin
from the command line or from PHP it
doesn't matter as long as it's going
into this database that field will
always be also incrementing so the other
fields that we want to include here are
going to be data basically just data
about the user so we're going to have a
first-name lastname a bio and we're
going to have a record to say when this
record was created or a field so when
this record was created so for the first
name it's going to be a variable
character last name is going to be a
variable character as well and we need
to define the lengths and values of
these so I'm just going to enter 25 so
for the bio I'm going to choose the text
field because that's going to be
significantly longer and for created I'm
going to choose date/time and this
provides us with a specific format of
date and time of when this will not
necessarily when this record was created
we have to specify that ourselves but
this is the format that it's going to be
in or the type that it's going to be so
we don't need to define a link for the
bio but if we go ahead and hit save that
database has now been created and you
can see that we've got an empty result
set now under structure you can always
keep an eye on the structure of your of
your database table so we're just going
to go ahead and insert a couple of
records here let's go ahead and just
type in a name here you can see that PHP
myadmin gives you a larger area here to
insert now for the full of creator that
day I'm not going to go ahead and choose
with this date picker
simply use the now function in in MySQL
which will basically generate and then
fill this in for us so there's no need
to fill in this ID column absolutely no
need that will automatically be done for
us so let's go ahead and create one more
record and again we'll choose the now
function and that will populate that for
us let's go ahead and click go to rows
inserted so let's go ahead and browse
the database table and you can see that
we've got an ID of 1 next to Alex to
next to Billy and all the relevant data
including when this record was created
so now that we've created some test data
we can go on to actually connect to our
database from PHP using the MySQL I
extension and we can start to read data
from the database and then of course
start to manipulate it delete records
add new records and we'll be going into
that a bit later on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
