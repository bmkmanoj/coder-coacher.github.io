video essentially aims to give you a tip
on indenting code now if you are
experienced in programming and you
already know how to indent indent code
and you know why you should indent code
blocks then this video is not going to
be for you so you know to save you a bit
of time I thought I'd give give a little
warning at the start of this video so
essentially this this video is for the
absolute beginner who may be a starting
PHP or has been writing PHP for a while
and might have got some you know
negative feedback on the code someone
might have said the code was messy hard
to read you might have even found it
really hard to you know identify the
line that an error might have occurred
out or you know you might just be
looking at your code and thinking I
don't understand what this does and I
can't read it back properly and I don't
know where things at the start and end
then this is probably the video for you
but as I said I just wanted to mention
that anyone that's comfortable with
writing code this probably isn't for you
so okay assuming that you are a beginner
let's go ahead and take a look at just a
very brief example of indenting code so
when I create an if statement which
obviously checks a condition for true or
false so for example if one is equal to
two now one's obviously not equal to two
so this will return false but that's
beside the point of the video now most
people would say well you know if
something equals something and I need to
do something with this they'll just go
ahead and say echo hello okay
very basic pointless example now you
might think that just you know just by
doing this this is fine you know it's
readable you understand what it does you
can see that we've got our if statement
here here and we know that this code
within the block outside executes or
runs based on this condition now fair
enough
if you want to be lazy in the sense of
you know I won't bother if I've got a
short file now let's just say you were
writing along
you know working on a project and you
had that you had that viewpoint
throughout the entire project your code
is gonna get very very messy
it's not gonna look nice you might even
be and I've done it in the past I'll
admit this but you might even be one of
these people that don't use don't even
use code blocks at all okay and you get
this horrible and I have done in the
past but you get this horrible look like
this no it's not a good practice to get
into the best practice is whenever you
create a block for anything in
if-statement wire loop for loop for each
construct anything indent where
necessary don't indent for the sake of
it you know I guess you this video could
go in the direction of why people do you
know this I don't know people could for
example you know indent just where it's
not necessary at all but you know you
look at some people's code sometimes and
you know you think well this is an
absolute mess I can't understand it one
of the first steps of understanding code
is is making it look structured and
logical you need to make things look you
know let's just say we had say a group
that Lodha nested if statements in here
okay you know in an else--if on here and
then an if within here and then a while
loop within here and then a switch
within here for example I don't know
your code could could look like this now
just how it looks at the moment is
slightly more complicated than the basic
example I've given but we've got so many
nested elements here probably not good
for practice but if you are writing code
like this then you know that's fair
enough now my text editor luckily
highlights the blocks if you've noticed
I'm clicking next to these blocks here
they're highlighting when a block starts
so all of this and when it ends here so
I automatically know without even having
to count any opening or closing curly
brackets that I can just go ahead and
highlight that entire segment there and
I know that's one block so you know my
text editors helping me out here but the
fact I'm indenting if you
you know someone might not be using my
text editor we might send this file to
someone else and they might open it in
notepad for all we know they're not
gonna understand this code or you know
you might paste it online or in a forum
or anywhere people aren't gonna
understand your code as well as you are
from your perspective so it's important
that you indent you know you can rely on
fancy features like this but when you
know like I said when you pass it to
someone else it's not gonna have the
same effect so I know that if I get an
error say unexpected end-of-file reached
or something I know that it might not it
might have been because I haven't closed
a curly bracket and if I remove this
curly bracket we can already see that
you know we've got this end of our if
here we've got an else if and then
where's this ending that's certainly not
yet that's the start of our if statement
up here so we know we can you know
proper pop a bracket in there and you
know if you're writing code like this
and you're passing it on to other people
to help you you need to understand that
other people cannot help you or it's
extremely hard to help someone if they
haven't properly indented their code it
is the hardest thing if it let me just
go ahead and just unand end all of this
okay look at that now how much more
beautiful does it look when it's you
know out here like that if someone comes
to you with a load of code like that
and and says I've got an error on line
200 and you've got 300 lines in a file
and everything's like this or some
things are like indented and some things
aren't and I have genuinely seen seen
code that looks like this and obviously
not this because this doesn't do
anything but I've seen code that's so
poly indented I I just tend to think
that people chop blocks of it and oops
I've enlarged my text editor people will
just you know grab blocks of it and
indent it for the sake of it it's really
important that while you're writing code
you're using a good text editor that
allows you to indent well and that you
indent you know and as you're writing
code if you want to go ahead and write a
file say 100 line file without indenting
go back and indent here that's fine you
know as long as you are passing your
code on to someone else and it's
properly indented it makes it so much
easier to read people definitely
underestimate the requirement to indent
code another thing as well that people
do do is they use the space key to
indent characters so for example let's
just get this back to how it was before
in fact let's go ahead and just pop it
back like this let's just say you wanted
to go ahead and an indent say anything
within here I could use two spaces for
example now first of all it is slow
second of all is terrible practice
because what we're actually doing is
we're adding whitespace to a file you'll
notice that a tab is is actually a
character in itself if you like it gives
it a a specific amount of space and the
tabs classed as a character on your
keyboard the tab keys there that's why
it's there you know if we if we didn't
need to tab things we would just use
spaces and we wouldn't tab key wouldn't
exist
so using spaces as a massive no-no
adding whitespace to your files
particularly when it's things like
browser things like HTML or CSS using
the space key is you know terrible cuz
you're adding more and more white space
there particularly things like CSS and
HTML your browser's picking up on that
as valid characters whereas you know
four spaces could look the same as a tab
but a tab is just one character so
you're going you're getting faster
processing them so we're not just
relating this to PHP you know we're
looking at everything else as well PHP
will read everything in a different way
so you know this doesn't matter too much
but still for readability if someone
else wanted to go in and modify your
code somehow and they found that you
tabbed in with loads of spaces you know
it's very annoying it annoys people and
tabs easier to go back and forward
rather than you know four or five spaces
so that's just a quick tip about
indenting like as I said a very basic
video but you know it's one of them
things that if you get right from the
beginning and you get into the good
habit of doing then your codes gonna
look a lot better it's gonna be a lot
easier for people to help you when they
look at your code if you're working say
2 or 3 for people even more you know
hundreds whatever people on a project
and people are poorly indenting things
it annoys everyone else it doesn't look
good and it makes it a lot harder to
maintain a project so always indent take
into account some of the tips that I've
given if you have any you know if you
have any problems with your code you
know you're gonna get a solution a lot
easier if you have readable code
readable code is perfect some people
don't think so because everything's
server-side processed it doesn't matter
but in actual fact your code you know
needs to be readable but there we go
that's it that's a little tip on
indenting in PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
