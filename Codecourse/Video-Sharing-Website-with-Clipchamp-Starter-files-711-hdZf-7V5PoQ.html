project start a file from the course
downloads and this contains a very
bare-bones slim 3 application structure
which we're going to cover in this video
if you know your way around slim 3
that's fine you can go ahead and get
started with the next part so once
you've copied these over to the
directory that your web server is
pointing to you'll see the following
files now these aren't going to work at
the moment because what we need to do is
download all of our dependencies so
you're going to need composer installed
if you don't already have it installed
head over to get composure dorg we also
have a series that covers downloading
and using this as well if you're a bit
stuck so once you have this annual
within the directory you can run simply
composer install and that will go ahead
and download slim 3 for you ok so now
that's done you'll notice that you'll
have a vendor folder and if you pull
this open in your text editor you will
see that we have quite a few directories
and files here I'm just going to take a
minute to go through what all of this
means so let's start in the room in your
composure JSON file you can see that
we're acquiring in these two
dependencies that's what were downloaded
when you run compose it install okay so
inside of our public directory this is
where we start so we have an index PHP
file if we just head over to the public
directory here you'll see page not found
because we don't have any roots set up
at the moment but don't worry too much
about that we'll go ahead and do that as
we go so index dot PHP all of this does
is it creates a new slim app instance
and you can see here we're passing
through the settings to display error
details this is important for debugging
but of course if you are popping this
project on a production server you're
going to want to either set this to
false or just get rid of it because this
is false by default what we're then
doing is grabbing slims container and
we're attaching slim views to it we're
going to be using twig for this and
we'll go over these templates in a
moment but that's essentially what this
does here what we're also doing is we
are setting up our database dependency
also on a can
tanner now you're going to want to
change these settings to your own
database credentials and the database
we're using is called video if I which
is the small project we're building but
of course if you have another database
name that's fine just go ahead and
change that will be creating the
database in the next part so then we're
just running our application and what
we're going to do just to save a little
bit of time is create all of our roots
here but of course you can create them
into separate files if you want so
inside of here we also have an HT Access
file I'm running Apache but of course if
you're running into necks or another web
server you're going to want to include
the appropriate redirection and you can
find out how to do this on the slim
documentation ok so over into our app
directory we have a views directory here
and then we have a templates directory
will be creating a couple of views in
here one for the home page to actually
click the upload button and another to
actually view the video once it's been
uploaded but I've included here in apt
wig farm this is just basically a
template for our application so here you
can see that i'm pulling in bootstrap
which is a front-end framework this will
help us just really quickly build out
the kind of elements we need we also
have our own application stylesheet in
here as well so this is included and you
can see this just includes some stars
which you might just want to have a
little look at but we'll be creating the
elements for these and you'll see the
stars in action later on so then we have
a container container as part of the
bootstrap framework this has stars
associated with it we have our logo here
as well and then we have a block here
for our content now what we're also
doing is we are pulling in jquery we're
pulling in clip champs javascript
dependency which we've already seen work
what we need that and we're also loading
in an appt JFR which we haven't actually
created yet we'll be creating that in
our j/s directory so inside of public
like I said we have our CSS folder we
have our J's folder and for now that's
pretty much it what we can do is go on
to start to create the roots and
actually set this up
ready to upload videos and then create a
sharing link as well so once you're in
this position we're going to jump over
to the next part very quickly create the
database and the structure and then
we'll go on to build the rest of this
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
