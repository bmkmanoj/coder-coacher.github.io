happening what we want to do is we want
to go ahead and append list items within
this unordered list so we say timeline
ul and then we say dot append now we can
just say something like dock pend Li Li
but I'm not going to do that I'm going
to do it the proper way
and we're going to create an object
which represents a list item like that
so basically this looks this this
basically is a self-closing not self
closing a list item start and then it
will end list item and if I was to do
this let me just pull this down a bit so
it's easier to sort of grasp so we've
got this here we've created this object
and then inside we can pass different
parameters so I'm going to say here the
text status so text is the text within
this item that we've created so let's go
ahead and refresh and now you can see
that we've got three statuses placed in
here let's go ahead and inspect these
just in case you're unsure so we've got
our overall unordered list and within
here we've got our opening list item our
closing list item for each one so it's
perfect now that we have you know done
that we've basically read from an XML
form we've read a basic note here now
there's also other types of data that we
can read from XML files so for example
things like attributes now naturally
will look like this so most XML files
you work with will contain attributes
this one only has a few for things like
here we are URL start and end and what
we want to do is I'm going to go ahead
and replace status and insert this ID so
let me just grab this ID here and I'm
going to go ahead and do a find in my
text editor and a replace so I'm going
to find status and I'm going to replace
it with status ID so replace all and
three occurrences which we would expect
so now for each status node we've got
this ID here which is perfect so we can
start to read that and that's just an
example we don't need to add this in the
Twitter timeline because it already
exists here
but in an XML file you're working with
you're most likely have attributes like
this so I'm going to say var ID and this
is going to be the same so this we're
referencing the same thing but this time
what we're doing is we're saying dot
attribute and then we say ID so using
the jQuery attribute method to read not
an attribute in HTML an HTML document
but in an XML document because it's it
works in the same way so if for example
I was reading an attribute from every
div and looking for class timeline would
be returned but this is the same
structure as an XML document that's
effectively what it is it's just markup
so we're reading this ID attribute and
we'll obtain the value automatically
from attribute that will return the
value for us so now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to say within brackets I'm
just going to place the ID so you create
a bracket and string and we append ID
and then we are sorry concatenate
another in bracket and then the status
let's just put the space after that so
now what we've done is when we refresh
we've read the ID from each of these
notes so that's how we read attributes
as well now the last thing I'm going to
touch on is just delving a little deeper
into this XML file because at the moment
what we're doing is we're reading from
status which we're looping through and
we're grabbing the immediately
descending node so the chart the child
nodes of this what we want to do is we
might want to get more descendant so for
example within this user node within
status we might want to grab the name of
the user that's tweeted so in this case
what we want to go ahead and do is we
want to create another selector and I'll
say user now we're going to do exactly
the same as we did here so what we're
going to do is use a bit of our logical
thinking and we're going to find and
we're going to find user and then name
so user space name dot
text so then within status we've read
user
so within status we've read user then we
read name and then we grab the text for
it so it's just a case of looking at it
and see
I mean indentation helps a lot a great
deal here when you're you're looking at
these but you know we're just looking at
how things sort of descend into each
other so in this case I'm going to pop
at the end of the status a hyphen and
then user so let's go ahead to the
browser and refresh and you can now see
that at the end of these status we have
PHP academy' at the end of each one
that's the user with we're reading from
great so I'll quickly actually touch on
looping within these statuses so for
example within a status you may have
something like well let's just make
something up I'm just going to say link
and link and in here I'm just going to
put a link so perhaps google.com and
then I'm going to copy this or let's say
three times and let's change this very
slightly each time cool so now we've got
this problem we're within status we've
got three of the same named nodes so if
we were to say status link then you know
what's going to happen let's take a look
so I'm going to say far link is equal to
this or we append the value we're going
to say find link dot text cool so first
of all let's just place this for every
status so let's just go down and place
this in and down again and place this
under here cool so let's go ahead and
refresh here now we want to go ahead and
output it I guess so at the end of here
I'll just put
link lovely so when i refresh now we get
all three of these nodes have been
processed and then output so this is
very clever and it's also very useful
and what it means is we don't need to
loop through these inner nodes that
contain the same node name and then go
ahead and output these but what happens
if we want a specific one so what
happens if we want the first one well in
this case we're going to go ahead and
we're going to use selectors to select
which one we want so you might have come
across in the child in CSS what we can
do is we can specify this so this is a
pseudo selector and we're selecting the
first child now this is indexed at one
so one in this case will represent this
two will represent this in three words
and this so if we want to just get the
first link for example or even the
second or third we can go ahead and
refresh and there we go we just get the
first link returned now if you wanted to
process each one separately what you
would do is you were doing a loop within
here and you would loop through this dot
find link and then you could process
each one so I'll just give you a quick
example of that so for example let's go
ahead and get rid of this entirely so
I'm just going to go ahead and alert
them out cuz I'm running out of my space
in my markup so what we could do here is
we could say this dot find link dot each
function and you would normally just go
ahead and process each of the links here
within the loop because you might want
to say format them in a special way or
use them you know different places or
whatever in this case though I'm just
going to go ahead and alert out link
sorry
alert this dot text
cool so let's go ahead and refresh that
and here we get Google com kugel type
code at UK google.ca so that process is
for each one in this case you'll see
that we've got an error down here so if
I go ahead and hit this it says link is
not defined on line 16 and the problem
here is that we're just referencing a
variable that doesn't exist at the
moment so if we go ahead and just get
rid of this then when we refresh we get
Google calm cool look how you could at
UK Google let's see eight and then that
one appears and then we're looping
through again and outputting them and
obviously again you wouldn't you
wouldn't alert them but that was just an
example so that's a short guide on how
to read XML files with jQuery there are
obviously a lot more complicated XML
files that you can loop through but
generally for basic use this is enough
to loop through and grab the data you
need from any XML file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
