basic example of using BEM and in this
video we're going to focus on the B and
the e so the blocks and the elements and
we'll see how they're named how we use
them and then in the next video we're
going to look at modifiers all right so
let's say we just have an unordered list
and this is a pretty standard example so
we have an unordered list here and we
have list items and these have text
within them so pretty straightforward so
what would we normally do here if we
wanted for example an inline list at the
moment is just a standard bulleted list
so what we would do is we could head
over to app set CSS and we could say
well we want the unordered list to have
a list style type of none we want the
padding set to zero and we want the
margin set to zero as well and that
would work like that and then what we
could do is we could say something like
ul Li and we could say well we want
these to display as an inline block so
that looks like this
so we've achieved what we want to do but
once again if we wanted this to be on
the navigation we might say well we want
this to be a normal list from top to
bottom not inline so we would say nav ul
Li and again we're getting into that
problem so we already know that this is
a problem so what we're gonna do let's
start again
we're going to take a look at this block
here this is a block these are elements
and we want to define a class on our
block and every single element so to do
this we define out the name of the block
as a class so for example list inline or
inline list so inline list will do for
now and it just looks like a normal CSS
selector of course it could just be on
its own so it could just be list but I'm
being a little bit more descriptive here
I'm saying inline list so I'm going to
apply exactly the same style to this so
our list style type is none
our padding is zero and our margin is
zero so that looks like this once we add
our class to it so let's just pop this
in here in line list like so so now what
we want to do is style each of the
elements within this so to do this the
naming convention is the block name so
we re define the block name and then we
have two underscores then we give the
name of the element so in this case it's
a list item so we say in line list two
underscores and then item so in this
case it will be display:inline-block and
now rather than having to create a
descendant selector we're just creating
a very flat structure
so we've already improved the rendering
speed from CSS because remember chaining
on and doing descendant selectors are
slow we've already improved that now
comes the part that most people don't
like and remember there's nothing
necessarily wrong with this and you'll
see this when we write the mark-up so
let's define our inline lists item and
of course what we need to do is exactly
the same thing for our other item so you
can already see this starts to look a
little bit strange we've got lots of
repetition here but what you can
actually see is it's very clear what's
going on here so we've got an immediate
speed improvement we've got a really
easy way when we look at the markup we
know write an inline list has these
stars and item has these stars
there's no L R ul Li so we're not being
very specific here here we're being very
specific keeping everything in a flat
file and looking at the mark-up it's
very easy to see what's going on and as
we progress through the series and we
eventually take a look at SAS you'll see
how much nicer this is to work with so
this now we know exactly what it is it's
an inline list we can move it anywhere
we want because we have
specific element styles and very
specific block styles we can put it any
way we want
it's not tied down to any other elements
and we can really reuse this so let's
take a look at another very quick
example so let's say we have an avatar
and inside of that we have an image so
for now we won't put anything in the
image but we have that image there and
we have that div there as well so what
we're going to do is define out our
avatar and for example this could be a
width of 50 pixels it could be a height
of 50 pixels whatever and then inside of
here
how do we define the image well of
course we use the convention the naming
convention and we give the name of the
element this can be anything it really
is up to your judgment what you call
them there's no hard rules to what you
can actually name things as long as you
follow this convention so in this case
in actual fact this might just have a
border of one pixel like so and the
image might have these properties and
then a border radius for example that
could be 100% so now again we're seeing
a very reusable component that we can
move around where we want and here we
would obviously give our class here and
this would be avatar image so over in
our browser obviously this doesn't look
great at the moment but you can imagine
that it would once you have your image
in there so again if you wanted to add
another element within here and for
example this was the user name we would
call this Avatar user name and then we
would have the user name just in here
and then of course in here we define
this style out once again and this could
be anything at all we'll just mess
around for now so there we go we can see
an avatar and image and the user name
all very clear stars completely flat
this is really important and here we
know exactly what's going on this is
very descriptive and very easy to read
okay so we've looked at our blocks and
elements let's just get rid of our
avatar example because we're going to
focus
next on modifiers so let's jump over and
see how these can help us as well
including the readability of our
elements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
