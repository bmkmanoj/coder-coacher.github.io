you actually need to start working with
dates and times in PHP the date-time
class is pretty simple bar just to
complement this we're going to look at
some useful functions that you might
need along the way so the first one is
going to be the time function let's just
go ahead and echo the result of this out
and see exactly what we get here this
actually gives us a unix timestamp so
this can be very useful depending on how
you're storing dates and times you may
wish to store unix timestamp it's also
useful for other things as well but
either way you know that you've got that
there just now now fairly similar to
this is the micro time function now if
we go ahead and look at the result of
this you can see that we get the micro
time just here and that can be useful as
well particularly for generating random
or semi random things now what you can
actually do is go ahead and just pass in
the true value here and this will give
you back the value as a float this is
usually what you use this is our unix
timestamp and then this is the micro
time just after so obviously this is
pretty useful depending on how precise
you actually need to be so otherwise
kind of away from the object-oriented
style of the date-time class we have the
date function you may have actually used
this before at least seen it before what
this allow us to do is very quickly just
give us a date and time so we can say
something like d my using the formats
that we've already seen and you can see
here that we get exactly that so really
depending on where you're generating
things this can actually be quite useful
but of course you don't then have the
flexibility of the date-time class it
really depends on what you're doing so
next when you are actually validating
dates how do you know that a date that
you've actually given is correct well
let's think about a couple of months and
the amount of days in them and see if we
can use a function to check these are
valid so for example the date of July or
the month rather of July has 31
days the month of sep tember has 30 days
so therefore using that logic September
the 31st isn't a valid date so we can
check this and likewise i guess july the
32nd is not a valid date or so on and so
forth so we can actually use the check
date function for this passing in the
month passing in the day and passing in
the year so let's start out using July
so we'll say seven thirty one and then
any year so 2016 so let's go and do a
VAR dump on this what we will get is a
true or a false value a boolean so in
this case we get a true now if we were
to say one the 32nd of July obviously
that is not a valid date because there
are no months with 32 days in so what
about moving on to sep tember then if we
were to say 31 here that actually still
returns false so it's clever enough to
say well there aren't 31 days so the
only valid date or at least up to is 30
so we can go ahead and change that so
why would this actually be useful well
if you're allowing users to enter dates
into a form by themselves this can be
very useful even if you are using
dropdowns within a form people can very
easily modify date so for example if you
had a form with say july or sep tember
up to 30 in terms of September someone
could very easily just modify the value
of an option within a select element and
go ahead and search I and submit 31 what
you want to do is use this to check the
date is valid very very straightforward
and you can do that before you start to
pass it into the daytime class so lastly
we looked earlier at date-time list
identify us and remember what this gave
us if we just do a VAR dump on this was
a list of a rather date.timezone list
identifies this gave us a list of all of
the time zones that we can actually use
now sometimes when you are maybe loop
through and you want to output these
this is a little bit of a mouthful to at
least type so what we can actually do is
go ahead and use a different function
for this it's just an alias a bit so you
can use timezone identifier list we
could say as time zone and in here we
can obviously go ahead and echo out a
time zone and of course you would put
this in some kind of form either way
it's a much easier way to go ahead and
output all of the available time zones
if you are allowing users to check them
so that is pretty much it for useful
functions most of what you need is
within date time but sometimes you will
need things like time or date depending
on what you're doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
