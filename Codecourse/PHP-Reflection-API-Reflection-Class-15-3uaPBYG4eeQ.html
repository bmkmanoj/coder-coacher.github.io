at the PHP reflection API and in this
pad particularly we're going to be
looking at reflection class so if I just
go over to my editor here you'll see
that I have already created a user class
it's not actually functional it isn't
linked to a database or a file storage
system or anything like that
but it will do for the for the series
now we have two properties of here both
protected we have logged in which is
equal to false by default and we also
have beta which is equal to an empty
array and if this was actually a
functional that would contain things
like I username and a password in that
email and then have a getter and a set
of the data and a getter far logged in
so if I just go down here and we create
a new instance of user and then we can
say if user is logged in echo you are
logged in and because logged in is he
called the false by default we're
obviously not going to see this message
so refers yep empty page but anyway that
that's not what this tutorial is about
if I just create a new variable called
assi which is self reflection class and
I assign it to new reflection class and
then we provide the class name which in
this case is user and then what we can
do is we can echo free and we can
concatenate on print our get class
methods our C and we have to set the
second the second parameter to false to
tell PHP that we don't want to output
this by automatically so if we refresh
here and oops we need to change this to
true apparently yep true so here we'll
see all the methods that this reflection
class provides for us and this is very
useful if we just take a look at
these we have get name we have is
cloneable so it can determine whether
the class is cloneable we have get start
line get in line
we have has method get method it methods
in the same with the properties and the
constants and it can determine whether
the class is a trait or if it's abstract
or if it's final it's great so if we
just delete that and we say echo I'll
see it name here refresh surely now if
we get the the name of the class which
is user so if I just bring this back up
alternatively you could browse the docs
either way works so let's have a look at
the has method method will come in this
out and we'll say if RC as method is
logged in will echo one just to make
sure that everything works and we get
one if we set this to something else
like set logged in which we don't have a
set of for logged in we don't get
anything so let's take another look at
what we can do here is something we
should look at if I just extract this
class for a new file and I just at the
name space appear so if I say namespace
Acme and then instead of user I'm going
to provide the full path Zack me slash
user and we echo I see get name we need
to include the file so include user dot
PHP Hill refresh we get our user now
what if we want just the name of the
actual class without the namespace here
well we could change this to get short
name and we just get user</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
