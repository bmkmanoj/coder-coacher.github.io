actually uploaded the file we know that
we have a call back here what we need to
do is take the video source send it
through to our back-end store that in
our database redirect the user off
sounds quite complicated but it's
actually pretty straightforward to get
going with so we need some kind of route
which is going to handle this storage so
let's go and build this just now so this
is obviously going to be a post route
and will call this video / store we have
our callback as normal and in here we
have our request we have our response
and of course our arguments now that
we've done this let's just to a VAR dump
and say okay then we'll pull together
our ajax request or monitor it in the
browser and then we can just build the
rest of the functionality until it works
so for our ajax request we already have
jquery pulled in so we might as well
make use of the ajax method so in here
we specify a URL now in this case I'm
just going to copy this its full path
here and i'm going to say video store so
obviously you can be a little bit clever
and if you are on a production
environment you wouldn't need this but
we won't dive into that too much at the
moment so we also want a type remember
we are sending this through as a post
request and of course we need to send
through some data as well so for the
data that we send through we want to
send through the key so we can store
this so let's say source and we'll just
save video dot key remember when we
uploaded it we looked it in the console
and we have a key property on this video
object here so once that's done and it's
been successful we have a success
callback on our Ajax request so inside
of here then we receive data and we're
going to do something with that later
we're going to redirect the user off to
a particular page but for now we just
want to make sure that this request
works so now obviously what we want to
do is upload a video we want to check
that this request goes through and then
we should see that VAR dump that we
created earlier so let's bring up our
developer tools and I'm going to head
over to the network tab just so I can
monitor any requests that are being sent
through so let's click upload a video
let's drag this over and submit it and
we'll wait for that to prepare an upload
and now that that's done we see that
we've made a request here to store and
we see the string okay so we know that
we're successfully sending an AJAX
request through to that route that we
just created over here we're getting
that okay back so now we need to work
out how we're going to first will
generate the hash insert this into our
database and then what we're going to
actually return as the response because
remember we're going to need to return
the hash so we can redirect the user to
that page appended with a hash and then
they'll see the video so let's just
tackle the hash first of all I'm using
PHP seven so I can use the random lights
function which would just generate me
some random bytes if you can't do this
if you're not working with PHP 7 you can
use something like openssl random pseudo
bytes or you can use a library or to be
honest for now if you're just playing
around maybe just use the rand function
with md5 but of course going forward
you'd want this to be properly generated
so I'm going to generate 32 random bytes
and I'm going to use the binary to
hexadecimal function to convert that
into a nice string that we can go ahead
and store and this will now be 64
characters in length which is why we
chose this for our database table okay
so now we want to actually insert this
so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going
to create a statement variable here for
the prepared statement now remember we
have a DB dependency if you just head
over to index dot PHP well we're already
on there and we have that
just here remember to change your
settings if you haven't already so now
we can prepare a statement and this
statement is just going to insert into
that videos table that we've created
what we want to insert is the source and
the hash so we don't know where this
quite where the source is coming from at
the moment we know that we've sent it
through here but we haven't actually
worked out how to pull it through with
slim but we can do that in easily in a
moment so we bind the sauce here or
rather we put the placeholders that we
can bind and then we have a result and
this result is just executing that
statement passing in that data as an
array so we know that we have a source
here and we also have a hash now we know
the hash so we can just place that in
but what about the source well there's a
couple of ways you can go about doing
this you could store the full path
including the bucket if you wanted to or
when you pull this back you could use
the bucket now i'm just going to store
this along with a bucket just so it's a
little bit easier to work with but of
course if your bucket changes you then
have to go an update all of your
database records so let's just do this
for now but of course in real life you
might want to just switch this up a
little bit depending on your needs so
for the bucket name then my bucket name
happens to be the following so s three
amazon AWS com video upload code course
calm and in the source that we get
through we already have the videos
folder so we don't need to include that
all we need to do is concatenate on
request which is part of slim get / am
source so all this will do is it will
take that source we saw in the console
earlier catenate it onto here and that
will be stored okay so now we just want
to respond with the hash that we've
generated and if that does make sense
the moment we'll see why that's the case
later on so to respond properly we want
to go ahead and
RAB the body from slimmers response we
want to go ahead and write to the body
and to write we want to do this is JSON
so we want to json encode an array just
here and that array will contain our
hash like so and then we just want to
respond with a correct header and the
body so we just return response with
header and the header we're going to use
content type and of course this is Jason
so we choose application JSON and then
here we respond with the body that we've
just written to so all we're essentially
doing is generating a hash inserting the
right data and we're responding with
JSON with the hash so we can test this
out now so let's go ahead and refresh
make sure you've got your console open
you can also switch over to xhr request
just to limit the amount of information
you see in here as well so let's go and
drag this video over again and submit it
and there we go hopefully we didn't
break anything it looks like it's all
good and you can see here we have that
hash perfect so we can verify that this
has been stored in the database and it
has indeed we can double check that the
source looks okay and it does look like
it's okay so we've got the full path
here including videos and we have that
correct hash that matches here so the
point here is that we can now use this
hash with in JavaScript to redirect over
to the right page and then we can
subsequently look this up in our
database pull the source out and then
view it within an html5 video player so
hopefully that wasn't too complicated we
now have good progress made on actually
getting this to be a shareable link
let's move over to the next part where
we're gonna look at redirecting the user
and building the page to actually show
this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
