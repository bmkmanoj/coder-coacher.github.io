ourselves the ability to delete any of
the pages that we don't want which is
just going to remove them from our
database table so to start with then
we're going to create under admin a new
file called delete PHP which makes sense
let's close off all the other files that
we don't need as well and inside of here
as usual we require in our start file so
we can access our database and we don't
need a view for this because all we're
going to be doing is deleting the record
and then redirecting the user back to
list dot PHP we need to update list of
PHP out view to include the URL to this
page so we echo out our base URL we go
to admin we go to delete dot PHP and in
here we're going to again specify the ID
so we're going to echo out the page ID
and as usual we'll escape that just to
be careful so now when I click delete
that goes through to delete our PHP ID
of 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 as we've seen before so how
do we hook this up so it actually
deletes a record this is pretty
straightforward so over in our logic
here we're going to start by checking if
the ID in the query string is set and if
so we want to delete the record but we
then want to do after that regardless of
whether whether the ID was in the query
string we want to redirect the user back
to the list page so we have our base URL
again admin list dot PHP so when we
click on this then what you can actually
see happening here is us being
redirected back so we are hitting the
delete page even though I'm clicking on
these we're just not actually deleting a
record
so to delete a record then we still want
a prepared statement because we're
passing in that ID into our query so we
still need to be really careful here we
don't just want to execute a query and
go ahead and pass this get super global
value in so we're gonna say delete page
and this is going to be prepared
statement and down here we want to
delete from pages where the ID is the ID
that we give we've seen this before we
execute the query we pass in the ID and
we can pull that straight from that key
ID in you get super global array and
that is it so now we can test this out
by deleting a page another one and then
we delete our final page we get our
initial error message on here we have no
content but by now now you know how to
add a new page so you can go ahead and
do that so that is our very basic CMS
complete we've looked at quite a few
aspects of basic PHP development in
terms of interacting with our database
creating records editing records setting
up our application structure so it makes
a little bit more sense than just having
a lots of files lots of large files in
one directory and we have ourselves and
mini CMS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
