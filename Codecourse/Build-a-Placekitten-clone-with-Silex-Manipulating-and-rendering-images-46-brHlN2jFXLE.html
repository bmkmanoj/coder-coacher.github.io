selected image we need to manipulate
this and go ahead and actually respond
with it then we'll work on things like
caching and all the other features that
we want to implement now we're going to
be using a package called intervention
image which is a really nice way to
manipulate things either using the GD
library or the in magic library we're
going to be using the GD library but
it's pretty straightforward and we're
not going to be diving too much into
this all we really need to do is reduce
the size make it gray scale and we're
pretty much done now there is a little
bit of work we're going to do around
this because we're going to create a
service provider for this and we'll look
at this work so let's go ahead and get
this installed will create a saitek
service provider for this and then we'll
look at how we use it within our route
really nicely and then we can reuse it
elsewhere if we need to so first thing
is let's go ahead and actually install
this so we're going to use composer
again to require this in and this is
under intervention and then / image so
we'll wait this to finish as always and
will get this included okay so now we
want to rather than just start using
this within our route and get into a
little bit of a mess I'm going to create
a provider's folder over here we'll go
ahead and pray our own cylex service
provider which is really useful
knowledge because then any kind of
service you pull into a Silex
application you can reuse and we're
going to go ahead and create an image
service provider so feel free to call
this whatever you like you can make it
as specific as you like really doesn't
matter now with any service provider we
need to implement the pimple service
provider interface so let's go over to
service provider interface and pimple
comes as part of cylex so we can just
have a look at this interface see what
we need to do and we need a register
method in here that's all we need and we
need to have an instance of the pimple
container into this as well so let's go
ahead and pull these in so let's first
of all set the namespace for this
because we are using Pierce off for
autoloading for this so we have appt
providers and let's use pimple container
because we know that we need that inside
of that register method
and it's also go ahead and use pimple
service provider interface and again I'm
going to use this syntax for putting in
my name spaces because they are under
the same route namespace so let's go
ahead and take provider interface and
we're pretty much done so we're going to
create an image service provider class
of course and we're going to implement
the service provider interface and then
we need that register method in there so
we can just go ahead and create this
like so and then into this we know that
we go contain it instance in and we can
just call this app it's usually
convention that we call this app it just
makes it a little bit easier when you're
writing code down here rather than
naming this pimple okay so now that
we've done that we need to figure out
how to actually put in intervention
image now there's a couple of ways that
we can do this we can do this either by
using a kind of facade a static class or
we can use the intervention image image
manager and I must prefer this method so
we're going to say intervention and then
image and then image manager and we're
basically just going to bind this on to
the container so to do this we say app
we give it the name that we want in this
case we're just going to call it image
and this is how we pull it out of the
container and then we going to say app
factory and then inside of here you give
a closure and we just return whatever we
need and in this case we're returning a
new image manager so this is now bound
on to the container once we register
this without app and we can use this
anywhere that we have our appt instance
available so let's go ahead and register
this and then within our roots we can
very easily use this with app image so
over in bootstrap app we just register
this as normal so much like we do with
our doctrine service provider and of
course it's our own service provider now
so let's say app register and we create
new app providers and of course is our
image service provider and of course you
can import these at the top if you
prefer it doesn't really matter too much
so let's go ahead and just give this a
refresh make sure we didn't break
anything everything looks good so we can
come over to our roots and start to use
this inside
here so we know the location of the
image we know that our images are inside
of public image and we know that we get
a filename through this query that we
created earlier so now really all we
need to do is map this up the
intervention image we can manipulate
using intervention image and then we're
pretty much ready to go so to do this
let's go ahead and create some kind of
placeholder variable will be again
fiddling around with this later because
we really need to catch these images we
don't want these to be pulled out and
then manipulated every single time you
make a request we want to cash these for
speed so we're going to thank app image
because remember we have our appt
instance in here and we're going to go
ahead and usually make method so we're
now using intervention image methods in
here to go ahead and put in an image
manipulate it and then respond with it
so in this case we're going to go ahead
and pull in the current directory here
we're going to go back a directory into
public we're going to go into image and
then we're going to basically using the
result from that query that we used
earlier we're going to grab the file
name so we now have that image ready to
start manipulating and I'm just going to
kind of pull this down onto a new lines
we need to chain on a lot of methods
here so now all we need to do is fit
this to a specific wit and a specific
height now we don't have access to these
two placeholder values at the moment and
all we do is just add these onto here so
i'm going to say width height and so on
and so forth depending on how many
placeholders you have now we can say
well we want to fit this to a width and
a height that's provided in the URL we
want to make it gray scale so all of
these kind of methods here are available
on the intervention image documentation
so if you need to do anything else to
these feel free to refer to that
documentation now what we need to do is
create a response for this placeholder
so very simply we say response P&amp;amp;G and
we're done we now literally have a PNG
image so we can't really just say well I
want to place that inside of the
response we can do but what will get is
if we just fix up the path here so you
can see we've got image but we didn't
add a slack just on the end of their we
should now see
the raw image to heater which is not
good so what we want to do is inside the
response send over some headers now we
know that when we respond we're using a
PNG all the time regardless of these
source type of the image so as a third
argument to our response we can simply
start to pass in summer headers so we
want to tell the browser that we have a
content type here of image / PNG like so
and that is pretty much it so grabbing a
random image from the database looking
that image up and responding with that
image at the width and the height that
we've requested give it a refresh and we
see a cat perfect and of course if we
refresh this we get a random selected
one every single time so that's pretty
straightforward what we can now do is
start to change this around so I can say
500 it turns mr. 200 and we get the same
thing so works really well of course
they're cut off a little bit but i'll
leave you to fiddle around with that
depending on the images that you use but
that is pretty much the basis of it
that's how easy is now we can't really
stop here because if we are using this
as a service if you were building a
service like this you really need these
images to be such as fast as possible
and the problem with this is we're
always going ahead and fitting this to a
width and height with always processing
this as grayscale so it's taking a
little bit longer than it should do and
we can kind of see this if we open up
our network tab over here and go ahead
and give this a refresh you can see that
this is actually taking if we pull this
out 172 milliseconds now that doesn't
seem a long time but ideally what we
want to do is once we have at specific
width and height manipulated this image
cache it and then just serve that image
back to us if it already exists so with
that said what we want to do is go over
in the next part and look at cashing our
rendered images</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
