or our columns set up ready to go we're
now gonna go ahead and insert our first
record into this table so we want to go
ahead and supply the information name
description and created we don't need to
supply the ID because this is Auto
increment so when we go ahead and insert
our first record this will automatically
become one and that will be the unique
identifier for that record so let's go
ahead and look at the syntax to actually
insert a record so we say insert into
and then we just describe the table name
or give the table name that we want to
insert into in this case it's articles
then what we do is we supply the fields
that we want to insert into in brackets
so in this case it's name description
and create it so they're the fields that
we want to insert into now we use the
values keyword and then in another set
of brackets we define the actual values
that we want to insert and these will be
in relation to each other so the first
say string value I give here will relate
to name the second will relate to
description and the third or crape
relate to created now Creators is a
little different name and description of
both string data just ones of that
varchar' of Max 120 and once a text
which allows for a lot longer data so
the first thing that we want to do is go
ahead and just insert a name so let's
just say working with my SQL and let's
go ahead and give this a description so
this article will cover working with my
SQL and then for the created we're going
to use a MySQL function now what this
means is the the MySQL function will
return a value to us and then go ahead
and populate this field based on the
return value so in this case we use that
now function and what this will do is it
will just populate the created field
which is a date/time with a current
timestamp which will then translate into
a date and time
so now that we've done this let's go
ahead and hit enter we see query okay
one row affected and we've now inserted
data into our database table
successfully what we now need to do
though is go ahead and look at how we
actually select data from our table and
we'll go ahead and look at that in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
