our application essentially what we're
going to be accessing data based data
with our system wouldn't work properly
without this we wouldn't be able to
store anything and what we're going to
be building here is a database wrapper
and essentially what this is it's an
abstracted way to work with our database
give ourselves easy to work with
functionality now the beauty of this
database wrapper is that it can be used
outside of this application as well so
once you finish writing this code you're
going to be able to use this in anything
you do and that's the point really of
building it like this it's it's code
reusability something that isn't tied
directly to our application we can use
this anywhere we want now we're going to
be using PDO PHP data objects have the
sole reason that we can actually then
define what kind of database that we
want to work with in this case we're
going to be using MySQL because it's so
popular but we can of course change this
and work with any other database that
they're supported by PDO so let's go
ahead and start to define our class now
we're going to be testing this along the
way in our index dot PHP file so we're
going to be looking at the kind of
things it does I'm also going to be
keeping an eye on our database so we're
going to be inserting things extracting
things querying updating looking at
security and stuff like that so this is
quite a large thing to build but once
we're done we can sort of relax and and
know that we can work really efficiently
with our database so let's go ahead and
define the class this is just going to
be dB now we're going to be working with
a pattern in PHP called the singleton
pattern so we're going to have a main
static in a static method called get
instance and this is just going to allow
us to get the an instance of our
database if it's already been if it's
already been instantiated and basically
this means that we don't have to keep
connecting to our database again and
again and again on each page we can just
use the database on the fly as we want
if you were to create a class with a
constructor which we'll do in a moment
you would be every time you need to you
instantiate your database object to
perhaps creating new query and taking
new set of results you'd be connecting
to your database again and again again
which is very very inefficient so we're
just going to be using the get instant
static method in this case if that
doesn't make sense don't worry as we
build the code it will make perfect
sense hopefully so the first thing that
we're going to do is create a public and
I we can create a private static
variable called instant instance that's
going to be null let's give that a
underscore as well so what we've done
here is we've created a private static
property to our object and this is going
to store the instance of the database if
it's available if or if it's not
available we're going to instantiate our
DB object from within it and store it
here again sounds complicated but once
we get around this pattern it's going to
make things or things should become a
lot clearer eventually so we have some
other private properties these aren't
going to be static properties these are
just going to be private properties
within our object which won't be
accessible to outside of this class
won't be accessible to anything that
extends from this we just need them to
be private there's no need for them to
be public so we have private PDO and the
underscore basically is a notation that
lets us know that as we're using these
they are private properties and they're
not they're not public or protect or
protected would use underscore two so we
have a PDO query and I'll explain all
these in just a moment
error results and count we're going to
set count to zero and we're going to set
error
- folks now we can bring these down line
by line - just make it look a bit neater
things make it a little bit more sense
so what's happening here is we've got
PDO this is going to represent the when
we when we instantiate the PDO object
we're going to store it here so we can
use it elsewhere query is going to be
the last query that's executed error is
going to represent whether there's an
error or not so whether the query failed
or not and we'll have a method to check
or return whether there has been an
error we have results which will store
our result set so if we would pick say
all users with a name the first name
Alex that will be our result set say
there's 10 users that'll be stored there
and the count of results which is
extremely important because we're also
going to provide a method that's going
to allow us to say you know is there
have there been any results returned or
something like that so basically the way
that we're going to use our database
class is going to be similar to this so
it's really useful to take a look at
what we actually want our database
object to do and then we can build it so
for example let's say we want to grab a
list of all users the way we want this
to work is we want to have a basically
the ability to just say get me a certain
amount of data so quite simply we could
say something like users equals DB get
instance now this is going to be the the
method the static method that we're
going to create as part the singleton
objects so what we will cover this in
detail in a moment and we'll then say
something like query select username
from users so that's it now what we can
do is say something like if users
account
that would actually probably be a method
that we'd use so that's quite as a
method and then we can say for each
users as user echo user username and
because we're going to be returning an
object this basically represents the
field name in a database so that would
be that would represent this so this is
the way that we're going to be building
things now there's a lot more
functionality than this but you can see
looking at this it makes it a lot easier
to work with your database rather than
having to you know connect PDA at the
top of your page execute query blah blah
blah and we can basically do everything
like this and we're going to have a lot
of helper methods as well that are going
to allow us to define things in it in a
certain way so for example we could say
get from users and we could say yeah so
we can define something like where
username equals Alex so we're basically
going to be building this functionality
and it makes it so easy to work with
your database I mean look at that it
sort of reads like a book get you get
users where the username equals Alex or
user name is greater than five or it
wouldn't be user name with it it would
be something like points I don't know it
you can use this for a variety of
purposes so that's what we're basically
going to be doing so let's go ahead and
and create our constructor function and
this is this is going to do is connect
to our database so let's go ahead and
create a private method this will be
construct and this is run when the cost
since instantiated now we're going to
try the PDO connection and we're going
to catch a PDO error so this is
basically a try-catch block which allows
you to
and basically catch errors inside of the
try block so if if we do have an error
with basically just going to kill the
application and then output the message
that's returned from this and when we
are working without our connection we'll
will mess around with the settings and
see how this affects it but what we're
going to do is we're going to set the
PDO private PDO property to the PDO
connection so we're going to say new PDO
and this is just standard syntax you can
find this in the PHP documentation so
what the way this basically looks is
it's a string then we have a username
and a password
the initial string defines what what
database basically handler or whatever
however you want to call it you want to
connect to and then it defines the
database name as well and the host
obviously so in this case we're
connecting to a MySQL database the host
is going to be basically the host that
we define and I'm just going to put X's
and Y's and Zed's here because we're
going to use our config class that we
created to actually handle this so the
host is going to be one two seven or not
or one the DB name is going to be the
database name that we defined and then
we have a username and we have a
password so we'll preserve an A for
example so for the host let's go ahead
and just concatenate on a value this is
going to be config get MySQL host as we
saw when we created our our config here
so this is basically within MySQL host
so the database name is going to be
config get MySQL levy simple as that
and then for the username in the
password we already know that we've
stored these in the config they are here
and here so we just do exactly the same
thing config get
my SQL user name and exactly the same
here so let's just go ahead and just
copy and paste this and change this to
password so that's it that's our that's
our line of out of connecting to our
database let's go ahead and give this a
go just by saying DB equals new DB and
we'll look at we'll look at sorting this
out in just a moment in fact this is not
going to work and this is the whole
point of the singleton pattern we need
to call DB instance so if we were to say
DB get instance we have the well we
create the public static method and
that's going to be called get instance
now what this is going to do it's going
to check if we've already instantiated
that object by instantiating an object
we're creating we're connecting to our
database if we haven't instantiated with
we're going to instantiate it if we have
we're going to return the instance so in
this case we need a check here to say if
the instance is not set so that self
remember of dealing with static
properties here so we need to use self
and then scope resolution operator here
and we're going to say self instance so
if that's not been set we want to
actually go ahead and set that
nudee be sorry so what this is going to
do is if this isn't set which by default
it won't be when we using this on say
one page we want to go ahead and create
a new DB instance that's going to run
this set PDO here and it's then going to
return self instance so we can start
using all of the functionality of our
class or our object so if in the case
that we use this twice on a page this
will no longer be valid so this will
this will return false and all we'll do
is just return the instance that we're
currently working with we can create a
new query we just don't have to
reconnect to our database so let's take
a look at and sort of prove how this
actually works so let's refresh so we
don't have an error we we know now that
we are more than likely just using the
right credentials but if we were to say
root Zed or something like that the guy
having refresh you can see that we we
kill the page and we we get the error
back there so we know that we're
connecting successfully to our database
or we can safely assume that we are
let's take a look at what happens here
so if I go ahead and echo connect it
here in fact we'll put that inside of
try block so let's go ahead and refresh
so we say connected now because we're
where we would ordinarily be running the
constructor function every time we
instantiate this class create an object
from it we'd assume that if we were to
do this then we would see this message
again and again and again but because
we're first calling gate instance we're
checking whether this has been set or
not
ie we're checking whether this private
construct method has been called and
we've actually connected to our database
so when i refresh now refreshing the
page we only connect once now if this
was to be reversed and we had this as a
public function and we were to ignore
the fact that we were to get instance
and we were to say something like DB
equals new DB and do this over and over
and over and over again what we're then
doing is if we were to use this down a
page
you know a few times we're connecting to
our database again and again again
there's no need to we only need to we
only need to store one connection one
sort of link to our database if you like
so by doing this we actually avoid the
need to having able to have to even
accidentally connect to our database
again and again and again so we've
connected to a database really what's
left to do now is just go over the the
useful methods that we need to create
inside of our database to be able to
pull data and actually manipulate data
update things delete records and things
like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
