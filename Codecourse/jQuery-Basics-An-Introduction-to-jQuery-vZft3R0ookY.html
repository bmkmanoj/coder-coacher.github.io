welcome to this video on an introduction
to jQuery okay so the first thing we're
going to look at is what is jQuery we're
going to take a look at the website and
it's a pretty decent website with a lot
of information about jQuery we're also
going to look at why we might be using
it and we're going to be looking at a
couple of examples as well okay so what
is jQuery well if you head over to
jQuery comm you can already see a very
short description of what jQuery
actually is and then the last paragraph
which is probably the most important
concept surrounding jQuery is jQuery is
designed to change the way that you
write JavaScript okay so essentially it
is a JavaScript library we're not going
to be looking at simplifying htl a HTML
document reversing but we're gonna be
looking mainly at event handling
animating and also Ajax interactions so
when we look at Ajax on or rather in its
simpler form or in its raw form we tend
to find it's quite complicated so jQuery
is going to simplify that for us as well
so well yeah like I said we're mainly
focusing on them three elements of
jQuery the fact that it is lightweight
which is another benefit of jQuery means
that it won't increase page load time
too much if we just take a look over
here you can see that the production
version of jQuery is 31 kilobytes so as
you can imagine this won't have a
significant load time or an impact on
the load time of your page we're going
to talk more about the production and
the development differences a bit later
on okay so we've seen it it's
lightweight we have a lightweight
footprint at cs3 css3 compliant it's
really important due to the standards of
websites today obviously we validate our
CSS and our HTML using validation
services and probably the most
interesting and and most impressive is
that it is cross browser compatible so
if you've written to JavaScript before
and it hasn't worked on some browsers
and it has worked on other browsers
because obviously it's important to test
the pages that you're creating on other
browsers to ensure that they are
compatible as well then you'll be glad
to know that jQuery is cross browser
compatible so you'll get instant
compatibility with all major browsers
and the versions so we've got IE 6.0
firefox 2.0 safari 3.0 and these are all
upwards so they're always essentially
going to work opera and all versions of
Chrome
ok so let's go out and take a look at
this production &amp;amp; development and the
difference between production and
development so let's just think about
what we might want to do with a
production or a development version now
production version is a minified in gzip
version of the uncompressed code and
essentially this is what you want to use
if you have if you want to essentially
just write in jQuery so if you want to
use the jQuery library on your website
you would download the production
version because we have to include
jQuery on every every page that we use
it we actually need to keep this
relatively fast however we also have a
development version in fact let's just
take a look at the production version
first of all you can see that we have
it's been it's been compressed so it's a
lot smaller it doesn't really make much
sense to the human eye the development
version however is if you would want to
either manually modify jQuery to work in
different ways you might not want to do
that but the main benefit of this
development uncompressed version is if
you want to write your own plugins
plugins are available to download to use
in addition to the standard jQuery
library however we're going to take a
look at that
when we come to it ok so we have the
development version if we were just to
click on this and click download you can
see that the code looks a lot more
readable and as it's just plain
JavaScript ok so the next thing we're
going to take a look at is the the fact
that some people do actually disagree
with the use of jQuery they find it's
unnecessary to use this shorthand
library and some people would say it's
lazy however there are there is one main
benefit that I
found is that you're using the same
standard again and again from the same
library and obviously the team at jQuery
will always be updating the version of
jQuery so you're always going to get a
standard and everything's going to be
built on top of it and you're going to
get the you know let's just give an
example if you were to create one
website with jQuery and you were to use
shorthand jQuery notation to access the
jQuery library you using the same
standard as well jQuery if you were to
come over to another website and use
jQuery again you're not changing the
code that you've really used you're
using the same library and therefore you
are keeping the same standard across all
of your projects and you can see that
the there's a major use of jQuery among
very popular companies and company
websites so that's probably another
great reason that you should use it
because you should follow follow suit
from all these great companies okay so
there's a section on the jQuery con
website you can go across to this now if
you haven't already and actually click
on this run code now bear in mind when I
click this button this code here is the
only code that we've used to actually
actually get this effect from this so
let's go ahead and click on it so you
can see that that's just nicely scrolled
out and we've shown a box with some text
in so you might not believe it if you've
never used jQuery before but this line
here was the only thing required to
actually open that box up it's a
paragraph element open that paragraph
element up and actually display that so
jQuery is it actually extremely easy to
use as well okay so I may have missed
some points about jQuery but this is a
general idea of what jQuery is why we
use it the benefits of using it and of
taking you around the jquery website so
you should be comfortable using it there
is very well documented information well
we have a jQuery has a great document
documentation for the library so you can
go there whenever you need to find help
with specific things to do with jQuery
however this is the general idea of Jake
we use it to shorthand JavaScript we
have animations and most interestingly
our Ajax interactor interactions okay so
that's a basic introduction to jQuery
and in the next video we're actually
going to look at how we can add jQuery
to our web page and then start to use
some effects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
