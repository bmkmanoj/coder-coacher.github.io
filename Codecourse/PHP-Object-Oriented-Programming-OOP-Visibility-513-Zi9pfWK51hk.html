probably going to be wondering what this
means we've always used public but is
actually three scopes of visibilities in
total let's list them up here we have
public
we have protected and we have private
and I'm going to demonstrate each of
these to you so let's start with these
I'm going to change these to protected
and the inside our penguin class I'm
just going to create a new method and
I'm just going to call this foo since
this is just a test and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to echo this leg
count so I'm referring to this property
and like I said in the last tutorial
every subclass ie a class that inherits
another class inherits all of its
properties so this should work fine so
checking out out we didn't call the
method penguin foo and we get to which
is fine that's expected however if we
were to change this to private we get
undefined property penguin leg count and
that's because when we set a property or
methods visibility to private only the
class that it's in can access them so
you see down here we're returning this
leg count that's fine because this
method is in this class but here that
we're getting an error because this
penguin class is a totally separate
class even though it's a subclass now
protected means that subclasses ie
classes that can that inherit the class
they can access them so this will be
fine however if we try to access this
this property from outside of the
subclass so penguin leg count
we we get cannot access protected
property penguin Lacan however if we
change this to public hit refresh and I
didn't echo it we get to which is great
and this also works with methods so if
we change this to private and we say if
penguin can fly and we'll just do
something here hit refresh and we get
called private method bird can fly and
the same with protected call to
protected method bird can fly so we have
to keep this at public to allow our our
developers to use this outside of the
subclass and that's why we use getters
and setters as well so we can access the
properties that are set to protected and
private without having an issue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
