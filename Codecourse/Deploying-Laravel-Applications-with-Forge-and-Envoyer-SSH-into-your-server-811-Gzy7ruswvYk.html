our server if we ever need to take a
look in there perform any maintenance
install anything else it's very rare
that you would do this but it's good to
know
so the first step then is to grab the IP
address of your server that's important
and also remember the email that you are
sent earlier with the sudo password
which can be useful and the username
we're gonna go over to our terminal I'm
inside of the SSH directory now at the
moment we can't actually SSH into our
server let's actually try it and see
what happens so let's go ahead and try
this and you can see here we get
permission denied public key now the
reason for this is that inside of forge
we actually need to set the keys that
are allowed to access this server that's
really important we don't use a password
to SSH in that's pretty an insecure
we're going to be using a public and
private key so I'm using a Mac and I'm
gonna generate my key on the command
line but if you are using Windows you
can use something like putty so how do
we generate an SSH key well let's go
ahead and do this
I'm currently within my SSH directory
within my home folder and I'm gonna go
and say SSH key gen T RSA that's gonna
ask me where I want to save this and I'm
just gonna call this in stick atom e hit
enter I'm gonna overwrite the one that
already exists because I already had one
I don't want a passphrase so I'm gonna
hit enter again so now we actually have
a public key called insta CAD amitabh so
we can use the cat command to go into
Academy pub that we'll just output that
to the screen there and we can go ahead
and copy all of these contents over and
we can paste these in so I'm just gonna
call this Alex paste that in and hit add
key and what that'll do is it will
install that key on the server so next
time we connect we can specify that we
want to use the insta CAD me key and
that will go ahead and allow me in then
so that's installing that key now just
wait for a couple of minutes while that
finishes ok so that's now installed and
we can go ahead and reconnect and this
it will let us in so let's just clear
the screen here and this time we're
gonna SSH over as Forge we're gonna go
ahead and grab the IP address again so
we'll copy and paste this and this time
we're going to choose which key we want
so it's in stick atom E that's the
private key so now this will let us in
and we are now within the bun to
operating system on our server perfect
so we can list a directory now and you
can see that is our site so if you have
multiple sites you'll see lots of these
and you can see now this is called insta
Khadem e-comm we know exactly what it is
and we can go and basically switch over
to that directory you can see the public
folder now remember the public folder is
basically what we have under the meta
under our site so if we go over to our
site again and a meta you can see that
directory there if this was ever changed
which we'll do later when we go ahead
and we use envoy to actually deploy then
we need to update this but for now we
know that this far here is basically
what we're being served here is that's
the PHP info file so if you did ever
want to mess around in here you go ahead
and create new files you can do whatever
you want pretty much but that is
essentially what we have we can look
into this later when we set envoy up to
see what's going on so we now have the
ability to SSH into our server we can do
whatever you want from here if you want
to manually restart services you can go
ahead and do so now this will ask you
for your sudo password which we know
it's just here so we can just go ahead
and grab this pseudo password and we can
paste that in and that will go ahead and
restart the server for us so we are now
inside of our server with SSH tin and
we're ready to move on to set up on voya
bar in the next video we're going to
talk a little bit about what envoy is
and why it's useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
