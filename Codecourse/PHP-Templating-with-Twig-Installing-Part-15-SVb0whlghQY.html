at templating engines with PHP now
there's a lot of controversy regarding
PHP template in engines many will argue
the PHP itself is a sufficient enough
templating engine which is true that's a
hundred percent correct but for those of
you who like your views to be a little
bit more organized and a little bit more
readable well we have template engines
now there are a few Turnitin engines for
PHP we have twig here which is built by
the same people who build the symphony
framework we have smarty and we also
have plates in this series we're going
to be focusing solely on twig so I
already have an empty directory here
I also have an open up in my browser the
first thing we want to do is install
twig now if we click here there's going
to be some instructions we have a
composer which is the recommended method
of installation they also provide a
direct download link someone but we're
not going to be using that we're going
to be using composer as it suggests so
to do that we're going to have to make
sure composer is installed which for me
it already is so let's just test it out
composer perfect if you don't get this
then you probably don't have it
installed to install it just go to get
composer dog and follow the instructions
there it's literally just one command
they have to paste into your terminal
and it's installed so now we have
composer installed we're going to CD
into the directory and we're going to
compose a search I can spell compose a
search twig and we want this one the
official twig so we're going to say
composer require twigs last week and
we're just going to provide an asterisk
which means any version and we're just
going to let this install so that's how
you install twig</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
