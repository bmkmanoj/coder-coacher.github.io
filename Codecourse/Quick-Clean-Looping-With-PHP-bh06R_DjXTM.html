yourself needing to loop through to a
certain number so for example if we want
to count from 1 to 10 obviously this is
a useless example but you want to count
from a specific number let's say Y and
you want to count up from that so we're
going to count from 1 to 10 Y being the
flexible value so we can use something
like a for loop we could say for x
equals 1 and while X is less than or
equal to Y X plus plus fairly
straightforward we can go ahead and
output X and concatenate on a line break
that will basically give us 1 to 10 with
line breaks now this is a little bit
annoying because we have to write out
this specific syntax and it does get a
little bit confusing and immediately
it's not difficult to look and see
what's going on here but it's more
difficult than the method I'm going to
show you so instead of doing this we'll
just get rid of this we're gonna use a
for each loop instead so to do this
we're gonna say for each range which
will basically give us an array of a
specific number to another number so in
this case let's just get rid of this for
now actually and we'll do a print our on
range 1 to Y and that gives us this so
we've got an array with values 1 to 10
now what we can do in a cleaner way we
can say for each we can use range in
here so 1 2 y as X and then we can do
exactly the same thing so this cleaner
solution gives us exactly the same
result so whatever you're looping
through and if you find this syntax
clearer some people might not but in
this case if we're just literally
looping through a load of numbers or a
load of values this is often the cleaner
way to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
