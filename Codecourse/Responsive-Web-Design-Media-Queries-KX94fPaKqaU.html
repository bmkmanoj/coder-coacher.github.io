going to talking about media queries and
how to use them effectively so you may
be aware that since CSS - we've been
able to say that a stylesheet should
only apply to a certain media type for
example we could have a document use a
large font on a screen then use a small
font for print the screen and print our
media types media queries allow us to go
a bit beyond this and be more specific
about when we want our styles to apply
so immediate query consists of a media
type and then 0 or more expressions that
check for the conditions of a particular
media feature among the media features
that we can query our width height and
color and we also have minimums and
maximums within those width and Heights
so the media query itself is an
expression that's either going to
evaluate it true or false and if it
evaluates to true the style that's
associated with it is going to be
applied and if it's evaluates to false
it's not going to be applied so how do
we write a media query well it's just
like I've written here we start with the
media type that we want to target
whether that be a computer screen or a
print preview or a handheld device or
even all the media types and then we
separate from the media type by using
the word and and then we use these media
features we bracket them separately and
we use one of these media features here
so this is where we really get a bit
more specific so for example we could
specify a set of widths where our style
should apply so let's jump straight into
an example so here I have a fairly
standard desktop layout a just to 50
percent more I'd columns and you can see
at the moment is quite nice to read
because we have a good amount of words
per line we have about 10 words per line
here but then when we scale it down you
can see that it starts to get a little
bit uncomfortable so but when it gets
this at a point and we have less than 5
words per line it's just not as
comfortable for read so wouldn't it be
great if we could have our columns
spread out and fill 100% of the width I
mean
to a certain point and we can so the
first step is to choose a break point a
break point is the point where you want
the new style to kick in so the way I'm
going to do this is when you're choosing
break points try not to target specific
devices it can be tempting to sort of
look at the resolution of certain
devices and try to base your break
points around that but the aim with
responsive design is to provide the
optimal experience and any size so
choose break points based on your design
and is resize the window until it feels
uncomfortable if you're in Chrome if you
open up the dev tools and then
background them and resize your window
you'll get and this sort of scope up at
the top right to see what size your
window is so it looks to me like this is
getting a little bit uncomfortable just
around 600 pixels so I'm going to write
a media query with the break point of
600 pixels so this is the page that
you're just looking at and you can see
we've linked in this style sheet style
dot CSS or I'll open that up I'm going
to go down to the bottom here because we
want we're going to be affecting the
width of the column glass so we need it
to be after the initial 50% width that
we've written beforehand so the way we
write media queries within a style sheet
is we say at media and then we write our
media query so I'm going to target all
media types then we use that word and to
separate from the media features and
then we're going to write our media
feature so we put it in brackets and we
want to say max width of 600 and then
open up some curly braces so now we can
just write normal CSS within this block
here but it's only going to apply when
the viewport has a width of 600 pixels
or smaller so let's say it's just normal
CSS so we're going to say in here dot
column give it a width of 100%
notice here I've said I've targeted all
media types and I've had to use that and
keyword however if we totally take that
out and we don't specify a media type
that all media type is actually implied
so we don't need to have that in there
so now let's look at our site now you
can see if I resize my very past 600
pixels the column spreads out to 100%
width and it's easier to read for our
users so currently this conditional
style is embedded within our stylesheet
this is not the only way we can do it so
I'm going to comment this out here
because we can also put it inside a link
tag you may have seen this before but if
I make a link tag here and I can add an
immediate attribute to it so inside this
media attribute is just like what we put
after the app media so that's why we put
our media query so I'm going to put my
max width 600 pixels in there and then
I'm going to link it to another file so
I'm going to call this file small box
CSS and I believe we've already created
this so in here is just what we had
within the block in side our CSS so now
if we look at that and save both files
should see is that has the exact same
effect so there's two ways of doing this
this is the separate way and this here
is the embedded way and there are
advantages and disadvantages to both so
usually embedded is best because it
avoids having to download the extra file
even though it's a very small file it's
an extra HTTP request and that can slow
down page load times and that's really
not something that you want to be doing
also having this embedded means you can
keep all the styles for the column in
the same place and that's quite handy
sometimes however there may be times one
is more organized to put it in a
separate file for example if you had
like a print stylesheet that you wanted
to have completely separate from your
main stylesheet and it didn't have a
whole lot in common
your main stylesheet you could put that
separately and it wouldn't make a whole
lot of difference so that's one of many
decisions you'll have to consider when
working with media queries so anyway
most queries that you're going to create
will probably involve width in some way
in sites that scroll vertically the
width is what's going to cause the
layout to change the most usually you'll
want to use a range rather than a
specific width like we've done here so
here we've just set an upper bound of
600 pixels and then everything below
that the style within this block is
going to apply but what if we wanted to
set a lower bound so let's say we wanted
to make the header orange between 400
and 800 pixels so we create our app
media and then we could use our media
features so we say min width this is how
we set our lower bound I'm going to say
for pick 400 pixels sorry and then we
say and max width 800 pixels so you can
see it's a fairly intuitive syntax and
it's really quite nice so now we can go
in here I'm using the html5 header
element so there's no dot or anything
there so I'm going to say background
color orange and again we're coming
after the the initial rule that sets the
color for the header because otherwise
no sorry this one because otherwise it
would not apply so now if we save that
and look over here you can see that
between 800 and 400 pixels we're getting
that start applied so that's how you set
a range and tie multiple query of
conditions together do note that each
media feature is bracketed separately so
there are lots of other media features
we can query but I'm only going to talk
about with today as that's the most
important one if you're interested in
looking
the others you can go over to the
Mozilla developer Network page for media
queries and look at all of these media
features but trust me when I say that
the most important one for everyone is
going to be width min width and max
width so now we've looked at media
features let's have a look at these
media types so if we go over to the w3c
page for media types there's a really
good explanation for each of the media
types so we can see that all as I said
earlier it's suitable for all devices
the print is intended for Page material
and for documents viewed on screen in
print preview mode so it's very clear
about when each media type is going to
apply so let's look at an example of
this in action so I have this web layout
here as you can see it's a fairly
standard web layout again so we have our
navigation at the top the content in the
middle and some top quality advertising
at the bottom if I go to a print preview
of this page that you can see that we
still have our navigation visible and we
still have our advertising visible this
is not really ideal for the user because
when they're printing a page what
they're really looking to print is just
the content in mind they're going to
have limited paper and limited ink and
you really don't want to be printing
anything for them they don't want you to
print so let's see how we can control
that so this is the page that you're
just looking at and again you can see
that we've linked in this style sheet
style dot CSS so we'll go over to there
and we're going to create a media query
at the bottom here and all we're going
to do is target the media type print
we're not going to use any media
features and in here we're just going to
hide the navigation and the ad so we're
just going to do that by saying just
plain on and you know also just to stop
people from sort of frustratedly trying
to click on their piece of printed paper
I'm also going to say in here I'm going
to take the anchor tags and I'm going to
give them
separation or took stir text-decoration
of none and then give it a color of
inherit so it takes the color from the
text around it so now if we refresh that
you'll see there's no change visibly on
the screen but then when we go to a
print preview all we're left with is the
content so our navigation is gone our
advertisement is gone and we've nicely
hidden those links so in a moment this
is only applying to where the media type
is print or if we wanted to apply it say
to when the media type is anything but
screen so we've already looked at the
and operator we saw that earlier when we
were tying together to mediate media
features so let's look at the not
operator so if I was to say in here not
screen the not keyword here or the not
operator negates the entire query so
where it would usually be true it's
going to be false and where it's going
to be usually false it's going to be
true so now in every media type apart
from screen this is what's going to be
displayed so again if we refresh the
page here you're not going to see a
change but when we go to the print
preview because it's not a screen media
type that's what we're going to see
we're going to see the star that we've
put in that block so that's how we use
the not keyword do note that when you're
using the not operator if you're using
it with media features say we're using
it with max-width
you can't leave out the media type so
before we could and the media type of
all would be specified but here you do
have to say it explicitly so just bear
that in mind
we can also use multiple media queries
together so let's say we wanted to apply
this style here on everything that's not
a screen but also on screens with a
width smaller than 400 pixels so all we
have to do is come a separate our media
queries so now in here we're going to
say max width 400 pixels I'm going to
say screens wet so what this is doing
here is we're looking for anything that
isn't a screen and anything that is a
screen and is less than or equal to 4
pixels in 400 pixels in width so this
coma acts like a logical or so if either
of these things are true then the style
is going to get applied so let's have a
look at that now so now again you see no
change until we go down to a tear less
than 400 pixels and also when we're in
print preview that still applies so
that's all the basic syntax but there
are a lot of other style considerations
when working with media queries we've
already looked at embedded versus
external you also have to consider how
you'll build up your media queries so
often you'll have multiple different
write points and there are different
ways to layer them first of all it's a
good idea to keep a base style outside
of any media queries for unsupported
browsers namely Internet Explorer 8 and
below so if you look at anything that
we're doing earlier we've had quite a
lot outside the media queries and very
little inside actually but after your
base style you can either overlap
queries or put them sort of back to back
and have them at the start apply
individually so let's look at these two
methods so overlapping all notice we
have no upper bound on the queries so
they're going to run into each other so
you can see here I've commented in
where we're going to be picking up
things from the previous query so you
can see here because there's no upper
bound on 300 everything that has a width
of 600 or higher is also going to have a
width of 300 or higher so it's going to
collect in everything from the 300 pixel
or more or query likewise with the lack
of upper bound on 600 we're going to get
everything in in 900 from both 600 and
300 so we're getting this sort of
cumulative effect where and these
queries pick up everything before them
so now we can look at the individual and
back-to-back method so you'll see here
that the Styles don't run into each
other at all so what we have is this
coming from 300 to 500 99 and then this
one takes over from 600 to 800 99 and
then this takes over from 900 onwards so
these are totally mutually exclusive and
they sort of start afresh each time so
that they don't depend on each other at
all there are a couple of things to bear
in mind about both of these methods when
you're overlapping you will have to
override styles from the previous
queries so you can see here the first
query there min with 300 pixels applies
a border to all the divs
but what if after 600 pixels I don't
want a border well I'm going to have to
override that and say or zero pixels or
border none' whereas in the individual
or back-to-back method I wouldn't have
to do that because these are not relying
on each other at all the other thing
about overlapping which is a slight
niggle is that the order matters so if
you were to put say this 900 pixel query
up here what we put in the 900 pixel
query is now going before
it's going to go in here which means
that again we have this or overriding
issue because if we wanted to have a
border radius of 10 pixels in here and
we'd expect that to work then we'd be
wrong in fact of the wrong way around
because you can see that when the
browser is reading this it's going to
apply a color of red a border of 2
pixels the border radius of 10 but then
it's going to come back down and if it's
got a minimum width of 900 it's
definitely going to have a minimum width
of 600 so it's going to follow on and
it's going to see the border radius of 5
pixels and apply that so what we put in
there is going to not be applied so
that's something to be aware of as well
hopefully that made sense to you in the
individual style the order doesn't
matter at all so we can shuffle these
about as much as we want and nothing's
going to happen when you're doing it
individually the downside is that you
might end up rewriting quite a lot of
stuff so you can see that there is quite
a bit more code here than there is up
here if you take out the comments that
I've put in then there's really not a
whole lot of code there whereas down
here there's quite a bit because we're
doing both the upper bounds and then we
might end up repeating styles a few
times so repeated color red there also
be careful if you're doing this sort of
individual back to back style be careful
not to overlap at all so I'm going to
shuffle these back so that it makes a
bit more sense starting like that so you
might have noticed earlier I had to fix
this because it said 600 pixels so
that's 600 pixels is going to overlap
one pixel with this so for Windows that
are exactly 600 pixels wide both of
these are going to apply there's not a
huge problem in this case but we are
going to get a border where we don't
want it here because we're going to
collect in this border here which is
something that we didn't expect to
happen so do be careful that they are
completely
usually exclusive a general rule unless
you have like radically different styles
for each breakpoint overlapping tends to
be easier if you're using different
background images however for different
sizes then you should apply them with
this back-to-back style this is because
WebKit browsers download all background
images even if they get overridden so as
an example of this let's create a new
file quickly and say I had FCSS saying
div background image of fluffy cats dot
ping actually let's go kittens because
they're just more fun on me and then if
we were to later apply like happy dog
it's in the same supply to the same
element but in WebKit both of these are
going to be downloaded even though this
is being overridden and this is what's
going to be applied that's what we want
to see but both are being downloaded so
that's going to slow down your load
times it's going to be extra load on the
server it's just something you really
don't want so when you're overlapping be
really careful about that
it's usually best if you're going to be
doing background images to do them
back-to-back to avoid downloading
anything that you don't have to there's
no reason that you can't use both
methods if you have very similar styles
if your different breakpoints and you
want to overlap but you have background
images as well and that's fine you can
overlap and then just do small queries a
small back-to-back queries for your
images another thing to consider is what
you want default to be so I mentioned
earlier that it's a good idea to have as
much code as possible outside of media
queries but what should that style be
outside you know should it be should we
work from the mobile style and then
build up or should we work from the
desktop style and so we'll break it down
maybe somewhere in between where you
often find that your mobile styles are
more simple than your desktop styles and
so
the better starting point especially if
you can be using the overlapping method
also remember what I said about WebKit
browsers here if you were doing the
overlapping and you did have the
background images in there and you're
starting from the desktop and they're
breaking down then mobile devices would
have to download all the desktop assets
as well as the mobile assets and bear in
mind that mobile devices are far more
likely to be on slower connection or
even to have limited data so controlling
what their device downloads is really
quite important than making sure they
have a good experience on your website
so that's a strong argument for using
the mobile style as your default another
point is that unless you intervene the
default is what's going to be seen on
the unsupported browsers so Internet
Explorer 8 and below statistically most
of your visitors will be on desktops and
it is unfortunately still important to
support ie8 because it represents a good
20% of desktop traffic there are a few
options for Internet Explorer you can
use conditional comments so I'll create
another new file here the way this works
is you just say if it's less than IE 9
go there then oh what am i doing
Christ okay so it's like a conditional
comments so it's just like an HTML
comment so you open it up like that and
have this little if statement if less
than IE 9 and then you create your link
tag I'm not in HTML mode so I can't do
that then you create your link tag in
here and you make that something like ie
dot CSS and then close it just like that
and if close it something like that no
you need to close your HTML comment
obviously so then what you're doing
there is serving a single static
stylesheet to Internet Explorer 9
eight and below so that's one option so
that's not bad there is also the option
of responds EAS this is a pretty
lightweight scripts made by Scott jail
or gel not entirely sure how to
pronounce that but it as it says here
it's a polyfill for the min/max with CSS
media queries so it it only supports the
minimum max width media queries but
that's really as I said earlier most of
what you're going to be using media
queries for so this would do exactly
what you wanted to do in most cases note
the unsupported browsers with javascript
disabled will not work with this but
they're very much the minority and to be
honest they are just asking for trouble
so I wouldn't worry too much about them
so there you go that's all the advice I
have for you for using media queries for
your responsive web designs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
