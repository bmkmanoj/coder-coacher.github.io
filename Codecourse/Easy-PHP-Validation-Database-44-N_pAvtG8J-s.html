these fields and we've seen how we can
extend this but what we're not doing is
we're not interacting without database
in any way so what we're gonna do now is
we're gonna build in functionality that
allows us to check the uniqueness of a
username and an email now I'm gonna
leave this quite open because you may
have your own database wrapper that you
might want to pass in to the validation
class as a dependency but for the sake
of this video we're going to build a
basic database wrapper that we can use
here and you can go ahead and use that
for your own purpose if you need to so
let's start to look at what we need to
do we obviously need to extend our
validator as we have already done we
need to add an additional rule we need
to add another message but let's create
this database wrapper just so we can
pass this in and we know that we can use
this so I'm gonna call this class date
this class database and I'm gonna store
that as database dot PHP so what we're
gonna need to do now is inject it as a
dependency into our validator so just up
here let's require this in and let's
instantiate this down here it doesn't
take any arguments will be hard coding
all of the login in from I secure our
server login information inside of the
class you can pull that from your
configuration or whatever and we're
gonna pass this as a dependency first
into validator so we need to modify the
validator class because that takes a new
dependency now and that is a database
soil type hinter and we'll call this
variable DB so we're gonna say this DB
and we're gonna assign that the value
that's passed in and we'll create a
property up here to store that so within
our validator we now have access to
whatever functionality is within our
database if you have your own database
wrapper that you've already created or
you want to download already made one
just pass that in as I've done now and
you can just use that straight off so
you could probably forward the video and
skip the part where we actually create
our own wrapper
this is gonna be fairly straightforward
though so let's go ahead and start doing
this so I'm going to store a few values
here so things like the host the
database that we're going to be using
that's website I already have this
created so let's log into MySQL and look
at this and let's use the website
database and if we show all tables you
can see that we've got a user's table
and let's just describe that so you can
see that I've created this already we've
got an idea user name an email and a
password and I think I have a test
record in there already there we are
so we can use this information already
you know this is going to be different
to yours so we have the databases
website we obviously need to connect
with the username and in this case for
me its root and the password this is
just nothing for me so we also need to
store a few things that allow us to
store statements and we also need to
store which table we're working on we're
going to change some methods here I'm
also going to create this PDO object
here which will be public so we can
access that wherever we want so
basically what we need to do now is
create a constructor and this is
basically going to set the PDO property
we created up here to a new PDO object
now this takes a string which tells you
it's driver you want to use you can use
MySQL I here if you want but we're using
PDO just for flexibility so I'm going to
connect to a MySQL database the host we
already know that's going to be this
host the database name we already know
that's going to be this DB and then
after here we have the login information
so this will be root in this case it
would just be this username
and then this password cool so let's
just refresh our page here just to make
sure nothing went wrong and it did so
access denied okay so the password I
think is root there we are so as long as
you're connecting now you now have
access to this PDO instantiated PDO
object so let's create the ability to
select the table and I'm not going to go
through this too much because you might
be using your own wrapper or you might
just not really care about this wrapper
but we want to be able to set a table
and this means that we can chain methods
on so we're gonna say this table and
we're gonna assign that the value that's
passed in here and then we're going to
return the whole object so this means
that we can do something like if we just
go inside of index we can do something
like say DB table query so we can do
something like table users and then we
can do something like in here select
everything from whatever out that
wouldn't really matter but we can do
something like insert here so that's
basically the idea behind this okay so
the next method we need to create is a
basic query so we're gonna say this is
gonna take an SQL string and all we're
gonna do here is we're gonna return this
PDO query SQL that's it in fact I don't
actually think we need this to be honest
the way that we're working with things
we probably don't need this so let's
leave this one out what we are going to
do though is we're going to create a
exists method and that's going to be
used inside of our validator so we're
gonna say exists and this is basically
an intake some data and this data is
gonna look something like this username
Alex and that's going to return true or
false whether this actually exists or
not
so what we need to do here is we need to
be able to actually create a where
operation so let's create a method here
called where and this is going to take a
field an operator and a value so this is
going to be something this is going to
be called like this DB where username
equals Alex so that's how we're gonna
call this and this exists method will
use where it's just basically cutting
things up so we're not doing too much in
each in each method and we're also going
to have a count method as well which is
gonna return the count of the last
statement executed so let's fill in this
where one now the SQL for this is
basically just going to be put this in
double quotes it's gonna be select
everything from and then we have the
table name this table and we're setting
the table here and then we're able to
chain on where so select everything from
this table where now we already have the
field the operator and the value so
we're gonna bind the value in a moment
so we're gonna say we're field operator
question mark now we're gonna prepare
this statement so this would ordinarily
look something like this where username
equals Alex for example but we're not
doing that because we want to take
security into consideration so we are
going to say this statement and we're
gonna set this to a prepared statement
like this so that hasn't actually run
the query but then what we can then do
is say this statement executes and we
can pass in an array of values
to replace the question marks so we're
creating a prepared statement and we're
executing this with this value here so
we're username
we saw an example equals doesn't equal
or whatever value which is here which is
injected in when it's executed and then
we're going to return this we're not
going to be training anything in fact
yeah we are we're gonna be training
count onto this within exists
so within exists this is now fairly
straightforward we've got data which
represents something like I said
username Alex this is basically going to
be passed into this wherever we want to
use it just for simplicity we want to
extract the field from this and we do
this by saying array keys on data and
then we get the first element so that
will just be username for example in the
example I just typed then we want to
return this where field like we've just
extracted equals data so the data that
we're getting here at that field then
we're returning the count now if the
count is positive we return true from
this otherwise we return false so the
count is super simple we just say return
this St MT row counts the last statement
count this isn't obviously perfect you
can add more to this but that's
basically our database wrapper hopefully
that makes sense but if not I'll just
quickly run through it we're connecting
we're giving the ability to select a
table so we can actually test this
inside of index dot PHP and just to make
sure we've got everything working so I'm
going to do a var dump on this just to
check that we get back true or false
so I'm going to say DB table users
exists username Alex now this should
return true so we're passing in this
here
well that's then doing is what we're
selecting the table first here obviously
and then what this is doing is it's
taking a field which is equal to
username it's running the where query at
the where method with username equal
Alex because that's picking up on the
field we pass in here and that's
returning account so where we'll do a
select everything from this table where
the field it equals Alex and it's return
basically paying that and then the
counts already stored so we use the
count on here so let's check if this
works we should get false that's
actually wrong let's just go back to
next page are there we go username so I
spelt the field name wrong okay so when
i refresh we get a bill of true if we
would say username Billy that's
obviously going to be false because it
doesn't exist in our record set ok so
now that we've got this functionality we
can scrap this example and we can
actually start to build in the
validation here so we're already
injecting our databases our dependency
we need to just go through the standard
process now in order to allow for this a
unique operator or this unique rule so
let's define this in here actually first
so I'm gonna say unique users now what
this means is it means that I want this
username to be unique to the users table
so this is the user table username is
the name of the field the only downside
to this method is that we can't
explicitly define which column we want
to use to check unique so this name of
this field must match but you know you
can go ahead and chop and change this
now we also want the email to be unique
to users as well so we're checking for
the uniqueness of a username and an
email which is pretty straightforward
standard ok so inside of our validator
let's add this as a valid rule and let's
also add a message in here so the
message we want is going to be something
like that field is already taken so this
will be this username is already taken
this email is already taken so down here
let's now create a new method
it and we'll call this unique obviously
so this is obviously gonna take the
field the value and the satisfier
remember in this case the satisfy is the
table so what we want to do here is we
want to return this.d be much like we
did on index just a moment ago as an
example and we're gonna say exists
so within exists oh sorry table first so
the table is the satisfier now when we
choose exists when we pass in an array
with a field and a value the field and
the value we know are provided to us
here so we just say field and value
that's it straight forward so now what
this is gonna do is it's gonna return
true if the user does exist but we want
to negate this because if the user does
exist that's a false check we're gonna
say that's wrong so we just add an
exclamation mark here so now what we're
gonna do is test this out so we know
that we've got a user name called Alex
when I hit this it obviously doesn't do
anything because this is passing through
an empty value you could of course in
here check somewhere if this string is
empty don't do this check and the same
with a match one actually but you know
for now we'll just leave it so let's
type in Alex Alex like that and it's
enter a password that matches just for
the sake of it when it hits submit that
username is already taken and that email
is already taken
let's send someone that doesn't exist
but an email that does exist and we get
that email is taken and let's send to
something that doesn't exist all
together and there we go it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
