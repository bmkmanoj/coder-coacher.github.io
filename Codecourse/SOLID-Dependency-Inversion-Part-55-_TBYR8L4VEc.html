letter and solid which is D now D stands
for the di P are the sorry which stands
for dependency inversion principle an
uncle Bob says that high-level modules
should not depend on low level modules
both should depend on abstractions which
is a little bit of a complicated
explanation but don't worry about it
we're going to go over in this episode
so I have I have a I ran the class which
I instantiate up here and basically what
I'm doing is I'm setting an error
handler and an exception handler both to
methods in this error handler now this
I'm actually using a very met I met a
very messy way to do this you could
probably improve upon this but this is
just a basic this is just for
demonstration so it doesn't really
matter so if we go into our error
handler we can see the two the two
methods that we called oops
this should actually be an exception get
message we have our two methods that we
called here and both methods when
logging in error to the file by calling
this log which is this but this if we if
we think about this this is actually
breaking the first principle in solid
which is the SRP or the single
responsibility principle because not
only are we handling the errors and
displaying a message to the user but
we're also logging to a file which is a
another responsibility entirely so to do
this we're going to get rid of this for
what we're then going to say this logger
instead of this log and then we need to
create this log of property protected
logger and in our constructor we're just
going to say construct this logger
because new and go create that file now
look at the PHP class longer public
function was a log message and this will
just write to file and we're done with
this we can close this now
so this is going to work fine everything
looks great but wait a minute
we're actually breaking the final
principle and solid but the thing is
that this log address here and there's
error handler glass a very tightly
coupled which is a bad thing so to do
this we'd probably want to use
dependency injection so we'll just set
this logo to lager which we will pass in
the constructor with covered dependency
injection already so it's it's a very so
it's not alien to you so you error and
another and I'll just set this up here
and that's all it is now a much more
efficient way to do this would be to use
a container but we're not going to go
into that in this lesson do take a look
at Maribel's inversion of control
container though it's very powerful it's
a great resource take a look take a look
at the docs and also maybe have a look
at the source code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
