learning SAS and to do this we're going
to be building the following page that
you can see this page has a few
components all of which we're going to
utilize nearly every aspect of SAS so by
the end of this series you'll be able to
go ahead and pretty much write all of
your CSS Assassin and compile it into a
CSS file and if you're not too sure what
SAS is you can obviously head over to
the website and read up on it but
essentially what we're going to be doing
is taking a project structure like this
so we've got a Styles folder which is
holding one of our styles we've got base
which we'll go into later we've got the
different component sorted in its
different files and then we've got sort
of global framework type styles as well
all of which are pulled in by this app
dot s CSS file you can see that they're
all imported here and what that will do
is it will take all of your nicely
organized and variable full code and it
will give you something like the
following so it will output this and
this means you can work a lot more
efficiently and you can write nice clean
sass and then you can compile that to
CSS so this is what we're going to be
building but in this video we're going
to look at actually installing sass
you're going to obviously need to be
able to install it to be able to compile
your files to CSS so the first thing
that you're going to want to do is head
over to the sass website and under the
install section we can see here there
are a couple of ways to start using sass
you can either use an application which
comes with suss itself so you can
compile within these but we're gonna be
focusing on purely just doing this from
the command line it's not difficult at
all so don't worry too much if you're
not that familiar with the command line
now I'm on a Mac so in insulation for me
is pretty straightforward I just run gem
install sass but if you're using Windows
you will want to grab the Ruby installer
and then you can go ahead and just
install it via the command line as
normal so whichever operation system you
using follow these instructions and by
the end of doing this you should be able
to bring up your command prompt or your
terminal and you should be able to type
SAS V and that will give you the current
version number available that's been
installed so for me it's three point
four point 13 so now that you've got SAS
up and running hopefully we can go ahead
and actually look at how we start to
compile our s CSS files into CSS we'll
be looking at a very basic example of
this in the next video and then we can
start styling what you can see here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
