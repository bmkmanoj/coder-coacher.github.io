login page for our users today we're
going to be creating the functionality
to display a user's tasks so to do this
we're obviously going to need to log in
then we're going to switch over to our
code the first thing that we need to do
is go to a routes file because we want
to make sure that a user is logged in
before we display his or her tasks so to
do this we're going to use the auth
filter if we go to our filters file and
find auth we can see that if the user is
guest returned a redirect to the login
page so now we've been that we're going
to create a model we're going to call
this item so class item extends eloquent
which is laravel so RM and that's all we
need to do larvae will automatically add
all the database methods like all or
where the next thing we need to do is go
to our user model and we're going to add
a method to return all the items for
this user
now each item is going to be an instance
of this model here so we're going to
create a new function a public function
items and we're going to use lera files
relationships so return this has many
item which is the name of this model
second parameter is the name of the
column containing the user ID which for
as if we go back to our database we can
see is own ID now this is an optional
parameter larvae is very clever if we
left this blank it would it would assume
that the name of the column is this here
the name of the model appended with
underscore ID and it would probably
convert this to locates as well so if we
rename this here to user ID which we're
not going to do we wouldn't need to pass
in the second parameter here we only
need this because we're calling it
something else
so we can close this now we're going to
go to our controller next home
controller now we're going to grab all
the current log didn't use its items and
store them in an array so the first
thing we need to do is get the instance
of this user class here for the current
user so to do this we say auth user and
then we're just going to call this here
so all user items and we're going to
start this in an items array now the
more observant of you will have noticed
I I'm actually accessing a property here
instead of a method which we defined
here the reason we're doing this is
we're using novels eager loading eager
loading essentially eliminates the n
plus 1 problem I'm not going to go into
great detail but if we had this method
and we called it 5 times we're going to
execute this query here 5 times but if
we got rid of these so we replaced this
with a property and duplicate it 5 times
we're only going to call this query once
because laravel detects that we've
already called this query so it grabs
the data that received from the query
the first time instead of executing the
same thing more than once which is
unnecessary so now we just need to pass
this to the to the view so we do that by
passing a second parameter in here this
is actually multiple ways you can do
this you could say with items items or
you could say with items items or you
could say compact compact items but I
just prefer to pass an array just to
make things a little bit more clear and
readable so items equal oops
this new sweet items in called items so
we can close this and we can open up our
view
and we're going to delete this we're
going to add a header target your items
perfect
now I actually added my own styling as
you can see I changed a few things here
and I added my own so feel free to copy
this I'll just scroll through slowly
obviously here are a hundred percent
welcome to creating your own but this is
why I use it minute so back to our view
we're going to leap through the items
that we pass to the view so items as
item and for each just to check that
everything is working with going to echo
item name and the line break so we
should get a list of items nope okay so
everything is fine here oops
thanks fine here and no controller yep
everything looks fine so it must be in
here somewhere
okay this is our issue we're trying to
find all items for this user with the ID
of two but in our items table we only
have we only have items for the user ID
one so we need to change these to two if
we go back to a browser and refresh
there we go perfect so let's close these
up we're going to encase this and they
unordered list like so and we're going
to encase each item in a li now we're
actually going to want to add a checkbox
for each of these and when the user
clicks the checkbox it will mark the
task as done or in some cases undone so
we're going to say form open form
clothes and we're only going to have one
info field here
input type equals checkbox the name will
be item and the value will be the ID of
the item so item ID and then next to
that we just want to display the item
name and we also need to display this
inline so
let's go back to our style sheet form
input type equals checkbox
display:inline perfect so the next thing
we want to do is if we go back to our
database here we'll see that we have one
done item walk the dogs but in our
browser here it's showing the user dates
on them because the checkbox isn't
checked so we need to add a conditional
statement in here to say that if the
task is complete then Mac this then make
the default value for this checkbox
checked we're just going to create a
ternary statement so we're going to by
the way if you don't already know this
basically just echoes out whatever we
put in it so if we say hello it's going
to say hello if we go into our source
code there we go so we're going to say
if item done then echo checked otherwise
echo nothing so let's just check that
this works perfect our walk the dogs
item is checked</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
