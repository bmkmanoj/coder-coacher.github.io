local web server so you can use it over
the Internet
with a URL I'm gonna show you how to do
this with a service called end rock so
the first question is why would you want
to do this one of the main reasons why
you're developing is if you have
external services that rely on
communicating with your project
obviously you don't have to keep pushing
it up to a production or staging server
to be able to test this so this URL here
actually mirrors what I am doing locally
so if I just hop over to my text editor
and modify this file you can see that
not only changes on my local machine it
also changes with this URL just here the
other reason is you might just want to
very quickly boot one of these up give
it to someone and let them take a look
and then you can go ahead and close it
off so the benefit of doing it like this
is much more secure because you don't
have to permanently open this up on your
machine which is obviously a security
risk so we're gonna be using an grok to
do this so what I'd recommend you do
then is sign up for an grok go ahead and
download this executable and then place
it somewhere that you know that you can
run it of course you can add it globally
as well so what you're going to need to
do the first time that you run and grok
is sign in with your credentials so I
already have this set up so when I run
in grok just here you can see that I
have a list of commands we also get some
examples here now this is extremely
straightforward so once you are in the
position where you can start to run this
we're going to go ahead and expose this
just here so I'm going to close this one
off and at the moment I'm using mam on
my Mac but of course this is gonna work
for things like WAMP or xampp it really
doesn't matter now if you're using
something like laravel homestead or
another virtual machine this process is
gonna be slightly different and we have
another video covering that so either
way I'm running on localhost on pour 8 8
8 8 so all I want to do is go ahead and
run and grok I want to run HTTP
and then I want to run the port's that
I'm running on so in this case it's
eight eight eight eight and this will
boot this up it will go ahead and give
us a one-time URL so when we close this
off this will no longer be available so
you'll need to keep this running in your
terminal and if we just go and duplicate
this over paste this URL in and go over
to some project you'll see that we get
this just here that is how easy it is so
obviously there are a ton of more
options that we can do within go up
we're not really going to cover them
because in most cases you don't need
them this is really all you need to get
this up and running so you can use your
URL either through web hooks or giving
it to someone else and that is it we can
expose our local machine when we don't
need it we can simply close this off and
it no longer works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
