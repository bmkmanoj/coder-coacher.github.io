remember me star login script we're
going to be dealing with cookies in this
as well so we're going to be setting
cookies for the user once they login
successfully we're running this from a
database so here's the database all set
up I've already got my entry and for my
username and password which is md5
encrypted so we're using a bit of
security here we've got a login page
quite a bit of code here but when it all
falls together you'll see that actually
it's quite simple
we've got a user area once the user is
logged in and this uses a function here
called logged in which is present in
this functions PHP script here basically
what this does is it checks for a cookie
or a session so whether the user wants
to be remembered or not we're going to
be determining for using sessions or
cookies and then we have a simple logout
script which is going to either destroy
a session or unset a cookie I know it
says set cookie but this is how we run
setting cookies sir if you don't know
about cookies then I have a tutorial
otherwise just follow this through and
you'll get the hang of them straight
away so this is more or less our our
page
we've got remember me checkbox here
let's say I'm going to type in Alex and
a completely wrong password click login
you'll see that a username password
combination is incorrect and if we type
the correct password which is one two
three
and we can click login and then we say
where we're in the user area and what
I've also done is if I come up here and
go back to the login page press Enter
that will automatically redirect us back
to the user area and then what we can do
is we can logout and then again if we go
to the user area here you'll see that
that'll automatically redirect us back
to the login page and so the user can't
access that area and that's all
basically using and that handle of
function I showed you there and we're
obviously connecting to a database so
you'll get to grips with more database
techniques if you are a bit unsure of
them already and a bit of security and
here we're obviously we're using md5
encryption but what we're also doing is
structuring this so SQL injection is
probably not impossible but slightly
harder to achieve okay so this has been
the first part of the introduction in
the second part we're going to be
starting out with the coding designing
our form and then processing the login
through the database
so I'll see you in the second part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
