flash messaging within laravel so
essentially what we want to do is take a
route so for example test and we want
that to redirect back to our public page
so just our home page and we want to
flash a message that we then want to
display at the top of the page
so this could be using a framework like
Foundation or bootstrap but I'm just
going to be doing this with plain text
for now so the first thing I really want
to do is start to create our template if
you're not already templating in your
application this is extremely easy with
blade syntax so let's create a new
folder within views and let's call this
templates or template and within this
folder let's create just a default blade
PHP template so this is going to make
our basic templates let's just create a
basic document here and we'll just say
something like website there and we will
just go ahead and indent this so what we
now want to do is somewhere within here
yield in the content that we're going to
place in from our other blade files so
we just say yield content not here is
where we're going to be adding the flash
message and the reason we're doing this
is obviously if you're just using a
template you're not going to want to
include the ability to flash messages
for every single page and what we're
going to do is we're actually going to
extract this and put it in a separate a
separate folder file as well so
basically we don't have to if we create
another template for example you could
have default template form template
article template you might not want to
have to duplicate the the actual logic
so let's go ahead and just create a
normal view we'll just create say home
PHP and under routes for the home let's
just return that view so let's just say
home and there we go so inside of home
now let's just write home just so we can
see that that's fine cool it works but
obviously within home we want to go
ahead and we want to extend the default
template so template default and then
here this is going to be the section
content and we'll stop that there
so that's the basis of our template you
can see now that we have our source
wrapping this or our markup for a page
wrapping this so let's go ahead and
start to build out these flash messages
so what going to do down here is we're
going to build it then we're going to
take it off and put it in a partials
folder so I'm going to create a just a
new route here and essentially what this
is going to do is it's just going to
redirect us so this might be within a
controller you might want to redirect a
user and say sorry you need to sign in
for that could even be within your
filters you might want to under your
authentication feature
filters redirect and then and then
obviously give a message but for now
we'll just do this within routes just so
we can keep it in one place so let's do
a redirect and will redirect to our home
page and you can obviously use action
here and you could provide home if you'd
name this it's entirely up to you what
you do so what we can do now is we can
obviously pass a variable as a session
to this page so all we need to do is say
with so I'm going to call this message
you can call it whatever you want I'm
sure you'll find a suitable name enough
for it I'm just going to say you need to
sign in obviously complete example this
doesn't actually check if the user
signed in so this doesn't really make
sense but put it there as a placeholder
so inside of default now what we can
actually do is we can say session yet
message now that would not ordinarily
get the message but obviously if that's
not set and we don't get anything it
just outputs absolutely nothing and it's
likely that you'll want to wrap some
kind of template around that so for
example we visit test at the moment you
can see that that redirects us with that
message and obviously when the user
refreshes that's a flashed message so it
will just disappear
so here what we might want to do is
create some kind of wrapper for this so
you might want to have say I'd know div
with a class of alert
something like that and what that's
going to do then is it's going to star
that up for you and you all you would do
is you replace this inside of here so
what we can actually do is we can create
an if statement to say if session has
message and only if the session has a
message then we want to output sorry and
if then we want to output the Marquart
and then we want output the message here
so we could apply a really really quick
style to this I'm just going to do this
in the header just for the sake of
simplicity you would obviously want to
take this into a style sheet so let's
say alert and let's say we want this to
be a background of slate gray we want
the color to be white perhaps we want
the padding to be 20 pixels and a margin
autumn of 20 pixels as well so that then
when we visit test the text that adds
the mark-up in and gives us our flash
message now you can also use dynamic
methods so if you didn't want to do this
syntax
personally I prefer this way but you
could say with message and get rid of
this all together and laravel will
detect the fact that this is a variable
called message within your page so what
you could then do is visit test and you
get exactly the same result so that's a
really quick guide to flashing messages
with laravel you can use this anywhere
across your application and redirect you
users back to the homepage the forum
page whatever page you have because then
that's in the template now very very
lastly if you're interested we're going
to extract this to a partial so if we
just go ahead and get rid of this now
I'm going to say include template dot
partials dot and let's call this message
or something like that and inside of
here let's create a new folder called
partials and then let's create a new
partial in here called message blade PHP
paste that in sort out the alignment
there and there we go so we should if
we've done everything correctly get the
same result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
