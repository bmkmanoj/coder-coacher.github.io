the foreground of our page we want to
choose a font that complements this and
also looks really really nice
so I've chosen a fund called o matic s C
and I'm going to choose this in normal
so at 400 weight you can all see pull in
the bowl if you need to I'm using google
fonts API by the way so if you just
google for automatic s C and google
fonts after it you'll get this page up
or something similar so down here then
we have the URL here of the actual
stylesheet that we can pull in I have
this handy on my clipboard so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to return to my
text editor and i'm going to paste this
in as a SAR sheet like that so if you
are implementing a font from google
fonts I recommend you remove the
non-required type attribute here and you
also use double quotes for these as well
these attributes either way we've now
got that font loaded in so on the main
dot CSS we can actually add a class for
something like top header to inside of
our body content let's add this h1 let's
give this a class of top header so we
can target this and I'm going to pull
across a quote here like so and I've
just pasted that inside of the header so
at the moment all this looks like is is
like this it doesn't look great so we're
going to start this up and make it look
really really nice so what we need to do
is we need to define a maximum width for
this header assuming this is just a
general header that's going to sit on
top of this page on its own I'm going to
set a width here of 100% which might
seem a little bit weird because you'd
think that would happen by default but
I'm then going to set a maximum width of
anything really but I'm choosing 960
what this means is it will scale as far
as possible but it will as soon as it
hits 960 it will stop so you'll see that
come down but as I pull this in
obviously because it's text as well this
is going to still remain looking nice
and essentially now what I'm going to do
is just change the font and things like
that so I'm going to use the font
shorthand property I'm going to set the
size to 6m s and I'm going to pull in
ematic SC and we have our cursive
fallback just here and so let's check
this out there we go we have our font
applied which looks really cool so I'm
going to change the color to white or
you could use just an off-white if you
didn't want it as as harsh white so F 0
F 0 F 0
might be a good idea and then what we're
going to do I'm actually going to set
this to whites it's a little bit more
striking and then what we're going to do
is we are going to add a text shadow
just to make this pop a little bit
better it's on the X and y offset I'm
going to do one pixel I'm going to do a
zero spread and I'm going to use an RGB
a color which is going to be black with
a point one or two Alpha Channel so
that's basically 20% of its opacity so
now that we've done this I'm just going
to set a margin here of 40 pixels on the
top and auto on the left and the right
so what this will do is simultaneously
at the top and bottom give it 40 pixels
and because there's Auto then on the
left and the right this will Center
itself and I also then want to align the
text sent to the center and that will
give us the effect that we saw at the
start of this series so there we go
we've added our nice background image
and we've also chosen a really lovely
font to go on the top of this and then
style this up so it sits really nicely
on the page complimenting this
background so there we go that's how we
add a lovely background image with some
really nice typography on the top</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
