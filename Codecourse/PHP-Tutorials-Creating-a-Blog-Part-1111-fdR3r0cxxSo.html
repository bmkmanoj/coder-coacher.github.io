this series which i think is the tenth
part seems like a nice point to stop
this series so here we have the edit
post form notice that it's practically
the same as the add post form which we
have here and that means it also needs
this functionality so once again I'm
going to be lazy and I'm just going to
copy it there we have it we do need to
change a few things like this should be
edit post and we should use gets ID of
course we need to create this function
we can get rid of that and we will
change this later okay so in order to
edit the post we need to get the data
related to the post so we do post equals
gets posts gets ID which is the ID of
the post you are editing so what you can
do now is in here oops
simply echo post and we want the first
item which is 0 title and now when we go
to edit this post we get PHP tutorial in
the title so we can do the same thing
for the
eco-post zero contents the category is
slightly different but first let me copy
this the error display part of ad post
or PHP and since it's the same for edits
post or PHP I'm just going to paste it
in just to speed everything up a little
bit now as I said this here is different
actually it's not so much different
there we go again
I'm just going to copy this because it's
essentially the same but what we are
going to say here is selected which is a
new variable and we're going to check if
the um shall I say it oh my window just
did some weird things anyway we want to
check if the name of the category is the
same as the as the name of the category
for the post as you know by now for each
loops over every category so it checks
for each category if that category is
the one in which that specific post was
posted so in this case it first goes
over Uncategorized but this PHP tutorial
post was not posted in on categorized so
it moves on and eventually it finds the
PHP category in which it was posted
and in there we will say that it was
selected so we do select it or nothing
if you are using XHTML you want this to
be selected equals selected but since
I'm using html5 I don't need to so I
won't and here I'm going to say echo
selected and now when we go and view
this again we get the contents here and
we also got the wrong category here so
let me open up Firebug and here it is
okay so I get selected equals nothing
here before PHP let's close that
okay value equals that all right once
again let me pause the video and I'll
get back to you when I have sorted this
out okay don't ask me why but apparently
something bogged up a bit for some
reason and without me touching the code
at all it seems to work fine anyway so
what we can do now is create the Edit
post function in block dot PHP it's
essentially the same as add post we do
actually let me copy this yes it's lazy
I know but hey be very honest with
yourself you're probably just as lazy as
I am otherwise you would not be a BHB
programmer so here we say update post
and we set get ID equal to the category
we set the title equal to title and we
set contents equal to contents and of
course we're ID equals ID what just
happened
there we go and close that's off all
right it's weird
that's it tap that in and that's
everything we need to do
let's now update this - this is a PHP
tutorial oh wait one more thing one more
thing in here we need to redirect to
post zero both sigh D now we edit it
there we go and that is our blog
finished I hope you enjoyed this series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
