we're gonna take a break and look at
very simple concept which is flashing
messages now you'll see this on most
websites when you perform an action it
will flash a message and then when you
refresh the page it will go it's just a
note of fire to tell you that something
has happened but it won't persist so
what we're going to do is create a very
basic example route and we're gonna do
this just within our home route here and
when we hit that route we're gonna
redirect the user to the home page flash
a message and then that's going to go
the next time we refresh it's basically
just a temporary piece of information so
what we're going to do then is we are
going to just open up messages remember
we saw if flash global that means is it
has a flash message already been set if
it has let's show this mark up here with
the message global is just the name of
the flash message you can call that
whatever you want
but let's just create a quick example
route here we'll remove it in a minute
called flash and let's create our
closure and our app so it is so it's in
scope and all we're gonna do here you
say app flash we're gonna choose the
name of the flash key in which case it's
global again this can be anything and
then we're going to choose the content
so you have registered for example and
then we're going to redirect the user to
the home page so we're gonna say app
response redirect and for now we can
just redirect a forward slash because I
see now let's generate the URL so I say
app URL for home remember that's this so
all this flash route is going to do is
flash a message and it's going to
redirect us to the home page now
remember because the home page has or
extends the default template and the
default template includes that messages
template here we're going to flash a
message and then the next time round
because the session would have been
removed it won't show it the next time
around that's basically why we call it
flashing messages so we're on the home
page let's go to flash now you see that
message show up here when we refresh the
page again it goes so that's how simple
it is we're going to be doing this
throughout the application because when
we do things like register a user we
want to show them a message at the top
of the page and then go ahead and next
time they refresh it goes and it's just
a little bit of information for them so
that's how we flash messages within slim
fairly straightforward and like I said
we'll be using this throughout the
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
