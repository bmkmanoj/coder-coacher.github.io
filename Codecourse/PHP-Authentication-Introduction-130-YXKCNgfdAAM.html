building an authentication system with
PHP and we're going to include all of
the features you would expect from an
authentication system and this will give
you a good base to go on and extend this
and include it in whatever you need it
for
so let's take a look around and look at
what we can do within this so the first
thing is obviously registering I've got
my database just up here and I have a
user's table and a user's permissions
table so we're going to be able to set
permissions for specific users as well
in this case we're setting whether a
user is an admin or not so let's
register for an account I'm going to
enter my email address here I'm going to
choose a username and a password if I
forget anything
we have validation in here as well and
we also have validation to check that
the email and the username are both
unique so let's enter my password twice
hit register now we've now been
registered now we actually need to
activate our account we're not going to
be able to log in before until we've
activated so you can see I've received
an email now to activate using this link
so I'm going to go ahead and click on
that and we see your account has been
activated and you can now sign in so now
I'm going to log in and I'm going to
check remember me so this is going to
store a cookie which is going to last
for a week you can increase this or
decrease it and that will remember me
even if I close my browser off so that's
one of the features we're implementing
so just working from the bottom up here
we can list all users at the moment we
just have Alex and I've just clicked
onto my profile which can also be
accessed via this link as well this one
here we can update our profile so we can
go and add a first and the last name if
we wanted to that's going to update my
details and you can see here now I'm
being greeted by my full name these are
in here and then when I view my profile
I see my full name here as well we can
obviously change our password so we can
enter an old password and a new password
that will validate that the old password
matches obviously and then we can just
change that and that's our password
being updated we can obviously
of ourselves admin permissions as we've
already seen there's the record in our
database table and we have a permissions
record here you can easily add more
columns for different permission levels
you can have very specific permissions
or general permissions like is admin by
changing that to true or one we see a
new link here which we can go into an
admin area you can have lots of
different pages that are all protected
if you are an admin only so if we go and
log out we are going to head over to the
login part we're going to click forgot
your password and we request a password
reset that's going to send a email to us
and we can recover our password you'll
see also here we get an email when we
actually changed our password a moment
ago so I'm going to recover my password
to start the process I click this link
that prompts me to enter a new password
and I can click Change Password and
there my password has been changed and I
can sign in so that's what we're going
to be building we are basing the
authentication system on the slim to
framework but if you've not worked with
a framework before don't worry too much
we're going to go over how we install
everything that we need to get up and
running with this and it's very very
straightforward once you get used to it
so that's the authentication system
let's jump to the next part where we're
going to start to set everything up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
