is create our first PHP file in our web
directory and we're going to preview
this in our browser I'm also going to be
using a function in PHP called PHP info
which is going to give us details about
our PHP installation so this isn't just
useful now - for testing purposes it's
also useful in the future if you need to
check certain things certain settings in
your PHP installation so we'll be go
ahead and creating this file looking in
and our browser make sure everything's
working and then from then on we can
actually start to do some useful things
so you can see that I have the directory
where I'm going to be working open in my
browser viewable via Apache so basically
what we're going to do now is open up
our text editor and we're going to go
ahead and create a new file so let's
just go ahead and save this and not
worry too much about putting anything in
it initially and let's go ahead and call
this home PHP now you can call this
anything but when we go back to our
browser and hit refresh
if you've called a file home or index
dot PHP typically Apache will see this
as your root file if you like so the
file that's going to be open by default
so now what's actually happened is we're
not seeing the directory listing anymore
but it's automatically called home dot
PHP and process this file so it's the
same as us typing home PHP in our URL
bar like this now if we go ahead and
create any other file so let's just go
ahead and delete this home file so let's
just say contact PHP this won't be seen
as a root file so when we go ahead and
browse you'll see that this will appear
here so we can create many files but
typically what we do is for a file that
we want to be hit initially we would
call this index.php so let's go ahead
and actually start to create some
content within our file to just check
that everything's up and running that we
can start developing with PHP now we've
already by called by calling this file
index.php
we've given this a PHP extension so it's
now a file type PHP
is a PHP file and that's been
interpreted by Apache and PHP is now
processing this file before returning it
back to us so how are we actually going
to or what are we actually going to put
into this file well we need to start by
opening the HP tags which allow us to
specify that we are writing PHP and this
needs to be interpreted so we use a
opening or a less than sign a question
mark and PHP so in this case we're just
going to say PHP info and this is a
function so we're going to supply to
curl brackets and we can go ahead over
to our our web trip or our browser and
go ahead and preview this and you can
see here that I'm running PHP version
five point four point one six and this
is also useful because you can keep up
to date with which version that you're
running certain functionality in version
newer versions might be deprecated and
you might want to access functionality
in newer version so you might want to go
ahead and update your PHP installation
and as I said before this just lists
certain information about our
installation of PHP you can see
different configuration files so it's
good to have this a hand if you ever
need to just quickly look something up
so what we've done now is we've created
our first PHP file we've successfully
run it and we've gained some information
about our PHP installation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
