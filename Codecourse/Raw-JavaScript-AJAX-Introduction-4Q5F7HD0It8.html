we can Ajax so we don't have to rely on
libraries like jQuery you can see at the
moment I've got my browser open and I'm
outputting something down here now this
is actually part of a Ajax request to a
JSON file which has then grabbed this
value and output it so we're gonna be
looking at building a piece of
functionality in JavaScript that's going
to allow us to do this choose the file
that we want and do something with the
output so let's go ahead and just look
at this in the text editor you can see
I've got the index.html file open that I
just have open in the browser you can
see that I'm including a script here
which is Ajax j/s and then just below
this I've got some inline code that I'm
just writing down here just for part of
this tutorial so you can see that I'm
using app Ajax which we're going to be
build all of this functionality we're
going to be building inside of Ajax jas
and I'm Ajax into file dot JSON so far
dot JSON looks a lot like this it just
has this name value with a name in here
and then we have a first callback which
is basically for the success of this and
I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna create
a data or we redefine this data variable
here to JSON the pass of data Zara
passing this data and then we're just
console logging the name out here so
that's what we're gonna be building we
also have an error handler here to just
console.log something if things didn't
go quite to plan so let's go ahead and
start to build this out from scratch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
