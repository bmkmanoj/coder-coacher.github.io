we established the URL that we were
going to pass using curl now what we're
actually going to do is open up the code
and check if the form has been submitted
here and then we're actually going to
send the send the these variables here
to text local using curl and then the
message will automatically send to my
phone or to a phone that you want to
send the message to so the first thing
we want to do is check if the form has
been submitted now remember in the first
part I created this hidden field here to
say this submitted I was true and we
need to do is check that that exists so
I'm going to say if dollar sign
underscore post submitted equals
remember double equals true and that
means the form has been submitted so I'm
going to say echo submitted now we can
just test that so send and there we go
it says submitted so we know if the form
has been submitted or not okay let's
just go back to this okay so now what we
want to do is we want to open up a new
curl initialization so we need to
initialize a URL that we're going to be
passing these these variables here too
so I'm going to stop a new variable
called set up a new variable called curl
I'll create a new variable called curl
and this is curl eye nit so initialize
and in rounded brackets and and inverted
commas and the address is HTTP ticks
forward slash forward slash and it's WW
txt local comm and then that is for -
send SM
host PHP like I had here before but now
you can see that we're opening it with
curl to be a lot more secure and so
people can't see these variables so
that's initialized that URL the next
thing we need to do is set a few options
in curl so I'm going to say curl set ups
set up that's setting an option and this
is obviously using curl here this
initialized variable here or this
initialized curl session here and we're
referencing it using this variable and
this is curl opt underscore post and
this is true true okay this is just
saying that we're using post data so now
we're going to say set up again using
curl here this that we've already
established and it's curl up underscore
post fields and this is going to post
some specific fields now you've probably
already guessed that these are these
fields here that we've already created
from our data so we just need to put
VARs in there as simple as that
now we need to take curl ok set option
and what we need to do is again
reference this and it's curl up and it
is return
transfer and what this does is it
returns the information sent by text
local like we said we going to return
our information here if anything goes
wrong we're going to need this command
to be able to fit to return back to us
so we need the information back from the
page if possible okay so we've done that
now what we need to do is just create
this variable called result and that's
basically going to execute everything we
want everything we've done and again
that is curl so we're just constantly
referencing this open variable then we
want to close the session there so close
come okay so that should all be okay
after we've done this we want to just
kill the page I mean it's obviously up
to you what you do at this stage and
however you're displaying to your user
that you've sent the text message you
don't necessarily need to kill the page
with the die command but I'm just going
to say SMS has been sent okay so to test
if this all works I'm going to put the
test variable here to one and so I'm not
actually going to use up any of my
credits I'm going to refresh this page
here and I'm going to start typing in a
number so one two three four five six
seven on the PHP academy' and
the message text in there so I'm going
to click send SMS has been sent so we've
got no error back so if I hadn't have
put the SMS or the test rather here show
you test here is one this would have
already sent the message now I've
changed this back to zero I want to test
this for myself to see if it does work
and send the text to my mobile phone but
obviously I don't want to give out my
mobile phone in a video so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to test it in
the background and then I'm going to let
you know if it worked just so you can
see if this code has in fact worked you
never know I might have made a little
blip somewhere and that hasn't yet been
shown so I'm going to test that right
now and then I'm going to take a picture
of the result on my mobile phone and um
that will be a link in the description
of this video to you for you to be able
to see how it how it looks now has come
up okay so I'm going to do that now
and test it to sending a text to my
number okay so I've been having a few
problems trying to send the message and
the reason for this is that I fully user
name I have meant to put my email
address in so apologies for that
you won't find that your user name is
the user name you've registered with is
in fact the email address that you've
registered with so if you haven't
already changed that and if you're
following along with this just type in
the email address you used to register
click Save Changes and now I'm going to
attempt to send the message oh great so
I've just sent the SMS message and it
has come through to my phone and I'll be
taking a picture of that as soon as I
finish the tutorial the other nut blowed
and show you how it looks so the code
that I have come up with does actually
work so I've confirmed that so you
should be able to follow along and use
this for txt local different gateways
obviously I have different code that
they might use definitely different
variables but if the Gateway does just
require you to pass post or get
variables then you will be able to use
curl to do this so this code should be
more or less the same obviously except
from things like the URL so if you do
have any problems with it
please feel free to go over to the forum
if you log on to PHP academy' dot org
and click the forum button or you can go
on to PHP academy' dog forward slash
forum and you can get some help there if
you do need any don't forget to also
follow PHP academy' on Twitter and also
check out the new Facebook group which
is just going to allow you to socialize
with other sort community members that
watch PHP academy' videos you'll also
get a few updates as well so it's nice
to get some updates on videos things
like that and discuss ok so I hope you
enjoy this video series there might be
more on SMS tutorials but for now this
is the basics of sending an SMS through
PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
