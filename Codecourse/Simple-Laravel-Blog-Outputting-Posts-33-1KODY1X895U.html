outputting these to the page and
allowing users to click on them we want
to create some test content now I've
already done this but go ahead and
basically just create whatever you want
in here you can see the inside of here I
have quite a bit of content it's very
unreadable within this interface but
basically I have three different
articles one is in draft mode remember
when we created our migrations we
created a draft column this basically
allows us not to show it on the home
page but it allows us to view it
ourselves with the slug that we provide
in the URL and that just means that we
can preview it when we're writing it so
let's focus on outputting these to the
front page and then we'll make them
click through to our actual article so
inside of our controllers inside of home
controller this is where we're going to
be pulling in our posts but we need an
eloquent model before we do this
besides the user default user model
we're going to create a new model here
and we're gonna call this post of PHP
it's important with the naming
conventions unless you want to specify
the table name yourself in this case
post is a singular of posts which is
what we called our database table if I'd
call this some host stop PHP it wouldn't
work
we'd have to specify the table ourselves
but because eloquent does take laurel
into consideration all I need to do here
is define a class called post obviously
extend eloquent and I can just create
some brackets and not do much else so we
now have the rich functionality that
eloquent provides and we can actually
pull in all our posts so let's do a
little bit of testing here let's create
a post variable here now I'm gonna say
post yet so let's do a print our on post
and let's see what we get and there we
go we've got a load of content you can
see that I've got some cupcake ipsum
content in here they just basically
represent some body text so now that
we've got this we need to take into
consideration the
fact that we don't want draft articles
to show on the home page so I'm going to
create a where clause here and I'm gonna
say where draft is zero so we get all
articles where the draft on the article
is zero and then we can pass this
through to our view so I'm going to say
with posts posts so that's now available
within our home view here so what we can
do is we can do a quick if statement
here and we can end that there and we
can say if posts count and in here we
can do a for each post as post we can
end that for each and we can place the
mark-up that we created earlier inside
of here and just in that property there
so we know the column names for each of
the element selects out per post title
and in here let's output post Oddie
and for read more leave that as it is
now we now see oops undefined variable
post so let's check this now there we go
so let's get rid of that and there we go
so we've now got the content as we'd
expect it but there's one more thing
that we need to bear in mind I did say
that we were going to use this package
which is basically a passed down wrapper
passed down is a markdown parser for PHP
so let's take this here that we need to
require into our composer file and let's
scroll down and hit out composer JSON
file and in require let's add this in so
let's head over to the terminal here and
we'll do a composer
update okay so now that them
dependencies are installed we can
basically just follow the instructions
in here so in config app we need to add
one of the service providers or the
service provider for this so let's copy
this let's head over to
and down here we have our list of
service providers so we can just add
this down there we also need to add an
alias as well so let's go ahead and copy
this I'm gonna paste this here okay
so now that we've done that we can use
this to pass any markdown we want so we
can just use markdown then the static
method pause and then enter our content
so in this case what we actually don't
need to do is need to include our
paragraph as we have here so I can just
get rid of this and I can say markdown
parse post body and there we go so it's
automatically generated that for me now
we want to limit this because we don't
actually want this to be as long as it
is we want needs to be previews so
before we pass the markdown let's use
the string helper and let's limit this
so let's limit the post body and we will
limit that to say a hundred characters
and there we go or we can make that a
little bit longer actually there we are
so we've now got a preview of the
article we are pausing the markdown we
now need to allow the user to click on
either the title so let's wrap this in
an anchor and we also want them to allow
to click read more but we don't have a
root set up to actually show the posts
here so we need to go ahead and do that
now
so under routes let's create a route
called posts and then we want to be able
to pass in a slug we have a not a
callback an array here we want to say
this as post show you can call this
whatever you whatever make sense
especially as your app works larger and
in here we're gonna say host controller
at get show so now we can create the
post controller and we can create the
get show method this probably could be
index actually it depends on how precise
you want to be about your naming let's
create this post controller now so we
have a post controller and that extends
our base controller so inside of here we
now have this yet show method and this
takes a slug so we can test this out by
actually just echoing or returning the
slug let's save this as post controller
and there we are so what we now need to
do is we need to actually define our
links to link through to post show
passing in the slug so let's get rid of
these and inside let's get rid of this
and this and this we don't need so in
here let's use the URL helper to
basically link through to host show then
we pass in the slug and that's it let's
just copy and paste this down to here
and that's it so now what's gonna happen
is that of course so let's just go and
say host slug it's like so that's coming
from the post so now we've got these
links now if I click on this you can see
that it goes through - in fact the slug
and then it echoes out the slug the same
with this one installing laravel it
works the same way so now that we've got
the linking through nailed let's
actually create the view for actually
viewing this specific post so let's
create a new folder in here and let's
call this posts and in here let's create
a new file and we will call this show
blade PHP and we'll just call this show
for now so under the post controller
rather than echoing out the slug the
first thing that we want to do is
actually get the
you post by the slug so let's create a
new variable called post will say post
post model and will say where slug is
equal to the slug that we've just passed
in and we're gonna say first or fail so
if it can't find that it will just fail
and you can set up custom for it for s
and stuff like that
now what we want to do is return the
creation of our view which is posts dot
Show as we've just created and we want
to pass through the post to that view so
now what we can do is if we close off
home inside of show let's actually just
do a print our on post so when I click
this we get all the content of that post
when I click this we got the content of
that post
now I also inside of my database table
have a draft article if you remember and
I've called this not quite finished
so the slug is not quite finished and
there we go so we've got this here as
well so we can preview our articles in
this way let's actually create the
design if you like for this so remember
we're extending the default template so
templates dot default and the content in
here so section content we stopped that
there is going to be the actual post so
all we want to really do here is from
our home view copy this paste that in
there sort out the indentation and now
what we can do is remove the limited
string get rid of this view read more
link and then we could optionally get
rid of this anchor what we can leave it
there really it doesn't really matter so
when i refresh we've now got the actual
post here and the content so if we go
back there we go and if we go back there
we go
so we've now got all of this content in
here it works we can click through to
our blog articles but what we now want
to do is just customize the header
because at the moment every single
article has the same title which is a
little bit annoying and really it's very
very bad practice so what we're going to
do is inside of our default template
we're gonna introduce or rather inside
of the header we're gonna introduce the
yielding of a title so what we're gonna
do here is we're gonna say yield title
so on the home page for the title we're
just gonna call this home so if we head
over to here now we need a little space
in there that now says home type blog
now when I click through to one of these
I want the just before the pipe to be
the name of the article title or the
blog title so let's now go into show and
we can say section title and start and
in here we can say post title so now
when we refresh we get the post title
inside of the header now the last thing
that we're gonna do is look actually
outputting the date the creation date
obviously this is optional but it's
probably highly recommended for you to
do so so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
start with the home page and just down
here I'm gonna create a paragraph and
I'm gonna say published on and then I'm
gonna give a date here so now on the
home page we've got published on and we
want to output the date now in laravel
the created at date and the updates to
that day which i mentioned earlier when
we are creating our migrations returns a
carbon object and carbon is a date
handler in PHP own a very popular and
very very powerful one so what we can
actually do here
rather than you know use native PHP
functions this is abstracted for us to
the point where it just works really
really well so what we can do is we can
actually say something like post created
at and let's just take a look at that as
it is you can see that it just looks
like that but what we can do is we can
use things like formats we can use a
mess the format method and we can
provide in here a type eight your time
format that you would normally see in
PHP and that will then generate the
relevant eight in the relevant format
for you what you could also do is you
could use the diff for humans method
which is quite popular and this will
show you when this was created so my
database and times a bit messed up but
this would say something like two days
ago or one week ago or two years ago or
whatever for now that I'm going to keep
this in this format so let's go ahead
and just copy and paste actually all of
this and let's put this inside of show
now ideally what you do is you would
store this format on a model somewhere
or somewhere in your app settings just
so you don't need to keep repeating it
over and over again so we've now got
published on Monday the 9th of June 2014
when we click through to this we get the
same thing so with very very little
effort and very different code we've
created a powerful blog because we've we
using markdown and pass down to pause it
and we can click through we've got
titles we've got dates and that's it
really varied it fairly easy to create a
laravel blog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
