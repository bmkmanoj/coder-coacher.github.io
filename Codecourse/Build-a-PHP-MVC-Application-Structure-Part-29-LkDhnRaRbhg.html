that we need for our MVC application
this will pretty much give you a good
idea of how everything fits together
and how everything works if you are new
to the MVC pattern let's start to create
directories then we need to first of all
think where we need to actually start in
this application and instead of this
just being within this MVC directory I
want to create a new folder and call
this public and this is where your users
are going to land so this will be the
root directory to your application and
this will contain the bootstrap file so
within public you also might want to
have maybe some CSS or JavaScript
directories you know something like that
so we'll create a CSS directory for now
just as an example now the only other
folder you need in your root directory
is an app folder now this app folder
basically contains all of the folders
like controllers the core said the
application and controller core the
models and the views and also the
initialization file which will actually
include you know the useful core
functionality in so within this app
folder let's now create all of the
folders we need so we've got core core
is going to store application and
controller basically core functionality
so your app will be that what what is
instantiated within your bootstrap file
and this will give you the URL splitting
or the routing which we'll cover later
and this will also then handle your
controllers so it will choose the
correct controller as we've already seen
in the demo and that will go ahead and
do the rest of the stuff so we'll
obviously look at this later the next
thing we need is controllers so we have
a controllers folder and what this is
going to do is basically hold files so
just normal PHP files like home PHP or
forum dot PHP or whatever and this will
be your basic be your controllers
we've also got models so these will be
your models and we also want a views
folder as well so let's create that now
so views are just going going to be your
what you outputs your user so here I'm
going to create a home folder because
we're going to be creating a default
home controller which will always be
rendered regardless of whether
controller and methods been selected via
the routing the routing system we're
using very very simple but we'll handle
that later so that's pretty much it for
our entire structure so what's going to
happen is your users are going to land
in your public directory so here and
within here you're going to have an
index.php file and we're going to be
building the bootstrapping in the next
part that will then call a new
application and it instants basically an
object which will be stored in here and
that will then subsequently read the URL
if it's available and it will render the
right controller or call the right
controller which will go and render view
and obviously within your models
directory you're going to have models
that are just available to use and you
can go ahead and do whatever you want in
them so in the next part we'll look at
actually bootstrapping this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
