welcome to this video on error reporting
and how we can turn it on you might be
receiving no errors at all on your page
and this might be because you have error
reporting set in a very specific way
that doesn't actually output any errors
which isn't very useful when you're
trying to debug an application so we're
not going to be looking at the error
reporting function within PHP in this
tutorial so want to make that clear at
the star we're gonna be looking directly
at PHP z' initialization file and how we
can change error reporting within this
so this is the way to go if you're
working locally and you want to you know
turn on some really strict error
reporting or off altogether if you want
the opposite effect for any reason we're
gonna be looking at within PHP to I and
I and then you know error reporting is
something that you can you know go ahead
and look up on php.net
and you can do this you know from your
from your scripts it's always a lot
better though when you're working
locally to turn on the strictest error
reporting it just gives you that that
extra warning or then extra warnings
that you know when you go ahead and
upload to a public server you don't get
any surprises because it often find that
when you pay for hosting the PHP dot ini
file will be stuck you can't change
anything so you want to go ahead and
make sure your you know you're getting
all of these warnings out from your from
your PHP code so we've got our PHP ini
file open in here I'm using xampp which
you know is a package that automatically
installs apache and mysql and everything
for you so you would find if you're
using xampp and i believe it's the same
if you're using WAMP as well in C colon
backslash xampp PHP PHP dot ini so it's
basically the wherever PHP is installed
or whichever directory it's installed
within or where the files are contained
within PHP dot ini will be found and
obviously you can go ahead and do a
search on on your PC for the file as
well
so the php.ini file if you're not
familiar with this I'd go ahead and sort
of have a look through it see what kind
of settings are available try and use a
text editor that highlights things
because as you can see all these green
bits here all comments and you've got
the odds if we just scroll down the odd
setting turned on here or the property
value but we are specifically in this
tutorial looking at every reporting so
I'm gonna go ahead and control F so
search however you're doing this
whichever text editor you're using I'm
gonna go ahead and search for error
underscore reporting and you can see
here we're down to some kind of weird
section here that's not quite right
let's go ahead and hit f3 and you can
now see we are looking at the error
reporting property which as I've said
can be set from PHP but we're looking at
it more sort of directly in here so if
we scroll up a bit to where we have this
error handling and logging a header
probably would make sense to go ahead
and read this if you haven't already it
gives you an insight into you know all
of this as well gives you an insight
into the settings the different you know
well as it says error level constants or
just you know the different levels of
error reporting you've got things like e
all which it says here it's commented
includes each strict which if you come
down you can read about each strict
itself you know there's there's tons of
different things in here but eat all is
probably what you would want if earlier
when I was discussing outputting
absolutely everything so things like
warnings so for example undefined
variables as it says here non-fatal
errors which means that your application
will still run properly everything will
work but it will just tell you things
about undefined index undefined
variables you know things like that or
if you're looping and you're
incrementing a value that hasn't yet
been set you might get an undefined
variable warning out you know things
like that so there's various levels of
reporting these are all really really
well documented at php.net I think it
would be beyond the scope of this video
to go ahead and explain them all
but the main thing is to be able to
actually specify them down here and it
says here common values we've got some
common values in here at the moment by
default especially with my installation
through xampp it's eally strict so I
could for example just say a all or all
is strict so you know this is basically
telling me any errors or every error
that possible that you know I could
possibly have out there's those of
different things you can play around
with you know you've got everything here
really so you can apply you know a
combination of these or stick to the
default things like your ease strict so
really this is you know preference it
depends on how far you want the ever
error reporting to go okay so once
you've decided on what you want to be
you know shown to you in terms of error
reporting you can go ahead and change
these values as required obviously we've
got different symbols here that mean
different things so in this case it
means eel and so we're saying and
exception here so basically this is an
exception we are showing all errors
except for this particular here and
obviously these can be switched around
it doesn't need to just be this it can
be eel except I don't know
a warning for example you know it could
be absolutely anything so you know you
can combine these here as well and as
the default setting that we've got says
here show all errors warnings and
notices including encoding standards so
anyway once you've picked a level of
error reporting you can want to go ahead
and modify this value obviously then
what you need to do is you need to go
ahead and you need to restart your web
server so depending on what you're using
I'm using Apache which is part of the
xampp installation it's just an easy way
of installing you know Apache MySQL PHP
all together then you go ahead and
restart Apache
you can do that using your xampp control
panel your WAMP oh I've got an error
there but your WAMP control panel or you
can use your system services controller
if you've got Apache installed as a
service so there's you know this is
common knowledge when you're working on
local server that you should have
already but go ahead and restart and
these settings will be taken into effect
obviously this is up PHP initialization
file so when PHP is loaded through and
I'll server these settings will be taken
into effect and then go ahead try and
force an error in your page and see how
that outputs so this has just been a
quick tip on how to set different levels
of error reporting through PHP dot ini
which is the recommended method
personally I'd recommend this method as
opposed to using the error reporting
function in PHP so that's how to set
error reporting in PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
