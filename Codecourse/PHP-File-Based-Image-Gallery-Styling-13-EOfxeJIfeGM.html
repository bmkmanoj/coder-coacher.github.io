creating an image gallery with PHP and
we'll be creating a gallery class that
allows us to set the path of our images
go ahead and display the thumbnails for
the images that you've stored in a in a
thumbs path and then go ahead and loop
through them and output them like this
and it also gives us the ability to
select which types of files that we want
to output as well so from within that
directory we specifically define whether
we want upset PNG or a JPEG image or
something like that so let's just take a
look at how this works we've got a few
images out here we're going to be
running through how to create this
design as well and when we click on
these nothing much happens it just goes
through and opens the image in the
browser but you can of course plug in
you know a lightbox plug-in or something
like that and any JavaScript you want to
deal with showing these images but the
the images that you see here are
actually different to the ones that we
click through to so if we go ahead and
inspect this and we open up this this is
actually a thumbnail and the one that we
click on is actually the main image the
larger image so that's what the gallery
is going to look like we're going to
start with styling this up and then
we're going to go ahead and create the
gallery class now let's just take a look
at how the code works in terms of
creating a galleries you know defining
the path and stuff like that we've got
our general markup here the first thing
that we do is obviously include our
gallery class let me go ahead and
instantiate it we go ahead and set the
path that we want and then we go ahead
and we create a variable called images
which holds an array of images using
this get images method and then down
here we just go ahead and literally loop
through and output the gallery items and
we've got the thumbnail here which is
actually displayed in an image source
and then we've got the href attribute
which obviously we'll click through to
that actual image so this is how it's
going to end up looking obviously we're
going to go ahead and build this class
that's going to allow us to do this so
let's go ahead and get started building
this gallery okay so the first thing
that we want to do here is go ahead and
mark up our page so to find the mark up
that's going to display when a user hits
Gallery now this just could be
integrated as part of your site the
gallery is going to take a width of a
hundred percent so this is going to look
good at most sizes so this can just be
plugged into your existing design if you
need to so let's go ahead and just
define a basic markup to our page or the
basic markup that we need so I adopt
type our HTML our head and our body and
we'll go ahead and give this page a
title as well so we'll give this a title
here of image gallery okay so within the
body what we're going to need is a
container and then within that we'll
have you know all of our images or our
gallery container so we'll just create
this container now this is purely for
the purpose of having a an almost a fake
page container so this could be you know
anything on your site really now within
this we want to go ahead and define the
gallery so we'll just call this gallery
so we won't write any more for now this
anything in here is going to be the
gallery images what we do need to do is
go ahead and link in a style sheet so we
say link rel so the relation here is a
style sheet and the location of this is
going to be in CSS forward slash gallery
dot CSS now this could be just part of
your main style sheet but let's go ahead
and create this style sheet enough new
folder CSS as we've seen and we'll call
this gallery CSS now let's go ahead and
start up the container and what we'll do
is we'll keep an eye on this in our
browser so if we go ahead and create the
stars for the container class and we're
going to give this a max width of 940
pixels and you'll see why in a minute
we'll give this a padding of 10 pixels
what they'll do is this will create a
container for us of 960 pixels we're
adding padding to the left and right
which is pushing this out and we're also
go ahead and give this a background
we'll just say F 0 F 0 F 0 so I can like
gray color and then we'll go ahead and
say margin:0 auto which we'll send to
this content
now now if we go ahead and refresh you
can see that we've got a center
container could we inspect this that's
960 pixels because the box model of the
padding's push this out and we've not
got anything in at the moment which is
obvious because we haven't created much
more in here so in terms of the actual
gallery itself well we want this to be a
hundred percent of the container so
we'll just say a hundred percent width
and that's pretty much all we need to do
now the next thing we need to do is go
ahead and define how gallery items are
going to actually display so we're going
to create another div inside of here and
this is going to be what we're actually
going to loop and this is going to be
gallery item so in here is going to be
an image and that image is going to be
something now I've already got a images
folder here with lots of images in so if
we were just to go ahead and copy this
URL and we'll say we want this to be
gallery images thumbs and this P earth
in the JPEGs just go ahead and check yep
they're JPEGs so this now should show us
a large image or the at least the
thumbnail size here of our image so
let's just take a look at this directory
structure again we've got this gallery
folder here in our root directory and
this is where our gallery class is going
to sit now in images we've got all of
the large size images so these are the
full-sized images that we have at the
moment they're just what my camera has
called it but if we look in Thums I've
got an exact sort of same naming system
for all of the images except these
images are a lot smaller so if you go
ahead and have your main images and then
go ahead and reduce the images to
thumbnails and then place them in this
directory called thumbs so that's how
our directory looks so you know make
sure you setup your images okay so what
we're now going to do is go ahead and
take a look at styling this gallery item
that we've got here so we're going to go
ahead
and Hillary tossed our sheet and we're
going to say gallery item okay so these
are going to float left and we're going
to give these a width of nineteen
percent and we're going if these are
margin of 1 percent and padding of 2
percent so they basically will scale
nicely so let's go ahead and just say
for now float left and then we'll take a
look at the problem that we face here
now take a look what happens here pay
attention to the background you'll see
that that flips up and the reason being
is that we're floating this left and
there's no clear on this so what we need
to do is we need to create a clear fixed
clasp which is going to clear any floats
on our main gallery container so what
we're going to do and this is useful for
other things as well I mean you can just
clear your gallery but this is a good
cross-browser solution so we're going to
call this CF or clear fix whichever you
prefer and we're going to use the pseudo
element before and the pursue don't
element after so dot CF after and this
is going to say content and we're just
going to say space and we're going to
say display table this is just simply a
hacky way of implementing clear fix
cross browser and we're going to create
another one CF after which is going to
say clear both so this basically is
saying this pseudo element here will
clear all elements so you're clear will
floats rather so in the gallery we can
go ahead and apply this clear fix to
this so now that's fixed that problem we
can float as many elements as we want
inside of here in this container we'll
take all of the elements as normal so
let's crack on with the gallery item
then we want to make this look a bit
nicer at the moment it is just an image
so let's go ahead and give this a
background and you'll notice that that's
not really done much except you can just
about see the white part down here we
obviously want to go ahead and give this
a width and then go ahead and give it
some padding as well so you can see the
nice white container so I'm going to put
with 19 percent and then a margin of 1
then let's check out what that looks
like first of all so nothing really much
has happened here and but what we can go
ahead and do is give a padding of two 2%
so you can now see that we've defined
the width of this you know item the
image is sticking out so we need to make
some adjustments to the stars on this
actual image we need to give this a
width of 100% so it fits within this
container but at the moment we've got
enough room here for there to be four
images so basically if we look at the
width of this this is going to be
exactly the right amount with a 19%
width add a 1 percent margin and 2
percent padding will allow for four of
these so let's go ahead and just quickly
style as we mentioned the image within
the gallery item and that's going to be
width of 100% so that now looks like
this so we've now got this nicely
contained within here and just to finish
things off we're going to go ahead and
give the padding at the bottom a larger
value and this is going to be 5% I'm
also going to go ahead and give this a
box shadow so let's just take a look
what that's done that's giving it it's
almost like a you know a Polaroid effect
on this as a sort of printed out picture
or photo so let's go ahead and give this
some box shadow to make it look like
it's a little bit more 3d and sort of
sitting on this surface so the values
here are the X&amp;amp;Y
offset and so this will just put a
shadow to the just to the left-hand side
just to the bottom and a three pixel
blur or spread and then we're going to
give this an RGB a value which is a RGB
Channel and then an alpha Channel as
well and I'm going to set this to black
and then point two for the Alpha so this
will give this a sort of an opacity to
make it look a bit nicer so you can
change the offset or the blur or the
spread to just to suit your needs but
for now this sir looks absolutely fine
so what about having more than one of
these so let's
head and just do a fake sort of loop
here so we'll go ahead and open and
close in PHP tags and here we'll just
say four and we'll say four x equals one
while X is less than or equal to I know
let's put ten on here X plus plus and
then it's down here go ahead and just
end this four and that's it so now what
we've got is a loop of ten oops oh just
there we are such such a dollar sign on
there and there we go so we've now got
ten images now gallery so we know now
that the floats working obviously we've
got a clear fix on here so the container
has you know increased in height - how
many elements are on the page or within
this container and it looks fine so now
that we've done the styling we can move
on to actually creating the gallery
