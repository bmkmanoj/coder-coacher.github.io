default page that we get with every
laravel installation so in this part
we're going to look at changing some of
the views and creating a template so we
can actually you know show this in a
nice way so the first thing I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna
delete hello dot PHP and that will give
us an error here because that view can
now not be found of course this view is
being directly rendered I think from
views yes from roots yes it is we also
want to just get rid of all of this as
well so what we're gonna do now is we
are going to create a new root and this
is our going to be our home page and
instead of passing a close we're going
to pass an array and we're gonna give an
alias to this root this is going to be
home now we're also gonna say what
controller and what controller method
this uses in this case it's going to be
home controller and the method is going
to be index so if we head over to home
controller you can see that we've got
this show welcome as a default let's
change this to index and for view let's
render home so let's create this home
view inside of here so inside of the
views folder we're gonna create a new
file this is home but we're gonna call
this blade PHP this just allows us to
use the blade templating engine so let's
type home in here and we should now see
home perfect so let's create some
partials and by this I mean I'm going to
create a new folder and this is going to
house things like the header the footer
etc etc anything you want to include
into a main template I'm going to create
a templates directory and inside of here
I'm gonna create a default template so
inside of templates I'm now going to
create another folder and I'm gonna call
this partials sit inside of partials
this is going to store the header so
let's save this out again as a blade
just in case we need to use the blade
templating language
and we're also gonna have footer as well
so over in Defoe let's just draft out
what our main page is gonna look like
this is going to be extremely simple I'm
just gonna create a doctype HTML tags a
head and a body so inside the head I'm
going to set the character encoding to
utf-8 and I'm also going to set the
title as well blog we're going to change
this title dynamically later using the
different temperent views that we're
gonna create so we're gonna have
something like the title of the blog
here and then a bar and then blog but
we'll leave this as it is just for now
so what we now need to do is we need to
take the top half of this and we want to
put this inside of header and we of
course wants to take the bottom half of
this and put this in footer and we'll
just get rid of some of this line
spacing here so now what we want to do
inside of default we want to include all
of these pieces so we simply say include
templates dot partials dot header and
we're gonna have content here and down
here we're gonna include templates dot
partials dot footer so let's save this
and let's now inside of home say extends
templates dot default this will now use
that default template so what we should
now see is this and if we view the page
source we'll see all of the stuff we
created earlier come together there's
one problem
we don't want to hard-code the content
into here instead what we want to do is
yield content from somewhere so to yield
content basically means to take what you
use when you extend the template and
place it into that location so in here
we're gonna say section content and then
we're gonna say stop and in here I'm
gonna say
something so inside of here now we get
this placed inside of where we asked it
to be so now that we've done that we've
basically created the template that we
need let's just quickly mock out what
our pages might look like so for example
inside of header I might want to have a
assistant heading at the top of this
page so I'm going to create an h1 and
just say my blog so let's preview this
there we go and inside of the index page
or the home page we want to have various
article elements that hold the preview
content for all of our articles what's
going to happen here is we're going to
click through read more or on the title
of these articles and that will take us
through to the actual content so in here
let's just quickly create an article
element and inside of here let's create
an h2 saying this is the article title
now we're going to use markdown which is
basically a land not a language it's
sort of a language where you take
something like I don't know for example
hello
this will be translating into a header
you can read more about markdown
somewhere online you just got google for
it or something but in here for now
we're gonna power graph paragraphs will
automatically be generated in fact we're
gonna be using this ready-made passed
down wrapper for laravel this is just
basically a markdown part of PHP so
inside of here now let's just say this
is some body and it down here let's
create an anchor and we'll say read more
and we'll do a alright there we go
so this is what we're gonna get repeated
down the page we're not going to
introduce pagination it's fairly easy to
do this you can look this up in the
lower rail manual but we're gonna have
these coming down the page so basic
we be looping through these for every
article that we create so that's but
three there and that looks okay so when
we click on either the article title or
read more that's going to take us
through to the article itself and we're
going to use the exact same article
markup here so let's get rid of all of
these bar one just so we know what we're
working with and in the next part we're
gonna look at creating the models we're
gonna look at putting some data in here
and we're going to look at actually
outputting all of our articles or our
blog posts on the home page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
