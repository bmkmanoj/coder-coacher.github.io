inside of translations isn't enough and
in this video we're gonna get an example
that alerts to a user how many messages
they have this will just be text on the
page but in this case we need to take
pluralization into account if we say
something like you have five messages of
course the five could be the placeholder
what if we have one message if we have
an S on the end this isn't going to make
sense in the English language
now we could of course have two
different translations one for the
plural and one for the singular and we
could use an if statement to check the
count of messages and then determine
which one to show but this is going to
add unnecessary code and it will get
messy and hard to understand and
maintain but obviously laravel being
really flexible provides a much better
solution to this so let's go ahead and
create a language file inside of
greetings or let's rather create one
inside and call this messages so we
return our array and we'll say new for
the key so I'm gonna say you have count
new messages so we can practice working
with this so inside of home let's choose
messages dot new to show if we preview
that we'll see that but just without the
count being replaced so inside of our
root
let's pass down the account of messages
so we'll say new messages and we'll say
five for now so now within here we can
replace the count with a new messages
variable that we've passed down and that
will replace that and it will say you
have five new messages so now that's
working let's tackle the plural version
it's really really simple inside of our
language file all we do is use a bar to
separate the plural and singular
versions
so we can still use the count
placeholder twice we just have to
re-type this and there we are so you
have count new message and you have
count new messages so if we refresh this
as it is it doesn't make sense because
we've now got two translations separated
by a bar and that's because we can't use
the trans help a function here
unfortunately we have to go ahead and
use a lang model and access the choice
static method which will go ahead and it
will determine which one to pick and
you'll notice that I included the
singular first rather than the plural
first because we're saying two laravel
here this is the singular and then after
the bar or the separated by the bar is
the plural version now when we refresh
you will see that we've got an error now
the reason being here is we need to pass
an additional piece of information
through to Lang choice it actually takes
three parameters here in this case it's
just going to be the translation name
which we already know the second is
actually going to be the count because
this isn't enough to decide a laravel
this is what determines the singular or
plural version so as the second argument
we passed through the number in this
case it's new messages and the third
argument is going to be the placeholders
and again we could have as many as we
want in here so this is saying render
the new messages translation with five
new messages in this case passed down
from our root and we passed in the count
as usual so when i refresh now it says
you have five new messages that's
exactly what we would normally expect
let's go ahead and change this to one
and see what that does and as we would
expect it changes to the singular
version that we include it and there we
are the singular version takes its place
and we've tackle pluralization in
laravel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
