also want to store the users details you
don't have to do this like I said but it
is worthwhile doing and what we're gonna
be doing here is just taking it as a bit
of a shortcut to doing this we're just
gonna be issuing an insert statement but
you might want to do things like check
if the user already exists first in my
case I'm just gonna insert a record and
we're gonna assume the twitter ID is the
unique field and that's then going to
not overwrite the user's details if they
sign in again so we're gonna means
basically issuing an insert statement
every time the user authenticates so we
want to call this store user now with
this we want to send through a payload
and that comes from the reply from the
from Twitter's API which contains things
like our screen name and our user ID
both of which we're gonna be storing so
let's create this method down here store
user and that's going to take in payload
and we're gonna issue a query just in
here so let's build up our database
first of all so let's bring our terminal
back up and we'll sign in to our MySQL
in terminal your monitor and let's use
the website database I already have set
up you can go ahead and create your own
database and we want to just have a show
of tables there's nothing in here so
let's create a table called users and
we're gonna have an ID we're also gonna
have a twitter ID I'm gonna have a
Twitter username okay so for the ID this
is just gonna be an integer it's going
to be unsigned it's going to be in
primary key and it's gonna be auto
incrementing so just like a normal idea
that you'd get now for the twitter ID
this is going to be a big int it's going
to be unsigned it's also going to be
unique which is really important you
need this field if you're doing it the
way that I'm doing it and that's it I
believe so for the Twitter username this
can
speedy varchar' and i think yeah the
twitter username limit is 20 so we can
store this is 20 so let's just describe
that users table just to make sure we've
got everything right so we've got an ID
here which will also increment as the
primary key an unsigned twitter ID which
is unique and to user name perfect so
inside of our store user we need to call
a query now what I'm gonna do is I'm
building this in a way that I assume
you're gonna have your own way of
connecting to your database but what
we're gonna actually do is inside of
classes build up this DB class in here
just literally so you can inject your
own way of connecting and querying
into this Twitter earth class so for
this database class it's going to be
extremely easy I'm just going to use
MySQL I you know probably might be
better to use PDO if you want this to be
easily expandable nothing wrong with
MySQL I though so let's create a MySQL I
instance here or a property to hold this
instance and let's create a construct
here this class is going to be really
small what you're just gonna say this
MySQL I is a new instance of MySQL I
we're going to connect to our localhost
we are going to connect with the
username root the password root and
we're gonna choose website as the
database so we also need another method
here which is going to be query all this
is going to do is just return this MySQL
I query and obviously we need a SQL
argument passed in here and we'll just
pass that to that that's all we need to
do for this so you can either copy this
if you don't have a database solution
you can add other methods in here if you
need but we can close that now we know
that that should work so what we're
going to do inside about in it dot PHP
file is we're gonna create a new
instance of our DB so we're gonna say DB
is new EB that's it and we need to
inject this in anytime we called Twitter
auth so Twitter or can make
use of it so in the index file we will
also put it in the sign-out file in
actual fact no we won't will will
yeah we will just for simplicity you can
make these optional but were they can
all that for now and also in the
callback as well like this so you can
chop and change this depending on you
know how efficient you want to be but
what we're going to do now is we're
going to create a method up here called
DB we're also going to now allow a DB to
be passed in and we can type in that to
DB so that must have a DB object passed
in and then all we do is we so this DB
is DB that's it so now we have access to
the functionality inside of this DB
class so I we can just query so in here
we can say this DB query cool so inside
of here let's now insert a new record
and that's into the users table and the
values here are going to be the twitter
ID or the user ID and the screen name or
the twitter username as we've called it
in here so inside of if we just look
here remember that we're using this
reply we're passing this through to
store user so we've now got access to
things like reply user ID and we've also
got access to reply or this should be
payload screen name so in my case the
user ID will be like the number that we
saw earlier and that happens to match my
creator ID for my app and the screen
name will happen to match the owner
because I'm using the same account
authenticate so we can use these inside
of our query so we want to insert into
users Twitter ID and Twitter username so
the values here for the Twitter ID its
payload
user ideas we've already seen and then
single quotes is going to be the Twitter
username and that is screen name bear in
mind I'm sure this may not be an issue
but bear in mind I'm not escaping
anything here do be wary anything that
is passed into your queries go ahead and
escape I'm not gonna bother with it here
but please make sure you do it now what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say on
duplicate key and it's basically what
this means is if this unique field here
remember this is set to unique if this
new unique field is provided again we
want to basically do an update on ID
equals ID and this will just read
basically maintain this record it won't
insert a new record it will just update
ID to equal ID which basically does
nothing so let's check that this all
works let's go over to here and sign out
and we'll also open up our database
obviously a select everything from users
at the moment has no results but when we
sign in with Twitter hopefully
everything's working we're signed in now
so let's just check this query okay this
should be spelt correctly okay so now
let's give this another try let's sign
in with Twitter again oh yo you would
get a sign-in fail that was on for too
long
sign in with Twitter there we go so
we're now signed in if we head over and
check this it's now been stored so with
the unique field if we were to sign in
again with the same account that just
redirects us back that won't store
another record because we have this as a
unique field so that's it we've stored a
user we've obviously signed in and
authenticate tupid Twitter again you
know storing users information is
optional you may want to store other
information along with this user in case
you want to save it and that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
