looking at using VAR dump as we've seen
to go ahead and inspect the contents of
variables not only giving us the value
but also the type as well and we know
that we can use this on a raise and a
variety of other different data types
now it's really important that while
you're learning PHP and in fact even
when you're a seasoned developer you
pretty much find out exactly what's
going on with your code now the ability
to dump out data makes it really easy to
see what you're working with before you
start doing things like looping or any
of that so while this is usually more
useful for large complex arrays and
objects we're going to basically cover
the foundations again so you know
exactly where to turn if you get stuck
and you know then that if you're
struggling with something you can use
any of the methods so that we're going
to show here to go ahead and help you
out so first let's just again go ahead
and define our variable so let's make
this an array because it's slightly more
useful to be able to dump on array and
what we're gonna do here is we're gonna
create an associative array by setting
the key to Alex or any name rather than
leave it the default 0 upwards so let's
go ahead and create another one just
keep this really simple like so okay so
if this were a complex array or this
array was returned as part of a class or
a function that we didn't build how
would we look at the contents of it well
we've already seen this the best command
to use probably is var dump so let's go
ahead and do this check it out in the
browser and we know we see that this is
an array so that's really helpful we
know that we have two items in the array
and we see the contents of the array
here including the data types of
anything in between so now what happens
if we had a slightly different structure
to this so let's say users and let's go
ahead and again output say in fact we'll
make this an array within an array so
named let's go ahead and say Alex and
then again let's say age and set these
as well like so let's change this over
to Billy and let's change this over as
well so now we can do a var dump on
users and we know that we get a slightly
different result we still have two items
but now each of these items are
numerically index so starting at zero we
have an array within here and then for
the second key which is one we have
another array and again we can inspect
the contents of each of these so again
this example here we know exactly what
we're working with so we don't really
need to do a var dump on it but again if
this was something returned from a
database or part of another package
which you'll eventually learn about then
this will come in handy now if you are
following along and you see pretty much
what I see here then you're not going to
be using a PHP extension called X debug
so there's a PHP extension called X
debug which makes it a lot easier
amongst other things to see a nice
output of what you dump now what I'm
going to do is switch over to another
server I'm running that has X debug
enabled and you'll be able to see what
this looks like so we can bring back a
basic array like this and do a var dump
okay so I've just switched over to a
completely different server which has X
debug enabled and you'll probably agree
that compared to me load working locally
on mam you can see that this looks a lot
better I didn't have to do anything else
I'm using exactly the same code but
extra bulk has formatted this it's
giving it a little bit of color and it's
structured it in a much nicer way now if
you want to install X 2 bar depending on
your setup there are plenty of guides
around to do this so I would recommend
going ahead and trying to get that
installed however it's not completely
necessary and if you don't want to we
have another option to make output a
little bit prettier so let's close this
off let's return back here and I'll show
you how to do this without having to
install X to Bob okay so we are doing a
var dump at the moment normal var dump
which is giving us the following now
what we can do is go ahead and wrap this
and I think we've already looked at this
in this series anyway in something
called pre tags now what this does is it
preserves the formatting of whatever you
are doing so if we do do this and we
come over to the browser you can see
here that we do get a nicer structure to
this all it's done is it preserved all
of the line breaks that would have
originally been output when using var
dump so you might also come across and
if you want to very quickly find out
what you're working with you may come
across the print our function as well so
let's just go ahead and do a print our
own names and let's go ahead and refresh
and that should be users let's give that
a refresh and you can see here that we
get a slightly less complex output now
once again we can do the same thing with
this so we can use the pre tags here to
go ahead and preserve the formatting it
really depends on what you want to do
but you can see that this is slightly
easier to see what's going on
particularly for more complex things if
you didn't need to know information like
this was an integer this was a string
then this is a lot better for you okay
so for dumping that is pretty much it
but once again if you do struggle with
anything and you're trying to work out
the value of something is or how an
array is structured just use bar dump
and you will be immediately able to see
the state of a particular variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
