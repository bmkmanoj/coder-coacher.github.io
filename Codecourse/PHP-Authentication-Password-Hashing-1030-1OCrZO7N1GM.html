can start registering users but before
we do that we need to create a password
hashing helper to help us securely hash
passwords to be able to store so we're
going to be creating this as a helper
under our code course directory which we
created earlier when we create our user
model and we're going to then pull this
into our application into the slim
container so let's create a new folder
within our code course directory or
whatever you called your top-level
namespace we're going to call this
folder help us and inside of here we're
gonna have a new file called hash PHP
and this is going to be a class called
hash we need to namespace this remember
because this will be auto loaded with
psr-4
as we saw earlier namespace under code
course helpers and hash is basically
just going to allow us to password hash
that's pretty much it so the password
the PHP password hashing API allows us
to generate a hash which includes all
information you can choose the algorithm
you can choose the cost and if you
remember we specify these in our
settings just here so we can pull them
in to this hasha however how do we
access our configuration settings within
and within a class here well the way we
do this is when we pull it into the slim
container we can pass in these
dependencies and this is called
dependency injection so under start then
where we define our container items here
we are going to this time create a
singleton because it doesn't need to
change throughout our application it's
just available in the same state so here
we're gonna say hash and we're gonna
return a new hash and we're eventually
going to parse our configuration into
here so we can start to use it so let's
give ourselves the ability in here to
pass in that configuration as a
dependency so what we want to do is
create a constructor and we want to pass
in our config just here and then we are
going to set that to a property at the
top there
so our hash sure doesn't do anything yet
but it now has access to configuration
as long as we pass it in and to do that
what we need to do is make app available
as part of this scope and then say app
config then we have access to our
configuration options within our hasha
so we can test this out by just doing a
far dump on this config and if we go and
use this so under start let's just test
this out down here let's go ahead and
say hash equals new hash and there's a
problem here we'll see an error we don't
have a hash class found now let's
remember because it's namespaced
under code course helpers so at the top
all we need to do is say use code course
helpers hash and remember that's already
already also loaded in via composer so
now we have the following oh okay so I'm
missing an argument one let's take a
look at this out of course so down here
were obviously just creating new
instance so let's pull this from our app
so we'll say app hash so when i refresh
now we see our configuration like we've
are dumped inside of this hash here but
now we actually want to look at
generating passwords so we're gonna have
a method here called password this is
going to generate a password for us so
in here we want to type in password it
won't generate a password for us it will
generate a part of a hash so the PHP
password hashing API has two functions
password hash and password verify
password hash will hash your password
verified will allow you to type in a
user submits a password and the hash and
check that these match so we're gonna
return password
hache and in here we type in the
password and then we have configuration
options so we need the algorithm so we
need to get this from our config so
that's this configs we now have our
config available yet app hash algo which
is stored in app hash algo so we already
know how to put in our configuration and
let's just pull this down just so it's a
little bit easier to work with so the
third argument here is an array and in
here we can specify options like the
cost which we know we have in our
configuration so let's pass this in so
it's this config get app hash cost so
we've created the ability to hash a
password as securely as possible using
the PHP password hashing API so we can
test this out here by echoing out app
hash password and then we can type in a
password a user might submit so for
example I love cats and that will give
us this hash which we can then store in
our database so what happens if we need
to verify a password well let's just
create a temporary password variable
down here and say I love cats just
imagine this is a password that the user
has submitted in a form when they're
logging in so we'll create a new method
here called password check and all this
is going to do is it's going to take in
a password and a hash so that's the
plain text password and a hash which
will come from the database eventually
and we can just return the result of
password verify which is part of the PHP
password hashing API we type in the
password we typed in the hash and this
will return either true or false to see
if that password matches so to test this
out then what we'll need to do is again
echo our app hash password I love cats
we'll store this hash in our database we
won't do that now we'll just copy it and
we'll paste it into here I'll just say
hash equals this long string and now we
can var dump the result of a p' hash
password check that myth that we just
created we can type in the password and
we can type in the hash and you'll see
that that will give us true or false in
this case it's true because we know that
that hash we just created is basically I
love cats so if for example we said I
love cat and refreshed we get false here
or if the hash was somehow wrong it
obviously doesn't match so we get false
so that is basically our hash class we
will be adding to this later because we
need to include sha-256 hashing so we're
gonna create a general hashing ability
within this class eventually but we will
be doing that later on so we now have
our password hashing class complete
we've loaded it into our apps container
under hash and we can use this anywhere
in our application now when we're
dealing with registering users and
logging users in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
