to set up a stripe account so you can
actually take payments now you don't
have to actually pay anything to create
a test stripe account and it only takes
like a couple of minutes to do this so
once you're signed are over on stripe
comm you should see your dashboard and
you can see I've already had a few
payments taken under the test mode and
you'll notice that it's on test mode by
default so we're all good to go we can
just use our API keys to make charges to
cards the test cards that we saw earlier
so we can do all of this and we don't
have to pay a penny we don't have to
give any of our details anything like
that is all within one secure
environment so what we're going to need
to do in this part is set up plans that
we're going to allow our users to sign
up for and you can set up as many plans
as you want or you can just have one
single plan if that's what you're after
and then we're going to look at the API
keys and how we get them into stripe so
let's do this now let's head over to
plans and let's click on create your
first plan then we need to give this an
ID can literally be anything but I'm
going to create two plans a small and a
big plan so the ID for that is just
going to be small we then can choose an
amount so I'm going to say $5 for this
one and I'm going to have the intervals
monthly now you can set trial period
days but we're not going to cover that
you can go ahead and look into that it's
really really easy to do with our of our
cashier so I'm going to create that plan
and I'm going to go ahead and create
another one now as well and this is
going to be the large plan so we'll call
this large and this will be $10 instead
so $10 and that's going to be monthly as
well again we're just going to create
that plan like that
so we've now created two stripe plans
let's take a look around out account
area to see what information that we can
grab from this so under API keys you can
see that we've got a set of tests API
keys and a set of live API keys and we
need to store these inside of laravel so
it can make use or cashier can make use
of them when we install cashier we're
not interested
she yet but we will be doing so in the
next video so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to take the test secret key
now this is really important this is
kept secret the publishable key can be
used for things like the JavaScript
library so when we take a payment and
use this the stripe JavaScript library
to process this but please keep your
tests secret key secret now we need to
look at the difference as well as going
to tests in their life because the tests
will allow you to use test cards live
will obviously be when your application
is in production and you are accepting
credit card or debit card information
from public so let's copy this test
secret can get this into laravel now at
the moment I have a blank laravel
installation it literally is just
nothing at all so we are starting
completely afresh if you're integrating
this into your application you'll
probably find this just as easy
so under config you got a services file
and you can see here that it already
includes a key in here and an array of
data for stripe now this is for your
production environment but we're going
to want to use a local environment so in
services here you can go ahead and you
can put in your live key and I can go
into there now for your local your
development version you're going to want
to be able to use test cards so under
this local folder in config head over to
oh actually we don't have one so let's
create one here we'll create a file
called services or PHP we're literally
just imitating what's here and we can go
ahead and grab this whole file I guess
and just paste that in like this
although I'm not using these two
services because this is just a test so
I guess I can just get rid of them so
under the secret here this is for our
local version so we want to use this
test information here this test key here
so let's replace that in there so we've
now got these set up but at the moment
we're actually in production for example
if we were to run migrate you can see
that it says application in production
so what we need to do here is
the bootstrap start we need to change
our environment and I'm going to do this
by detecting whether or not a
environmental variable is set and that's
when I'm going to assume that we're in
production now otherwise what we're
going to do is we're going to assume
that we're in local all I want to do is
return get EMV and we can put anything
in here so app EMV otherwise we're going
to return locals so that will assume
that we're in local so now when we run
something like migrate it just gives us
this error because we haven't entered
our correct database information yet
however we didn't get the production
warning so we are now in a local
environment if this doesn't make sense
to you if you don't want to worry about
doing this you can use the method under
cashier and this is if we just scroll
down set stripe key so you can do that
in one of your initialization files the
only reason I do it under local and
development is it just makes it easier
for pushing to production to
automatically switch to your live stripe
key now I can test that out API key is
being returned correctly by basically
just using config yet and this is what
laravel cache is going to do later so
we're going to say config yet services
stripe secret so services stripe secret
so that should output this ending into H
because we're currently within our local
environment and let's just check that
out and it does in fact say 2h so we've
now got our stripe plan setup we've got
our API key and we've got a API key into
laravel we can now go ahead and install
cache here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
