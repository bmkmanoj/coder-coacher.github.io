statements in video and what prepared
statements are I think what we'll do is
we'll first start with a query that we
may use to insert data into our database
we'll do a basic insert statement and
we'll see the result inside of our
database and then we'll talk a little
bit about how is not ideal particularly
when user defined values are in the mix
so for example if a user was to be
posting something into a forum or
posting a message to another user your
your using user supply data inside of a
query so let's go ahead and look at how
this might work so we'll create a
variable called SQL and we'll create a
query within here this can be quite long
query so this is basically going to be
inserting into the guestbook table and
we will define the fields that we want
to supply that's name message and post
it and then we'll define the values that
we want to insert here so in this case
it's going to be Joshua for example test
and the now function in MySQL which just
will basically set the date/time to the
current date and time so now what we
would usually do is we would say a
handler weari SQL so we use the handler
which is the open connection to MySQL
and then we perform a queries in the
query method we pass the SQL string in
and when we go ahead and refresh the
page and check out database that's given
us an additional record within our table
so we don't want that we don't want to
do that because here let's say we wanted
these to be user-defined so we wanted
these to come from a post request to the
page so as part of the HTTP requests we
wanted to send across this data
basically a user submitting a form so
any data that isn't trusted this could
be from any source so what happens in
this case well usually what we would do
is
create some variables up here this might
be name underscore post name and the
same thing for message so it might be
message dollar underscore post message
so what you would then do is you would
go ahead and you would place them within
here so you would say something like
name message and that would work in a
similar way so if this data is available
that would work let's just go and
pretend this is the case for now we
don't actually want to set up a form
just for the sake of talking about
prepared statements so I'm going to set
the name to Joshua a message to test and
in here I'm going to do something a
little bit different I'm going to type
in colon name and colon message now this
is really odd because if I go ahead now
and I go ahead and execute this query
you'll see that we get an error so it
says here you have an error in your SQL
syntax check the manual that corresponds
to blah blah blah near dollar near colon
name message it doesn't understand when
it gets to this point here which is fair
enough that you know this isn't valid
SQL code if you like so why are we doing
this well the point here is that we want
these two values to be bound to this
query rather than popping them straight
into the string we want these to be
bound to the query and instead of using
the query which we'll member
automatically just execute a query and
insert that data we want to prepare it
now the difference between preparing and
querying is that when you prepare an SQL
string or query it won't actually do
that query when actually execute that
query so when if i refresh there you see
that nothing's changed here at all we
don't have any errors because there's no
problem with this SQL code now what
happens is now is we go ahead and we
prepare something then we execute it now
if I go ahead now and execute this so I
might say
well we need to create a variable from
this first I'm going to say query equals
the prepared statement now I'm going to
say query execute now this is at the
point where the query is actually run
and we'll get an error but we'll get a
slightly different error here we don't
have an invalid query error we have
invalid parameter number no parameters
were bound so what does this mean well
we've created these parameters here now
what we need to do is bind the values
that we want to appear in these
parameters place the reason that we do
that is then we're actually project
protecting against SQL injection as this
data is going in the inside of X cube
what we can do is we can pass an array
in here of the data that we want to
actually bind to this query so we've
prepared it we execute it and we pass
the values in bound so let's turn just
pull this down a little bit so the first
is name and we want to set that to
whichever name we want to use or
whichever value we want to use rather
and that's name so that's this imaginary
name here that's coming from a user
somewhere we then have message and we do
exactly the same thing we apply a
message to this so now what's going to
happen is we execute this passing in
this array of these of these values
which will then bind to these values
here because we've defined the same
properties here and then that will
actually execute and run the query with
them date with that data in there so
when we refresh now nothing happens over
in my database
that data has been inserted so the point
of this really is that you want to
prepare a statement with the values that
you want to insert then you want to bind
the values and execute the statement so
there's an alternative way of doing this
I should sort of shorter way of doing
this if required and that's just using
question marks for the for the values
now this is this is sort of less less
sort of immediately obvious but if we
say array name
message all this is going to do is it's
saying the first element of this array
is going to be bound to the first
question mark and the second element of
this array is going to be bound to the
second question mark and we get exactly
the same result here when we refresh we
see that we get another record insert
with Joshua and test so that's basically
how that how it works with preparing and
executing statements in P do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
