part of the tutorial the second part of
the tutorial to just explaining a bit
about process from the form itself to
the point where arrives at the mobile
phone the reason I've chose to do this
it's just because it might be
complicated to some people to understand
how it works through a gateway I've
drawn this very simple diagram with a
few annotations just to clear out if you
do know how it works and you want to
skip to the actual code itself then
you're more than welcome to skip to part
three of the video so the next part of
this video and you'll be able to get
straight in with the code okay so the
first thing is this SMS dot PHP file
that we've been working with and the
first thing that happens is when we
click the submit button on that page it
submits the post variables through the
form and that submits back so if you
follow this line here it submits the
post variables back to this page now
when that's been done and we need to put
together the URL that needs to be sent
to txt local remember the variables that
I mentioned earlier that need to be sent
like the username the password the
message etc so we put together
everything that's been sent from this
forum in SMS dot PHP we submit it back
and then the PHP side side of things and
puts together this URL and then we need
to submit that URL using curl so as we
come away from this page and as we
submit this information using curl we
come up and curl submits the post data
to text local and that's this page here
text local com forward slash send SMS
post PHP so we've submitted the number
the sender and the message which are
then put into a URL which is then
submitted securely through curl to this
URL here okay that's this step here and
then once that's submitted everything's
checked from the txt local process and
obviously txt local deals with it how it
deals with it and then the message
should arrive at the cell or mobile
phone so that's basically the process
that happens from the SMS dot php' to
this page here and then arriving at
their cell phone or the mobile phone so
it's quite a simple process and have a
look at this video watch a couple of
times if you still don't understand but
that's in the third part of the tutorial
I'll just be coding straight up how how
we can use curl to send send this URL
that we're creating so that's about it I
hope you understood this and I'll see
you in the next part of the tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
