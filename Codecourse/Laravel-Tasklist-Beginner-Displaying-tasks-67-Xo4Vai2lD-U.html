course we can't see them at the moment
because we need some way to first of all
grab these from the database we need to
pass them into this view and then we
need to loop through them and output
them so let's get started then on
working out how to pull these tasks back
now we're going to do this obviously
within this route because this is the
route that displays our view so we want
to pass that data down to this view is
the only view we have and then we can
loop through an output them so let's
start by checking out how we do this I'm
going to create a tasks variable just
here I'm going to use the task model and
what we're looking at now is eloquent
query builder so this means that
normally you'd write an SQL query you
would say something like select name
from tasks and you would order by
created at in ascending for example so
we would have the latest on the top or
the latest on the bottom so to do this
within lauraville we use methods like
order by we can use methods like where
we can use methods like we're in there
are loads of these to build up queries
what we're interested in though is just
ordering these but in ascending order by
the Creator that date and then we use
the get method just here so we're saying
task which remember relates to our tasks
table we want to order all of these so
this just assumes we're grabbing all of
them and we then say get now get will
return us normally when you work with
PHP you'll find it will return you with
an object or an array in this case what
we get is a collection so a collection
is just a helper think of it just a
helper for data now in this case we have
two items we have a task model and a
task model if you've worked with P do
before you will know that what you can
do is fetch an opt fetch data by an
object and this is fairly similar to
what's happening here we just have to
task objects so that's exactly what
we're getting back and we can iterate
through collections we can loop through
all of the items
we can grab the first item from a
collection so for example we could say
something like first just here and that
would give you the following this is the
pub just happens to be the first task we
can do a variety of different things and
at first this might seem a bit confusing
but eventually it will become really
easy and you will just start to be able
to write your queries out this way so
now we have this task variable but we
need to pass it into our view because it
currently won't be in scope so we can do
this a variety of ways we can either
pass an array as the second argument and
we can say tasks and then give that
tasks variable this would work and we go
over here and we now have this available
in here ready to use or we can do
something like this we can say with then
we can pass an array of data similar to
what we did before or what we can do is
use with tasks now what this will do is
it will automatically detect that this
is what you want to call the variable
and then you could just pass in tasks
it's entirely up to you which one you
use I personally prefer either using
with and then passing an array in or
passing an array in here it really
doesn't matter what you do if it starts
to get messy look back at it and think
how can I do this better in our case
though we have a very simple example
where we're just passing one thing
through to a view so I'm going to leave
it like this for now but of course feel
free to change it depending on your
personal style ok so now we have the
tasks collection available in our view
so how do we start to iterate through
this well we just use a for each loop
everything else will be taken care for
us so if we go over to tasks and index
we want to do this underneath at the
panel that we've already created so
we're going to come down just here first
thing I want to do is create an if
statement to actually check if we have
any tasks so to do this i'm going to say
tasks count now remember this to
collection count is a method that we
have available on the laravel collection
so that's how we can do that you can
alternatively like we saw with
validation do count tasks
and check that it's greater than zero
it's entirely up to you what you do I
just prefer doing tasks count little bit
more readable so now if this is the case
we can just say we have tasks and if we
just head over here you'll expect to see
we have tasks perfect so now we want to
create a new panel so I'm going to
create a panel again with a class of
panel default again just bootstrap
styling and inside of here we want a
panel heading this time and inside of
here we're just going to say current
tasks and down here underneath the panel
heading we want a panel body and this is
where we're going to list our tasks so
will list our tasks just in there so
this is what this currently looks like
so we're going to do this within a table
of course we're just playing around here
so table makes sense so let's create our
table out we're going to create a class
here of table and we will set this
striped and inside of here then we have
a table head we have a table header
which is task and the second part of
this table will just be the button so we
can just put a non-breaking space in
there for now so now for the table body
this is where we start to need to
iterate through so to start looping
we're going to create a for each we're
going to say for each tasks as task I'm
going to go ahead and end that for each
just there now inside of here the markup
is obviously going to be a table row
then we're going to have a cell just
here into this we can just place in our
task name so task name so notice we're
using a property to access this that is
just because we're working with a task
model now so now when we refresh we see
learn lauraville and learn PHP our two
tasks we've created and we can go ahead
and enter another one as well like so
and that will just add to the list so
what we've now done is output the tasks
that we currently have stored inside of
the database and that is it now of
course what we now want to do is move on
to the next part where we're going to
look at deleting tasks and this might
seem
fairly straightforward be an actual fact
there's a few things that we need to
watch out for here so we'll cover that
in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
