going to want to add a domain name to
point to your digitalocean server at the
moment what we've been doing is
accessing this via the IP address which
isn't ideal so in this part we're going
to set up this domain so in this case
it's just a domain that I have which is
registered with GoDaddy it really
doesn't matter what kind of platform
you're using to manage your domain it
work exactly the same and we're going to
attach this domain now so we want to
come over to the DNS part of the
digitalocean
control panel so over on here and we can
go ahead and add a new domain so all we
need to do is enter the domain name here
choose the droplet that we want to
attach this to and then we need to
update our domain name servers so let's
start out by adding this domain so it's
me Alex comm we go ahead and choose our
droplet so in this case it's Project and
the IP address automatically appears
just here and we're going to click
create domain so once that's done we
have the ability to go ahead and update
a few things here we have the zone file
and basically the a record is our IP
address but the name servers here are
what are important we need to go ahead
and update our domain or now wherever
we've registered our domain we need to
update the name service to NS one
through two three digitalocean com
so I just happen to have these already
set up but whatever you're doing with
your domain whoever it's with you want
to go ahead and manage these name
servers and go ahead and update them to
NS $1.00 digitalocean com ns2 and ns3
and once that's saved this domain once
it's propagated will then point to your
droplet so that's pretty much it we can
go ahead and add records here if we want
to so there's a variety of things that
we can do here but let's go ahead and
test this out now so
go ahead and switch over our IP address
and there we go
so we're now using at the main instead
of the IP address and it works in
exactly the same way and that is how
simple it is to attach a domain to our
digitalocean droplet pretty
straightforward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
