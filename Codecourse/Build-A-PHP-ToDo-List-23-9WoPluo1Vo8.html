end in this part again if you do want to
just skip to the back end if you have
front-end knowledge or you literally
just want to build your own design go
ahead and do that and then join me in
the next part but in this part we're
going to be burning up the front end
we're going to be adding our fonts from
our Google from Google font API we'll
have to open sans and shadow into lights
too but I'll show you how to use them as
well will create more hooking a style
sheet will add our meta viewport so this
will work nicely across all devices and
then we'll start to mark out our actual
list the form as well and define where
that's going to be submitted through to
it sounds like a lot to do but there
isn't actually that much to do so don't
worry too much so I've created one file
this is an empty file inside PHP to do
and I have this open in my browser here
currently that's obviously just a blank
farm so we've just got an empty
index.php file you're going to need to
name it PHP X will be doing some query
within this at the very top and then
we'll have our view if you like at the
bottom so I'm using Emmet to expand out
tags like html5 or shortcuts on html5
but obviously feel free to just follow
along and type what I am we have an
html5 doctype HTML head and body tags so
what you'd normally expect and a
character encoding tag here let's give
this a title of to do and inside of here
we're going to want to link in first of
all Google font style sheet so we have
one for open sans and one for shadow
into light two which is the top
handwritten font and then we'll holy now
main dot CSS style sheet so let's pull
in our google fonts first and so I've
got open sans just open here just Google
for these and they'll come up so Google
for open sans google fonts and then I'm
going to open this in Google font and
this'll allow me to use it now I'm only
using the normal 400 so I don't need to
select any other options here that's
going to have an impact on page load
speed and I don't need any additional
character sets either so here basically
this says no three of this code to your
website I don't like how this is
formatted now
is using single quotes and it's using
the the redundant type attribute so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to paste
this into here I'm going to remove the
type attribute and I'm just going to
change these single quotes here to
double quotes of course you can define a
replace that might be a little bit
quicker but there we go so we've got
that in there now so we've got our first
font in let's just duplicate this down
so we can then go ahead and add in our
shadows into light too so we hit this
there we go and we've got sort of only
one option for this and here we can go
down and we can basically copy and paste
this and what I'm going to do is just go
ahead and grab this here and I'm going
to go ahead and paste that into there
like so okay so now that we've linked in
our google fonts we can use these from
within our main stylesheet so let's do
this now inside of href we're going to
link to CSS main dot CSS so that's not
that obviously doesn't exist yet so
let's create this here so we create a
new folder here called CSS and then
within this I'm going to create a new
file and this is just going to be called
main dot CSS and this is where all of
our styles for our entire application
are going to go okay so now we need a
viewport tag here so again if you don't
have in it and you will just do a meta
the name attribute is viewport to
describe what this meta tag is and the
content here you need a width to either
device width so that just sets the width
of the viewport user scalable I'm going
to get rid of cuz I want them to be able
to scale it we've got an initial scale
of 1 which means it's not neither zoomed
in or zoomed out I'm going to get rid of
the maximum and minimum scale here so we
can allow our users sort of pinch in if
they want to so that's pretty much it
for the head all the boring stuff out of
the way now what we're going to do is
we're going to create the list the
header for the list the items we'll put
a couple of fake items in there where
while we start things up so I'm going to
switch away from using Emmet now if
you're sort of learning HTML that might
be a little bit easier so we're going to
create a div which is
to generate container and the class of
this is going to be list just so we can
specifically target things within this
list you don't have to do this but it's
probably wise so we're going to create
an h1 element and here I'm going to give
this a class of header like so and then
in here I'm going to say to do so I'm
going to move down now and inside of
here I'm going to actually create the
items and we're going to put these in an
unordered list because technically this
is just an unordered list unless you're
going to add to this and have priorities
this is probably the best markup for
this so we create an unordered list here
then within this we have list items so
these are lis so
UL is unlist lis list item so what we
can actually do is we can add the item
in here within a span and you'll find
out why we do this later and this is
going to have a class of item I'm also
going to have a modifier here which is
going to be additional class which is
when this item is done if it is done
we're going to have a strikethrough
but through it so we can add that in a
little bit later it's an actual file
let's duplicate this down have one item
that's not done on one item that is done
so just say something like pick up
shopping and something like learn PHP
okay so what we need now is a down here
a form that basically allows use that
they add a new item so here we create a
form with an action and this action is
going to be add to PHP that's basically
where the form is going to be submitted
through and all the variables within the
forms - like the actual item we're
adding is sent through to PHP so we can
pick it up so we have a method here post
and we'll end the form just there so
inside of here in fact let's give this a
class so we can specifically target this
since this is more than like you can
look different to items that we have on
our page other items so here we're gonna
have an input type and this is just
going to be text
just going to be text that user can
enter this is the name of the item that
they're adding so the name here is going
to be name that's a little bit confusing
this could be named item this is the
name of the item so when I have a
placeholder in here and this isn't the
best solution because if placeholder
isn't supported by a browser the users
just going to be left with a blank space
that they have sort of have to guess
that this is where they're going to add
something so you might want to look at
sort of a placeholder fallback or some
other solution but for now this is okay
it's not it's not the worst solution in
the world so we're going to have a class
here of input and because we want to
know what to target within this form and
I'm also going to set also complete to
off just so it doesn't suggest items so
as we're typing and I'm going to set
this to be required and what that will
do is it will bring up the you must
enter this or fill in this field text
that we saw in the demo in the last part
so to finish this off we're going to
have an input type here of submit and
this is going to have a value of adds
and this is going to be at the bottom
the button at the bottom which will
allow you to click and add the item
essentially just submitting the form and
then we have a class of submit so let's
take a look at this in the browser at
the moment it doesn't look great but we
can see that the structures here we've
got the header we've got the items and
we've got the input and the button to
actually submit the form doesn't look
great but that's where our CSS comes in
so inside of main dot CSS we need to go
ahead and change a few things here I'm
going to first of all set the background
color of the body so I'm going to say
background color and this is going to be
e c e FF 0 which is a light gray you can
go ahead and use your own color scheme
if you want this is a really nice or
gray color to be using and we're going
to change the body and the input and if
you're using a text area or anywhere
this would apply to that too we're going
to set the font so I'm going to say font
at 1 M sorry 1 M this is going to be
this is the shorthand font property so
we're saying all of these on one
otherwise you would do something like
font size
and from family but we're just doing it
all in one here I'm going to choose open
sans so that will make use of a Google
font that we pulled in a moment ago and
this is going to be a sans serif
so a San serif fallback if open sans
can't be loaded and here we're going to
give this a color so for every book for
that sort of whole page when it's a 3 6
3 6 3 9 I think I got this color scheme
just off Adobe cooler which is a really
cool way to grab a nice color scheme so
we're also going to do is for all
anchors we're going to set the text
decoration to none and we're going to
set the order autumn to 1 pixel dashed
and then the same color as our body font
now this isn't an ideal solution if
you're applying these styles to your
entire website maybe just the to-do list
is part of your website but in essence
this is just going to remove the default
underline of the links and it's going to
add in instead a one pixel - border of
the same color we don't have any links
at the moment but what we could do is we
could just add one in to see how this
looks so let's just say click me there
we go so that's how it looks it's got
that dashed underline there and that's
mainly for the mark done buttons that
we're going to be creating but you don't
really have to do this it's entirely up
to you so let's create the stars for the
actual list now so this is the container
of the list so I'm going to create this
as a sort of self-contained container
it's going to have a maximum width of
500 pixels but you could of course have
this within other elements so in this
case you wouldn't use these let's just
go ahead and set the background color
first of all to white and this will
obviously contrast with what we've got
in the background so there we go we've
got a nice white background to that and
let's set margin to 20 pixels and also
what this is going to do is it's going
to send to this container when we start
to add our wits on this basically means
20 pixels are the top and bottom and
also at left and right which will Center
an item which has a width
less than a hundred percent so here
we're going to say 100 percent width but
then we're going to define a maximum
width of 500 pixels what this will do is
it means that if the browser window is
made smaller than 500 pixels this will
sort of become almost responsive so when
I pull this in you can see that as I
pull that in it's actually it's not
chopping off it's just pulling
everything in so that's the reason that
we do that okay so for the rest of the
styles here we're going to give this a
padding of 20 pixels that just means
then that this pushes sort of the
elements within away from the very edge
you'll notice that that actually grew in
size if we do inspect this we can see
that the list is if we just check it you
can see the green part here is the
padding your range is just sort of the
margin the natural margin around the
outside now if I get rid of the padding
you can see that the size of the
container increases and decreases and
for that reason we're going to set box
sizing to order box and what that will
do is it will alter the box model to
mean that the padding doesn't affect the
overall size and height of that element
okay so just to finish off let's give
this a border radius of 2 pixels and
let's give thee well that just round off
the corners very slightly if we just
zoom in you can see that the corners are
very very slightly rounded now it
depending on your monitor contrast this
might not be visible I'm not sure I've
chosen the best colors for that but
let's add a box shadow now this just
adds a shadow to an element we have a
let an x and y offset we have a spread
and then we have a color in this case
I'm going to use the RGB a function and
I'm going to set this to black with an
alpha Channel of 0.1 okay so next thing
to do is to style the header so we're
going to say list dot header so at the
header within the list we're going to
change the font family to the one that
we pulled in from google fonts which
were shadows into light too and then we
set the fallback to cursor
okay so now we're going to set a margin
here of zero zero zero zero just to sort
of give our north east south and west
values and then all we want to do is on
the bottom add a ten pixel margin and
that will just move that so it sits
nicely at the top with the padding we've
already given it but if we inspect this
you can see that the orange part is the
padding on the bottom or the margin on
the bottom rather so we've got our
header sorted
let's now now go ahead and list out
items so just pull this down a little
bit but first of all let's just reset
the items container so we're going to
say margin zero this is basically the
unordered list we're going to say
padding zero and we're going to say
list-style-type is none I don't actually
know if I gave the unordered list of
class and I didn't so this is a class of
items now what that's going to do is
it's going to get rid of the default
margin and the padding on an unordered
list and it's also going to get rid of
by using list-style-type:none it's going
to get rid of them bullets so you can
now see it just looks like text set
underneath each other but we've still
got the semantic benefit of having an
unordered list here okay so what we're
going to do now is we have let's just
take a look at the mark up here we
should have an item like a done button
or something like that which we haven't
added into here we've got a span after
the span what we can actually do here
down here as well if we just pull this
down so this one is done so we can use
this class of hooked onto here to cross
this out if an item isn't done we want
an anchor in here and we want this to
say mark as done and then this is going
to link off to somewhere we know that's
going to link off to like done dot PHP
with all the information that we need
this is going to have a class of done
button class done - button and what that
means is we can say
done button and we can star this to look
like a nice little button so what we
actually want here is we want let's just
have a look in fact let's group this
under its own heading so we'll say done
button and I will take done button here
right so let's star this up and then we
look at positioning and things like that
of these items so mark has done at the
moment it just looks like a normal link
it's got the normal sort of default
colors on there and it's got the annal
it's got the underline that we gave it
earlier so we want this to be a display
of inline-block that means that we can
style this like a block element that
it's going to sit in line we're going to
change the font size we want that to be
0.8 m or you could do zero point am but
it's entire up to you and we want the
background color here to change I'm
going to have this as D 9 d f e 1 which
is like a slate gray type color like a
lights like slate gray color and we're
going to change the actual color of this
as well so we say color and we'll set
this to probably sensible to the same
color as the body like so obviously make
sure we have our hash in there okay so
now what we're going to do is add a
little bit of padding so at the moment
things look a little bit tight so again
I'm doing three pixels on the top and
the bottom six on the left and the right
so it now looks like this quite nice and
we're going to set the border here to
zero and we're going to set the opacity
to not point four now the reason that
we're doing this is when we hover over
each item we want the opacity to change
to one which is basically how I Paik it
is and then this will allow us to solve
not see this as much as we glance down
the page we don't know more looking to
prominent so let's style up the items
now so each of the items in this list so
down here we can say items dot item now
in fact now let's say let's say
the items Li so style each of the list
items and while we're doing that we also
want the input to be starred along with
it so we want item add input to look
exactly the same as the items we already
have so we want this input here to look
like each one of these okay so we'll set
the border to zero we'll set the border
on the bottom to one pixel dashed and
hash ccc and we'll set the padding here
to 15 pixels zero so now we have the
following so that already looks a little
bit nicer we've got the input like I
said here looking pretty much the same
as these items here except we've gotten
this add button will star that in a
moment to have it underneath here and it
looks fine now we've got this problem
where when we click in we've got this
blue board around it you can of course
keep that it does aid you know some sort
of usability however what we are going
to do is we're going to get rid of this
so we're basically going to say input
focus outline:none like that and there
we go when we click in it we don't get
that outline okay so now that we've done
that let's just focus on done items
because this one should be done all we
need to do in this case is we need to
say items or items item dot done so this
is item that has a class of done as well
inside the items here needs to have a
text decoration of line through oops
line through and there you go so that's
a done item and we'll control that with
PHP later so the last thing to do in
terms of the items is when I hover over
one of these items I want this markers
done button to change opacity one we
could do this with JavaScript but it's
easily done with CSS
and obviously a lot quicker as well so
I'm going to say for each item for each
item that we hover over so each list
item that we hover over we want to star
the done button and we're going to set
the opacity to one so when we hover over
a list item the done button changes its
value on a pasty to one so there we go
when I hover over that's done like so
okay so the next thing we want to do is
we want to set the input we've already
used input down here we want to set the
input to a width of 100% and what that's
going to do is because at the moment
this is only sort of half of this width
that's going to push that Add button
down and it's also going to pull the
input all the way over to the edge so
when we type lots of stuff here all that
really happens is we just get this
effect you could of course use a text
area it's entirely up to you and star
that differently but I've just use an
input here to keep everything on the
same line so let's star the submit
button here so let's go down and style
the submit button
okay so submit this could be named
slightly differently it's a little bit
generic and if if you are including
other elements on your page this
probably is a little bit too generic
but that's okay you can change the class
name just to see you so I'm going to set
a background color on this to FFF so
that's just white we're going to set a
bit of padding so five pixels on the top
ten on the left and the right we're
going to set a border here one pixel
solid ddd so let's just check how this
is looking cool looks a little bit
better what we're going to do is we're
going to set a width of a hundred
percent here and we're then going to say
we want a margin top of ten pixels and
let's refer back to this cool so it's
looking a little bit nice now we can
click this and we get out front and
validation because we added our required
attribute on here but I want to add a
little bit of a shadow on this so I'm
going to set a box shadow on here or
three pixels
left offset or X offset rather sorry
three pixels Y offset zero and DDD and
we should get like this so that's the
front end of our to do let's now move on
to the back end making this actually
work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
