building this Ajax multiple file
uploader with a PHP backend to go ahead
and process the files and we're going to
be building this in the style of an app
I saw of app which allows you to have a
custom callback which allows you to do
the things that we're going to do you'll
see in a minute down here let's go ahead
and just choose a few files at the
moment I've only allowing mp4 files you
can see I've got quite a few mp4 files
here I've got one Neto txt file let's go
ahead and just select a few of these
videos to go ahead and upload so let's
click upload here you can see that we
get a progress bar with a progress
slider and the percentage and then once
that's done we wait a couple of seconds
and these are shown to the user we can
go ahead and click on these and view the
contents of the video so what happens if
we want to go ahead and instead in
upload a father isn't allowed well
because of the nature of how we're
building this we can customize how we
display this but for in this case all
I've done is I've shown an optional part
to say sorry these files can't be
uploaded so we've got the two that have
been uploaded here and then
unfortunately the following failed and
the file that didn't upload and
obviously there's no link here because
the file didn't upload so this is going
to be based on an AJAX called - a PHP
file we're going to upload the files and
then we're going to get an array of
successful files and failed files so in
the next video we're going to take a
look at some considerations we need for
uploading files in PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
