value in PHP and understand what it
means and what it means for a variable
to have a value of null and we'll also
take a look at a function as well or a
couple of functions that allow us to
work with null values so basically what
null is is it's a variable that either
has been assigned the constant null so
there's null basically looks like this
as a constant we also have a null value
if we have a variable that hasn't been
defined a value yet so for in this
example name will be null and also we
have a function PHP called unset which
will remove the contents of a variable
and it will be null so we can say know
unset name if name previously contained
a value so let's just play around with
these three different different
scenarios so I'm gonna say name equals
null then I'm gonna come down here and
I'm gonna do a var dump which again is
extremely useful if we need to work out
whether a value has a null value or not
not actually check if it has a null
value but determine whether it does so
we can use the is null function which
we'll take a look at in just a moment so
I'm gonna do a var dump on that and
refresh and you can see that this just
says null it will just come up with null
now if we were to say name is Alex or in
fact let's just declare name but not set
a value to it we get exactly the same
results it just says null so it's an
undefined variable so it hasn't had any
value set to this we also can use unset
so if we were to bring back the string
and then use unset on name and we var
dump on name we also will get a null
value back and again it says undefined
variable because technically now this
has been unset and it contains null so
what we can actually do is we can check
if something has been set or not using
is null so for example if I say
name at the top of the page here and I
say if so I'm gonna use an if statement
here and I'm gonna say is null name name
equals Alex and then down here I'm gonna
echo name so this might look a little
bit confusing but all we basically have
is an if statement here so we're
checking the value that's returned from
this is null function we're passing in
this this name variable here just to
check whether it's null or not
so we're basically passing this this in
so what we get back is if we get true
back we're going to basically just set
this name otherwise we'll return false
because this function returns true if a
variable that we provide to it is null
or false otherwise
so if we go ahead and refresh the page
now we get Alex here so we're still
getting this notice because we have an
undefined variable where at which we're
actually passing in to check but
regardless we've actually checked this
and set a value whereas if we didn't
have this check we would we would just
be echoing out something that wasn't set
so that's basically null values and the
VAR dump the var dump function or
language construct is extremely useful
here because basically what it means is
that we can check the type in this case
it's going to be a string of length four
because we've defined this here now that
we know that it's null and and that's it
we've output the value so you'll come
across null in in certain circumstances
now null is a slightly confusing in the
sense that sometimes it's mixed up with
the boolean value false but in actual
fact this isn't true null is a constants
it's not a variable type so it's not
it's not false it's not zero so for
example we can check this so let's just
say var equals false and we'll say no
No so we'll say results equals
var is equal to null so we're doing a
check if y is equal to null or not and
then we'll go ahead and we'll do a var
dump or result this is going to give us
a true or false value back so if we
refresh it says false hiss so false does
not equal no now what if we use a double
equals which doesn't use type checking
let's go ahead and see this as well it
says true so this is a little confusing
in the sense that it does actually
return true so this will return true but
it will turn false if we use type
checking as well because these two are
of essentially different types so it's a
little bit confusing but it's
fundamentally you know not the same
value is that it would be exactly the
same if we were to say does 0 is 0 equal
to null and in this case we would get
true back as well but obviously if we
were to say does 0 absolutely with type
checking equal null then we would get
back the value false because it doesn't
so yeah I mean it's a good thing to play
around with but it's sort of fundamental
to understand that null doesn't mean
that a variable holds the value false</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
