details we're now going to actually look
at sending email so the first thing I
want to do is define the from and from
name now we use exactly the same method
as we've seen here we use the object
that we instantiated at the top PHP
mailer object and we say from now this
is the email address that the email is
being sent from so really this can be
anything in this case I'm just going to
say Alex a PHP academy' dog which is my
email address
now bear in mind I'm sending this from
myself to myself and I'm saying it's
from myself as well so in this case it's
just going to show me in Gmail usually
this would show the from name if you
were in any other circumstance so let's
set the from name now again this can be
anything so I'm just going to write my
name so now we want to add addresses to
people that we want to send this to an
actual fact will will will do the reply
to address first so we're going to say
add reply to that this is actually a
method because it takes two parameters
both strings and in this case we're
going to supply the email address which
is the reply to email address so I could
say something like reply at PHP academy'
de org and I'll just say reply address
here so we've added a reply to now let's
add the addresses the CC and the BCC
that we want to send this to now it's
important to realize that with the add
address method you can call this as many
times as you want it doesn't matter so
I'm going to say send this to myself and
you can actually provide a name so here
in this case I'm a little bit limited
because I ant an email to myself but
otherwise these details would make sense
so
address can be called as many times as
you want we could really call this again
and again and again it wouldn't matter
as long as the email addresses are
different which obviously makes sense so
we've added an address to send to now
let's add a CC which is using the add CC
method so let's do this on the mail
object and again this is a method so
let's say CC this to the same email
address and the same name and we can
also add a BCC as well which is a blind
carbon copy and again this is a method
as well because we need two parameters
here so I'm not actually going to
include these so I'm going to get rid of
them but for the purpose of this
tutorial it's good to know that they're
actually there so add address is
probably the most important that a
recipient basically but now we actually
need to get to the meat of the email
which is the subject the body and the
alternative body which I'll speak about
in a moment so the subject is obviously
the subject of the email so here is an
email we obviously then have the body
which is again self-explanatory this is
just what you would see in the body of
the email
this can be HTML but we're looking at
we'll be looking at sending HTML email
in the next video so I'm just going to
write this is the body of an email so
now the alt body or the alternative body
is basically the body in plain text
because obviously some male clients
won't read HTML and it's always a good
idea to include this text which is
basically the just the text
representation of your email now in the
case of sending a normal email like this
it doesn't usually matter but I always
like to add an alt body anyway and in
this case it's going to be exactly the
same as what you enter here so I'm just
going to copy and by
that down ideally you'd probably store
if these were identical you could just
store them in a variable and reuse them
so that's setting up the properties of
this email if you like what you can now
do is actually send the email but I'm
going to do a var dump and I'm going to
do this on mail send now the send method
will actually send this email so with
all the properties that you've provided
here to the SMTP server for delivery as
we've defined up here and via dump is
basically going to give us a true or
false value to tell us whether this
email has been successfully delivered or
not and what we can then do is put that
into an if statement so let's try this
out in the browser so let's head over
here and refresh that
okay so we've included a mail so it's a
10
ok so let's refresh and we should see a
true or false value and you can see just
down here we have a true value now if
this failed to send let's just change
something here say let's say PHP
academy' dot-com and we refresh that
then says false so this hasn't worked
you can now also see user name and
password not accepted so we've got all
of this information here just hasn't
worked so that's basically due to the
fact that we had the SMTP debug on now
in a production environment you wouldn't
want this to be included you wouldn't
want to debug Orwell at all really all
this information shouldn't be you know
available so assuming we've got the
correct credentials and we hit refresh
here by removing that all we're now
doing is actually outputting the dumped
variable here and you can see in my
email client here this has actually been
sent we've got two
here that have actually been delivered
so this has worked so now you know that
you can go ahead and put this into an if
statement so you could say something
like if M send that means it's
successfully sent else that means it
hasn't sent so you can actually use a
property which is part of this M object
called error info so you can echo this
out do whatever you want with it and
that will give you more detailed
information now it's not to say that you
would echo this out in a production
environment because it's likely you'd
want to just log this somewhere or you
know pass it off to some kind of
debugging tool that you log errors in
something like that
otherwise though this is basically how
you could do this this will return a
boolean value so in this block we know
that this email sent and in this block
we know we can get the error in for
everyone and that's basically the basics
of sending email with PHP mailer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
