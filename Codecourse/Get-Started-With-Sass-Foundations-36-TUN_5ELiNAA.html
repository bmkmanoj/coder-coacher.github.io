foundations of our very basic front-end
design and by this I mean looking at
fonts we're gonna look at including
variables within Sachs so we can
reference these within our other files
and we're gonna look at things like
background colors as well and we'll
create a very simple wrapper for our
page we're not using any frameworks here
we could of course use a framework like
foundation or bootstrap but we're just
gonna meet keeping these things really
really simple on a component level so
the first thing that I'm going to do
then is over in my text editor I'm gonna
pull in a font that I want to use and to
do this I'm gonna use google fonts of
course you can pull in any font you want
from any source it really doesn't matter
how you do this because we're gonna be
defining the font name in exactly the
same way so I'm going to be using open
sans it's a really nice font to use if
you do want to use google fonts just go
through and select the options you want
here and then you can go and copy this
link here to the style sheet I already
have one prepared because I don't like
the format of this so I'm gonna go ahead
and just copy and paste this over into
here so it looks like that so it's just
linked with a rel attribute style sheet
and then the href here and I'm putting
in 300 400 and 600 font weights so
remember we have our CSS file linked in
here that's going to be generated using
the sass command on the command line we
have app dot s CSS which doesn't contain
anything at the moment I've removed what
we saw in the last video and inside of
CSS this directory is currently empty so
what we want to do then is we want to
start structuring our assets or Styles
directory to include things like the
base framework for our out of our
front-end styles and also we want
another folder that's going to hold
things like variables which we're going
to be looking at in this video and
things like mix-ins and placeholders in
the future
so let's create a
new folder called ace and inside of here
we're going to create a new file that's
gonna hold all of our application
variables you could of course split this
file up but I find it's quite helpful to
have them all in one file just for easy
finding now with any sass includes we
prepend these with an underscore and
that way we can just easily import them
using our main app dot CSS file so I'm
just going to call this variables des
CSS so if it's underscore and then the
name of the file that you want so what
we need to define in here are things
like the background color for the body
the body text color the font family the
font size the line height link colors
anything like that and that way if
anything changes we can just come over
to this file change it and it's just
updated now of course for the body
background color this is just going to
be one property on one selector anyway
but as we progress through the series
you'll see that giving variables or
creating variables in this file means
that you can just adjust the whole look
and feel of your components with just
changes of variables so let's say we
create our global style variables here
the first thing we want to define is the
body background color so for this I'm
going to say e d e FF 0 which is a nice
light gray color we're going to set the
body text color here so we're going to
choose that I'm going to do two to two
so just off black we're gonna set the
font family now because we've pulled in
google fonts open sans with google fonts
we can just say open sans here
and obviously for this we have a sans
serif fallback we can set the body font
size in my case this is just going to be
set to 100% and we also going to set the
body line height as well so 150 percent
so we've got these we need to now work
out how we actually use
so we've not created a file that's going
to house electors like a body selector
so what we want to do then is create and
you fold it in here and I tend to call
this framework if you are using a
framework like foundation this will all
be done for you we can you can change
variables within foundation but in our
case I'm just gonna have a global file
in here which is going to do things like
set the fonts that body background and
anything like that so I'm going to call
this global duress CSS so in here then
we just write you know CSS is normal as
such and we just define the properties
we want in here so font family is going
to be body font family the font size we
set as a variable as well that's body
font size we have a background color to
our page which is body BG color we have
a text color to our page which is body
text color and we have our line height
and then we are going to set the margins
to zero just so our navigation can
eventually sit at the top so let's also
set our link colors as well and then
we'll start to hook all this together
and see how we run our sass come out and
again just to generate all of this so
for our links then we're just gonna say
link color and I'm just gonna set this
to black and I'm gonna set the link
weight to 600 like so so obviously you
can get a little bit more advanced here
and use pseudo selectors and things like
that but for now all I'm going to do in
here is just say anchor I'm gonna set
the color to link color
and the font weight to link weight you
can obviously chop and change this and
make it a little bit nicer so now that
we've got our global duress CSS file
with this with these Styles in we've got
our variables that are holding our
variables we want to import them into
this main file because remember the apt
is CSS file is the file that we're going
to be compiling from so to do this we
use import and then all we do is we
choose the name of the directory if we
are storing within a directory and then
we choose the name of the file so for
example to import our variables we're
going to the base directory and we
import variables now notice I haven't
added an underscore here that's because
SAS knows that this is an include file
so we'll recognize it as such so you
don't need to give the exact name you
don't need to give an extension either
it will pick all this up for you so what
we'll also do then is we will import
framework global and now we can start
compiling so remember we run SAS watch
and then we choose the name of the
father for the input and then the name
of the file for the output so in this
case then we are going into assets
styles and we can by compiling app dot s
CSS and we want this to go into public
CSS app dot CSS so that's now watching
for changes so whatever changes we make
here that's going to be updated and
notice we also have our app dot CSS file
generated for us and you can see all of
the variable values have been placed in
the correct position and we are pretty
much good to go
so now when I go and refresh this page
we see our background color and all of
the other stars there as well
so just out of interest if you do want
to compress this file a little bit more
minify it as such we do have an option
to do this so let's just come out of our
sass command and let's just run sass h
again and if we just scroll up a little
bit
we can see here that we have this output
style here so we can say style and then
we can have nested which is default we
can have compact compressed or expanded
so let's go for the compressed option so
we'll rerun this command but this time
we will provide style compressed so
let's just save this file going to app
dot CSS and you can see that it's all
being compressed into nice a nice one
line just to save a little bit of space
so now that we are watching this file
for changes we can go on and finish the
rest of this part of the series so I'm
going to add to my framework folder here
I'm going to create a new file and I'm
going to call this layout by s CSS now
this is entirely up to you how you sort
of lay your site out it really really
doesn't matter but for the purpose of
this video I'm gonna create a basic
wrapper so I'm gonna have a hundred
percent width on this I'm gonna have a
max width of 800 pixels so this will sit
by a default of 800 pixels but it will
also be responsive as well and I'm gonna
set the padding to zero on the top and
bottom and 20 pixels on the left and the
right so now that we've done that we can
update our app dot CSS file we can pull
in layout save that and we have that in
here now so we've got our wrapper in our
app dot CSS file so we can update our
index page and include a div with the
class of wrapper with content just going
in here so this will sit below the
navigation that will be creating at the
top a bit later okay so we're pretty
much done for this part we've laid out
the basics of our page in terms of
creating the global styles for our body
and anchors we've created a very basic
wrapper just for the purpose of this
video and we've also learned about how
to create
use variables within sass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
