an object fetching as an associative
array fetching into a class what happens
if we just want to fetch all of our data
for example we might want to count it
before we loop through it because at the
moment what we're doing is we're using a
while loop here and we're saying
something like while R equals query
fetch and then doing something in here
now we already know that if we were to
do a print R on query fetch and output
that within pre-formatted tags we get
something like the following like this
so this is an associative array combined
with the numeric now what happens if we
just want to fetch all objects at the
moment all this is doing is is it's
fetching the first record we know that
we have two records within our database
but here it's only showing one so let's
just change this to PDO fetch suck so we
know that we're just getting one record
out here now that's no good now what
happens if we want to just return them
all so we use the fetch all method now
what's happened is is it will return an
array with two items in and this is the
first and the second item in our
database which is all of them if we were
to go ahead and insert another record
choose the now function for that then we
see the other record added on and the
benefit that we have here is what we can
actually do is we can say something like
results equals query fetch all and
choose something like PDO fetch
associative array then we can say
something like if count results echo
there
our results otherwise echo there are no
results so we can actually start to
implement some logic based on that now
there are other ways of doing this but
I'm just demonstrating so here we've got
there are results if for example we were
to say something like select star from
guestbook limit 0 it says there are no
results limit 0 is just going to
basically limit this at the zip the
first result so we'll just return
nothing so that's just so quick
demonstration how we can return or fetch
all results rather than having to loop
through them you might need to do this
in some circumstances so you know it's
useful to know that the effectual method
is available as part of PDO</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
