is building out config class and this is
going to allow us to draw any option
that we want in a really cool way from
our config that we created it in init
dot PHP so we defined our configuration
here of course we could when we are
accessing our config because we set this
as a global we could of course do
something like the following MySQL and
host for example so we could of course
do this but this is a little messy and
what happens if we go ahead and change
the name of our our config to something
else for example now what we're going to
do is build this class and essentially
it's going to allow us to access our
config in a super easy way using forward
slash is almost like a directory
separator so the end result that we want
is to be able to say something like echo
config get and then we want to say some
that MySQL host and that's what we want
to do and that's going to then output
one to seven or not dot one that's what
we want because it just makes it sort of
abstracts you know using native
functionality of accessing this Global's
array on its own let's go ahead and
build this it's not too difficult but
there's a little things in here that
might confuse so it's one of them things
that we build but then afterwards we can
sort sit back and relax and say I can
pull config from anywhere and this works
at any level deep as well you can go
into I don't know you could say
something like more and then create a
new array and go go much deeper into the
array and this config class would still
work so it's sort of bulletproof in the
sense that whatever you add into your
config you'll be able to access so the
class is going to be called config
remember we don't need to require this
any works we already have an autoloader
so we can test this out on the index to
index dot PHP we don't need to require
it anywhere so we're going to have one
function in here or why
method rather it's going to be a static
method so we have a public static
function and this is just going to be
called get now instead of get we want to
define the path so that path and we're
going to set that as a default value of
null just so we can check if it exists
so inside of here we want to say if path
so we want to make sure that path has
been passed to this method so now what
we're going to do is create a variable
to basically define where our conflicts
coming from just so we can make things a
little bit easier so we can just put
essentially going to say config equals
Global's
config and that's it so we now have this
configure variable that we can use down
here makes it life a lot easier so we'd
have to keep repeating ourselves with
this so the path is going to be the path
that's passed in so let's go ahead and
just just use this class basically we
haven't built it entirely yet
let's go ahead and use it like we just
saw so I'm going to say MySQL host so
I'm going to assume this is going to
output this and that's what we want to
achieve by creating this so the path we
want to explode so explode is going to
take a character that we want to explode
by and it's going to basically give us
an array back so let's go ahead and
print our on path and that's just going
to show us what we what we see here
let's open our browser and refresh and
we can see that we've got an array now
of two elements one MySQL one host so
you can start to see now that as we've
broken this up it's going to make it a
lot easier to find what we're looking
for here and why I asked you out and
host so now what we want to do is we
want to loop through these pieces that
we've broken up so we of course create a
for each loop to loop each element of
this array and we have for each path
which is the array that we've just
created as bit so in here now we have
access to bit so if I was to echo bit we
would get just pop a space on there
you'd see that we get MySQL and host so
we now have access to each of these bits
that we've defined so we want to check
if these are set in the config so we can
use the
set language construct and say config
bit so now what's going to happen is if
config so this config and this bit here
is set then we can go ahead and set it
so let's go ahead and check this out
there now only echoes once now why is
this well if we look at this code
carefully if is set config bit that will
be MySQL host isn't set inside config so
what we really need to do here is we
need to set our config equal to config
and that bit so here we say config
equals config bit so what's now going to
happen is we're going to return this
we're going to return this value so
return config now let's take a look at
what happens when we let yeah let's
check we're out there we go and we have
one one two 7.1.1 done or done order one
so what has happened here is for each
one if it's set we're setting the config
to the bit that we want so for the first
loop we're going to say does mysql
existence like config if it does we're
setting config to mysql so then for the
next loop does host exists in config
because now config equals mysql and then
we end up with this piece here so that
is literally all we need to do the last
thing i'm going to do is just outside
this I'm going to return false so if we
don't have anything existing here so for
example MySQL host
hello and if we do var dump on that
and we go ahead and open our browser and
refresh you can see oh oh of course no
so we can define her actually the way
our codes written we can define this
because this doesn't exist so it's still
returning config but if for example we
were to say hello host there that will
then be of course because we're
returning out we returning our config
anyway if the path is actually set so I
guess in that case the only way that
we're only gonna we're only going to
return false is if that like that
so something you might want to do as a
sort of side thing is actually check for
things like this because obviously this
hasn't been factored in this code that
I've written but you might want to
actually check if things exist I mean
this isn't necessarily a problem because
if if our config file is if our config
stuff is there then we we saw have
control over that it's not a user
controlled thing so you know no one's
necessarily going to be there to mess
around with it but overall if we would
change this back to MySQL host and we
refresh we can now get specific parts of
our of our config out now like a mention
we can go a little bit further so you
can create a new array inside of here
but basically now we can access all of
our config in really easy to remember
way so we don't have to we don't have to
mess around accessing this global array</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
