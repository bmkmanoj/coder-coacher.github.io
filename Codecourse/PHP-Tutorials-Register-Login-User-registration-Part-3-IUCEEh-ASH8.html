in the last part in this part what we're
going to be doing is checking for
existence of all these just to recap
what we've done we've stripped our tags
off of our full-name and I use the name
and we have encrypted and stripped our
password remembering these functions
this way around so we're not encrypt so
we're not stripping off our encrypted
value and here we're going to start our
registration well not a registration
process our checking for the existence
of all these
just before I do that I'm going to set
the date now this is using the date
function and inside we have a wife of
the year and then we have a M for the
month and D for the day at the longhand
way of writing the year so that would be
a four sorry not longhand it's more of a
four letter for number year if it was a
small wire we'd have a two number year
so the way my database works at the
moment is I have my year first my month
my day these are some these are
separated by hyphens we can see this if
we enter our database here and we say
insert a value into users we can see
that the date is in a specific format if
we use the calendar function here and I
click Save today we can see that we've
got a year in our four digit format and
our month here and a day here separated
by hyphens so I stood hearing to that
structure in summer database okay so if
submit we need to start check for
existence if that's right how you spell
it as it exists
you know just say and I okay now this is
really easy all we want to do is we want
to say if we need another if statement
and we need a block a code after that
now this is going to be if full name
username password and repeat password
exist which as we have evidence here
we're going to say if username then
we're going to say and so a double and
double ampersand symbol and then I'm
going to say password then I'm going to
say and if that means the full name in
I'm just gonna put that in there so just
separate these with double and amber
sands and the last one is repeat
passwords so repeat password so we're
going to require all of these and
otherwise in our if statement we're
gonna say echo please fill it in we were
saying bold or fields okay I'm gonna do
a paragraph break after that okay in
fact I'm going to put my paragraph break
this for my form so then we don't need
to add it to row every error message we
give okay so we've got that let's just
give that a go I'm going to go back to
my register page and we've got it here
let's click register please fill in all
fields let's say type in a couple of
them and just choose one of our
passwords we're not going to repeat our
password register mmmmmm
repeat password repeat password
beep password okay the reason we're not
guessing the reason we're not getting
this to work at the moment is an md5
value of nothing is equal to an md5
kick-ass string of text an encrypted
string of text so I've realized that we
want to do is we're going to take out
the md5 function here so make sure you
remove the end brackets what I'm going
to do is I'm going to come down here and
I'm going to say check for all of our
data so if I go back and I try this
again before it remember it didn't work
if we didn't choose a repeat password so
if I didn't choose a password or a
repeat password we get our error up if I
again choose a value except the repeat
password we still get this error so
that's the problem
and what we now need to do is say if
everything exists then we can convert
our password and repeat password so I'm
just going to say password equals md5 of
password so they said this will encrypt
our original variable value and store in
a new password called the same variable
we also need to say repeat password
equals md5 and repeat password
okay so we'll hit well we'll say encrypt
password
okay so we've encrypted our password
okay now what we're going to do is we're
going to go ahead and we are going to
allow add all our data into our database
and I'm just trying to think I might say
yeah I'm gonna do is because we've got
we've got a bit of data here going into
our registration and then it set a
maximum limit for each of our data
that's inverted and I'm going to say 25
characters for our full-name username
password and repeat password so I'm
gonna say the maximum is the maximum
value is 25 okay so what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to say if
the string length of username is small
or say is bigger than 25 or the string
length of the full-name is bigger than
25 okay
um then I'm gonna say we look at DD's
individually and say the username if
your string the length of your username
or your full names too long and but what
I'm gonna do is I'm going to do this in
one now if it's bigger than 25 or yeah
if it's bigger than 25 each of these
values we're going to echo out saying
username or and I'm gonna say max limit
or username full name are 25 characters
and then otherwise I'm going to proceed
to check my password length now I've
decided to do this check password length
because I want a specific check for this
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to say if
my string length of my password is
bigger than 25 okay or the string length
of my in fact know what we're gonna do
let's get rid of this get rid of your
house the first check I'm gonna do so
I'm going to delete all this again it
doesn't my do my passwords match so I'm
just gonna say if password equals equals
repeat password
then continue with a big block of code
otherwise echo out to the user
your passwords do not match okay
and that's basically that now inside
here we can continue checking with our
character link
so check char length of username and
full-name and that is going to be if
like we said before if username is
bigger than 25 or if rather the string
length using this function of the
username is bigger than 25 or the string
length of full-name is bigger than 25
then we're gonna say echo the length of
username or full-name is too long just
keep it simple
and then otherwise we're going to say
check password and here I'm going to
specify I want to say if now remember
our passwords match now so we only need
to check this on one of the pot on one
of the possible variables I'm going to
say if the string length of password is
bigger than 25 or the string length of
our password is smaller than 6
characters then we're going to echo out
an error saying password must be between
6 and 25 carrot test now I'm running
really short so I'll join you in the
next stop T in the next tutorial ok
thanks for watching and I will continue
with this off in fact I've got a tiny
bit of time actually sorry otherwise
we're gonna say register there user and
our code will go here too
so I'll test this out in the next
tutorial and then we'll get working with
registering the user so this is
basically checking for a minimum maximum
limit on our password and this block of
code here is going to be a magical
register the user piece of code okay
join me in the next part I'll see you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
