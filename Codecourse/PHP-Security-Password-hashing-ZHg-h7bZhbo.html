today a lot of people use the md5
function in PHP to hash a password that
they were storing in a database what
they would then do is hash the value a
user gave and they would compare it to
that value in the database in order to
authenticate them so from a password
checking point of view that would always
work it would be fine it would actually
lock the user in however the problem
arises is if anyone got access to your
database so we're not actually going to
be working with a database in this video
but I'm going to demonstrate cracking an
md5 hash password so let's take a look
at the traditional approach first of all
so we would use the md5 function and
whatever password the user gave when
they registered we would add that in
here so for example I love cats 33 you
might think this is a fairly secure
password you've got a number in there
you could add some extra characters in
here too and that would produce the
following hash so when a user re-enter
that password we would hatch it it would
equal this value and we can check it now
let's head over to a website like crack
station there are loads of password
crackers kind of online password
crackers and I'm going to go and paste
this in here and I'm going to just fill
this out and women crack that and you
can see here that what that's actually
done is it's given us our original
password it's look this up in a
dictionary and it has fully matched that
password so if a user or an attacker
were to ever get access to your database
they could potentially find out a user's
actual password and that doesn't only
affect your site they could use that
password elsewhere as well for example
on their email account and therefore an
attacker may have access to their other
services as well so it's extremely
problematic if someone did access your
database they access your database in
the add a secure hash it wouldn't matter
as much so what we'll be looking at now
is the proper way to generate and verify
passwords within PHP so we're going to
be looking at the PHP password hashing
API and this is available as of PHP 5.5
so if you're not up-to-date with your
PHP version either locally on or on your
hosts you should definitely do something
about this so you can use this if you
are authenticating users so let's take a
look at using the password hashing API
and we're going to look specifically
first actually hashing a password and
we'll look at verifying one in a moment
so I'm just going to echo out the result
of this but ideally what you do is you'd
pass the plaintext string into this
function so in your database you can
verify it later on so we're going to use
the password hash function we're going
to pass a password into here so for
example I love cats 33 let's take a look
at the PHP manual and see what other
options we can pass in here which have
their arguments so the next is an
algorithm so we can either use password
default or password bcrypt now password
default is a constant which may change
so what we're going to do is we're going
to store this as 2 5 5 characters now
database or more doesn't really matter
but this would allow for any longer
passwords as you update your PHP version
or any longer hashes to be you know not
truncated if you have to smaller column
value so let's put that constant in
there and lastly and kind of
interestingly we have this options array
so within the options array we can
provide a salt but as a warning here
that's been deprecated as a PHP 7 and a
cost which is what we're interested in
just now so the cost is the basically
the processing cost of actually
generating our hash so we can say well
we want it to be 10 we want it to be 20
if we know that I'm going to slow things
down too much but basically the higher
the value the less likely this is to be
brute forced in any way or cracked in
any way so I'm just going to choose 12
for now you will see a slight delay on
the page but I'll let you tweak this to
whatever sensible for you
and let's go ahead and refresh now and
see the difference so you can see that
this is slightly longer and they're
actually separate components to this and
we can see this over on this image just
here so we have the algorithm that's
being used we have the algorithm options
in this case it's the cost you can see
that just here so this is the algorithm
used this is the cost we've set that to
12 we also have a salt and hash password
so there's no need to salt these
insulting is the process of adding on
additional data which makes it harder to
do a dictionary lookup either way now we
have a much more securely hashed
password which we can then store in our
database so this is the value that you
would go ahead and store for a user when
they registered an account now what do
we do about actually checking if a
password matches now I'm going to copy
this and I'm going to paste it into my
text editor and I'm going to assume that
this value came from my database we're
not going to hook everything up to
actually authenticate a user but this is
a stored value in a database so let's
say the user provides the password
Katz's we know that this hash is I love
cats 33 but the user or the submitted
password let's call this is just cats
obviously this doesn't match
so one you're registering a user we
generate this hash which is stored but
now what about when we actually sign a
user in well in this case what we need
to do is use the password verify
function we pass in the actual password
that the user is given and we supply a
hash so let's go ahead and check this
out then in this case what I'm going to
do is I'm going to do a var dump on
result and result it's going to be
password verify remember we type in the
user submitted password and we type in
the hash so this is the value that would
come from the form when the user wants
to log in and this is the value in the
database how
you're pulling that out and by via
dumping this will either get a true or a
false value you can see here we get a
false value obviously because cats here
doesn't match I love cats 33 so I'm
going to say I love cats 33 go ahead and
refresh you can see here we get true so
once you pull down the user's password
from the database assuming you'd match
them via the username or their email you
would already have this stored and you
can just do a quick comparison on these
and it's a lot more secure than coming
up with any kind of way to hash your
password yourself is so easy to use
you've just got two functions that you
need to remember password hash and
password verify and that is pretty much
it PHP have made it really easy with
this password hashing API to allow you
to generate a hash and then verify a
hash that's coming from a database in
this way obviously if your database was
broken into these values are much much
much harder to crack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
