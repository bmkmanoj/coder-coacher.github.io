you are going to need a couple of things
the first thing is a local webserver and
the second thing is PHP installed and
enabled on that webserver now you can do
this manually and I'd encourage you at
some point or another to go ahead and do
this just so you know how to set things
up but luckily for us and particularly
if we are using a Mac and using OSX we
have a very very simple solution a very
easy solution to go ahead and do this
all for us and this is a piece of
software called map
now what this software will do is once
you've downloaded and installed it it
will install Apache it will install PHP
which are the two things that we're
going to be using throughout this series
and what it will also do is install
MySQL now we're not going to be using
MySQL but later on if you wanted to
follow other courses on code course then
you have this available and ready to go
okay so to get started then the first
thing you want to do is download and
install MAMP
and once you've done that you'll find
that you'll be able to pull up this
window just here so what's happening
here is this way this is where we're
going to control everything so we can
start our server we can stop our server
we can change around our preferences and
we're going to be taking a little look
around this and then in the next part
we're going to be creating our first
file and we're going to talk about text
editors and how we actually go ahead and
write code and save the files out so in
its normal state
nothing will be started so our Apache
server which is our web server is not
started and MySQL isn't started so let's
click start servers and all you need to
do is wait for this to finish and once
it is finished we'll take a look at
where our files are coming from so that
has started if you have a new
installation of this you may find that
something will open in your browser but
we can manually do this just from here
just so we can see where our files are
served from so let's click this and you
can see here we get a MAMP welcome page
now we're going to ignore this because
we're going to be accessing all of our
files or at least our web server from
localhost
and then port 8 8 8 8 so it's localhost
colon and then 4 8 now at the moment
we've landed on this and you can see
index of slash that basically means we
don't have any files in our web
directory so what we're going to do is
come back over to our little mount
control panel we're going to head over
to preferences and under this web server
tab just make sure you're under here you
can see here we have a choice between
Apache and nginx so just a kind of diver
nginx is a different web server there's
not really much difference in the way
that you're going to use them but I
would recommend just starting out with
Apache and you can always explore nginx
later on if you want to so the document
root here is really important this is
where our files are going to be stored
so we're going to be creating PHP files
inside of our document root and then
when we access this server in the
browser it will load our files from this
document root so at the moment or at
least when you install this it should be
something like the following so it
should be on your hard drive inside of
applications inside of mam and then
inside of htdocs so let's go ahead and
open this up and you can see at the
moment we do not have any files within
here so what we're going to be doing in
the next part there now that we have
this set up and we can access this in
our browser we're going to be talking
about a text editor because we're going
to need to download and install a text
editor and we're also going to be
creating our first couple of PHP files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
