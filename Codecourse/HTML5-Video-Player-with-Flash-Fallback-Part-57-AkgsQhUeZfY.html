done so far is get a video convert it
into the three formats that we like to
want to use got that all playing within
this video element here to find a few
sort of parameters tags if you like in
here and also taking a more in-depth
look at the other tags that you can use
so you can find all of that in the
previous videos what we're gonna be
doing now is just adding a little bit of
JavaScript into the HTML which we're
going to be able to use - what if I
certain things and in this example I'm
just going to be modifying the size of
the video so what we're gonna what we've
done so far is we have this this is a
root directory here with our index page
that we're working with we have a folder
called GS and in that we have this file
called JavaScript it's JavaScript dot J
s so we're gonna want to call that in so
underneath the video tags that will do
if we just type in a script SRC equals
and then slush scripts I'll just close
that off the source is J s which is the
folder j s and then javascript is spell
that right that looks right to me and we
can now begin modifying this or putting
code in for that so I'll just save that
so in here what we're gonna want to do
is to create a variable which will sort
of get the element video by its ID in
this case the ID is also video and we
can use that variable than to play with
you know the different things that we
want to play with so just to sort of
show you I could available such a far
and I'll just call it my video equals
then we want to say document dot get
element by ID and just to explain it's
very important that you get these
capsules in the right place the not so
much for the variable here because which
I could've able is but document don't
gets that's all in lower clay lower case
element and the e is capitalized by and
the B is capitalized there an ID and the
AI is capitalized there javascript is
very fussy with things like that
you wanna open up your brackets and
we'll use a semicolon to close that off
and the element that we're getting is
video so just to understand that we're
getting the element by the ID so we're
guessing this element but the the method
of doing that is by it's going to be
looking for an ID called video so it's
not looking for this here it's looking
for this sort of text inside this ID
parameter and now we can start playing
with the java scripts or adding some in
so what we're gonna do is going to
create a function and I'm gonna call
this big brackets you'll you'll want in
there and then you're gonna want your
curly brackets as well and we're not
calling anything in here but because
it's a function you need to put that in
and then we're just going to say my
video so in reference to this variable
so it's getting the element by the ID
video that's available there called my
video so my video dots widths equals and
event this big so the max file sets all
my file size the max width of the video
is 854 because that's what we downloaded
so I'm just going to choose that for the
big part of it so 854 and then you will
need u semicolon to close that off
simple as that another function called
small and again exactly same my video
dot width equals we'll say
320 no choose whatever value you want
and then finally
function normal will call this and it's
give me my video
doc width and the normal I believe was
420 so I'll just save that now just
double check that that looks all right
and I think four times original faster
well file size again the original width
is 420 so that's good now this won't do
anything because we need to call these
functions which will then sort of bring
everything else into play so to call the
functions we're just gonna put in three
buttons so it looks like this so it's
just button and then slash button I'm
going to want to do that three more
times because we've got three functions
button okay and inside this whatever you
want so I'm gonna go for big small and
normal so this is going to create three
bonds a bit like submit buttons with the
text big smaller normal in sort of three
separate ones which it does there now I
I'm gonna put a break in here just sort
of separate or put the video on a
different line if you like now again
we've got the buttons but they don't do
anything enough because we still yet
haven't called the functions that we
want to use so if I go on button and
then type in in here on click equals you
to quotation marks and the function
which is big there's big button here so
inside the the button that's the first
sort of button angle brackets unclick
equals and then big and then your
brackets and that will call the function
big one more or two more actually so
again on click and this is the small be
called that small
one more time unclick equals and then
we're gonna call the function normal
there we go
so if I save that fingers-crossed when i
refresh this and press big the video
gets bigger small smaller and then
normal here and as you can see we've
only actually defined the width here so
that's the only thing that we're
modifying so my video dot width equals
320 we haven't said anything about the
height and I did sort of touch on this
in a previous video that videos are
proportional so you don't need to
specify the height and the width it will
modify itself to size automatically so
that's not something that you need to
worry about so fantastic Whitney there
so I think in the next video we're gonna
be taking a look at flush and when I say
flush I literally mean Adobe Flash that
the big products and what we're going to
be doing is creating a fallback and I'll
talk more in depth about that and why
the hell I'm deciding to use flash but
as I said in terms of a process called
grace will get degradation putting flush
in there is what I call a fallback so
but anyway I'll leave you guys with this
and I will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
