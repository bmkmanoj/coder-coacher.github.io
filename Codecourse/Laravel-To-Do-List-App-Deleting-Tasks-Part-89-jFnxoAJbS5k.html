series we have a login page we display
the tasks to a user we allow a user to
Marcus done or on them we also have a
page to create a new task now what we
need to do is allow our users to delete
the task after a while a usual have tons
of tasks this page will reach four and
obviously he's not going to want this to
be cluttered so he's going to want to
delete some tasks so we're going to
allow him to do that it's only fair so
let's add some sort of link here or add
a little cross next to the names so just
in brackets would say across and we'll
also encase this in small tag perfect
and we're going to make this a link just
a dummy link now perfect so when the
user clicks this the task will be
deleted so let's create some routes for
this route get delete array as the link
uses home controller and get the meat
now we're not going to bother creating a
form for this we could but I'd rather
show you something that I think is very
cool we're going to add a URL parameter
here we're going to say task
inside here we're going to say URL route
what did you call it
delete and the second parameter will be
this our second parameter we're going to
pass the task ID so item ID so let's
just check perfect if you look in the
lower hand corner you'll see the URL for
/ delete /the ID which in this case is
five we have three to one
so let's go to our controller from
controller and we'll create those
methods of that to method public
function get delete and we also need to
pass in this parameter here so we'll say
task so what we're going to do now is
we're just going to echo out task just
to make sure that everything works so
delete perfect now this is where things
get cool we can either say here task
equals task find task if not task then
display some sort of error message or we
can go to our routes file and we can add
a route model bind so route bind task
function we're going to have a closure
here which takes two parameters value
and route and here we're going to return
an object specifically an instance of
this so we're going to return item where
value equal sorry where ID equals value
and we're going to return the first one
that we find so now instead of returning
a string or an integer will actually be
going to return an instance of this
which I think it's awesome so let's just
check will say echo get class task will
say delete and as you can see we have
item which is awesome and just to get
into the habit of type hinting we'll add
that so this is just literally going to
be two lines of code we're going to say
task delete and we're going to return
the user back to the home page so let's
go back to meet
and we get an error task what's wrong
with this
oh we named our model item so let's go
back try again perfect if we go back to
our database refresh it's no longer
there refresh
no longer that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
