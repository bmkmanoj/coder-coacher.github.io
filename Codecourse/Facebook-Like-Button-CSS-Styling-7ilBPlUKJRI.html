Facebook style like button which we can
see here if I just zoom in and there's
quite a few elements to this so if
you're new to CSS or you're new to more
advanced or css3 features we're gonna go
ahead and look at a few things here
we've got gradients and we're going to
be using AB radiant generator for this
just to make our life a little bit
easier we're gonna have a little bit of
order radius here and we obviously have
the text here a little bit of shadow so
no image is used or anything like that
we're just gonna you know focus on pure
CSS here so we'll be building this up
from scratch you can use your own color
scheme so I'll show you how we're
generating the gradients you can just
use your own colors here we've also got
this all hover effect as well while
maintaining the gradient so let's go
ahead and build this up from scratch
okay so the only thing that we're
starting with here is just a basic
document layout and you can see that
I've linked in this main CSS stylesheet
so we'll start with the markup for this
this is gonna be an anchor because
presumably you're going to want someone
to be able to click it so let's create
just an anchor element here where we've
got an href attribute which I'm just
gonna set to a hash for now so don't
really want it to link anywhere for the
purpose of this tutorial and we're gonna
give it a class so we can target the
styling so I'm just gonna call this like
- button so that's pretty much all we
need to do the only thing left is just
to fill this in now it's important that
we do this because if for example the
stars can't be rendered we still want
this to look like a normal link like so
we don't want to do anything like with
CSS or JavaScript and inject this in or
add any additional markup it just
doesn't make sense
so I'm just gonna enter the text in
there and it just is pretty much like a
normal link so like I said if the stars
can't be rendered you still have a
perfectly valid link so what we're gonna
quickly do is just set the font family
on the body I'm just gonna set this to
Arial for the sake of the tutorial but
you're probably using a better fun on
your site depending on how you're doing
that so let's go ahead and target this
like button now the first thing I'm
gonna do is I'm actually going to set
the
ground gradient for this just so he can
so see where we stand then we'll add the
padding and change the font size now the
color of the text and things like that
but the first thing we need to do is
effectively just generate a grade in
here I'm using a colorless gradient
editor which basically will give you the
CSS for pretty much support for lots and
lots of browsers and then it will give
you a older browser fallback where you
just get the background color so that's
really important because otherwise say
you had some white text and these
gradients couldn't be generated you know
your users may not see him if it's on a
white background so I'm over on the
developers section on Facebook and I'm
basically gonna just steal the color
palette from here probably not a good
idea if you're using this for something
that's going live but for the sake of
this tutorial I'm just gonna choose the
colors from this button now to do that I
am going into in so I'm going into
developer tools by inspecting this
particular element and you can see that
here we have the actual code for the
gradient and we're not gonna steal this
code what we're gonna do is just steal
the colors so you can see here we've got
a WebKit linear gradient this is
basically the starting color and this is
basically the ending color here so we
can take these and we can copy them so
I'm copying the first one and then
inside of our gradient editor here I'm
gonna choose a gradient that just has a
one-point to an end point so we click on
this one and we can choose the color be
born here so let's just get rid of this
and paste that in so that's our first
color and then for the end we already
know that it's this one so we grab this
and we go over to here and we basically
just paste this in here and there we go
so that now is the preview for our
gradient we want it vertical and we're
going to hit this handy copy button
that's going to copy all of that to the
clipboard you don't have to include all
of this to be honest and it good idea to
go ahead and look at what you do need in
this case we're basically supporting
vendor prefixes for all browsers and
then we've got an IE
support here using a filter
and then like I said before we've got a
fallback for older browsers which is
basically the start color so for example
all of this didn't work you would still
be left with a valid piece of CSS that
set the background for older browsers so
let's take a look at this in the browser
and see what it looks like cool so it's
looking okay but obviously we can do
better here so what we need to do is up
here I'm just going to set some basic
styles the first thing one do is set a
display of inline block and that's
because I want to add things like
padding to it but I want this to sit in
line with other elements on the page
let's go ahead and change the color of
this as well just so we can see it a
little bit better and now let's add some
padding just so we pad that out and the
text isn't sitting exactly against the
edge of the container now for padding we
have a north east south and west values
what I'm gonna do though is I'm going to
use the shorthand and I'm gonna say I
want the five pixel padding on the top
and the bottom of the element and I want
eight pixel on the left and the right
this is basically what this means so
five pixels on the left and right I
think sorry on the top and bottom and
eight pixels on the left and right and
that gives us the following so it's
already looking a little bit nicer a
little bit better so we want to get rid
of that underline because we don't
really want the underline it sort of
looks like a button or at least it will
by the end of the tutorial
so we want to say text decoration and we
want to set that to none okay so now
let's change the font size so we'll do
point 8m and that just reduces that font
size down a little bit so it's already
looking pretty cool so I'm gonna zoom in
just so we can do the shadow and the
border radius and just make sure we get
this looking how we need it's good idea
to zoom in when you're doing things like
this so let's quickly set the border
radius this is really really simple and
nowadays doesn't really require a vendor
prefix and if this obviously isn't
supported it will just fall back to a
square and that doesn't really matter to
be honest as long as it's functional so
the next thing we need to focus on is
the text shadow so if we head over to
the like button on Facebook and I just
zoom in a little bit on there if we just
zoom in a little bit on here you can see
if I just scrolled down and pull this
down that we have
a shadow that sort of just it's its
position is just up a little bit it
doesn't come out words or anything like
that so we're gonna emulate that down
here so we say text shadow this is
really really simple we have an x and y
offset so in this case the x offset is
going to be 0 remember it just sits go
back to it just sits a zero on there and
the y offset we want that to go up a
little bit so we can say minus one pixel
the spread is how this spreads out blurs
out and we're gonna set that to zero X
we want that to be quite a harsh line
and then we're gonna use the RGB a
function to basically set this color to
black but then for the last one is the
Alpha Channel we're gonna set that to
point two so you basically have a black
shadow but then we have it at point two
so it's sort of not full not fully black
if we didn't have that um perhaps we
just used the RGB function we get the
following so it doesn't look as good I
mean you could have it like this of
course but we want it to look like an
actual shadow like that so now that
we've got that we've pretty much created
the bus and it looks pretty good you
could add a little graphic there if you
wanted to but I'm not going to do that
now the last step is to actually add the
when we hover over the button we can see
that on face but when I hover over this
it goes a little bit lighter that the
gradient sort of maintained it goes a
little bit lighter so we're gonna use
some the developer tools just to
basically if we just zoom out a little
bit on here just to basically when you
inspect this element we're gonna go up
to this part here which is where the
gradient is set and I'm going to toggle
if I click on this just here we click
hover and that's hoggle that hover state
you can see that now this has the
lighter color and we can actually grab
the colors from this as well so for the
linear gradient we have this so we're
gonna go back to our gradient generator
and I'm gonna set the initial color to
that one I've just grabbed from there's
it's a little bit lighter and then we
have this one here so we can go ahead
and just add this one on here as the
ending and there we go we've done
exactly the same thing but for the hover
state on that element
of course probably besties your own
color palette for this so now we want to
say well like button on hover so you use
the hover pseudo-element
we're just going to paste that in so all
of the other properties here will remain
so for example all of these will stay
the same all we're basically overwriting
or changing are these colors here so now
when we hover over we get that light and
effect so there we are we've built a
Facebook style like button with CSS
really really straightforward and we'll
fall back and look fine on older
browsers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
