notation and it's a lightweight data
interchange format
now to understand JSON is probably a
good idea to look at javascript objects
first so we'll quickly have a look at an
example and then start to dive more into
what JSON is and what it's capable of
and why you should use it so let's take
a look at the example of a a object so
I'm going to create a variable and I'm
going to call it object or just odd
and I'm going to set this to a pair of
curly brackets now this code we use to
define an object in JavaScript and this
is called an object literal what we can
then do is go ahead and extend it to
contain properties which can hold values
like strings numbers arrays and other
objects so I'm going to go ahead and
modify this and I'm going to create a
people property this is going to be an
array using an array literal and within
this this is going to store lots of
different objects so in this case I'm
going to say name Alex and I'm going to
say online true so I've stored a string
and a boolean value here so go ahead
down here and create another object and
I'll say name in this time Billy
and then I'll say online and this time
I'll say false so I've now stored an
object with a people property with an
array with objects inside of that array
obviously comma separated for each array
value so we can pass data around in the
structure like this JSON to ensure that
the data we're passing around is as
lightweight and file size as possible
and also the fact that JSON resembles
JavaScript syntax it means it's easier
to work with in JavaScript based
applications so it can also be used in
non JavaScript applications so for
example you could output some JSON with
PHP on the server side and then read it
in on the client side with JavaScript
let's actually take a look at placing
this object into a JSON file that we
might see expect to be returned from a
server so we're basically going to look
at turning this object into into valid
JSON maintaining the same structure so
let's go ahead and open people dot JSON
and start to write this out so I'm going
to start with some curly braces and I'm
going to go ahead and I'm going to
create this people property notice that
this time it is in quotes so I'm now
going to go ahead and assign an array to
this and I'm going to do exactly the
same thing as we did within our
JavaScript code I'm going to add two
arrays named Alex again we use the
property name with quotes and online
true now we don't need to use quotes
with this because that data type is
supported in JSON I'm going to create
another pair of brackets and I'm going
to say name Billy and again online but
this time it will be a false value so
you can see it looks pretty much the
same except we don't declare a variable
we don't need to end the file with a
semicolon we also need to have the
property names as a string as I've
already mentioned so we've saved this as
people dot JSON with a JSON extension
and the reason we don't declare a
variable here is because when we read
this file in with JavaScript and we'll
be looking at doing that Ajax in listen
later the variable represented the
loading in file so however we loaded in
represents the entire object so if we go
ahead and load a file in this file in
using Ajax and call the data that's been
returned data we could access people via
data people and then subsequently the
properties in each of these objects so
what we're now going to do is go on to
look at what valid JSON is and how to
determine valid JSON</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
