some CSS buttons and we're going to be
creating a base style so you can style
up either an anchor so this first button
here is an anchor or just a normal link
and this one is a submit button for a
form so an input with the type of submit
what we're then going to be doing is
adding additional classes that allow us
to control things like the color so this
is a success submit button so you can
change the color to green or you can
have some kind of error submit button
there's red maybe anything like that and
then finally we're going to be adding
some different size classes as well so
these four just here are standard size
they're just the default size then we
have a medium here and then we have a
large so these are going to be perfect
you can go ahead and just play around
with them and just basically tidy them
up and create your own styles within
these but this should give you a pretty
good base to having a full button set on
your website so I'm going to jump
straight into the code start writing the
mark up and then styling these up and
then finally adding these hooks on to
allow us to control the color and the
size so we're starting out with just a
basic document I have a style sheet just
linked in here it called app dot CSS
currently nothing in it I'm gonna start
to write out the markup for first of all
the link and then the input so let's go
ahead and create an anchor this is gonna
have a hey Trish H ref of hash because
we're not adding any link in here and
we're gonna give this a class of button
and inside of here we'll enter submit as
the text so that's what a standard
anchor looks like pretty ugly and then
we're gonna have an input with the type
of submit so an input element and we'll
enter the value there is submit so again
when we refresh we just see a standard
submit button nothing like each other
and again pretty ugly so this will also
work with button elements so if you are
using them within your forms that's
absolutely fine as well let's just add
the class of button to this as well and
we'll go ahead and start to write out
the base styles but before we do that we
want to just change the font on our page
just so we have something
nicer to work with and this is going to
vary for you so the font on your page
will be slightly different obviously you
can just fiddle around with this and
just update these buttons once you have
created them just to work with the
current styles you already have so we're
gonna have a fun of 1m so that's how
base font style and I'm gonna choose
hell vesica as the font and what our
sans-serif fallback
so already we'll see an improvement we
have a nice new font and we're going to
create the base style for the button now
so we're going to have a button class
which is essentially going to control
things like the order the font size the
padding the text decoration so removing
the underlining on the link and just
generally things like that just to tidy
them up and make them look the same as
each other go through anchors and inputs
so we'll start with a base background
color we'll just see how this affects
the elements as we go along and I'm
going to choose e0 e0 e0 for this it's
just a gray color so let's refresh and
you can see this has already started to
affect these elements but they still
look a bit odd so let's go ahead and
tidy this up a little bit further so the
next thing I'm going to do is set the
border to zero and we'll see that this
gets rid of the border on the input
which is brilliant so the next thing I'm
just going to change the default color
to 333 so like a dark gray color so they
both match now and I'm going to also set
the font size to 1m that's the base 1
size for our buttons so you can see
that's actually changed how the button
sits let's just comment this out quickly
we'll take a look at how that changed
again you can see that changes because
the default input is isn't inheriting
from the body so we have to define this
explicitly okay so next is the padding
we're going to give the area around both
the anchor and the input a little bit of
space so I'm going to use 8 pixels for
the top and the bottom
12 pixels for the left and the right and
we'll see that that makes them look a
little bit nicer so we want to get rid
of this underline on the subnet and then
we'll fix the fact that these don't
quite line up you can see that this one
is slightly bigger and this is obviously
a little bit further down so it looks a
bit odd so let's get rid of that text
decoration that's pretty straightforward
it's just text-decoration:none that will
just get rid of the underline on the on
there so again they look pretty similar
now and we want to set vertical align to
middle now that might seem a little bit
of a strange property to do this if you
watch very carefully you'll see these
now line up so looking a little bit
nicer okay so the next thing to do then
is changing the cursor to a pointer I'm
not going to save this out we'll just
check out what happens now so on an
input we can still click this but we're
not actually seeing a pointer like we'd
see on an anchor so it's a little bit
confusing you'll see you don't have to
add this but let's save this out refresh
and now we see a pointer on both of them
so it's just adding a little bit more
consistency so now I want to give these
a border radius that we'll just round
out the orders of this or the corners of
this for us so you can see they're a
little bit rounder now and obviously
from here you can just go ahead and
update these just to work exactly as you
want as your base styles and what we're
now going to focus on is changing the
color of the button so I'm going to copy
these I'm going to paste them just down
here I'm going to add another class on
called success so this can be called
anything you want just whatever makes
sense to you but we can tie this in in
our style sheet by saying button and
then attaching this select on here so we
have a button success selector all this
means is that a class of button that
also has the class of success now all we
need to do because we have our base
styles we don't need to duplicate
anything because this will inherit the
styles from here so what we can do now
is change the background
we can change the color we can do
anything else we want we're going to
keep this really simple so I'm going to
change the background color to a nice
green so this is 8 8 C 4 to 5 and we can
see here that they then change and why
don't we going update the foreground
color as well just to make that pop a
little bit better like that so we've now
got these sort of hooks if you like to
change the color and of course what you
can do is duplicate these down you cut
an error and you could change this to a
red color and do whatever you want here
so you can control that it's entirely
flexible now so now that we've got our
success buttons and our sort of standard
buttons we're gonna go ahead and focus
on sizing so again this is pretty
straightforward all we need to do is add
hooks in so I'm going to copy these
again just to demonstrate them side by
side I'm gonna say we want this to be a
medium button or both of these to be a
medium button so obviously at the moment
they look exactly the same we can go
ahead and add another hook as we did
with the success so we can say button
medium and now we can start to change
the font size and the padding anything
else we want to do so here I'm just
gonna say I want the font size to be 1.1
m and I want the padding to be 2 pixels
larger on the top bottom left and right
so remember the base padding on the top
and bottom is 8 8 pixels so we're gonna
say 10 and on the left and the right is
12 pixels so we're gonna say 14 pixels
so now that would have increased the
size of them just enough to make it a
bit of a difference and why don't we go
and just duplicate this again pull this
down here let's get rid of the success
this time actually just so we can see
using these in different ways so we're
gonna say button large so this is just
gonna be our standard color but we're
gonna make it a large button so we're
gonna say button large and again we're
going to just going to update the font
size so we're going to say font size 1.2
m/s I'm gonna set the padding again to 2
pixels larger than the medium so it's 12
pixels on the top and bottom and 16
pixels on the left and the right
there we have our larger buttons next to
each other so this is like I said far
from perfect you can go ahead and play
around with these styles but this is a
great way to start if you want some kind
of consistent button theme and just by
adding these hooks on it makes it a lot
easier when you're developing you know
exactly what the class names are and you
can just go ahead and use these across
your project so that's it we've built
some CSS buttons including hooks for
colors sizes you can go and hit ahead
and add to this as you want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
