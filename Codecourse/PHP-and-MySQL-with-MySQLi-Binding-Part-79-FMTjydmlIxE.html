a look at actually binding values to
prepared statements and then we're going
to execute these statements and then
output a list of names for example so in
this example what we're going to be
doing is allowing from the URL to define
a last name and what this is going to do
is it's going to return all of the
records in a database where we match a
last name but instead of escaping we're
going to bind this bind this to the
prepared statement now what basically
what we'll be doing is performing a
query not performing a query but
preparing a query or an SQL statement
putting placeholders where we want data
to be bound and then when we get the
result back we're going to bind the
result field to variables which we can
then output in PHP so see how this kind
of flows and for larger queries and and
depending on how you want functionality
to work particularly binding lots of
different variables to a query this is a
lot cleaner if you have lots of binds
that you need to take place but we'll
run through the example in this case
we'll just be selecting and returning a
result set you can do this for inserting
it's exactly the same thing so let's go
ahead and first of all check if we have
this variable set this get array value
which is last name so if that is set
we're going to create a variable called
last name and this is going to be get
last name and we're just going to trim
this value so remove whitespace from the
left and right hand side now what we're
not going to be doing is performing the
the real escape string method on this
string there's no need because when we
bind values we're also massively
protecting against SQL injection II
anyway so we don't actually need to
perform that for each variable which is
again a benefit of binding we don't need
to worry about that so what we're going
to do now is we're going to create a
prepared statement and I'm just going to
call this people
so that's going to equal DB preparer
instead of DB query now the difference
here is that when we prepare a statement
we don't actually execute it until we
use the execute method so in this case
what do I want to do well I want to
select and I'm going to choose a
specific field set because when it comes
to binding results you'll see that we
have to bind each field and that we need
so I'm just going to choose that I want
the first name and the last name and on
that from the people table and then I
want where last name equals question
mark now that might look a little odd
you might be thinking why are we using a
question mark there basically what we're
doing is we're now going to bind the
values that we need an assignment well
use their data type to tell this prepare
statement what kind of data type we want
and what what value we want to bind to
these question marks so what we now do
is we say people bind / am we define the
data type s is string and we then define
the actual value which is last name so
what's happened now is we've prepared a
statement we've by we bound a parameter
on to this statement and what we now
need to do is go ahead and execute that
statement so we now say people execute
okay so what's going to happen now well
actually nothing much if we go ahead and
say print R on people will notice that
we don't get too much back here what we
do but it's a load of rubbish so we've
got affected rows - 1 num rows 0 so
we're not really getting any useful
information back in fact we're not
actually retrieving anything at all
we've executed the statement but we now
need to bind the fields that we want to
select the variables that we can make
use of so what we do is we say people
bind value
and we say first-name lastname now you
can call these whatever you want it
doesn't make a difference but what's
happened now is is we've bound the
values of the data that's been returned
in correspondence to the position that
they're in so first name this will be
here we could call this like I'm not one
because it's an invalid variable name
but we could call this one and two if we
wanted just makes a lot more sense to
write first-name and lastname now what
happens if we echo out
first-name well let's give this a test
and see what we get back oh I think I
get bind values okay and turn error
reporting off oh so it bind result there
we go okay so we can actually bind
individual values as well we don't
necessarily need to bind just results
but in this case in this case well now
you notice that nothing was actually
output and that's because we haven't
fetched this so if we just perform a
statement here on this statement with a
fetch method we then get the the first
result back here we can do exactly the
same thing that we've seen before we can
say while while people fetch echo
first-name and then maybe put a break on
there in fact we can actually while
we're at it bind on the last name as
well so we should get two results back
and because we're in a while loop we get
the two results that we desire back if
we enter a name that doesn't exist in
the database we don't get any results
back of course we can do things like
checking result counts and stuff like
that but we'll with ignore that just for
now so now that we've returned or we've
prepared a statement with bound
parameters we've executed
we've bound the result back so that we
can loop through the fetch results and
output the first name and the last name
in this case what happens when we want
to bind multiple parameters well in this
case we're going to have to modify our
code slightly just so we can
you know change the for example the the
query string so we can provide a first
name and a last name so let's provide a
first name and a last name here and
let's also duplicate this so we say
first name so now what we want to do is
we want to say we could say where we
want the first name or the last name to
match so let's say with last name we
call something or first name equals
something okay so now what we've done is
we've we basically provided two question
marks which means we need we need we
absolutely must bind two values now if
for example actually let's make this a
little more interesting let's change
this to ID and we'll say where or ID
equals question mark and the reason
being is that will bind an integer and a
string rather than just a string value
so let's just back up a little bit and
look at what what we have going on here
so we can say gavotte here and this
isn't in a run because we'll we'll have
performed an error because we have two
values that we need to bind we're only
providing one string value what we want
is we want ID equals 1 or something like
that see we get this error here or we
want to say
ID equals 2 or something like that so
let's go ahead and modify this so bind
parameter string now you might think
that you'd have to do something like
this when in actual fact what we can do
is we can just say s I know comma
separation or anything like that and
then we can provide an additional
variable that we want to bind so now
what we binding is we're binding a
string and an integer this being the
string this being the integer at these
positions and then we are executing this
we're binding the results that we
require we're fetching the results and
we're echoing them out so what we can do
now is when we refresh we see that we
have Billy Garrett and Alex Garrett
output and if I choose ID of 1 in fact
the query doesn't make too
sense there we go so in this case here
we go so an ID of two and the last name
of Garrett will output this Billy
Garrett record and an ID of three and
the last name of Garrett will output
Alex Garrett so it really it depends on
sort of how you structure your query it
doesn't really make sense sense to go
too much into this because different
applications will have different queries
depending on the data but basically
we've looked at binding a single
parameter we've looked at binding
multiple parameters executing that
binding the results back and looping
through the result set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
