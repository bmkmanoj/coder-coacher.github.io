welcome to this tutorial on creating a
back to top link that's going to float
at the top of your page now this might
not be familiar to you but I've seen it
on a few sites and I thought I'd
recreate this as a plug-in so we're
actually going to be creating a jquery
plugin as opposed to just some
javascript jquery code now if you don't
know what this back to top link involves
it involves a floating back to the top
link as you scroll down the page now you
can see there's actually no content on
this page at the moment I've just set a
large page height to the page but you
can see we've got a significant amount
of scrolling area now what I'm going to
go ahead and do is scroll down and if
you keep an eye on this area just here
you'll see the back to top link appear
as a sort of square if if you like so as
I scroll down you can see that it fades
in then when I scroll back up again you
see it fades out and the purpose of this
is to give your users and a constantly
floating or fixed position link as they
scroll down the content in your site and
they can just click back to top and
you'll notice that when I click this
you'll see the scroll bar jump straight
back to the top which means we're back
at the top of the page and again that
will fade out now the clever thing about
this is we're going to be creating a
plug-in a jquery plugin and this means
that we can use this widget sort of
anywhere we want we just include the
source file and then we go ahead and you
know just activate the plug-in so if you
take a look at the at the code here you
can see that we use the plug-in just
sort of simply like this so we say back
to top which is our div here which we're
going to style as well so we're going to
be using a style sheet and we set the
position that we want this to appear so
I'm saying a thousand pixels from the
top of the document or when I've
scrolled a thousand pixels and then
we've got a speed in which the
the widget appears or the link appears
so really we could set this to say
something like a thousand and we could
set this to something like 500 and when
we view the preview of that you'll see
that it will appear significantly
quicker and also it will fade in and out
a lot of slower so we're going to give
this some sort of customizable options
as well so let's go ahead and take a
look at start styling this out and then
applying the plugin okay so we're
starting with our blank index 2.html
page we want to go ahead and create a
file called back to top jquery jas and
then we want to create a style.css file
now let's just go ahead and take a look
at the directory structure here you can
see they've got index dot PHP that's in
the root directory we've got two folders
j/s and CSS Jas is where we keep our
javascript file here and a CSS folder is
where we keep our styles this is just to
see it so keep everything organized it's
not necessary but that's just how we're
going to be working okay so let's just
get our document setup let's go ahead
and declare out doctype and we'll stop I
HTML and our HTML there and we'll go
ahead and start and end our head and
then our body ok so in head let's just
give this a short title we'll just call
it say to the top and then we want to
link in our star sheet so we say link
rel equals and we're going to have a
href as well this means we give this
stark street and href is going to be CSS
forward slash styles.css which is
essentially the source location of your
stylesheet now the bottom of body we
want to go ahead and include our scripts
so script source equals
stand up there so we want to go ahead
and include j/s forward slash back to
top dot to a query j s so this is sort
of standard notation for jquery plugin
now obviously as we are using jquery we
need to go ahead and include jquery
itself so let's go ahead and include
that if we just go over to our browser
and over to the jquery com homepage
click on download jquery and we'll copy
and paste this URL into our code so we
can paste that Nutter there ok so now
we've got everything set up we can start
styling things out we can start writing
JavaScript when we won but obviously we
need to create the mark-up for the back
to top and asset or widget away if you
want to call it so let's go in and
create a div and I'm going to give this
an ID of back to top now the reason I'm
using idea not classes because we assume
we're only going to use this once on the
page and we also you're just going to
create a div with no class or ID
attribute and we're just going to say
back to top so this is just going to be
the text within our main container so
let's go over to our browser and click
refresh you can see that we've just got
this at the moment now the first and
foremost important thing to do is start
to actually style this then position it
and then start to use jQuery on this as
well so what we're actually going to be
doing is we're going to be writing our
javascript in here so bear in mind that
we are including jquery including our
plugin then activating our plugin on the
page bear in mind that is probably best
to include another script sort of like
general jas that activates this plugin
for you but you can do it this way it
doesn't really matter well it does
because your browser will cache these
files rather than you know run them over
and over again but for the purpose of
this tutorial we're just going to do it
in the page ok so in side of styles.css
we want to go ahead and start styling
this out so the first thing we want to
do is make the body really long
because we want to mimic the sort of
scroll bar lots of content on the page
type thing so i'm going to say height
three thousand pixels so now when we go
into our browser and refresh you see
what we've got this scroll bar that we
can actually test it with obviously this
content at the moment is just staying
still on the page also going to go ahead
and set a fun family this is sort of
just for aesthetic reasons we don't
really need to do this and we're going
to go ahead and send the font size to 60
2.5% just to reset that so let's select
our back to top div so back to the top
we're using a hash because we are
selecting an ID we're going to go ahead
and star this up now now we are going to
include display none a bit later but
obviously we don't include that for now
because we want it to be shown while
we're styling it so position fixed this
is just going to fix it in a particular
position on the page now if you see I
press f5 to refresh you can see that
although i'm scrolling it's staying in
this position which is exactly what we
want because we want it to be visible to
the user at all times as they're
scrolling then we're going to set a with
to it so we're going to say 250 pixels
we're going to set the background to
black we're going to set a border radius
of 5 pixels this is obviously optional
it's just to start it out and also we're
going to set an appt acetate of nine
point six so nearly half or nearly fifty
percent opacity so it's about 60 well is
sixty percent opacity also going to set
the cursor to pointer and this is quite
a this is quite an important one I guess
because we're not actually using any a
links when we hover over our asset we
want the cursor to change to a pointer
without having to have an a tag in there
so I'm going to say cursor
winter and then when i refresh you can
see that as I hover over this it
automatically gives me this nice pointer
so that's something to watch out for
okay so that's it for that but now what
we're going to do is going up you're
going to say back to top div so we're
selecting the div within our back to top
element and we're going to say
text-align center obviously at the
moment is looking a bit odd that this is
what we're doing here with styling the
text within it we're going to set some
padding on this we're going to say 10
pixels north or the top nor pixels east
10 pixels south and north pixels west
we're going to set a font size here to
1.4 a.m. and then we're going to set a
color of white so we can actually see it
against this dark background so now if
you refresh you can see that we've got
this it's looking exactly how we want it
to look obviously it's not centered in
the page but we're going to be using
jquery to dynamically do that okay so
this is essentially all the styling that
we need to do so i'm going to go ahead
and close this and we're going to
actually start to write our plugin okay
so to write our plugin we are going to
need to first of all create the standard
notation to actually initialize the
jquery plugin or create sort of an
instance of a jquery plugin which we can
then apply this to so in the second part
of the tutorial we're actually going to
be looking at doing doing that and then
we're going to start fiddling around
with getting this asset here in the
middle of the page there are going to be
a few things that I won't include in
this tutorial that you can go ahead and
work out for yourself one of them is a
browser resizing issue if you were to
resize the browser while you're while
the you know while the back to top thing
is either in view or hidden but still on
the page when you resize your browser
you'll have some problems either way it
will go ahead and start writing the
plug-in and you can work
the problems out for yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
