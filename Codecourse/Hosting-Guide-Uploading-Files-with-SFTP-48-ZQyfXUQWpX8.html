server so we can go ahead and upload
files and what we're going to be doing
is replacing this in next or HTML file
with some files of our project so we can
then just view them via this IP address
now I have a very simple app or just an
example single line of code ready to go
and I have this within here so I can
just basically copy over this index dot
PHP file
obviously this might be a slightly
larger project so you can just copy over
all the files that you need so I'm going
to be using FileZilla for this which is
also available for Windows so if you are
on Windows you can just follow along as
normal this is using SFTP not standard
FTP so we're not going to be providing a
password it's pretty much exactly the
way we connected using our terminal but
just via our FTP client so the first
thing that we're going to want to do is
add our private key to FileZilla so we
can actually connect so what we want to
do is bring up FileZilla x' settings
area and under connection and ftp we
have this SFTP option so we can add our
prior our private key here so if we hit
add key file these are all of my keys so
wherever you've stored your public and
private key you can want to head over to
there we're going to choose our private
key remember the private key is the one
we used to connect the public keys the
one that's stored on the server so I'm
gonna select this and hit open and
FileZilla will want me to convert the
key file to a supported format so we
just follow this along and hit yes and
we just have to resave this so I'm going
to call this project underscore fz4
FileZilla
so hit save and that will go ahead and
add that to your keys so hit OK and now
we are going to enter our host now
username not our password we're not
using password authentication so what
we're gonna want to do is head over to
our control panel copy our IP address
here
and go ahead and paste this in with the
SFTP protocol in front of it so that's
it remember the username is root we use
that in our terminal earlier when we
connected and because we have our key
stored now we can just hit quick connect
and it's going to ask us to trust this
we can just hit OK and that will go
ahead and basically connect us so we can
now see that we're inside of our server
let me just pull this down just so it's
a little bit easier to see we can see
VAR we can see dub-dub-dub that we saw
earlier basically everything we were
doing in the command-line earlier and
there's our index dot HTML file so we
can go ahead and we can delete this we
can hit yes and when we have over here
we just see nothing so we now have
complete control over all the files in
our server so let's just copy over this
index dot PHP file to our server I'm
sure you know how to do this is pretty
straightforward we're just going to copy
this over that's gonna go ahead and
upload this you'll want to do this all
the fast that you're using and when i
refresh it says give us your name and I
can go ahead and provide my name here
and we see our working application so
that is how we FTP over obviously now
you have control over all of the files
within your server so you can use this
to go ahead and update configuration
maybe you need to change your Apache
configuration you need to change your
PHP configuration just remember that
when you do change your configuration
you're going to want to go ahead and
restart your server so make sure you use
the commands we looked at earlier but
that is pretty much it you can go ahead
and store this and you are now ready to
connect your server and upload files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
