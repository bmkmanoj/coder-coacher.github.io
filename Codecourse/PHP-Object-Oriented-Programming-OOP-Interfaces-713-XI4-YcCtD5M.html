looking at is implementations and
interfaces now I have a very simple
class here I shamelessly stole the idea
from laravel hopefully Taylor will mind
but I have a protected items right here
I have an ADD method so all we're doing
is adding a value to this array I have a
set method which and which just is the
same as ad but it allows us to specify a
key and then we have to JSON which
basically returns a JSON and encoded
version of this array so here I've
instantiated the class to create a new
object I've added foo and bar and I've
just echoed collection to Jason so if we
look at this in the browser you'll see
our JSON formatted array now what I want
to do is I want us to be able to call
echo count C and I want that to count
the items in this array and if we look
at this now we're going to get one
because because one object is equal to
one obviously so the way we do this is
we add up here similar to the extends
except we change this to implements and
we use countable which comes with PHP by
default and if we look at this now in
the browser and hit refresh we're going
to get this fatal error class collection
contains one abstract method amis
therefore be declared abstract or
implement the remaining methods
accountable count so here we're getting
this countable count a little hint so
it's telling us to implement this method
here so count so let's just implement
that now so public function count now if
we refresh we get 0 because we didn't
actually do anything with this so if we
just return something like 5 hit refresh
we get 5 so all we have to do now is
return the count this items because we
set two items and here we're going to
get to simple as that so now what I want
to do is I want to be able
to echo Jason and code collection and of
course we're going well we don't get an
error we get a JSON formatted collection
but we can change this to return the
items so we need to implement another
interface and we we do this by adding a
comma and then specifying a next
interface and another example of a PHP
interface is JSON serializable and i
spelled that wrong jason serializable
is that right I'm not sure let's see
yeah here we go so class collection
we're getting the same error as before
class collection contains one abstract
method and must therefore be declared
abstract we'll look at this later in
another video or implement the remaining
methods jason serializable jason
serialized so let's copy this and
because we already implemented this
method just under a different name we
just have to change the method name
so hit refresh and we get our JSON array
so now we can count and we can use JSON
and code
now what I want to look at is how we can
create our own interface and have our
class implement it so I'm going to get
rid of everything so I just have an
index file and I'm going to create a new
file and I'm going to call this talk
interface there's a there's a few naming
conventions when it comes to interfaces
usually when we want to create a class
we create the file name would be
something like food or PHP the first
letter being a capital with interfaces
there's two main methods that I've seen
people use they either prefix the file
with an eye or actually three methods or
they prefix it with an i and an
underscore and I've also seen foo
interface like so and that's the way I
prefer so I'm going to be using that so
we're going to call it talk interface
and we declare an interface using the
interface keyword and then our name just
like so now what we can do is declare a
method so public function talk and this
is going to look a little weird to you
usually we'd have curly braces like this
in an interface we just add a Simic a
semicolon to the end of the line and
that's how it interface created so now
now let's include that interface or that
file make sure we didn't get any errors
great now I'm going to create a couple
of classes I'm going to call it dog and
cut the PHP and it's both going to be
classes so class dog and in here we're
going to have class cat I need to both
going to implement talk interface just
like we did earlier we had implements
countable and jason serializable or
something like that
but instead we're replacing this with
our own interface so I'm going to copy
this for cat as well and now well first
we need to include this file so require
dog and let's instantiate it and now
we're going to get an error oh this
should be talked interface here refresh
and we get this same error so class dog
contains one abstract method and must
therefore be declared abstract or blah
blah blah implement the remaining
methods talk interface talk which is
that abstract method that we created
here so now we need to create that
method just like before we created count
and JSON serialize except this is our
own custom interface so public function
talk and we're going to return what
because that's how a dog talks so now if
we go back to our index and say dog talk
and we have to echo that we get what now
let's do the same for cat so let's
change this to cat and let's just
comment this out so we don't get an
error hit refresh and we get the same
error so we need to implement
method so public function talk
and what does cats say meow
so now we can uncomment this go to our
browser and we get me out so let's
create our dog again I'll echo cat talk
and the line break and Doug talk
meow a more perfect so the way to think
of an interface is a blueprint for a
class I should have mentioned that
earlier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
