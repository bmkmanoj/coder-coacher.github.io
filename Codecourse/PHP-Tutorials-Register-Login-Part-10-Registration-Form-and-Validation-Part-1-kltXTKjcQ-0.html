registration part of the tutorial this
is going to be slightly longer just
because we need to include validation so
it field specific fields exist we also
then need to check other things like
whether the user exists whether the
emails being used whether the emails are
valid email address whether the password
is greater than six characters for
example just to enforce some kind of
security but you know you can adapt this
for your own purposes and if you do add
more fields you can go ahead and adapt
this further so the first thing we're
going to be doing is actually building
the form and then we're going to look at
basically submitting the form back to
this registration page and and and that
will be it for now then we'll go on to
obviously completing this so we're going
to go from start to finish essentially
so at the moment the user would be on
here and they would click register we
create the register dot PHP page but we
haven't applied any any styling or
anything like that to it so let's go
ahead and open up our index page copy
the contents in here across and let's go
ahead and say register and anything
within here and now will be shown on
this page with our template so when I
click refresh sorry we're going to click
register we get this register here so
let's go ahead and just start building
the form up well we're not going to
worry too much about the the specifics
of building forms and should use a field
set or anything like that
or a table and tables are acceptable to
layout forms and things like that but
I'm just going to be using an unordered
list because it makes just life a lot
easier we have the styles in place in
this in this base template for the
tutorial to deal with unordered lists
and lists styling them correctly but you
know this is really up to you
so sorry I'm going to stop start a form
element and I'm going to have an action
a method to this so basically the action
is where this form is submitted
we've already looked at this with the
login process and I'm just going to
leave this blank which will submit it to
the current page the method is going to
be post with sending this data as post
data for one of two reasons are for two
I hope for two reasons the first reason
is that this won't be shown in the URL
bar so it's not impossible to to you
know modify it's not impossible to
modify this data but it does make it a
lot you know better if you're not
submitting things to the URL as well
with sensitive data like passwords these
will show up in the URL bar if you as a
query if you're using get for example
also post supports much longer data
length so we can post big text areas
without anything being you know
prematurely cut okay so within here I am
going to use an a ul and then within
here I'm going to have list items so
this is an unordered list with several
list items so for example one and two
when I go and refresh you'll see I have
got one and two underneath each other so
it makes perfect sense to use this to
layout format so let's go ahead and just
just you know put all of the form fields
that we actually require in we're not
going to be adding anything special like
the gender or whether they want Sun to a
mailing list or anything like that
we're just going to be doing first-name
lastname password repeat passwords we
need to obviously ask them for an then
type the password twice email address
things like that so add anything that's
stored within our database
so the first one is first-name that no
that's awesome to use a choose a
username and a password first so
username I'm just going to place a star
there or an Asterix rather just to say
that this form field is required I'm
going to do a line break and then I'm
going to do an input type an input field
the type is going to be text the name of
this is very important this is how we're
going to pick this up in PHP so I'm just
going to call this username just it's
obvious that we identified
like that and then that's it so that is
our first field done you can see that
there so let's crack on with the others
so the next one is going to be the
password which is obviously required and
this is going to change very slightly
we're going to have a type of password
instead as we've seen in our login form
already and the name of this is going to
be password so let's go ahead and
duplicate this item and I'm going to say
password again and I'm going to call
this password again
so everything's staying the same except
the variable name here password and
password again and we're going to check
if these are equal to each other when we
actually validate this a bit later on so
the next one is going to be the first
name which I'm going to ask for being
required the surname I'm not going to
ask for being required so a line break
there and that's obviously going to be
text and the name is going to be first
underscore name now what I'm trying to
do is keep these variable names the same
as I'm storing them in my field in the
the fields in my database table so first
underscore name last underscore name
just to keep everything consistent so
when I'm submitting this it makes a lot
more sense so the second one of the name
is going to be obviously the last name
and I'm going to remove the asterisks
obviously change this variable name here
and then we're just going to ask for the
user's email address so that's the last
one
and that stays exactly the same as the
text field you could expose you to the
html5 email field which enables
client-side validation but I'm not going
to worry too much about that for now
because it's irrelevant in terms of
in terms of the tutorial so this is
going to be called email the types going
to be called Tech is going to be text so
let's go ahead and take a look at our
page refresh and we've got all these
fields perfect
now we're missing one thing and that's a
submit button so I'm going to go ahead
and say input type equals this is going
to be submit we don't need to give this
a name because we're not picking up
within PHP but we do want to give it a
value so the value is just going to be
register and that will change the label
on the form so we've now got a button
the cool it's called register so we have
set up our form this is going to allow
the user to enter data we click register
we pass these variables which we've
named here here here and we're going to
pick them up in PHP we're going to run
through them make sure the ones that we
want exists and then we are going to
pass these to a function sorry we're
going to validate them so we're going to
use our errors array like we've done
before we're going to pass these to a
function when all of our well when we
don't have any errors present and this
function is essentially going to take a
specific amount of parameters Sariah
area below mount of parameters so we're
not going to define the parameters but
this function will do is it will pick up
our our values much like we did with the
user data function so let's go ahead and
into our core functions users remember
user data we use the func num they
function our mugs and the func get args
functions to pick up the variables
within here and we're going to use the
same method for our our our registration
script the reason being is that if we
were to submit all of these variables
and then we want to add say a middle
name so say we wanted to add you know
copy and paste it down and add a middle
name all we would have to then do is
validate this middle name using our
methods and then we just pass it through
to the the function we don't need to
update the function as long as we've got
these names here
the same as our database tables it
doesn't matter we can pass it through it
update our database and we don't need to
worry about it it makes it makes your
application a lot easier to manage in
the long run and so obviously you know
this is very you know long having to
type out the form fields there are
easier ways to do things there are
easier ways to store arrays or objects
of data that you want to include and
iterate through and generate these
fields but for now we're doing it the
long way of doing this just because it's
easier so let's go ahead and just test
this out without doing anything when i
refresh and click register it just comes
back to our page nothing's happened
you'll notice just quickly this is just
for anyone that hasn't worked with
different methods in forms before it was
to change the method to get and click
register you can see that we get all
these queries with this query after our
our page name so we've got using e
equals something so if I was to type
Alex here and then click register you
can see that this has passed this data
through you need to think of the posting
process instead of the get post of the
get process it works in exactly the same
way but passes it you know using a
different method it stores it in a
different way
so as long as you think of it terms of
just passing data to another page then
then you'll be absolutely fine with this
so let's go ahead and just quickly
create quickly create a check that out
form has actually been submitted so I'm
going to say if and in here I'm going to
use empty and I'm going to say dollar
underscore post and that's it and if
this is equal to false that means that
the form has been submitted so I'm going
to echo form submitted okay and that's
essentially it so if I go ahead and
press it into here nothing's coming up
when I click register
it says form submitted now we obviously
don't want any output above our header
we're going to output any errors down
here later we're going to do all of our
logic up here and all of our outputting
down here so for now that's how we would
have constructed our form we have
checked
the form has been submitted and in here
we are actually going to do all of our
all of our processing and then obviously
pass it through to that function I was
talking about so that we in the next
