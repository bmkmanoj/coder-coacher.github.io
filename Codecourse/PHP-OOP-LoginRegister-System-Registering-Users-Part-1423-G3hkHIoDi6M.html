enough to be able to validate redirect a
user with a flash a session flash
message and everything like that what
we're now going to do is actually
register a user and luckily enough
because we've done all this prep work
it's going to be extremely
straightforward to actually get the user
registered so we're going to start to
build our user class which is the set up
probably the second biggest or first
biggest class in our database but we can
add to this as we go we don't need to do
this all in one go we'll add this one we
want to log in register update details
check if a user exists etc and work with
user profiles so the first thing we'll
do is just outline the user class and
the only private property we want at the
moment is the DB so on construct we're
going to apply the get instance method
the static get instance method of our DB
class to this to this variable as we've
seen before it's nothing that we haven't
already looked at so I'm going to say
public function construct and here what
we're going to do is we're going to
define if we want to pass in a user
value or not so don't worry too much
about that for now but it's something to
think about because when we use the user
object we're going to use the user
object to get a users data if we want to
or like for example the current user
logged in we're going to use it to check
if a user ID has been defined and then
we can grab all the information
associated with the user but you know
something to bear in mind the only thing
we really need to do for now is set the
DB property to geat DB getinstance so we
can basically make use of the database
so we need another method here and this
is basically going to be the ability to
create a user and it's going to only be
three lines long which is fascinating
really
and so public function create and we're
basically going to say if this
dB insert count so if not so if
basically this helps sorry ever oh no we
don't need to do that because we're just
inserting sorry so in here we want to
obviously define what fields we want to
apply when we create a user and we know
that we want to apply this to the users
table and we know that we want to apply
the fields so fields could I guess be an
empty array in the sense here and then
if this doesn't work out we want to
throw a new exception and we'll just say
there was a problem creating an account
so sorry throwing your exception and so
if this doesn't work out we're going to
throw a new exception otherwise we'll
just assume that everything has worked
so we have this create method we can
start to use it now in our register code
so if the validation passes what we want
to do is the first thing we want to do
is instantiate the user class and create
an object from this so we want to say
user equals new user that gives us
access to our database if it's already
been it's already been connected and
everything and then we want to go ahead
and enter user data so what we want to
do is we want to say try because we've
thrown an exception within that method
we'll be able to catch any problems so
catch and this will be exception e and
we want to die with e get message now
this probably isn't the best
functionality in terms of user
friendliness you might want to say we
director user to a page a specific page
saying oops sorry we couldn't register
you or something like that but just for
now just to speed things up a bit we'll
just kill that kill the script to that
point so we're going to try to say user
create to remember this is the method
that we've just created in the user
object here
and in here we're going to say a list of
array sorry an array of fields we want
to insert so we have a username and
we'll just go ahead and fill these in as
we know a password salt a name joined
and group so the group is going to be
the group we'll get to this
functionality later on so we want to
generate a password a salt a name when
they joined and group now there are a
couple of things here that we need to
bear in mind we need to be generating
hashes we need to use the hashes or use
the salt against the hash also store a
salt and input the join date which isn't
too difficult but there's a few other
classes we need to work with here no
surprise but again as we create these
it's going to make functionality a lot
easier later on so let's just dive eart
quickly and take a look at the hash
functionality that's all we need to deal
with here so just don't worry too much
the hash class once we built this and
it's not long at all three very very
very short methods so we have a class of
hash and this is purely for the purpose
of security we want to generate hash a
one-way hash using sha-256 and it's
entirely up to you what kind of what
algorithm used to generate the hash it
doesn't really matter as long as it's
secure enough and you know in this case
we're using a very assault and anything
like that so I'll explain this as we go
along so we need three methods here the
first one is called make this is going
to make a hash the second one is going
to make a salt public
static function salt and the third one
is going to I don't actually know if we
need this in this functionality but it's
going to make a unique unique hash so
what will include this anyway we'll
definitely be using this later on so
we're let's say a public static function
unique ok so to make a hash we obviously
need a string to be provided otherwise
we'll just be making a random hash and
we also want to apply a salt to this or
not so we're going to add it as a an
empty string anyway now what a salt does
is it improves the security of a
password hash because it adds a randomly
generated and secure hopefully string of
data onto the end of a password and that
can then be used to add to the plain
tech add when we for example log a user
in we can add the salt on to then check
whether the hash matches that the plain
text password so we take the plain text
string and add the salt to it hash that
when the user logs in they enter a
password say it would just be password
we then append the salt onto that again
hash that and check if it matches the
addition of the existing hash and the
reason this makes it more secure is
because the salt is random it means that
two passwords stored as a hash won't
equal each other so a password let's
just say in some fantasy world hashing
the term password
let's just divert here over let's say
hashing the term passed by the string
password is equal to one two three four
five let's just say it obviously
wouldn't now if we were to add a salt to
this it might be something like password
and then a load of random characters
that might then equal something like 1
or 909 for example now if we were to do
that again with another set of random
characters that might equal 555 so we're
now changing we keeping there
original password as long as we store
this salt we'll end up with different
values and this just makes it harder for
password values to be looked up and and
and you know if all password hashes are
different then we're never gonna we can
know in there just imagine a list of
passwords in the database and everyone
has chosen a the same password if one
password hashes is found to equal a
certain character in a lookup table at a
certain string and lookup table then we
have an attacker will know everyone's
password so salting something just make
sure they're a little bit more unique
you can find tons of information on
salting and bet probably best
descriptions than the one I've given you
so what we're going to do here is we're
going to return using the hash function
and we're going to we're going to say we
want to hash this in sha-256 again go
ahead and look these things up and we're
going to apply this as a string but we
can concatenate on the salt that we
provide this is either an empty string
if we don't provide a salt or a or
assault return so if we do and so with
the salt here we want to generate a salt
of a particular length and here we're
going to return using this a little bit
strange using the M crypt create IV
function this is going to provide us
with literally a load of rubbish and
it's sorry length this is going to
provide us with a load of rubbish and
it's basically going to ensure that we
have a strong enough salt now for the
unique one this is fairly
straightforward all we're going to do is
return self make
unique ID and this is basically for the
purposes of returning just basically
making a hash so we don't need to worry
too much about this for now I'm not
going to include it in this
functionality so let's go ahead and just
play around with what we've already done
if you're a little confused let's go
ahead and create a variable here which
is going to be hashed salt and we need
to choose a particular length of hash
and I'm going to say 32 it's in our
database we're storing a salt with a
length of 32 let's go ahead and just
echo this out and we'll just kill the
script there so inside of our register
page let's go ahead and register so I
would choose in fact let me just delete
a couple of records here
okay so we've deleted that and we've in
fact we can delete this as well I guess
okay brilliant so we've got no no
records here now so let's go ahead and
register as we normally would so type in
a password we type in a password and we
type in the name register and there we
go we get this back if we just confirm
that it's not being shown okay so we'll
see this when it's inserted into the
database anyway but we've basically
generated a hash with the length of 32
and we can now in fact we need to keep
that we can now enter this into here so
restoring the the salt alongside the
users details now for things like
username it's fairly straightforward its
input get username password is going to
be hash make remember we've built this
functionality already and that's going
to be the users password that they've
defined to us but we're also going to
inside of hash make to find the salt
that we've generated as well which we're
also storing it's incredibly important
that you store the salt or your pass
will be lost it will be pointless
because if you don't know the salt that
you want to append onto check we can't
find the original
values so or compare the original value
rather so now for name we want to say
input get name and joined it's a little
different remember we're storing a
date-time format in our database so we
have here a date-time format this just
basically means we instead of storing
like a timestamp or something like that
we can store a human readable date here
which can be manipulated either in MySQL
or back when we're in PHP and basically
what we've done here is we've said we
want the year the month and the day
space hours minutes and seconds so we
want that very clearly to be defined and
the groups just going to be one will
obviously get two groups and permissions
a bit later on in the series so now
we're trying this user create
functionality let's go ahead now and
just try and register a user to Alex
password password and I'll enter my full
name hit register nothing happens in
this case because we're not redirecting
anywhere we're not using a session flash
functionality we're just being
redirected back to the same page but the
good news is that we don't have any
errors we haven't caught any exceptions
so when I browse you can see that the
data has been stored correctly so you
can see here that I've got rather long
password hash and the rather long well
the 32 character salt the name the join
date and time and the group that I'm in
and everything has been added to the
database as we would expect
so what we're now going to do is we're
going to flash a session message so
let's go ahead and just say session
flash now we're going to give this a
particular identify based on where we
want this to appear and I'm going to say
home and I'm going to say you have been
registered and can now login and then
we're going to redirect to a particular
page now we'll look at the redirection
in just a moment but for now I'm going
to use a header redirect
we're obviously going to abstract this
functionality make this a little bit
nicer later on but we going to flash the
home and then in home we're going to say
if session exists home now the reason
we've done this is this is now a generic
place where we can flash messages to and
then just show basically if we want to
redirect the user the home page and say
sorry we couldn't sign you in or we
couldn't register you please try again
we can do this and in this case we're
just going to on the home page
just output echo paragraph and then in
here we can just concatenate on session
flash home perfect so let's go ahead and
register a new user just to test this
functionality out so I'm going to
register user name is Ashley password
will just be password again and we'll
say Ashley Garrett click register we
redirected to the home page when we
refresh again that message goes but
eventually we're going to have our login
and register detail links here and if we
check out the database the user actually
has been registered again if you look
very carefully at this I've used the
same password for Alex as I have for
Ashley but we have two different
password hashes because we're using a
salt which is stored we can check this
when we sign in and therefore we
provided an extra level of security to -
the ability to store passwords so we've
now completed the registration
functionality and we've redirected back
to the home page and we're also we're
now going to look at the ability to
redirect because that's quite important
and obviously then we're going to go on
to more exciting things actually being
able to log the user in and things like
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
