a little bit difficult and in this video
we're going to take a slightly different
approach which has been inspired by la
Ravel's cashier package and this is just
a subscription billing package for
stripe but it gives you the ability to
generate invoices for payments so let's
take a look at the code first of all and
see what we're doing here so we have a
class in here which we're going to be
building we're instantiating this and
then we're loading in a view by a view I
literally just mean a file like this so
we're going to be generating from HTML
CSS images whatever you want to show on
a page and what we then do is we pass
through some variables which will be
used by that view so you can see inside
of here you've got this order amount and
really you can do whatever here and
obviously it doesn't need to be an
invoice it can be anything at all so
then what we do is we respond with the
file name that we want this to be
downloaded as so when I go ahead and
refresh this page you can see that we
get this invoice down here I'm going to
go ahead and click on that and we'll see
what this looks like so this is the HTML
page it's using bootstrap to style it
but you can see here that we've got all
of the information passed into this view
and it's been rendered and we now have a
PDF are downloaded to the user's
computer so before we get started you're
going to need a few things and in the
next video we're going to be discussing
exactly what you need to prepare to
build this functionality and really
after you've got them it's not that
difficult to do this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
