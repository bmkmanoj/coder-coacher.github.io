display the posts as you see here I have
put some content in index or PHP which
includes a navigation it looks horrible
I know that's not the point though
here's how I created it I applied some
styling here and here I have a nav
element which is an html5 element with
this unordered list of links feel free
to do is however you want and I have
this heading one tag element I mean and
of course I include in it for PHP okay
so we need to get all the posts this is
of course done using the get posts
function however we have not yet created
that let's just keep it simple we're not
going to worry about ID and cat ID just
yet all we're going to do is specify a
query it's probably the largest one in
the entire series but once you
understand how this works you will be
able to perform a hell of a lot of tasks
with PHP and my sequel alright so what
are we going to select we're going to
select the post ID now note that I add
posts in front of here this is the table
name posts we're selecting the ID in the
boasts table the reason I'm adding this
here is because we will also select the
categories ID
now because we are using to ID fields
here we need to name them something else
so I'm just going to use the as keyword
to specify a new sort of temporary name
for these IDs and I'm going to do the
same for the category category ID all
right other fields are the title of
course the contents the dates posted and
categories dots night we're going to
select it from the posts table and here
we go
inner join I'll just type it out for now
inner join with categories on categories
dots ID equals posts dots cat ID what
does this mean basically you can select
data from multiple tables by using this
inner join syntax we select data from
categories and posts where I shall I put
it well where the ID and guess ID are
the same so to retrieve the category
name for a specific post because we only
store the
categoryid in the boast stable we need
to perform an inner joy so here in for
the first post we have a gas ID of one
so when we join it with categories we
select the name where the ID here equals
one so let me just copy this query and
run it in PHP myadmin and there's our
result here you see named Uncategorized
even though we do not have a category
name field in the boasts table so this
is incredibly useful Oh up here I'm
going to say boasts equals already of
course we need to run this query so
query equals my sequel query query now
as with the get categories function we
loop over it with my sequel fetch a so
CIN a while loop and we say boasts
equals row and then we return posts so
now we can use this here on index.php
and we're just going to get posts but
forgot one thing we're going to order it
by ID descending this simply means that
we select all the data in a descending
order so the largest ID gets source of
display eat first
okay so in here we're going to use for
each loop for each post as post and here
we come to a point where it's might look
a little messy but well actually you'll
just find out as I go along in doing
this the first thing we're going to do
in here is check if the category exists
category exists and we're going to use
the name field and post name because
that is what the category name is stored
in so why do we do this well the reason
is we added some functionality to delete
categories however we did not handle
anything related to the posts in that
category so say we add a my sequel
category which had some posts but you
decided to delete the my sequel category
you would have those posts in no
category so by default we're going to
make that uncatted Erised
now this is actually a sort of terrible
workaround and the reason I'm not going
into much detail about this is because
it is actually a pretty good challenge
for you to implement into their system I
can do everything for you but that also
takes
away some of the learning for you anyway
we are now going to start actually
displaying things the first thing is a
heading two in which we are going to of
course display the title so in here we
say echo post title and in here we say
index dot PHP ID equals echo boast and
boast ID when we now view this okay we
have an error again 143 or up this
should be boast ID or boasts those ID
and now we should get third post yay
second post and first post in the next
part we are going to finish this up so
see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
