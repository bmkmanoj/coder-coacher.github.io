application we're going to create the
directories that we need and files that
we need within those directories and as
we're going along I'm going to just
explain basically what these are going
to do just so we've got a really good
idea of how this system all fits
together and how we should be
structuring everything and then in the
subsequent parts of this of this series
will be actually filling in the code and
actually making everything work so I've
got a empty directory called IO PLR this
is just the root directory of that I'm
working in and what I'm previewing in my
browser so I'm going to go and create a
new folder and we have four folders
within this and then files within these
folders now obviously we're going to
require a classes folder and simply
because we are going to be working with
classes and storing classes another
folder that we're going to need is a
core folder and this is just going to
hold our initialization file which is
going to auto load classes and things
like that we have a functions folder
we're still working with functions we
can have a sanitize function that's the
only thing that we're actually going to
include and we are also going to include
an includes folder and this is going to
store things like errors in in this case
we're going to have a 404 error if a
user profile isn't found I'm going to
automatically include that and display
it to a user so they're the four folders
that we need let's take a look at the
files that we need outside of these
folders first now the first file is
going to be the index dot PHP file
fairly straightforward so let's go ahead
and store that there we go so we've got
index dot PHP that's just going to be
the file that the user lands on and has
the ability to log in click login
etc etc the second file that we have is
going to be login that's obvious this is
going to process the user login we're
also going to have the ability to log
out so we have a log out we're also
going to
have the ability to view a profile and
we also need to be able to register if
we haven't logged in as read I have an
account and we want to be able to update
our profile so we need an update file
and we also need to be able to change
our password now that's everything so
let's go ahead and just close all these
files so inside of classes these the
main sort of meats of the application
these are the cool interesting things
that we're going to use to work with all
the functionality so going to have
things like input helpers so to help us
work with input really easily
things like validation classes to
quickly an easy but easily validate and
creating these classes is going to take
a little while to get your head around
sort of understand if you've never
worked with work with oriented
object-oriented programming before but
in the end you're going to end up with
something that's going to save you so
much time in the future so these are the
really cool parts of our application so
the first thing is going to be config
dot PHP what this is going to do is it's
going to is it's going to allow us to
draw config options from our config in
our in it dot PHP farther we're going to
create inside of our core directory so
it basically allows us to say what's my
database name called pull it from config
it's it's going to be a really quick way
to access different configuration values
from your application now cookie doc PHP
is the next one now this might seem
obvious it allows us to deal with
cookies so we have static methods like
get or put or you know the ability to
store cookies really easily check if
cookies exist no messing around inside
of your inside of these files with
actually pulling in you know using sort
of native PHP functionality we're going
to sort of abstract that and put that
all in cookie PHP now DB is probably our
database PHP is probably the biggest
class that going to write alongside user
dot PHP and this is a database wrapper
we're going to
work with PDO PHP data objects to
connect to a MySQL database in this case
but because we're using PDO we can
connect to any database we want really
we're also going to have a hash class
this is basically that allows to
generate a variety of different hashes
so for things like salts also for just
general hashes that we're going to store
moment hash a password or something and
so that's a sort of security
consideration we're going to have input
dot PHP which allows us to work with
input data so that's going to be really
really useful so we can do things like
input to get user name and this will
return something like Alex for example
so that's going to be really really
helpful as well so the next one is going
to be redirect dot PHP so let's save
this farm redirect PHP the redirects
going to deal with things like 404
errors or redirecting to a specific page
so we're sort of again abstracting the
header function that we find in PHP so
we're not going to have to do header
location index dot PHP every time but we
could also do some stuff like redirect
to 404 or something like that so we'll
be doing that so the next one is going
to be session PHP this is going to allow
us to deal with PHP sessions so the
ability to set a session check of a
session exists a check of your users
logged in basically that's fairly
straightforward we're also going to have
token PHP now this is cross-site request
forgery protection in terms of PHP
security this is going to allow us to
check if a token has been set on a form
and it matches the current user session
token this is really important because
for cross-site request forgery you know
the ability to for someone to submit a
form thought directory user somewhere
and then you know perform an action on
their behalf is is you know it's a
common PHP security vulnerability room
and code so we're going to use tokens to
protect against that and if you're
unsure about cross-site request forgery
go ahead and and look that up and you
understand hopefully a bit about what it
means so user dot PHP again it's going
to be a massive class allow us to log in
log out perform all sorts of actions
update user details and in user dot PHP
we're going to use the DB class a lot to
check user information update user
information and things like that so
we're going to make use of the of the DB
wrap or the database wrapper for that so
the last one again is a probably one of
the coolest ones I think is the
validation class and this is going to
allow us to do things like validate and
check if validations passed and this is
a massive time saver and it can also be
extended to you know cater for whatever
functionality you want so we're going to
be able to validate things really
quickly like does that form field exist
is that bigger than 20 characters or you
know does this user name already exist
and things like that so that's a really
really cool way to work with things so
they're all the classes that we're going
to create and the beauty of these
classes is that you can take these and
use them outside of this of this login
and registration system as we've already
discussed so in core we're only going to
have one file and that's just in it dot
PHP that's basically going to be
included on every page that we use and
it's going to allow us to do things like
auto load classes so we don't have to
keep requiring all the classes that we
need in that's basically it so inside of
functions we're going to actually create
a folder and this is going to be on it
sorry we're not we're going to create a
file and this is going to be sanitized
dot PHP I'm going to have a function in
here that's going to just basically
sanitize data so we can output data
remember the user has the ability to
update their profile information and if
you are updating profile information you
know you want to sort of protect against
what you're outputting from your
database so inside includes we're going
to create a folder and this is going to
be called errors now inside of this
folder we're going to create a file
called 404 dot PHP so
of our redirect class is going to deal
with outputting errors as we looked at
just a moment ago so we're going to have
the ability to force an error on a user
for example if a user profile doesn't
exist and again this can be this can be
taken in used elsewhere in the
application as well but we're mainly
going to be using it for if a profile
doesn't exist we want to force a 404
error so that's all of our directory
structure it does look overwhelming but
the majority of these classes are
actually going to be extremely simple
the two that are going to be the longest
is the user and the DB wrapper but the
validation class is slightly more tricky
the others are honestly a piece of cake
the rest of the application is just
going to be making use of these classes
so the main focus really is on these
classes once we've written all these
classes we can breeze through this code
and really get a good system working
together and it should be fairly
straightforward from that point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
