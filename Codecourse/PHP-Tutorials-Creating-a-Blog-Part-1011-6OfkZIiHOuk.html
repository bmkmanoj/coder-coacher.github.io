we are actually going to make the
category of PHP file and delete post dot
PHP so category to PHP first we want to
display data based on the category so
we're going to get posts no we do not
need posts ID what we need instead is a
category ID which is specified in the
URL so we need to edit get posts and we
essentially do the same thing as with
the post ID so if s set get ID gasps ID
equals int gasps ID and query does
equals where cats ID equals get ID it
may be slightly better to use categories
those ID here but guess ID is just fine
and now we need to oops display all
those posts and that's exactly the same
as in index dot PHP so I'm going to be
lazier and i'm going to copy this entire
thing paste it in here now it would be
probably be even better to create a
function to do this for us because we
are now doing the exact same thing twice
which is a bad programming practice but
for the sake of this tutorial I'm just
going to do
like this to to keep the focus on my
sequel bit when we display this now this
is something you do not need to see that
was a topic in which we discussed the
code that I wrote for the blog thing
here pretty useful then that topic is
actually where I got pointed out to this
little technique anyway let's try to
stay on topic a bit when we go to say
the uncategorized category which has an
ID of 10 category oh that's coma bhp
obviously not what we want so let's get
into index 2.php and there's the culprit
dots PHP of course we need to do the
same thing in categorical PHP refresh
this and I'll do it again and there we
have it everything for the uncategorized
category then we go to PHP for example
and we only kept this one now I'm going
to add another category test and then
return to index and i'm going to add
opposed to it and it's just a post post
and i'll add it to test there we have it
and now i'm going to delete a category
i'm going to delete test now when i go
back to the index we see that
we do not get the test post at all even
though it is there in cats ID number six
so and we see it's gone here too and we
see that this does not actually seem to
work now as I said this is probably a
great challenge for you to do this was
just something i put in theory didn't
even test it to be honest so i'm just
going to get rid of it and yeah think of
me as a jerk if you want but try this
yourself it will be some good training
for you alright so we have a few more
things to do which is delete post and
edit post so we're almost done let's go
to delete post and this is essentially
the same thing as a deletes category so
I'm just going to copy that code and
paste it in remember though that this of
course needs to be post and we do not
want to redirect to the category list
what we want to link to instead is just
the index and there's nothing more to it
once again we do almost the same thing
twice but again for the sake of
simplicity I'll just do this so I'm
going to add another test post test test
there we have it we also see it's on the
index now I delete it and it's gone
let's see now can we do edits both stop
PHP I suppose we could what I'm going to
do instead I'm going to check if
everything works the way it's supposed
to work I think add category didn't
really work now it's redirects back to
add category your PHP so I'm going to
change that oh right it does now that's
interesting it doesn't even redirect it
up so we do had a location and i'll do
at post doc PHP then we kill the script
so now when we add another one say xml
and there we have all of them and
everything else worked just fine so in
the next part I'm going to start and
hopefully also immediately finish the
edits postdoc PHP file and when we have
that done we have finished our blog ugly
as it may be so join me in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
