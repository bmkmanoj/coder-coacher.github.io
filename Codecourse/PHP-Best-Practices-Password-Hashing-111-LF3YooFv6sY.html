past few weeks months possibly years
studying PHP you can construct PHP web
applications so you're more or less a
developer now now what we're going to
focus on is turning you into a good PHP
developer we're going to teach you how
to follow the best possible practices
and we're going to start with passwords
now let's face it our users aren't
exactly smart they don't want a list the
majority of them don't know that your
password should be a link the mixed case
string which consists of both
alphanumeric or and special characters
they don't know that you should be using
a different password for each website
you use so we have to take precautionary
measures to make sure that their
accounts on their other websites and put
in jeopardy if our database are our
storage system gets compromised so to do
that we use password hashing now you've
been studying PHP for a long time now
you've probably heard of password
hashing you've probably also heard of
md5 now nb5 with secure once well as
technology evolves we shouldn't be using
anymore
not because it's insecure in itself
basically it's fast which means that
hackers can try billions of different
combinations per second on a single GPU
and that's the problem with md5 so what
we do is we use something like pH Pass
now we can download pH pass from open
wall comm /bh pass and we can click this
now I've already got my project set up
here I have pH pH Pass installed as we
can see here so I'm going to demonstrate
how to use this the first thing that we
want to do is obviously include the file
except the next thing that we want to do
is instantiate the the class so we'll
call this hash and we'll say new
password
ash and if we just go to our constructor
we can see it takes two parameters the
first is the iteration count log which
is an integer which we're going to pass
in 8 which is also the recommended
number and then we have portable hashes
which we're going to say false so next
thing that we're going to do is we're
going to set a password so we're going
to call it on hashed I'm going to set
this to secret now we're going to hash
the password so going to say hash equals
hash hash password unhatched so now if
we just echo this out and we go to our
browser refresh we can see that we get
this big long I think it's about 60
characters hash so that when our user
signs up to the site this hash is what
we want to store in the database so how
do we know if a hash matches a unhatched
password we use the check password
method so if we say if hash check
password now I always forget this e the
unhatched password goes first and the
hash password goes second
so if has check password gone to echo
match so let's try this out perfect if
we would do change this to something
else we first we're not going to get
that because it doesn't match so let's
put this back to unhatched and that's
basically all but it requires now in PHP
5.5 and up PHP actually includes this
functionality themselves so I'm going to
demonstrate that now but let's just
comment this out we're going to change
this to password hash we're going to
enter our password and the second grant
is the type of flash we want to use I'm
just going to say password default which
is a constant
down here we're going to say if password
verify on hashed hashed echo match
refresh as you can see we get a match</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
