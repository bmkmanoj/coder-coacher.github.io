specifically talk about password hashing
and look at some secure examples of
hashing passwords so they're suitable to
store in a database so if you're not
sure what hashing is or you know you're
hashing passwords at the moment perhaps
using md5 then this series is for you
so basically applying a secure hashing
algorithm to a passwords stored it like
storing it into a database means that if
you do it properly it makes it extremely
unlikely that it will be brute forced if
your database is exposed so if an
attacker gains access to your database
so your users table and has a list of
passwords if their hash properly then
you're less likely for them to be brute
forced and you know you're adding
another layer of security there so we
mentioned md5 and if you've looked at
md5 before then it's a good idea to note
that it's not a good solution to store
to use this to store passwords in a
database so the function looks like this
in in PHP and if we go ahead and just
choose a password I know we'll choose
something maybe more sensible so we're
going to choose a password like this and
go ahead and refresh our browser and you
can see that we get this hashed string
here now note that every time i refresh
the same hash is generated so if for
example two users in your database had
the password tabi one two three four
five their hashes that are stored in the
database would both be this value now
that's a little bit concerning because
if an attacker gains access to a
database and has access to one account
if you use this using the same password
they then have access to the other
account and basically using md5 nowadays
it's so easy to brute force this and
brute forcing is basically looking up in
a preset list of values in a table of
values that could be this value and
there are all sorts of complicated ways
that you can go ahead and brute-force
and we'll be looking at example of this
environment
so basically if you look at an example
like this you see we've got hash
generated and later on we're going to go
ahead and look at actually brute-forcing
this so let's go ahead and look at an
example of actually generating hash and
then going ahead and comparing this this
is if you're not familiar with
comparisons of hashed at all and it's a
basic example and then we'll look at
actually brute-forcing this value using
our an online tool so we know that I've
just used the md5 hash to hash this
taboo one two three four five password
and I have this hash from it so I'm
going to go ahead and I'm going to copy
this and in my text editor I'm going to
go ahead and I'm going to create a
variable called stored password now you
have to use your imagination and imagine
that this value is stored within a
database somewhere and I'm a user coming
onto the site attempting to sign in now
once a user entered a username and their
password they would supply the password
as tabi one two three four five if that
was their password so what you would
then do is you create probably an if
statement to say does this password
equal this password now because this is
a hash we can't reverse it no way to
actually reverse this value and then get
the plaintext string from it the
algorithm won't allow for that because
it's a hash it's a one-way hash so what
we need to do is we need to say instead
of something like does tabi one two
three four five equal stored password we
need to say well let's rehash this
plaintext value that's been provided to
us and because we already know that the
md5 hash will always be the same we go
ahead and get the same value here and
the same value here so we can go ahead
and echo something like you're in or if
the password isn't correct we could go
ahead and echo something like sorry
try again so let's go ahead and take a
look at this and see what it looks like
in the browser so when i refresh you set
this as your in but if maybe I slip-up
and provide
one extra extra letter on there you'll
see that it doesn't work so that's
basically how a login process would work
and how hash sort of you compare a hash
to a stored value so we know this works
but let's take this hash and go ahead
and see if we can brute force this value
out of it now if you signed up to a
website you might think that a password
liked a B one two three four five is
secure enough but you'll be surprised to
see that if we go over to a website like
crack station we can go ahead and
actually reverse this so i've pasted in
the hash in here and notice this has non
salted sort eight will explain salts in
just a moment so let's go ahead and just
type in this capture and then go ahead
and crack hashes so what's going to
happen now it's going to it's going to
perform a lookup and brute force this
value and you can see below here
surprisingly it's actually given us the
value so it's gone ahead and looked this
up and it's actually brute forced it or
cracked it successfully so now we start
to worry and we think to ourselves well
in this case if this can be cracked what
do we need to do well basically PHP has
within its functionality a function
called crypt
so the function looks like this and this
basically lets you securely hash a
string provide a salt and all the salt
is is it something that's added to a
string to change the value of its hashed
output so just as an example and this is
just as Inc as an example I'm going to
go ahead and I'm going to use md5 and
perhaps provide the value tabby one two
three four five again now if I go ahead
and apply a salt a different salt for
every single user and in this case all
I'm going to provide is HP's time value
note this is not recommended to do at
all this is just an example because time
changes all the time
sorry going out and append this like
this so I'm going to go ahead and append
this top value of that's returned from
time on to the end of this so what then
is when i refresh the hash changes every
single time it's generated so this is
basically what hash does this is just a
silly example and non-secure example but
that's what a hash does so hashing the
password like tab you want if you
provide again again again with md5 will
return the same hash so it's insecure
but the crip function I mentioned a
second ago lets you securely hash a
password add a salt get the returned
hash you can go ahead and store that
however we're not going to look at the
crypt function we're going to make life
even easier for ourselves with it while
we still enforce as much security as
possible so we're not going to talk
about crypt we're going to talk about
the password hashing API that PHP
provides from version 5.5 onwards so go
ahead and check your PHP version if
you're not too sure just type PHP info
into a PHP file that will give you all
the information about your PHP
installation if you go ahead and check
that out I'm running PHP five point five
point nine so I have the ability to use
the password hashing API if you are
unfortunately running something under
5.5 you're not going to have this
ability so go ahead
upgrade to the version 5.5 if you
haven't already and the rest of the
series we're going to look at using this
password hashing API to securely hash
path passwords that are perfectly
acceptable and safe to store in a
database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
