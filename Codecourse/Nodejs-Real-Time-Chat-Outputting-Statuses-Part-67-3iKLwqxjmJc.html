ability for the client to send a message
to sorry status from no Jess to the
client and actually sort of round off
this ability to send messages by
providing the status as you know message
sent successfully or something like that
and this will also help us in in the
sense of if a message is invalid so if a
user hasn't typed a message we will get
this message back as well
they'll have intent hasn't entered a
name so we'll go ahead and hop over to
our server J s code and basically what
we want to do here is we want to define
a method that's going to allow us or a
function just allow us to actually send
a status so I'm going to call this send
status that's going to be a function
it's going to take one parameter and
that parameter is going to be s for
status and then all I'm going to do in
here is socket emit remember we've
already seen this before down in here
socket dot emit status and that's just
going to be s so we're just passing
string in there is the ability to pass
an object in here as well and we'll look
at why that is in a moment but in terms
of sending a status we want to test this
out with the fact that you know we might
not have valid data here so if
whitespace pattern test blah blahs we've
tested our name we test our message if
this is empty or is is basically
consisting of whitespace we want to go
ahead and send a status and we want to
choose the status and that is going to
be name and message is required now the
reason we're doing the validation on the
on the server side is it can't be
changed by a user if we were doing the
checks on the on the client side and we
have these whitespace tests on the
client side the user could come in and
modify these and actually go ahead and
send the invalid data to our server
which we don't want because the client
has control or the user has control over
the clients code it's unsecure to be
able to do that basically or at least
it'll mess up our application so we want
to go ahead and only validate on the
node side and then send the status back
afterwards so we've got this send status
but inside
about HTML we now index to HTML file we
want to listen for status so let's go
ahead and do that now
so we want to say listen for a status
and we do exactly the same thing as
we've already done elsewhere and that's
just socket dot on status and then we go
ahead and provide our callback with the
data that's returned now there's a
couple of things we need to do here we
need to check if it's an object and then
if it's an object we want to extract the
message from it and this is a little bit
confusing to understand at first but
you'll see why we need this in a minute
so I'm going to go ahead and say set
status in actual fact let's build the
set status method first up here this is
set status and all this is going to do
is it's going to change this here this
idle
so set status is going to just take what
we get and you know do that so I think
it might be a good idea to go ahead and
set a status default and that's going to
be status dot text content so what's
happened here is we have a status
default so let's go ahead and just
console.log that out now if we look at
our client that says undefined at the
moment which it shouldn't do and so
let's just see what that are of course
because we haven't actually you know
required in the node so we're going to
say statuses get node and this node is
remember chat status and status and the
span within that so this will now be
this here and then we can go ahead and
get the default state so that is idle so
inside of set status what we want to do
is
you want to set the status of the
section so it's a status dot text
content equals s and that's going to
replace it with the whatever we pass
through to set status so let's just
actually test this out instead of
console logging this lets set status
testing and let's go ahead and check
this out so refresh that's now changed
to testing so we know that that works
that's exactly what we want to happen
but what we want to do is we want it to
revert back to the original status after
a period of say 3 seconds so we're going
to say if s doesn't equal status default
so if s isn't already idle then we want
to go ahead and say far delay equals set
timeout so using the set timeout
function and we want that to be for 3
seconds so it's all wait a period of 3
seconds then we're going to set the
status back to status default so we've
got the status default within overriding
that waiting 3 seconds and then we're
creating out well the delays creating 3
seconds today and then we're setting the
status back to the default and then
obviously we want to go ahead and clear
the interval delay so and this could
just test that out when i refresh what
should happen is this should change from
idle to testing which already has we
wait 3 seconds and that returns back to
idle so we've got this functionality in
here it's not massively important but it
adds a nice touch because we don't want
the status lingering around there so now
what we can actually do is socket dot on
status is actually take this status
that's passed through from nodejs and
through Tucket IO we pick up the status
we then go ahead and actually set the
status accordingly so we want to go
ahead and say set status and in here
we're going to create a ternary operator
which is going to check the type of the
data that's returned so I'm going to say
type of data so if the type of data is
an object that means that an object's
been passed back as the status in that
case I want to go ahead and strip extra
the message from that otherwise I want
to just out the data so assuming this is
a string what I then want to do is if
data clear is true text area dot value
equals nothing and this is a little tiny
bit confusing because we've not actually
done anything with this yet so and
essentially what this is doing is it's
checking if the status returned here
here is an object now in this case this
is a string so what would happen is we
would hit this this would sort of run
the callback and then we would set the
status it would check the status type if
it's an object which isn't it would set
just data so we just output a string so
set status data if we have an object
we're expecting a message property
within that and what all that will then
do is it will just output this is a
string and then if data clear is true so
we send this clear property as well then
we clear the text area and the reason
that we do that is because if we for
example and we'll just run through this
quickly if for example I was to type in
hello here and forget my name what would
then happen is this would send name and
message to the nodejs server it would
return the error saying oops you you
know you you need to fill in your name
and your message what it would then do
is it would change this status to you
know you need to send a message but it
wouldn't clear this here but on success
if we pass this clear
property it would then clear this text
area let's just go ahead and sort of
wrap this up and then it might make a
little bit more sense if it doesn't
already so we've got the functionality
here but in server j/s instead of
console logging inserted we want to go
ahead and send this data back so we want
to emit this data back to the client so
socket dot emit input to remember we're
listening for input out sorry no we're
not doing that at all are we so what
we're doing is called insert we are
actually then going and we use the send
status function that we already created
up here so that's just taking an S which
is the status or
object in this in this case so we're
going to go ahead and say send status
and in here oops
in here we're going to say message and
I'll just be message sent clear true so
now we're sending this status and if
everything's fine so if the name and
message are there we're sending this
status saying that we want to clear the
text area and with our message which is
then going to be picked up here and then
if clear is available it will clear the
text area so what we're going to do now
is go ahead and open our browser and go
ahead and just refresh and type in hello
and oh okay so we've got let's just go
ahead and remove this set status here
and basically what's going to happen now
is that when we type in a name or don't
type in the name rather and type in
hello we get name a message required
which then after three seconds revert
back to idle when we do go ahead and
enter a name in a message we hit enter
and actually sends the message we've
already seen that the database picks up
on this and it's still up no Jess picks
up on this and it stores it but now all
we've done is we've just provided the
ability for that callback so then empty
that box and return an error if the data
isn't present so we've now wrapped up
with creating or returning statuses from
our nodejs server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
