we're going to have to install it and
there are a couple of ways that we can
do this the first way which I would
highly recommend is using composer to
install this as a project dependency and
that way you can keep up to date with it
and easily install it when you transfer
your project over to your production
environment so let's take a look at
first of all installing carbon with
packages or through packages with
composer
and then we'll look at the other method
which is just copying the file over
which is fairly straightforward anyway
so if we head over to the packages page
for carbon this gives us the version
information here and we can just click
on one of these to get the require the
details for this so let's go ahead and
install this version and if we head over
to our text editor at the moment all I
have is an index dot PHP file which
doesn't contain anything at the moment
but I'm going to create a new composer
file so let's go ahead and save that as
composer JSON and it's pasted in it's in
just a moment we need to choose what we
want to require and just paste that in
and of course what we can do is if we
want to say one dot star we can that
will just pull in the latest version
under one so once we've done that then
obviously making sure you've got
composer installed on your system if you
don't already just head over to get
composer 2 org and you can go ahead and
download that it works for most
operating systems and we're just going
to say composer install and making sure
that we're within the directory that our
composer dot JSON file is within and
that's going to go ahead and download
carbon as a project dependency and with
composer this is going to be really easy
to just require this in because it will
create an auto load file for us so let's
just wait for that to finish and then
we'll get going including it in okay so
now that that has been downloaded we now
see a vendor folder within our project
if you have other dependency
these will be stored here as well and we
have this auto load file under this
vendor directory which we can just
require into our project to pull in all
of our dependencies so we can start to
use them so all we're going to need to
do here then is require in vendor slash
auto load dot PHP and we can now start
to use carbon which will obviously look
at throughout this series so there is an
alternative method of using carbon and
that's just to download the carbon file
so let's go ahead and look at doing that
next so if you head over to the github
repository we can download carbon
without using composer by simply coming
to this carbon source carbon directory
grabbing this file just here which you
can see here and we can go ahead and hit
the raw button we can copy over the
contents of this file to our project or
you can download the file and just drag
it over in this case I'm just going to
come over to my text editor I'm going to
create a new folder called libs I'm
going to go ahead and create a new
folder within this called carbon and
then I'm gonna go ahead and just create
a new file called carbon dot PHP let's
drag this down we're gonna save that
we're gonna paste that in there and then
that's our carbon dependency downloaded
so obviously to require this in it's a
little bit more effort without using
composer but we can just require in libs
carbon carbon dot PHP and if we go ahead
and just refresh we shouldn't see any
errors so like I've said I would highly
recommend downloading this with composer
and keeping it as a dependency for your
project but if you want to follow along
and like I said if you're not quite
ready to use composer yet that's fine we
can still look at how we actually use
carbon to make working with dates and
times really really easy so let's head
on for the rest of the series and just
look at how we use carbon and how it
will improve working without eights and
times
