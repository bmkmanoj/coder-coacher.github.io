quick look at setting up a lamp stack
with digitalocean if you're not sure
what a lamp stack is it's essentially
just a server that runs Linux Apache
MySQL and PHP so this is going to be
perfect if you have a small project and
you want to get it hosted nothing major
no real set up here there's there's
everything being done for us so we're
going to look how we can do this with
digitalocean so the first thing to do
then is obviously sign up for a digital
ocean account if you don't already have
one and you're gonna want to hit this
create droplet button once you're logged
in and will see the following screen so
we're gonna go ahead and give this a
name in this case I'm going to call it
lamp just an example and I'm selecting
the 5 pound a month option so the
smallest box we can set up you can go
ahead and select the region that is most
suitable for you I'm gonna leave it on
the default of New York and down here we
have the ability to select an image now
by default this will be a bun tune at
the moment this is 14.04 but if we head
over to this applications tab it gives
us a wide variety of predefined setups
for each of these servers so I'm gonna
go ahead and hit lamp on 14.04 so this
will be Linux Apache MySQL and PHP setup
under the bun 2 server which is perfect
this is exactly what we want to do and
we're gonna go ahead and add an SSH key
for this this is really important so we
can access our server using a public and
private key so if I go ahead and pull up
a terminal window we can go ahead and
generate our SSH key public and private
key in here if you are working on
something like Windows then you can use
some software called putty which I'd
highly recommend and you can generate a
public and a private key this way I'm
obviously on OSX I'm on a UNIX based
system and I'm just gonna run some
commands here which will generate a key
for me but whichever operating system
you're working with you'll just want to
do the same as long as long as you have
a private and a public key available so
I want to generate a key inside of SSH
and at the moment I just have a few keys
here I'm going to go ahead
and or a couple of keys here I'm going
to go ahead and generate a new one so
I'm gonna use the ssh-keygen command and
that say RSA key and it asks me where I
want to save this so this will be saved
in the directory if we don't give it an
absolute path so I'm just gonna call
this lamp for now and I'm not going to
use a passphrase we just go ahead and
skip that so now you can see I've got
lamp which is our private key and lamp
top pub which is our public key so what
we can do is go ahead and say Kats lamp
pub that's going to give us the contents
obviously if you've just generated this
with something like putty on Windows you
can go ahead and just open it up so I'm
gonna copy this back over to digital
ocean and hit add SSH key and go ahead
and paste this in here and let's go
ahead and call this lamp just add this
and there we go so that's now selected
and we can go ahead and create the
droplet so that's gonna take a little
while once you've done that you will get
an email through about the lamp stack
that you've just created but you can go
ahead and give that a read and find any
more information there but once this is
done we're gonna go ahead and connect to
our server both through the through SSH
and through SFTP as well so once that's
all finished you'll see your droplet
displayed here and we're gonna copy the
IP address and paste it into our browser
and you can see here in that we have the
default Apache to Ubuntu page so this is
just basically a file within your web
root that you can go ahead and replace
with any of the files from your project
and we'll look at doing that in just a
moment
via SFTP so how can we connect as in SSH
to this server in case we want to change
anything within the server in case we
want to install anything else
delete anything so I have a look at
doing that next so what we want to do
then is using the key that we generated
connect to our server so we know that we
are in our SSH directory or wherever
your key is stored and whichever SSH
client you're using you might be using
Windows you might be using something
different you can go ahead and and
connect with that and choose your
private key to be able to connect in
this case though I
obviously just within the terminal on OS
X so to go ahead and connect we use the
SSH command and we need to define which
key we want to use and that's just lamp
remember it's not lamp top pub because
that's the public key that's stored over
on digitalocean
so we're logging in as root and we're
gonna paste the IP address in there so
let's just grab that again and go ahead
and paste that in there and we'll go
ahead and type yes should be over an
hour server in just a moment there we
are so you can see that digitalocean
gives you a little bit of information
here which is really useful so the first
thing is your web root location and
that's var dub-dub-dub HTML and you can
obviously go ahead and see that by using
HTTP as in the protocol which will
automatically connect to port 80
that's your web server details of your
PHP insertion can be seen at info dot
PHP we'll look at that in just a moment
all that is it's a file that's going to
go ahead and give your PHP info and your
MySQL root user's password is this you
can obviously go ahead and change that
or rather create new users and give them
permissions so the first thing that
we're going to do then is CD over to VAR
dub dub dub HTML and let's list the
files in here so we've got index.html
which is the file that you can see here
and we've also got info dot PHP which we
know is just going to give us the
details of our installation so if we go
ahead and look inside of info dot PHP we
can see that that just gives an opening
PHP tag PHP info function and then a
closing PHP tag so let's go ahead and
remove info dot PHP you don't to keep
that on your server it's really really
important and while we're at it let's go
ahead and remove index.html as well so
now we have nothing in this directory
and you'll see that we just get this all
this let's just refresh there we go so
we've got nothing here at all at the
moment so if you are working with a very
basic project or you just want to host
something you might want to upload files
via FTP and in this case we're going to
be using
SFTP which is obviously connecting to
your FTP server a secure FTP server
where you provide your private key to be
able to connect so I'm going to be using
FileZilla you can obviously choose
whichever FTP client you want to use
we're gonna go ahead and connect now so
let's copy this IP address again and
there's a couple of things we need to do
here we need to provide the SFTP
protocol and paste that IP address in
our username is root we don't have a
password because we're connecting via
our keys so if you open up files of the
settings you can go ahead and over an
SFTP you can add a key here
so if we click add key far you can see
I've got list of my keys within my SSH
directory and I can go ahead and put
lamp now FileZilla asks me to convert
this to a supported format so I can just
go ahead and type yes and in here I'm
just gonna say lamp F said for FileZilla
and we're gonna go ahead and save that
and there we go so it's added so let's
hit OK and we'll go ahead and click
quick connect and we'll go ahead and say
ok to this and that will take us through
to our server so let's just make this a
little bit bigger so we can see our
files and let's just go back a directory
and that's going to var it's going to
dub dub and this is our root directory
so let's just create an example file
remember we our root directory for our
web is inside of HTML here so let's go
ahead and create a new file in here
we'll just call this index.html you can
obviously drag your files over if you
want and when we refresh we obviously
don't see our directory listings we now
have an index to HTML father and really
that is pretty much it we have created a
digital ocean droplet with a premade
lamp stat so we have obviously Linux
running and as a Ralph rating system
we're running a bun - we have a patch
installed which we've already seen we
have MySQL installed which we know we
saw our password our root password when
we logged in so you can either go ahead
and remotely connect to that or you can
go ahead and do that within your
terminal and we know that we have PHP
installed as well because we saw the
result of the pH
the info function so there we go that's
how we easily set up a lamp stack on a
digitalocean droplet and you can go
ahead and host your project over there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
