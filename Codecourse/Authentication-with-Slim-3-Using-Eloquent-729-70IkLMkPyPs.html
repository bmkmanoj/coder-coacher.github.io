models in the best way possible so going
forward if we want to add any more
functionality change something it's
gonna be really easy to do we also want
something that's really quick to get
started with and also really easy to
work with so we're going to be
installing eloquent which you might know
is part of the laravel framework but of
course we can use this outside of
laravel and we can use it very easily
within our slim project so first of all
we're going to create our database
schema and just a couple of test records
then we'll pull eloquent in we'll set up
the configuration and we'll go ahead and
create a quick test to make sure we've
got everything set up so if you go ahead
and pull up whatever you're using to
work with your database I'm currently
working with a database called code core
so make sure you have one created and
then we're going to just going to create
one table this is the users table and
we'll go ahead and create all the
columns we need here so this is the
users table now my database manager has
inserted the ID and this is an integer
length of 11 it's unsigned Associates
has to be positive it's a primary key
and more importantly is an auto
increment so essentially just what you'd
expect from any kind of setup when we
create records this will just increment
so what we also want is the user's name
so let's go ahead and add this and I'm
just going to do the length as 255 and
we're gonna allow null for this one now
what we want is to accept an email so
again I'm going to do 255 but this we
will untaek for allow null we don't want
this to be null ever and then of course
we want a password so let's give that a
varchar
again we can choose 255 here and we can
remove allow null so as well as these we
also need to create a created at and an
updated at column that's because of just
the way that eloquent works it will have
a Creator that date when you create that
record and if you update it in any way
it will update the update to that column
to the current time so let's go ahead
and insert these so we've got created at
which is a timestamp and we have
updated act which is also a timestamp
okay so for these then that's all we
need really to just get started with
authenticating users so we've gone ahead
and set up our basic schema let's just
quickly create a record in here just so
we can test this obviously we're not
going to be able to enter a password
because we're going to hash this
password or whatever you password the
user enters so we can't really do much
with that at the moment so just a name
and an email is enough just for now okay
so now we need to pull eloquent in so
how do we get this well of course we're
going to use composer to download this
and then we automatically have it
available in our project so let's do a
composer require on illuminate database
like so and this should download version
five points something to hang on when
you're watching the video and we'll just
wait for this to finish okay great so
that has all downloaded we should now
see it over in our composer lot JSON
file it's there so we're using version
5.2 here and we can now start to pull it
into our project so the first thing that
we want to really do is look at the
settings because obviously we need to
know where we're connecting to so let's
just jump over to app and or rather to
bootstrap app and let's just add the
settings in here we won't use an
external package to manage our
configuration of course you can go ahead
and do that later but let's just add
them to our slim configuration that
makes a lot more sense just to quickly
get going with this
so for eloquence this requires a driver
because obviously we can use any system
we have available so any database
software we have available in my case
I'm using MySQL then obviously we have a
host we need to know where to connect to
my case it's localhost and we have a
database name as well in my case is code
course so next is the username and the
password
in my case it's root and root so I can
just go ahead quickly duplicate that
down and then we have some slightly
different ones so we have a char set
which is just the character encoding
we're going to choose utf-8 for this
armie us have a collation here as well
and that is going to be utf-8 unicode CI
so that's pretty much we need we can
also add a prefix to our table if we
want or our tables if we want but I'm
just gonna leave this empty that will
just prefix all of your tables with
something so for example code course
users but we don't really need that we
can just name them on their own so now
that we've got our settings we need to
actually set eloquent up so we're gonna
go ahead and do this just down here you
could of course extract this off to
another file but let's go ahead and see
how we pull eloquent in and then we can
get testing it so we're going to create
a variable called caption our capsule is
just the way that laravel lets us use
its component outside of laravel so this
might seem a little bit strange but
that's all we're doing here so it's
under the namespace illuminate database
capsule manager so from this what we can
do is we can say capsule add connection
and where is this data coming from well
of course it's coming from our settings
so to actually grab our settings we grab
them from the container because the
settings that we've inserted here can be
accessed under settings within our
container and then we just say DB so
here you can see we have DB in actual
fact this should be just here let's pull
this in and then we go perfect so now
what we want to do is go ahead and set
this as global and we'll see why we're
doing this a bit later on when we test
this out so set is global this will just
allow us to use our facades and then we
just want to boot eloquent and that is
it
we now have eloquent within our slim
project and we can use this if you're
not familiar with our eloquent don't
worry we'll be covering it of course so
now that we've done that we also might
need this on our container so we can use
this directly so there's two sides two
eloquent
we have the database builder so we can
select a table we can query it we can
use we're methods to grab data and sort
things and all that kind of good stuff
but we can also use models and then use
them as a kind of reference point to
each table so if we create a user's
model that means it's attached to our
users table and then we can just use
that model so again we'll see how this
works in just a moment we'll demonstrate
both of these so what we want to do then
is down here add this to the container
just in case we do need it so let's go
and crack Lowe's you're just here and
just up here let's go ahead pull in our
container we want to use capsule because
remember we've defined that just up here
so it's important that we do that and
all we do is return capsule simple as
that so not only have we booted this so
we can use it globally so we can use
models we've also done this so we can
access it via our container from within
our controllers okay so let's test this
out there and we'll do this on the home
controller so just down here I'm gonna
kill the page and then we can test it
out here so we know that we have a
user's table so why don't we just say
this DB table users and we'll say we're
ID 1 so this will give us this record
what we can also do is things like find
one that will grab the record with the
ID of one and of course we can get more
advanced with this we can do lots of
different where Clause is we can do
joins we can do pretty much anything and
of course you can find that all over on
the laravel documentation so let's just
have a look at this then so let's grab
this record and down here
we'll just do a var dump on user and of
course what we need to do it is just
assign that so now we should see there
we go we've got that record out there so
now we can do things like user email and
then we go string and my email address
perfect so that's all working so now
that we've tested
yes what we need to do is go ahead and
set up our models and you'll see how
beneficial this is when we actually go
ahead and set everything up and it is
very very straightforward to do and it
makes a lot of sense so let's jump over
to the next part and we'll croute use a
model and sort all that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
