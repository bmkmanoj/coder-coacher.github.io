between dates which can also be really
useful in a kind of real-life situation
and we'll take a look at an example
first at using something to calculate
how many years younger
someone is than someone else so let's
create two variables just imagine these
are dates that you have stored somewhere
or you're passing into your application
and we're gonna use a date string again
so I'm going to type in they just here
of course you can create these dates in
whichever way that you want to and we'll
go ahead and duplicate this line down
and create a new variable with a
different date in so let's say 25th of
October 1961 so what we want to do now
is echo out a string and say Alex is so
many years younger than Dale so let's
echo this out and we're gonna say Alex
is X years younger Dale so pretty
straightforward and inside here we can
go ahead and output this using a method
within carbon so we first used the first
date object which is named Alex and this
variable I'm gonna say diff in years and
then as the argument for this we're
gonna pass in Dale obviously these
variables would be named differently you
wouldn't give these a name but you get
the general idea and we can go ahead and
see how this works now so let's go and
refresh and there we go so we get alex
is 28 years younger than dale now as you
will have known by now we can also go
ahead and use things like if in months
if in weeks days hours minutes and
seconds so we can use all of these
methods depending on your use so I could
say minutes for example and we just get
the same result here but obviously
represented in the minutes so that's
pretty straightforward but now let's
look at some more interesting examples
in terms of the other methods that we
can use so for example let's go ahead
and create the current date
and time and let's go ahead and create a
new carbon object and let's say pars
plus two weeks so pars is just another
way of not having to say new carbon and
then pass some kind of string in here so
if we look at the first one we see the
following so we've got this date and if
we go ahead and do a vitamin C 2 you can
see that that's just two weeks into the
future so what we can do then is if we
have two weeks into the future we can
calculate how many weekdays difference
this is so that's to avoid dump on C we
use the diff in weekdays method and then
we obviously pass in the date that we
want to compare this to or check the
difference on and we see 10 obviously
because it's two weeks into the future
that doesn't include weekends so it just
includes the weekdays and obviously fire
at 5 is 10 so we've got two weeks worth
of data there so we can also use a
method called if in week end days which
is obviously going to just be a Saturday
and a Sunday and obviously that is for
because we're adding two weeks on and
there's two weekend days in a week we're
just adding two and two and that's four
so this might be useful to you so we're
now going to look back at the diff for
humans method which is really useful if
you are storing something in your
database like comments on something or
when a user was registered anything
that's really posted that you're
outputting to use and telling them when
something was created sometimes it's a
good idea not to just output the date
explicitly cuz it's a little bit
difficult to just scan through and read
so differ for humans works perfectly
here so what we're going to do is just
get rid of this and we're going to go
ahead and use the pars method and we'll
go ahead and say - two days ago or - two
days that's just to avoid dump on see
just check everything out here
good and then we can go ahead and use
diff for humans like so you can go ahead
and refresh and we see two days ago so
it's a lot better this way and obviously
we don't have to use this we can
obviously create a date or create a
carbon instance from a timestamp which
you might be storing in your database or
you might just be storing something like
this in your database so something like
this at twelve thirty two something like
that so you might be storing it in this
format in which case you can pass it in
you can go ahead and refresh and then
you get the human readable version of
when that date is so that's really
really useful for actually displaying to
a user as is implied from the method
named if for humans
so we've now come to the end of the
differences section next we're going to
take a look at modifiers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
