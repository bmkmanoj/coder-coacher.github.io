what we're going to be looking at is
constructors
so first thing I'm going to do before I
start explaining anything is create my
constructor so if you can't tell that's
actually two underscores there echo
constructed so basically a constructor
our constructor method is what we call a
magic method and all methods that come
with PHP that are prepended with two
underscores they are all magic methods
so we have things like underscore
underscore get and underscore underscore
set but we're not going to be looking at
these just yet
so the constructor magic method is
automatically called when an instance of
person is created or when it's
instantiated so as you can see all I'm
doing here is I'm echo constructed when
the class is instantiated so if we go to
our code into a browser and hit refresh
we get constructed and we can actually
inject things through the conductor our
constructor using arguments like so so
I'm going to set I'm going to take name
and age I'm going to set this name to
name and this age to age and now what we
can do is we can get rid of all of this
and we can add our little parentheses
after this class and sensation just like
we do with a function and we can pass in
the name and the age so John and he was
20 and now hopefully we'll get the same
result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
