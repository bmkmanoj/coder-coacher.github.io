additional rules just so we can make
sure that this can be extended and the
first thing that we're gonna do is he
create a very simple additional rule and
that is checking if a string is
alphanumeric or not so this relates to
something like a username where you may
want to use a name to not contain any
special characters you might want it to
just be something like for example Alex
1 2 3 so let's define this additional
rule we're gonna say Alf Alf numeric
true or we could just say something like
owl none so we want this to be
alphanumeric so any letters from the
alphabet and any numbers so inside of
validator we want to go ahead and add
this as additional rule so owl num and
we also want to add a message as well so
this is going to be all num that is not
a or rather we should say the field
field must be alpha numeric or more sort
of appropriately to a user must contain
only letters and numbers you could just
write that so down here what we want to
do then is introduce this new method so
let's just copy and paste this for the
sake of simplicity and we'll say owl num
remember the name the same function name
as the rule and then in here we've got
the field value in the satisfier so in
here we can actually use the seeds hype
owl num function this takes a string
value and returns a true or false values
of boolean and obviously this is just
going to be value so in this case now we
can just submit in actual fact let's
change this to all
and get rid of the key so now it's
saying the username field must be
alphanumeric let's provide some correct
information here so this is now okay but
now in the user name if we just submit
we can see that that's all okay in the
user name or change this so only this
fails so Alex with an exclamation mark
would be invalid the username field must
be alphanumeric where is something like
Alex 1 2 3 is absolutely fine so that's
an example of adding a very simple rule
what we're now gonna do is actually
extend the form a little bit and we're
going to add two password fields and
we're gonna check if these two fields
match and then we're gonna have a few
things that we may need to update within
our class for this to actually work so
let's say password and say repeat
password so this is quite a common
example we normally see that we have to
repeat passwords so let's Kuan password
on one password again sorry that should
be password again there so we've now got
this additional field so we need to type
a password in here and a password in
here so what we want to do is we want to
say something like password and we want
password again now we need this to be
required but we could actually omit this
because if we have something like must
match this password field here that
means that this also must or this also
must fulfill these requirements so in
this case we can just remove all of
these there's no need to redefine them
rules for something that should match
something
so we must work will same match password
now bear in mind this isn't the string
that it should match it's the the same
of value that it should match so we want
to say the password again must be the
exact match for the other field called
password so again like I said we need to
make a couple of adjustments in here
because what's gonna happen here is if
we just add all of our other things in
so match match and in here the field or
the field must match let's chose it's
the field field must match the and we
could say something like
field match field so we can replace
these in like we did before but the
first thing that we want to do is we
need to compare these if we if we think
about adding this method we're going to
have a method called match with the same
arguments in we can keep these same
arguments in but what's going to happen
is we need to say return the first field
or the first fields value is equal to
something and this will return true or
false now where do we get this other
field from what's actually going to
happen here is this is going to
basically grab the value of it that's
stored somewhere and this is a little
bit difficult because we're not actually
storing the items anywhere so I'm gonna
create a method up a property up here
called items and what I'm gonna do is
here I'm going to say this items equals
items so now inside of here we have
access to this items and then we can
pass in a value like a square password
again so let's just run through what's
happening here we are we've got a field
called password again and we want this
to match to the password so this is the
value so really what we need to do is we
need sorry this is the satisfier so what
we need to do is we need to say that the
satisfier is going to be the field we
need to look up so the value here is
going to be the value of what whatever
we're given and then the satisfier needs
to be looked up so to test this out
let's do an echo on the satisfy here and
we'll follow that by the value
so let's just kill at this point so we
did a little bit of debugging so when we
submit we've got passwords here so the
reason this isn't displaying is we
didn't enter both so I'm gonna enter
password in here and one two three four
five in here so that's a password for
the original value and one two three
four five for the password again they
obviously don't match so if we remove
this this will basically return true or
false if it's false that means that
password doesn't equal one two three
four five in that last example and
that's true
so let's now fill this in and see what
we get
we'll notice that we get a problem and
the error message I entered earlier is
also going to be an issue but we can now
look at what we can do to resolve this
so I'm gonna type in password and one
two three four five six and we see that
we get the password again field must
match the password again match field
this is a little bit confusing the
reason this has happened is I've entered
this field match placeholder here which
field is getting replaced here as well
leaving that underscore match now we
don't actually need to do this field
match what is happening here remember is
we're using the satisfier name to access
that value therefore within here the
satisfier is the field that we want it
to match so we can literally just pass
in satisfy here when we refresh we see
it says the password again field must
match the password field so we've added
a couple more elements to this validator
and it just goes to show how easy it is
to expand this for your needs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
