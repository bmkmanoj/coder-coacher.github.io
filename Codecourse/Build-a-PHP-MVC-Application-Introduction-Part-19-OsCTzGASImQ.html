building a simple MVC application
structure so you can start building your
application in this style so MVC stands
for Model View controller and it's an
application pattern or a programming
pattern that basically allows you to
separate your views from your models
which update and give you data basically
and the controllers will handle that
data from the models and update the view
it does sound complicated but it's a
nice way of working and most frameworks
now will use this structure so let's
take a look at how this works you can
see I'm within the public directory this
would just be the equivalent of just
landing on your domain or something like
that so public directory is just the
root directory at the moment what it's
doing is it's rendering out the home
index view or the home indicus
controller and that's rendering out a
view here so this is the view coming
from the home index controller home is
the controller and index is the method
within that so don't know if that
doesn't make too much sense now it will
make sense by the end of this series now
what we can actually do is specifically
access different controllers and
different methods within those
controllers so I can explicitly define
here I want to access the home
controller and the index method if I get
rid of this
it still works out the same way it will
just render index by default and home is
actually the default controller as well
hence when we land on the index here or
the root directory it automatically
gives us this now we can also pass in
parameters and you can see here that
I've got this alex is happy this is just
two parameters that are passed down so I
can actually choose a different
parameters now I've only got two here
parameter 1 and 2 but I can change this
as well
and that would just update the variables
that are passed to the view and
obviously these are accessible in the
controller as well so just taking a look
at the source code this is the HT access
by the way this just handles the ability
to have them short URLs and we've got
inside of this app
remember we've got the index dot PHP
file inside here this is the bootstrap
file this basically just creates a new
app we've got controllers we've got a
home controller here you can see here
that we've got index this takes a name
and a mood like we've already seen we've
got default values and it grabs a user
model just as an example this has
doesn't actually do anything useful but
then we render a view using this view so
we're gonna be building all of this from
scratch so it'll be your very own
skeleton to this inside of models we've
got this user model which just allows a
public name to be set we're just doing
that here just as an example and inside
of views we've got our home index view
which is what we could see earlier so
you can see here data name and data mood
that's how it passed in basically so you
can go ahead and add additional
controller methods here so let's do this
now so let's say call this test I'm just
going to echo out test' you would
normally echo out values from this
controller I can now access home tests
and that will then do that for me so
this is extremely useful and you may
have work with MVC frameworks before but
now's the chance to build your own so
we'll be doing this within the series so
the next thing is setting everything up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
