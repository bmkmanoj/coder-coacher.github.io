record we can do so an update a specific
field and create a new value for this
and we can also update multiple records
as well we don't just have to update a
specific record but again the where
clause comes into this so let's just
take a look at these syntax of updating
so i'm going to say update articles so
we say update articles so it updating
this specific table and then what we
want to do is choose what we want to set
so we say set and then we choose the
column name so I'm going to say that set
name equals working with mysql and
things now what this is going to do is
if i was to run this now this would
update all records and set the name of
every single record to working with
mysql and things now we don't want to do
this what we want to do is provide a
where clause which we've already seen
and we want to choose a specific record
so we can choose a record by however we
want to do it we can choose it by
whatever column we want it doesn't
matter but in this case I'm just going
to say well ID equals 1 because I know
that the record with the idea of one is
the working with MySQL record and I want
to update the title of this to working
with MySQL of things when i hit enter on
this it says query ok one row affected
so now let me go ahead and select
everything from articles and you can see
that the working with mysql article has
been updated to working with mysql and
things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
