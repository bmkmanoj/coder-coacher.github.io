this Java series for beginners in this
video we're going to be introducing one
or two new concepts and then we're going
to be building a text-based game using
all the stuff we've learned so far so
the first thing we're going to do we're
going to create two objects now objects
are a new concept I haven't discussed
them yet at all we can look at them more
in depth in further series but for now
all we need to know is some basic things
about them which I'm going to explain
along the way so the first thing we need
to do for our game is be able to handle
user input so let's go ahead and make a
comment here this is going to be by far
the the most coding we're going to do
this series because it's actually a
whole finished project so I'm going to
go ahead and make a comment here saying
system objects we're going to create two
objects here the first one is going to
be something called a scanner now the
way we create objects in Java is very
similar to the way we create variables
so we go ahead and declare the type of
variable / object we want and then we
give it a name I'm going to call it in
for input and then we can go ahead and
say equals and we can set this equal to
a new scanner and then I'm going to go
ahead and open in closed brackets here
and then a semicolon so we haven't
actually looked at this at all you're
going to notice this is highlighted in
red here it's because it can't find this
class it's not defined anywhere in the
packages we've already got what we need
to do is we need to do something called
importing now scanner comes with the
Java development kit this is a built-in
class that Java has for us if we go
ahead and press Alt + Enter you can see
this first one here add import for Java
util dot scanner if you're not using the
same ideas meat you don't need to press
the OL Enter you can just go ahead and
manually type this in at the top
underneath the package declaration and
before we start the class you can just
go ahead and write import
java.util.scanner
so this scanner object here we're going
to go add first of all and wrote system
dot in now this syntax looks quite
confusing if you remember from most
tutorials we use system dot out dot
print line obviously the out is for
output and we can print stuff out with
that but the system dot in is actually
for input so if we put this inside the
scanner object
we're going to put this inside the
brackets here and it's basically we're
saying use the input from the system in
this scanner object and we can use this
in and we can use some of the methods it
has to help us take input from the user
now it doesn't really matter if we don't
understand the concepts of the object
fully yet we're only using this for
input and it's not super important how
it actually works how the how the sort
of object behind it works so we're going
to go ahead and make another object and
this is pretty much going to be the most
confusing part random R and we're going
to cool it we're going to make an a
random object called R and right here
we're going to set it equal to new
random and we don't put anything in the
brackets this time so what a random is
it's a random number generator and we're
going to be using that for part of our
game we can go ahead and hit alt enter
again and import java.util at random and
again you could do it manually if you
don't have that keyboard shortcut so now
that we have these two objects here
again not super important to know how
these work here all you need to know is
we can use this in variable here to get
input from the user and I'll be showing
you how to do that and we can use this R
and object here to get random numbers so
again not super important doesn't really
matter if you understand the object how
these like objects work so let's go down
a couple of lines we've got our two
system objects now so we can get user
input and we can make random numbers so
let's go ahead and make game variables
now so we're going to be making a
dungeon type game we're going to be a
hero in a dungeon and there's going to
be enemies and it's going to be randomly
generated a combat and we'll hit them
for some damage and now he'll ask for
some damage and will basically keep on
going until our characters dead and
there'll be some other factors too like
we could use health potions to bring our
health back up and other things like
that so for the game variables let's go
ahead and declare what enemies are going
to be in this dungeon first of all so
let's go ahead and make a string array
and this string array is going to hold
the names of all the enemies that we're
going to make so let's go ahead and
appropriately call this enemies and then
if we remember the way we do arrays we
can put equals and then the spike
brackets and now we do a comma separated
list of enemies so I'm going to go ahead
and write skeleton I'm going to have a
zombie going to have warrior and an
assassin so you can put more if you want
the way we do the program means that you
can add as many of these as you like
because it's going to randomly cycle
through all of them and pick one so now
that we have some enemies set up the
names of the enemies let's go ahead and
make few new variables for these enemies
we're going to go ahead and say int max
enemy health now every time we go an
attack or going to combat with an enemy
it's going to randomly generate the
amount of health they have and this is
going to be the maximum amount of health
they can possibly have so the number is
going to be from zero to this number
here I'm going to go ahead and set this
at 75 but again you can play around with
it you can set these to pretty much any
numbers you want you can see how it
works when you change them the next
thing we need is an attack damage for
the enemy we need to know the max attack
damage or the the maximum amount of
damage an enemy could do to our
character when we're going so let's go
ahead and call this enemy attack damage
we can set this to 25 for example we
don't want our character dying too
quickly so now that we've set up the
enemies we can go ahead and say player
variables we're going to stop some
player variables here so first things
first we'll have the health of our
character we can go ahead and set this
to 100 again you can use whatever values
you'd like we can set our players attack
damage how much damage we can do to
enemies we can go ahead and be a bit
biased here and allow our guide to do
more damage to the enemies than they can
do to us then we'll go ahead and do some
more variables we want our we want to
keep fighting as long as possible so we
want our person to be able to heal up
we're going to make a health potion
mechanic we're going to make it so our
enemies are we're going to make it so
our character can have a health potion
if he's low on health and he can go he
can get more health stats for that so
we're going to go ahead and write num
health pots and this is going to be the
number of health pots that are that our
character starts out with so again this
is the the health our player starts with
this is the attack damage of our player
and this is the amount of health potions
that our player will start with you can
go ahead and add comments to the side of
each of these if you'd like so we you
can easily remember which ones they are
so we need two more variables for the
health potions we need to actually give
some stats to them so we can say integer
health health potion heal amount so this
is the amount of health the potion heals
for I'm going to go set that to 30 and
we can have one final integer health
potion drop chance now this drop chance
here
we're going to make a mechanic so every
time you kill an enemy there is a
certain percentage chance for them to
drop a health potion I'm going to go
ahead and set this to 50% and I'll just
add a comment here to say percentage
because it may not be obvious so this 50
here means 50% chance to drop a health
potion again play around with these
numbers you can make them whatever you
like this is going to work either way so
now what we need is we need a boolean
variable we're going to call this
running I'm going to set it equal to
true now this running variable is going
to be part of a while loop it's going to
be the condition for a while loop so the
game is going to keep iterating over and
over until we tell it to stop or till
until some conditions are met so that
the game has to stop so we're going to
go ahead and add a system.out.print line
here
and we're going to give a welcome
message for the game so we can say
welcome to the dungeon and this is the
start of our game right here we're going
to go ahead and say while running and
now in this while loop this is where the
whole game happens before we go into the
while loop though we're going to add one
thing to this while loop and that is a
label now we'll see why we need this
soon so I'm going to go ahead and write
game and then a colon so what I've done
with this is I have labeled this while
loop game so game is now the name of
this wallet and we're going to be using
this label here a bit later so that we
can tell our program to iterate back to
the start of this world loop here that's
why we need this label right here so now
that we've done that there's going to be
a lot of system.out.print lines in this
program right here just because because
it's a text-based game there has to be
loads of text printed out to the screen
so I'm going to go ahead and copy and
paste something I already have and that
is a system.out.print line with just a
lot of dashes in it like right here and
I'm going to keep this copy and pasted
because this is going to be a set this
is going to be kind of separator like an
amount of dashes that we're going to use
so now let's go ahead and move down in
the wall loop the first thing we need to
do is start start combat with an enemy
the first thing we're going to do is a
find an enemy set up the stats for it
and then start combat with it so let's
go ahead and say int enemy health now if
you remember up here we set a variable
called maximum enemy health and this is
the maximum amount of a health an enemy
can have but it can have a kind of more
than this but it can have less because
we don't want it to be the flat 75 the
whole time so we're going to go ahead
and set the value of the enemy health
each time because again it's going to be
random and we're going to set this equal
to Rand which is the random object we
have here and I'm going to show you the
methods we use now we can go ahead and
put the full stop and then you'll see
there's a lot of method a lot of methods
here we're going to use this one here
called next int and it takes one
parameter
so this parameter is the maximum value
that this random that this random
integer can be so the integer that is
generated is going to be between zero
and the number given and the number
we're going to give is our variable
right here maximum enemy health so at
the start of every iteration we're going
to set enemy health equal to a random
number between naught and the maximum
enemy health so now we're going to go
ahead and set a string called enemy we
need to know which enemy we're fighting
again this is going to be randomly
generated it's going to be a random
selection from one of these here so we
need to access one of these random names
so we're going to go ahead and see
enemies grab the array and then do the
square brackets and now as we've learnt
we need to put the index of the array
inside the square brackets here and the
index in this case is going to be a
random integer between zero and the
length of this array so by doing by
banking it between zero and the length
of the array we're going to generate a
number that is either 0 1 2 or 3 and
it's going to randomly pick one of these
each time so inside the index for the
array we're going to say round dot next
int and then the parameter is going to
be enemy's dot length so we're accessing
the enemy's array here and then the
index we're using is a random integer
between 0 and the max length of this
array here so now that we have the name
of the enemy we can go ahead and system
dot out dot print line and I set this up
beforehand so there's going to be a so
we can actually format the game it took
me a while to format it in the text
obviously because this is a text-based
game all in the output of the that all
of a Java system to out dot print line
output it's kind of hard to format it so
I've used lots of separators like this
and I've used tabbing and things like
that so I've set this up ready so if you
just copy the way I type it it should
end up looking pretty good so the first
thing we're going to say is which enemy
has appeared too
our character so if we go ahead and do a
backslash n at T this is the character
for tab in the console so we're going to
tab for words one and then we're going
to say we're going to do this hash
symbol here and then a space then we're
going to say plus enemy which is the
string variable here the name of the
enemy that we've just retrieved and then
we're going to do another plus we're
going to concatenate on and then just
write a paired and then we're going to
do a hash and then a backslash and then
n so let's explain what this string is
so first of all we do a tab then we do a
hash like this and then we do the name
of the enemy and then appeared and then
another hash and the backslash n make
sure it moves on to the next line so
it's like a line break we're moving on
to the next line so if I do a comment
here I'll show you what this would look
like as an example so we'd be tabbed in
some then there'd be a hash and it would
say skeleton has appeared for example
like that and we need to actually add
the word has for that so this is an
example of what it would look like in
the console so now that we have the
enemy appearing we need to set another
while loop because we have the while
loop for actually running the game this
is this while loop here is where we grab
the enemy and we have it but then we
need another while loop for when we're
actually in the combat with the same
enemy we need to keep iterating until
this enemy here that we've just create
setup is dead we need to make sure this
one dies before we move on to the next
one so we're going to go ahead and say
while enemy health is greater than zero
so that should be pretty straightforward
the enemy health is this random integer
here that we've generated between naught
and the max enemy health and we're
saying whilst the enemy whilst the
enemy's health is greater than zero ie
whilst the enemy is alive we're going to
go ahead and do what we're going to do
so we first need to set up for the user
a list of commands that they can use
because the way we're going to be
interacting with the user in this game
is we're going to be saying which option
would you
like to pick and then there's going to
be 1 2 3 4 etc and it's going to have
options for each one and then the user
is going to have to input 1 2 3 4 and
then hit enter so that's how the input
is going to work in this game so let's
go ahead and say system dot out dot
print line put some speech marks in
there
and I'm going to copy this down five
times the keyboard shortcut in NetBeans
at least for copying lines if you press
control-shift
and then the down arrow you can just
copy the lines like that and if not you
can always just highlight and copy paste
as you would normally
so in these five system.out.print lines
we're going to go ahead and set up the
options and the first thing we're going
to do is print out the HP of our
character each time we fight this enemy
each time each iteration of combat I
guess you can call it we want to print
out our health so we know how much
health we have left so we're going to do
this /t for a tab again we're tabbing in
two into it a bit so it's going to look
nicely formatted we're going to go ahead
and write your HP but colon and then
concatenate on our health value we're
going to go ahead and tab we're going to
tab for each one we're going to catenate
on the enemy the name of the enemy and
then we're going to add apostrophe s so
it's going to be the enemy's HP and then
we're going to concatenate on the enemy
health and then once we've concatenated
on the enemy health we're going to go
and ahead and give the option to the
user so we're going to make a line break
with this backslash N and then we're
going to tab in with the backslash T and
then we're going to say what would you
like to do and now this is where we
present our user with the options so
we're going to go ahead and tab in again
and we're going to give them the option
one for attack and I've just copied the
line down once more because I'm going to
have three options we can have option
two for shrink health version and we can
have option three for run
so we've given three options to our
character we can either attack the enemy
drink out potion or run away from the
enemy so let's go down here a bit now
this is where we need to get the input
from the user so this is how you get
input from the user using this scanner
object here we're only going to be using
this variable in and it's pretty simple
we're just going to call one method from
it and it's pretty simple so we're going
to say string input so we're going to
get the input of the user whatever the
users typed in we're going to get that
input and we're going to say it's equal
to in which is our scanner object up
here right there we're going to say in
dot next line and it's as simple as that
this in dot next line it grabs the next
line from the console which is basically
if I run this I can show you so you can
see our games already set up kind of
we're not finished it yet but you can
see welcome to the dungeon
Yugi's Amba has appeared it gives us HP
their HP what would you like to do so
we're presented with the options and
then we can type in one two or three
we're going to add some validation to
make sure they've picked a valid option
and basically when I click one and hit
or when I type any input and hit enter
it's basically after you hit enter this
input here is what this method here
returns this in next line
it returns whatever you type after you
press ENTER so in this instance this
string here would be stored in input and
then we could do whatever we want with
that so once we have the input we need
to actually see what they want to do so
I'm going to go ahead and use some if
statements here we're going to say if
input dot equals and we've seen these
string functions so if input equals one
we're going to do this and then we're
going to add else if input dot equals
two we'll do something else and then
else if
else--if input dot equals three we'll do
something else and then finally we'll
have our final else statement without
the if so if all else fails we're going
to do this and this is going to be our
validation so if it's not equal to one
two or three the user hasn't typed in
anything valid and we're going to go
ahead and just repeat the loop we're
going to go back up to here so the first
thing we have to do for input one so
input one is attacking the enemy that's
what we've offered the user here so if
they press one we're going to attack the
enemy now there's a few things we're
going to do for this we're first going
to set up two integers we're going to
say integer damage dealt and int damage
taken now whenever you attack the enemy
you're going to deal some damage to them
and they're going to deal some damage to
you that's how the attack mechanism in
this game is going to work so the damage
dealt is going to be equal to rammed dot
next in again this method generates a
random number between zero and the
number you put between these brackets so
the random damage that we're dealing is
going to be between zero and our attack
damage that we have here again you can
edit these variables as you wish so
random int attack damage so we're going
to generate a random number between zero
and fifty now the damage taken is going
to be equal to R and next int and it's
going to be pretty much the same thing
except we're going to go for the enemy's
attack damage instead of our attack
damage so we've got two variables here
damage dealt damage taken and they're
equal to random numbers between zero and
the values we've set on these variables
so very simple we need to do now we
simply need to take the health the
damage dealt take that number away from
the enemy's health and damage taken take
that away from our health we could do
that pretty simply we've seen it before
we can say enemy health minus equals
damage dealt and health minus equals
damage taken
so our health variable here our max our
player's health we're going to - the
damage taken from it so our health goes
down and same with the enemy health
right here the one that we set up at the
start which is a random maximum health
we're going to minus it from the damage
dealt so you can see now whenever the
user inputs one we're going to my NASA
random amount of health from the enemy
and then slowly but surely enemy health
will become less than zero so we'll
break out the while loop and then down
here we're going to add some stuff
saying you defeated the enemy so let's
go ahead and add some system.out.print
lines now again I've set this up
beforehand so there's going to be some
formatting in it so we're going to go
ahead and tab in and then do a greater
than sign and then we're going to say
you strike the and then we're going to
add on concatenate on the name of the
enemy and then say four and then
concatenate on the damage dealt and then
the word damaged so it's basically going
to say you strike the enemy name of the
enemy for X amount of damage whatever
this damaged out variable was then below
it we're going to pretty much do the
same thing we're going to say system dot
out dot print line and we're going to go
ahead and tab in with the backslash T
and then do the greater than sign and
then say you receive and then
concatenate on damage taken in
retaliation so you receive X amount of
damage in retaliation so we've - the
values we've told the users what value
we told the the player what has happened
in the game and then we're going to go
ahead and add a little check here if
we've happened if we've died and we are
actually haven't killed the enemy if the
enemies killed us we're going to add a
little if statement here we're going to
say if our health is less than or equal
to zero or we can simplify and just say
if our health is less than 1 we can say
system
dot out dot print line and say Tabon do
an arrow and say you have taken too much
damage you have taken too much damage
you are too weak to go on so this is a
little check here for if our health goes
and then what we're going to do is we're
going to say break like so and this
break statement here is going to breaks
out this while loop it's going to bring
us down here if I'm correct yep whereby
break is good
oh it's because I've got across okay so
here we are down here this is where
we're going to set up what happens when
you die it's going to say you have been
defeated blah blah blah whatever so
let's go ahead and finish the other
inputs first of all so for input two
we're going to drink a health potion
this one's going to be pretty simple so
we're going to say if our number of
health potions remember that's a
variable up here how many health potions
we have if the number of health potions
is greater than zero ie we have a health
potion then we can go ahead and simply
say health plus equals health potion
he'll amount so we're going to add on to
our health the amount that a health
potion heals for then we need to minus
the health potion from our inventory so
num health potions - - simply going to
minus one from the collection so to make
sure we've actually used it and we're
not sort of keeping them and infinitely
using them then we're going to add a
feedback printout to our user so they
know what they've done and again this is
formatted pre formatted so I'm going to
say you drink a health potion
healing yourself for and then we're
going to add on the X amount the health
potion heal amount and we concatenate on
. here then I'm going to press ENTER and
tab in a bit we're still in the same
system.out.print line just going to tab
and make it look neat make sure we have
this plus here for concatenate in just
remove the spaces there so you drink
health potion healing yourself for X
amount then on the next line we're going
to go ahead and said black backslash n
that brings it down to the next line and
then backslash T to tab in then we say
you now you now have plus health so the
amount of health we actually have and
then HP so it says you've healed
yourself for X amount you now have Y
amount of health I'm going to go down
once more to the next line and we're
going to say backslash n for the next
line backslash T so new line and then
tab then you have we're going to tell
them how many health potions they have
left so num health potions health
potions left and then backslash n to do
a new line so this is the little
feedback information we've given to the
user if they use a health potion we
first check if there's a health potion
available we then add the health on that
out the amount it heals for onto our
health then we take away one from the
inventory and we give them this nice
feedback here saying you heal for X
amount you now have Y mount of health
and you have Z amount of health potions
left we're going to go ahead and add an
else statement as well in case the user
doesn't actually have any health potions
left and it's going to be system dot out
dot print line
and we're going to say backslash T for
the tab and then the R and we're going
to say you have no health potions left
and then I'm going to say defeat enemies
for a chance to get one because we
haven't added it yet but the mechanic is
for when we defeat an enemy there's
going to be a random chance stated here
this percentage chance a random chance
for an enemy to drop a health potion so
it's looking pretty we've got a lot of
code going on here we're going to all go
over at the end though in case you
missed anything so what we're going to
do now is in this else--if down here
number three was run so our third option
was to run now in this instance we're
going to give a feedback to the user
telling when they run away and then
we're going to reiterate the loop and
that's why we have this game loop here
and I'll explain the reason in just a
second so on this in the case of the
user typing in the number three we're
going to go ahead and do a system dot
out dot print line and we're going to go
ahead and say tab in and say you run
away from the and then add on the name
of the enemy again again the name of the
enemy is still in scope we declared it
all up here and we're still inside the
same while loop so we can use all these
variables up here we still have so we're
using the name of the enemy so we run
away from whatever enemy it was and
we'll concatenate on an exclamation mark
at the end there so now this is where we
need the label we're going to go ahead
and use continue and what continue does
is it moves to the next iteration of the
loop it says okay ignore everything else
below this point just go back to the
start of the loop the problem is we're
already inside a loop and we don't want
to go back into this one because this is
the combat loop where we're fighting the
same enemy we actually want to go one
further up back into the main game loop
so we can generate a new enemy and start
the combat again so this label right
here this game label we're labeling this
while loop here the main one
we're just labeling it game so when we
come down here we can say continue and
then just put the labeled game so if we
didn't put the word if we didn't put the
label game in there we would continue
with the loop we're currently in so we'd
come back up to here and then we
wouldn't be running from the enemy we'd
just be refreshing the whole combat
cycle and we'd be to offered the same
options again so by saying continue game
we're going to break out of this loop
here and we're going to continue on it's
going to find a new enemy and forget we
ever fought this enemy in the first
place so that's why we have that label
there and that's the third option done
so the final else statement if the user
didn't type in one two or three if they
typed in random stuff or they didn't
type a valid number we're just going to
give them simple feedback and we're just
going to say tab in and say invalid
command and this is fine to just say
this because basically if we manage to
reach this else here and say invalid
command we're going to head it's because
it's a while loop nothing happens so
we'll head straight back up to the top
we'll just be offered the options again
so the user has another chance to look
at the options they have and then do
whatever they want to do so we've got
quite a lot going on here at the moment
so we've started our main loop and we've
initialized the enemy we have we've said
whilst the enemy's health is greater
than zero we're going to offer the use
of these options then we're going to go
ahead and get their input here then
we're going to go ahead and say if then
play equals one if they pick the first
one we're going to go ahead and attack
if it equals two we're going to do this
and if it equals three we're going to do
this so let's go ahead and come out of
this while loop now just making sure
I've got the brackets right here so the
first thing we're going to check for is
if once we're out here we need to check
why we broke out this loop did we break
out the loop because we defeated an
enemy or did we break out because our
health went to zero so you can see if
our health is less than one we go ahead
and say break so we've broken out of
loop right here so the first thing we're
going to check for is if our player is
dead we're going to say health is less
than one and we're going to say system
dot out dot print line and we're going
to add a descriptive sentence such as
you limp out of the dungeon week from
battle so that's the little thing that
we do if our health is below one we say
a limp at the dungeon weak from battle
and then we go ahead and break if I
could spell break there we go
okay so break here we'll break out of
the main loop the while running loop and
then it will come out to down here where
we're going to add we'll add a message
at the end saying thanks for playing or
something so first thing we checked if
our health was less than one we do the
description and break up the loop if I
health wasn't less than one and we broke
out this loop up here it must have meant
we defeated the enemy so we still have
all the enemy's stats up here and it's
name and stuff so we can still use them
down here remember we haven't we've
initialized them here we've done the
whole combat loop and then we've come
down here outside of the loop so we can
still use all those variables so right
here underneath this we're going to go
ahead I'm going to grab that copy and
paste thing I had which is this
separator here it's just a
system.out.print line with loads of
dashes and again it's just for
formatting purposes so I'm going to say
it's a system out print line and we'll
be using some hashes for formatting now
as well so we're going to do an
concatenate on the name of the enemy and
then concatenate on was defeated and
you'll see you'll see when we actually
run this how the formatting makes it
look it makes it look nice and neat
we've got all these we've got the
formatting going on we've got the
separators it makes it nice and easy to
read the code is not as readable but the
actual game for the user is fairly
reasonable
so we'll add another print line here so
in this line I didn't explain it we
basically just added that formatting we
said enemy was defeated so the name of
the enemy was defeated go ahead and add
some more formatting here we're going to
tell them you have we're going to tell
our we're going to tell our player how
much health they have left you have
health HP left so we've told them they
defeat the enemy we've told them how
much HP they've left now we're going to
go ahead and add our random drop chance
so remember we have a percentage here
health potion drop chance if we defeat
an enemy we want a 50% transforms drop a
health potion again you could change
this percentage to whatever you want
so the equation we're going to use here
is if R and dot next in and then we're
going to put a hundred in is greater
than health pot drop chance so let me
explain this we're generating a random
number between 0 and 100 if the random
number is greater than the percentage
chance for the drop and actually it
should be less than not greater than
sorry so if the number is if the number
between not 1/100 is less than the drop
chance
it means the random number landed in
that area so it means making the number
high will be more likely so if I make
the drop chance 99% obviously a number
between a random number between not 1
100 is highly likely to be less than 99
which means that the chance is higher
and so I'm going to keep that 50 at the
moment you can change it where you want
and similarly say I do 10 a random
number between naught and 100 is much
more likely to be greater than 10 as
opposed to less than 10 so I'll go ahead
and change this back to 50 so that's how
a percentage drop chance works so inside
the if statement here we can say
health potions and just say plus plus
will add one add one health potion then
we'll give feedback to the user they
want to know that they've actually
received them so add I'll formatting and
say the enemy dropped a health potion
then we'll just do some more useful
feedback for the player we'll just tell
them now the total amount of health
potions they have after that drop so you
have potions and it could be ambiguous
so we can just add that brackets s
because they could only have one health
potion so we've added one to the health
potions we've given the user feedback so
that's the random drop chance for the
health potion so we've said enemy was
defeated how much help they have left
we've randomized the drop of a health
potion and told them if they have
received one then we're going to go
ahead and add a little separator here
and we're going to give the user some
more options we're going to go ahead and
say system dot out dot print line we're
going to say what would you like to do
so we'll have two morons here we're
going to have number one as continue
fighting and we're going to have number
two as exits dungeon so after we've
every time we defeat an enemy we're
going to be presented with these two
options do we want to fight another
enemy or do we want to exit the dungeon
so let's go ahead and do the same thing
we did above we're going to go ahead and
get a string called input and set it
equal to n dot next line that's the
input of the user then we're going to
say while and we're going to set up a
little while loop here and if you
remember from this while loop if the
enemy entered invalid information we
have this final else statement here that
said invalid command and then the loop
would reiterate back to the top and just
print out the options again we need to
do something similar here because if we
don't validate the input that the user
has we're going to go right back up to
the top so if the user types in
something wrong it won't say invalid
command for example it would just go
straight back up to like fighting a new
enemy so we need to make sure we so
we're going to make a while loop and
we're going to basically say whilst the
input the users providing is not equal
to one or two ie while the user isn't
inputting valid information we're just
going to keep looping and asking them
what they want to do so we're going to
say well the input is not equal to so
equals the exclamation mark meaning not
of course while it's not equal to one
and it's also not equal to two then
we're going to go ahead and say system
dot out dot print line invalid command
and then go ahead and set input equal to
in dot next line
so this validation here we grab the
input that the users put in whilst the
input isn't equal to one or two whilst
it's not a valid input when it's not
equal to one or two we're going to say
it's not valid by saying invalid command
then we're just going to grab the next
bit of input they put in and hope that
it is valid so as soon as they enter
some valid input this wallet is going to
be moved over and we can actually get to
our options down here so we can say if
input equals one go ahead and system dot
out dot print line and then we can say
something like you continue on your
adventure and then we could say else if
input dot equals to system dot out dot
print line and this is the case in this
case the users defeated the enemies and
he now wants to exit the dungeon so this
is like the victory screen basically so
you exit the dungeon from your
adventures and you can add like a school
system if you want again this is fully
customizable you can play around with
the add in code you want I'm just laying
down the ground the groundwork for you
to use so I just realized I should have
move that across a long time ago that's
been taking up a lot of space okay so we
have our code here now we've done quite
a lot so far we're almost finished and
we can actually see the final thing so
we have the final two options for the
users if they choose to exit we
obviously need to say break we need to
break out of the loop so this breaks out
this while loop here and then finally
let me just make sure the brackets are
right
so what running will come out of this
loop here and then we're just going to
go ahead and say thanks for playing
system dot out dot print line and copy
this down twice we're going to make it
look nice with formatting
just going to add loads of hashes here
and we're going to say thanks for
playing I'm just going to make sure
these line up nicely with each other
there we go so we've got our nice thanks
for playing message at the end and this
game is pretty much done so I'm going to
go ahead and we're going to run this and
we're going to take a look at it let's
go ahead and drag this right up so we
see welcome to the dungeon and now let
me actually walk you through the code as
we're doing this so the first things
first I don't need to talk about the
variables again we initialized all those
fairly simple welcome to the dungeon
prints out as you can see and while it
begins the game starts so
system.out.print line we print out again
just for formatting so the first thing
we do is we randomized the enemy's
health we get a random name for the
enemy and we print it out to the user we
can see that's exactly what's happened
we can see skeleton has appeared it
prints out our HP which is start to get
a hundred from the start and the
randomized number for the skeleton was
72 now we're presented with the three
options here attack drink health potion
and run let's test the anomalies first
of all before we test the others if we
type in random input you can see we
receive invalid command and the loop
starts again up here it prints out all
of this again what would you like to do
let's put on put in for for example
again not a valid input so we need to
put in one two or three let's go ahead
and test one first of all we go and hit
one we can see it randomizes damaged out
damage taken and we take away
accordingly and then we print out for
the user so you strike the skeleton
thirteen damage and you receive five in
retaliation then it prints out both of
your HP so let's keep attacking this
till one of us dies so you can see it's
still printing out printing out
everything we do so I hit it for 26
damage and receive 22 so skeleton was
defeated you have 54 HP left what would
you like to do now so let's go ahead and
continue fighting press 1 and then we
can see
assassin has appeared so where are we
we're up here so to randomize the enemy
again we printed out everything as usual
let's go ahead and test our health
potion mechanic so if we press 2 we can
see this happens we drink health potion
healing yourself or 30 you now have 84
HP let's just check yet we had 54 we
added 30 and you have 2 left let's go
ahead and drink health potion I'll add
30 again and then go ahead and drink
another one added that again let's try
and drink another one we know we don't
have any left it says you have no health
potions left the fee enemies for chance
to get one so let's go ahead and run see
what happens you run away from the
assassin and you can see it's refreshed
we have a new enemy so you run away from
this enemy we've received a new one
let's go ahead and attack and attack
again just to kill it you see it was
defeated let's try and get a random
health drop it should be too hard if we
keep just spamming one okay let's just
see what happens when we die then okay
here we go we got the random drop here
so you have six HP left the skeleton
drop down potion you now have one health
patient so that's our random chance
coming in we're probably going to die to
this zombie there we go so you would
strike it for that you receive x-mount
you have taken too much damage your two
weeks go on you'll impact the dungeon
weak from battle and then thanks for
playing you see the thanks for playing
message at the end so yeah that was
pretty much the whole game done
everything I hope everything made sense
you can go back in the video if you
missed anything I don't think I need to
recap it all again pretty much the
hardest parts about this with the
conditionals like the ifs what if what
input and then all of this stuff it's a
lot of code to look at but it really is
all quite simple it's everything we've
covered so far the only things we
haven't covered with these two things
but it's fairly straightforward and you
only need to use one method from each of
them so yeah go ahead take this game
customize it how you want
just play around with it learn learn
Java by just editing the numbers seeing
what happens you could add in your own
Mechanics for this game it's pretty
customizable I can think of a few things
you could do already you could maybe add
validation so you can't go above 100
health with the health potion you saw
that happened you could also maybe add a
total tally score for how many enemies
you've killed and then print out at the
end here when it says thanks for playing
those are just a couple of ideas you can
do to customize this game a bit so ya go
and have fun with that and I hope you
enjoyed this Java series for beginners</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
