welcome to another video tutorial series
on the popular PHP framework coding
vendor we'll be showing you in this
video series in this video series is
I'll be building a registration login
system in PHP with code ignitor where
you'll be able to log in with an email
and password you'll which will send you
to a Members Only restricted access page
which you can only access if you've
previously logged in you'll be able to
log out from there
and in addition you'll be able to sign
up using going clicking on the sign up
page from clicking on the sign up page
from there you'll enter your email
address and your password twice just to
confirm your password which will send
you an email you'll click link that
you'll receive in the email it'll sign
you up log you in instantly and from
there you'll be a registered user and
you can log-in it at any time and have
access to the members only page this is
a very popular model for most websites
today so I've I find I think that this
material will be extremely useful if
you're using code you matter and you're
not sure how to do this yet we'll be
talking we'll be using a the database
class will be using sessions we'll be
using the email class which I'm not sure
yet have showed it to you before but
maybe in a more applicable way so yeah
let's get started right away then in
this in this video tutorial tutorial
series I won't be installing CodeIgniter
from scratch instead I'll just have this
pre-installed version I've put it in the
folder called to underscore user
underscore site which is the title of
this project I guess ok and the first
thing that I want to do actually is a
web sex out of this here is install this
mod rewrite functionality so that I can
access much so that my URLs are cleaner
in order to do this though they've
actually changed changed where the wiki
is and everything so if I actually want
to to do this all I have to do is type
in CodeIgniter on Google click on the
wiki page right here
and that'll take you to a github wiki if
you if you go to the actual pages scroll
all the way down to em see mod rewrite
right here okay and this is a five step
five step process to installing this
this mod rewrite module but I can do it
in I can show you how to do it in two
steps if you're if you're doing it on a
web server or you know whatever so what
you'll do is you'll just copy all of
this code in in this block here and the
number one create your dot htaccess file
and what we'll do actually is in the
root directory of the installation of
CodeIgniter on our system whether it's
on a web server or on your are on a
local server what you'll do is you'll
just create a new file call it dot hg
access and you'll see that I'll be right
beside index dot PHP and license up txt
open that up and there you'll just paste
the code that you copied from the
website and lastly if this isn't in the
root directory of your web server for me
it's actually in a folder called
tutorials slash to underscore user
underscore site and then you follow that
by a slash because that's where the
index.html
installation of code igniter will be so
for me just tutorials in to underscore
user underscore site I'll save this and
then we can test it out and see if it
works
so we know that in code igniter the
default controller setup right right
when you download the zip file from the
web site is called is the Welcome
controller right so I'll open that up
and you can see that the Welcome
controller the first the index function
of that just loads the welcome welcome
message view so in this case if I if I
go and type in welcome it should
redirect me okay perfect and this is
exactly what we're aiming for so we can
have in a kind of our welcome and then
slash index and then third
be any parameters that were actually
passing in and these two first two
folders are the two folders that I
actually specified in my dot H D Access
file slash tutorials and slash to
underscore user underscore site and
that's right there and then here's my
actually here's my actual installation
and if you're not sure why I'm pretty
sure there's a better explanation in my
previous tutorial series so go and check
that out if you're finding difficulty
here so index index yeah okay cool
the next thing that I want to do right
off the hop is create a database now I
have one set up here it's called you
just use your tutorial or whatever so
what I can do is I'll create two two
databases right away one called users
with three fields okay it's going to
make me blog ending in user tutorial
okay at my password saved yours will be
very similar I think whether you
actually have a hosted MySQL server or
just a local one so I'll create a tape a
new table called users with three fields
because this is just going to be very
simple first one will have yet will be
called first field will be ID
it'll be an integer under extra we're
going to auto increment it and set it as
the primary key
next would be email for our chart and
just set these to 255 that's the max
that of our chart can be and you know
I'd rather not really worry too much
about this stuff and the second would be
password again we can just set this to
255 will do all the restricting with our
code and just leave this open and we'll
save this and next we're going to create
another one call it temp underscore
users and this one will also have three
three fields the first will also be ID
it'll be an integer we're going to auto
increment that and set it as the primary
key
and then we'll have an email address
stored here this will be 255 characters
and this will have a key and that will
also be 255 characters save this if
you're not interested sure what this is
for just I just do it and we'll use it
later and it'll make full sense once
we're finished okay so now we have our
mod rewrite installed we have a database
setup that we're going to be using and
and yeah I think that's where I'll end
this video in the next video we'll
actually start building out the login
view with the form helper and yeah I
think that's where we'll leave that one
so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
