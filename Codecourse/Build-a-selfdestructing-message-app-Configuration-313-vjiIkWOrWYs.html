configuration for our application so as
it grows in size we can just manage
anything that we need to configure very
easily from one file or multiple files
if you want to split them out so let's
just create a configuration file for the
things that we perhaps need to configure
and then we'll install a package which
will allow us to easily load in this
configuration and this is hassan khan
config and it's a really lightweight
file loader you can load in lots of
different types of configuration and it
works really nicely so to start off with
we need to actually install this
dependency and if we head over to the
github page you can see that it does
give us instructions to do this it's
just composer require house and con
config so let's pop this into our
terminal again and wait for this to
download and now that's done we can
actually attach it to our container now
let's create this config file that I
spoke about a minute ago so I've created
a folder called config this is outside
of the app directory but it's still not
within the public directory so this file
can't be browsed so inside of here I'm
going to create a new file and this is
going to be a PHP now you can separate
out your configuration files if you want
but I'm going to be adding everything in
here just for a little bit more
simplicity you can load them in when we
look at actually loading in
configuration you can load multiple
files so that might be something you
want to do if something gets a bit hard
to manage so from this file we're going
to return an array and we're going to
set our base URL for our project now in
my case this is just localhost but when
you go live this will be the domain that
you're using so now we can set our DB
configuration so I'm creating a key
called DB and inside of here I can
create a configuration file for each
driver I want to use in our case we're
just going to be using MySQL so our host
name is 127 001 it's just the server
we're connecting
to the database name is going to be
destructive but obviously you can choose
whatever database name that you that you
have we have a username to connect and
we also have a password as well so now
that we've got this we can when we do
get round to attaching PDO to slims
container we can just pull these
configuration items out but at the
moment within our bootstrap file we're
not doing anything we're not loading in
this configuration and to do this all we
need to do is create a new container
instance which is a new slim container
and then we just add items to our
container and this keeps everything nice
and tidy it means you don't have to
instantiate anything else in any other
these files they're just all done within
our bootstrap file so i'm going to say
container config create a closure just
here and we have C in there which
represents the current state of our
container and in here we return a new
noodle house config object now noodle
house is the old vendor namespace that's
why it's not hacen can't just said in
case you're a bit confused about that
and in here we can load in our config so
we just say config a PHP if you did want
to break these up into multiple files
you can pass this that's an array and
then you can just have multiple files in
here we're just going to leave it as
this one for now so finally we need to
pass this container instance into slim
so we can access it from our roots and
we're pretty much done here so to test
this out what do we do well from our
roots from any roots we create we now
have access to this item config on the
container and to access this all we do
and we're just going to echo this out
we're going to access this config and
now we're going to use the get method
which is part of that conflict package
we can use a dot notation to pick out
say the host we would just say DB dot
MySQL dot host or just dot URL or just
URL so inside of our roots then we can
say DB dot MySQL dot host and that
should give us 127 dot dot dot one so we
now have a really nice way to pull
configuration from our roots and we can
also do this with in here in other
container items so for example when we
set up our database so now that we've
got that working and as long as you've
tested it here and you know that it is
working we can go on to install another
fundamental part of the framework that
we're going to be working with and that
is working with slim views and we're
going to be working with twig if you've
not worked with twig before don't worry
it's fairly straightforward to get
started with we're going to attach this
to our container and that means that we
can separate all of our logic within our
routes from our views</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
