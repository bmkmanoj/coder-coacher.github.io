needing to convert an array into an
object and I'm going to show you a
really easy method that allows you to do
this the first thing I want to do is go
ahead and create an array and this is
just going to contain an items property
with another array inside of it just so
we can work with a slightly more complex
data structure than just a couple of
elements in here so I'm going to say
something like milk eggs and bread
so we basically now have an array inside
of an array so let's do an echo on this
and wrap this in pre-tax and we'll use
the print R to go ahead and output this
so this ends up looking like this we've
got an outer array an items property
which contains an array with three
elements within it so let's convert this
to an object so I'm going to create a
variable called object just so we can
establish the difference between these
two items now we're going to be using
JSON encode and JSON decode a JSON is
JavaScript object notation and PHP
provides us the ability to encode and
decode JSON so for example if we wanted
to convert a string a JSON string into
an object we can use JSON decode to do
that and in code we'll take an array or
something and it will turn it into a
JSON string that can be transported but
we're not using that for this purpose
we're just going to do something a
little bit different just to convert
this so the first thing I want to do is
I want to encode this array let's take a
look at what this sir outputs or let's
do a void ump on this instead
so we've now got a string of length 33
and this is basically given given us a
JSON string that we would normally go
ahead and store in a database or
transfer somewhere else
now because we've now got string we're
in the position to use JSON decode to
format this into an object a JSON decode
by default will convert or decode a JSON
string into an object unless you provide
a second option which is a boolean which
will be true or false so for example if
we were to do JSON decode on this
already encoded string and we were to
say true we get an array so we get an
array of these items so what we've done
now is we've effectively decoded
something back from it being encoded but
if we choose false here or omit this
altogether what that's going to do is is
it's going to turn it into an object so
now let's do a print R on this object
and you see we've now gone object with
items and then an array within it now
there's nothing wrong with having an
array in here because we can still
access these items so for example if we
wanted to say something like for each
object items as item and we wanted to
echo out an item appending on a space we
can now do this so that's basically how
we convert an array into an object using
PHP remember we've encoded it and then
we decoded it using the JSON and JSON to
code and JSON encode for functions and
then we've basically got back an object
from this which we can loop through and
do whatever we want to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
