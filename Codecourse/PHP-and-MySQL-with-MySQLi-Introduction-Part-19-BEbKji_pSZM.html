working with PHP and MySQL to connect to
a database and retrieve information
update information and all sorts of
things like that we're going to be
working with the MySQL I extension over
the MySQL extension which has been
deprecated as of PHP version 5.5 and not
recommended for use so we'll be looking
at how we can create a test database and
we're going to be using a graphical user
interface called PHP myadmin that just
allows us to easily insert and create
tables and update records and view
records rather than the sort of daunting
nature of the MySQL command line to most
people so we'll be setting up a test
database inserting some records from the
very very basics where we're looking at
this so if you're entirely new to
working me this kind of thing this this
will work from the ground up so don't
worry well obviously connect to our
database we require a connection and
then we'll look at selecting data from
our database and then retrieving the
record so we can actually output them to
our page and then we'll look at updating
deleting records and how we can check
how many results have been returned or
how many results have been affected by
update queries and then we'll look at
inserting records as well and that
follows on to the importance of escaping
data and then we'll look at binding data
as well which is a useful way of binding
binding variables to queries so we're
basically going to work from the ground
up and by the end of this series you
will be hopefully feel comfortable with
creating tables query data inserting
updating records so you'll basically be
able to manipulate a data base in your
application so that's what we'll be
looking at in this series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
