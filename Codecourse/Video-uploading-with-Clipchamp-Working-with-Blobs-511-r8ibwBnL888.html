like as your Amazon s3 and YouTube we
can choose our output as a blob so
essentially with this we can just do
whatever we want we're not technically
uploading it anywhere it's within the
browser we can go ahead and send it off
to a back-end if we want we can place it
straight into a video player which is
exactly what we're going to look at
doing or the user can then go ahead and
save this their computer which we're
also going to cover so let's take a look
at changing this over and we need to
change a couple of things over here so
when we change the output to blob now we
don't have anything up loading so
instead we use the on video created
method so let's take a look at what this
looks like and then we'll go ahead and
do some really cool things for this
let's pull over a video and go ahead and
submit it and now that's done in the
console you'll see a file this is a
JavaScript file interface this will give
us the name of the video which is always
really helpful I will give us the type
in our case it's a video and before
because it's already being compressed by
click tramp all within the browser and
we have a load of other stuff as well we
don't need to worry too much about this
what we need to worry about is how we
can maybe get this straight into a video
player or allow it to be downloaded to
the users computer so to do this we're
going to first we'll look at an html5
video player so we're going to create a
html5 video play on here the source
obviously we don't need at the moment
you can include an empty source I
suppose it doesn't really matter and in
here let's just create an ID of video
player and will allow some controls on
there as well so now in here we can take
that blob and we can set it directly
into the video player so it's not being
uploaded anywhere is just being
displayed on the page and of course you
can use that then send it off to your
back-end maybe and of course in the
project we're going to do in the next
section we're going to look at exactly
how we do that so let's just go and
target our video player
and we're going to change this source
attribute now we can't just say video
what we want to do is say window URL
create object URL and we just pass that
file into there or that blog and that is
it what we've now done is we've gone
ahead and allowed this to be shown in
that video player so we'll see this kind
of empty video player here we can go
ahead and test this by dragging over a
video and submitting that will do all
its usual stuff and of course it won't
upload it it will just place that
directly into this player of course this
could be great if you were allowing your
user to preview a video outside of clip
champs or maybe on your own web page and
then you can go ahead and allow them to
save this you can send that off to your
back-end and store it however you want
to so the next thing we look at is
really interesting going to allow the
user to download the video so let's just
go and get rid of our html5 player for
now just sit some get in the way and
we're going to use a dependency called
file saver JX so if we head over to CD
njs let's go over and search for files
over there it is and we can go ahead and
copy the minified javascript here so
let's pull this into our project here
inside of a script tag and this is super
simple to use you can check out the far
safer j/s documentation or github if you
go and click on this link but it is
literally as simple as saying save as
and then going ahead and giving the
actual video like so and then the file
name so in our case let's just call it
video mp4 so just with that that's all
we need to do with the power of clip
chap and that nice dependency we can go
and upload a video like so go ahead and
submit it and you can see if I just pull
this up a little bit this has now been
downloaded so I can go ahead and click
on this you can see if I just pull over
my player here this is now in downloaded
directly to my computer really
straightforward stuff so here you have
almost complete control in fact you have
complete control over the video the
you've uploaded using clip chap and you
might be thinking well what's the point
in doing this well clip champ remember
is compressing the video for you it's
doing everything that would take you so
much time and energy to actually do
yourself so it's all done within the
browser not going anywhere else and you
can either pop it straight into a video
player send it over to your back-end or
you can use something like this if you
wanted the user to download the video
and then they have a nice compressed
video download to the computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
