what cross-site request forgery is we're
now going to build a class which allows
us to quickly and easily protect against
cross-site request forgery so the first
thing that we're going to do is actually
look at the markup
and understand what we actually need to
do to be able to send the token now as
we've previously looked we need another
input field with a hidden value and this
is going to represent the token that we
want to send the server so let's go
ahead and just factor this into what we
already have here now all that we really
have is a standard document markup a
form a field here an submit button and a
hidden field that represents the product
ID so this isn't too complicated it's
just a standard form that you might
submit and this could be anything as
long as it performs an action on the
user's behalf it's worth protecting
against with cross-site request forgery
protection ie the token that we're going
to be generating so we have a hidden
input type here and the name of this is
going to be token this can be called
anything you like it doesn't have to be
called token and we're going to be
putting the token just in here but let's
ignore that for now because we don't
have the ability to generate a random
enough token yet so let's go ahead and
look at what we need to do inside of
token dot PHP and also what we need to
do an index stop PHP in order to
actually use this so probably the first
good idea would be to start sessions so
we can use session data in PHP or we can
actually store data within a session so
basically we just use the session start
function to initialize sessions have the
ability to use these on the page because
we're going to be storing the token
that's generated on each refresh in a
session now we also want to go ahead and
require in the class that we're going to
be building so this is token dot PHP and
I have placed this inside of a classes
folder here
that's just located there so this will
be classes for
touken dot php' now this is going to be
a static while we're going to have
static methods to this class just to
make it a little bit easier to work with
but if you haven't worked with
object-oriented programming these just
work like functions really we just
reference them under the token class
name so you'll get to see a little bit
more how we deal with this now initially
what we might want to do is we might
want to check if a quantity has been
submitted and a product has been
submitted and eventually Warner tech to
check for tokens been submitted so we
might want to if statement here with an
is set in just to check if we have
submitted this data correctly so this is
going to be post data and the first is
going to be the quantity so the quantity
here is the name of this field so we
definitely require a quantity now this
doesn't actually validate the quantity
doesn't check if it's numeric or
anything like that we're not interested
in that for now that's a you know a
whole other explanation
sorry post we also want to go ahead and
we want to check if the Product ID has
been specified so that's product there
and we'll leave the token for now we'll
add this in just a moment so let's go
ahead and define two new variables which
is product and that is dollar underscore
post product and likewise for the
quantity
there we are so we've now defined these
two and we can go ahead and echo them
out do what we want with them but we'll
go ahead and just check that they're not
empty there we go so these are required
fields now let's go ahead and just
output okay here for now just so we know
that the code that we've written so far
works all we're doing is checking of
this this data set storing them inside
of variables and then we're checking if
they're not empty and outputting okay so
as long as we submit this form correctly
we should be okay there we are
so all this missing now is our
tokenization of the form and the ability
to protect against cross-site request
forgery so what we need to do is we need
to build this class so we use the class
keyword and our class is called token
we're going to have two methods inside
of here and the first one and these are
both going to be public and they're
static so we can access them using the
scope resolution operator which we'll
look at in a moment it sounds more
complicated than it is so we have the
ability to generate and we have another
method as well and this is going to be
the ability to check and to check we
need to pass in a token and that's going
to be the token that we generate inside
of our form and that's going to check it
with the token that's being set in a
session so that's the token there so for
the generate method what do we need to
do well this is extremely simple we want
to apply a randomly generated token to a
session and then return it so we can do
this all in one line and what we
normally do is we'd say session token
and we'd set that to a random value so
you know for example 1 2 3 4 5 all this
is going to do is it's going to place
this value inside of this session now we
don't want to do that because that's not
a random value that's hard-coded so
we're going to use
a function called OpenSSL random pseudo
bytes and we're going to pass in 32 as
the length so if we go ahead and and use
this now I'll explain a little bit about
the options we have in just one moment
there we are so this is the function
that we're using this requires OpenSSL
to be install or installed or included
as a module in your PHP installation but
you can look around the internet and
find other suggestions of how to
generate the most random characters you
can so you know it really it depends I
mean it's good to read up on things like
this anyway so this is just something
that was recommended to me so I decided
to check it out and use it and feel
satisfied that it would generate a
random enough character that it provides
a good random enough string that
provides a good level of protection now
what we also need to do is we also need
to base64 encode this because otherwise
it's going to mess out our page up so we
use base64 encode and wrap that in
what's returned by the OpenSSL random
pseudo bytes function now go ahead and
these up in the PHP manual as well read
them understand what they do and how
they operate what they return
particularly this one if you if you're
deciding to use it and also remember
that transferring this functionality to
another server might mean that it will
break because open SSL isn't installed
so you might want to either include a
check or use a different method it's
definitely not good enough to perhaps
use something like md5 and use the
unique ID function in PHP it would
provide a level of protection an
acceptable level of protection but it's
generally seen as not random enough for
secure applications so what we also want
to do here is we want to return the
value that we use whilst we're setting
it and and setting the value of this
session
so let's go ahead and just play around
with this generator method and we're
going to apply this to the token value
of our form so let's go ahead and open
and close some PHP tags and we want to
go here and echo
token which is the name of our class now
notice that we aren't instantiating it
usually what we would do with a class is
we would say something like token equals
new token now we can actually do this
but there's no need because we've
provided a static method here so all we
need to do is use the scope resolution
operator and say generate and that's it
so by calling this method on the token
class what we're doing is we're setting
a session and we're returning it at the
same time and that allows us to use the
echo constructor actually output this to
this page so let's take a look inside of
our browser and refresh this page and
check out the form here so you can see
that we've got this randomly generated
value as well but let's also go ahead
and modify our code so we can actually
output the value of the session so down
here I'm just going to say echoed
session token in fact let's go ahead and
do this down here because it won't be
available at the top of the page now
what we might want to bear in mind is we
might want to set the session up here or
the logic up here and then output the
variable that holds this down here but
it doesn't really matter too much to be
honest so when i refresh now you can see
that whatever we have in here matches
the actual value of the session so if we
compare this which is in on the on the
source of the webpage that the user has
generated or being brought back from the
server to their browser we can compare
this against this value that's actually
in a session you know of the user
session so these two match so as long as
they do match this form has or you have
a very good idea or a very good
indication
this has been submitted by a user so how
do we actually check this well we need
to go ahead and fill in if you like this
check method and this is relatively
straightforward there's nothing there's
nothing complex about this at all we
need a simple if statement just to
basically check first of all if this
session is set if this session isn't set
then it's likely being sent from
somewhere else or the users deleted the
field from the forum using a web
inspector or something like that but
generally for users legitimate users
this value should be set and the token
that's provided should match this tech a
token we've stored in the session so if
I go ahead and use the is set construct
and say is set session token so we want
the token set we want this token value
to be set and then we also want to check
the token now remember we pass in the
token that's been submitted by the user
we want this to be an exact match for
the session or not an exact match sorry
with using type checking here which
isn't you know strictly necessary but
it's it's a nice touch to make sure that
you know when using type checking it's
fine
type checking really is irrelevant here
because by generating a random string
you're never really going to end up with
anything like one which might be which
might be interpreted as a true value or
something like that but anyway we won't
go into that so if the session has been
set and the token that's been provided
matches the session token we can go
ahead and return true but what we also
might want to do is we might want to
unset the current value that we have
inside of our session superglobal so now
what we want to do is after this check
we want to go ahead and return false and
that's because if this check or this
this this if statement evaluates to
false we want to go ahead and obviously
we're not running the block with the
code within the block here so we just
want to by default return
folks so now that we have the ability to
check the token we can factor this into
our form here to make sure that the
token that's been submitted by the user
matches so this is extremely simple we
just need an if statement and this if
statement basically just uses the check
method and we want to provide the token
that's been submitted by the user we
also want to check that this token has
been supplied so we add this to our is
set construct a list of comma separated
values and then what we do is we can go
ahead and pass this in to our method so
what's happening now is we are
generating the token when the user
submits the form we store a couple of
values which is relevant to what we're
talking about really and we check if
they're not empty we could also check
our guess if the token is not empty but
that's not entirely necessary and then
we use the check method which we've just
built here passing in this token that's
been submitted and that will check if it
matches if it does match we go ahead and
okay or in the case of our application
we go ahead and process an order add
something to a cart post a comment on a
website upload of picture if you know it
really doesn't matter
so under quantity let's go ahead and
type in one click order and we have
success we've processed an order now
let's go ahead and modify this here and
change this to something completely
different in fact let's go ahead and get
rid of it first of all type in one click
order nothing happens so we've protected
against it in that way let's go ahead
and now append ABC to the end of this
string and go ahead and again try to
order a quantity of 1 and it doesn't
work we arrive back at the state that we
would naturally find ourselves in
generating a token setting a session and
we order and we can order successfully
so we've looked at what cross-site
request forgery is how it can affect
users and we've also built an extremely
simple class
allows us to quickly inject a randomly
generated string and check this and
ensure that the form has been
legitimately submitted by a user</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
