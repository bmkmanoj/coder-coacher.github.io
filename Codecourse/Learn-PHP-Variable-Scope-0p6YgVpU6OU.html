scope and we're gonna take a quick
example of creating a variable and
trying to access this within a function
because this is something that you might
come across and might seem a little
strange that it doesn't work so when we
talk about variable scope we talk about
the visibility the other parts of your
code have over variables in other parts
of your code so let's take a look at a
quick example and I'm gonna say name
equals Alex and then I'm gonna create a
function called get name and within this
function I'm going to echo out name now
don't worry too much about the syntax of
this function will be going over
functions later but I'm gonna go ahead
and echo get name up sorry I'm gonna
call get name now if we take a look at
this code line by line we see that we
set the variable name we create a
function that echoes name or we could in
fact return name but for now we'll just
echo name so we would think yet well
this will find the variable name up here
it will echo it out once we call the
function so let's take a look at what
actually happens here well we get a
notice in PHP telling us that we have an
undefined variable name but looking at
this code we actually do have a defined
variable called name so why hasn't this
worked well within functions in PHP the
scope of the function in terms of the
variables that we use need to be defined
within this function so for example if
we were to say get rid of this and place
it within our function this will then
work so if we refresh we get the value
that we expect but because initially it
was outside of this function it can't
find this variable name because it's
looking for a function that's been
defined within this looking for the
variable that's been defined within this
scope so how can we combat this now what
we're gonna do now is demonstrate risø
it's not necessarily considered a good
practice there are other ways to work
properly with this for example using
classes but we'll look at how
we can actually combat this and how it
makes sense and this is by using the
global keyword so buddies in the global
keyword we can basically create a
variable or define that we want our
variables to be accessed globally so I'm
just gonna say global name and that's it
so now what's going to happen is name up
here is going to become global and
therefore we can then use it within this
function so if we go ahead and refresh
now there's no change so the code that
was previously not working is now
working now there's a hell of a lot of
information on the PHP in the PHP
documentation about this so it's a good
idea to take a look around look at some
examples and understand how this works
but basically when we deal with scope if
you find that variables that you're
using are out of scope you might need to
either change the way you work or if you
absolutely need to define a variable as
global you can go ahead and do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
