while loops now once again these are
less commonly used but it's still really
important to gain a basic understanding
of how these works just in case you do
come across them or of course more
importantly if you do need to use them
so let's take a look at the structure of
a while loop this is a little bit
different in the way that we set the
kind of condition in here but it's
pretty similar to a for loop and
obviously pretty similar to anything
like an if statement or any kind of
block so inside of the parentheses is
the expression that will allow the loop
to run until it evaluates to false so if
we were to put for example zero or false
in here then what do you think is going
to happen in here so let's just say will
this run and we'll go ahead and check
this out
in the browser now obviously like I said
this will run until the expression here
evaluates to false so in the browser the
office he don't see anything okay so of
course at the moment this loop is
pointless there's no real reason to set
this in this way but let's look at how
we recreate counting from one to ten as
we saw with the for loop using this loop
I think this is always a really good
exercise because it kind of gets you to
use it so what we're going to do and
this will kind of prove to you that a
for loop is much better for that task
but we're gonna say we're gonna set a
current number up here which again could
be anything it doesn't have to be
counting from one to ten and we're gonna
choose when this ends at so we're gonna
start at one and we're gonna have a
current number as one and we're gonna
end at ten you could call this start at
if you wanted to now what we're gonna
say is increment by and we're going to
set this to one we want to increment
this by one every time so because we
can't do all of this inside of a while
loop we're now left to actually do
everything that we need to do inside of
the block and of course our expression
will go in here so we're gonna say while
the current number is less than or equal
to the end apt value so while one is
less than ten we run this now of course
at the moment this will run so let's now
increment this and then we'll echo out
so again I say current number plus
equals or we could say current number
equals current number plus but obviously
plus equals is a little bit simpler and
we're gonna say increment by and that's
the value that we have stored there now
let's echo out the current number and
we'll append a break on and let's head
over to the browser and see this in
action and there we go now why is this
happening is pretty much done what we
wanted because it's looped ten times but
the problem here is the ordering of us
outputting and then incrementing so
let's think of it this way we are
incrementing while the number is one so
this will give us two therefore we're
echoing out two so it's basically just
an ordering thing now again you wouldn't
use this for things like counting from
one to ten but you kind of get the idea
so there are a couple of ways to solve
this one which is probably less
favorable and the other one which is a
little bit easier the less favorable
solution would be disable the current
number is zero and I want to end at nine
that means that on the first loop this
will be incremented to one and then we
were output the number and then so on
until we get to nine but on the last
loop it will increment again so we will
end up at ten so you can see here we get
the right result but that's a bit
confusing because we actually want to
end at ten so it's kind of better to say
well let's start at one and end at ten
and the solution here is to bump this
line up so we echo it out before we
increment it so let's take a look and
you can see we get exactly the same
result so like I said this is an overly
complicated way to loop in this case to
just output a number from one to ten or
even with pagination you would use a for
loop it's much easier so why are these
loops useful well first of all this
gives us a lot more control over how we
initialize and check because we have a
block like this it allows us to create
if statements within we can use switch
statements whatever where else we need
to do to control the loop with a for
loop remember the control is all within
the initiator here then the condition
and then the increment so we have
limited control so think of this as a
kind of
replacement but with more control inside
of the block it just makes it a little
bit easier so let's create an example so
again we're all for real-life examples
we're going to create an example where
we want to know how many times we have
rolled a dice to reach a specific number
so let's say in real life I was after
the number six
maybe I roll a two then I rolled a four
then I roll a two again maybe a 1 and it
carries on going like this until I reach
six and then I stop because I have
reached the original number I wanted to
roll and we're gonna output this using
PHP so let's think about how we would
want to do this well let's first of all
define number I want and I'm gonna set
this to a three and we need to kind of
before we even look into this figure out
how we generate a random number between
one and six well if I just echo out here
Rand which is another PHP function this
takes two arguments the lower and the
upper value and if I go ahead and check
this out you can see that this will go
ahead and generate a random number
between 1 and 6 for me and every time i
refresh that will be different or every
time I call this it will be different
okay so now that we know how to do that
let's create our while loop and let's
start to think about how this might work
well when we go ahead and run this loop
what we want to do is inside of
parentheses at the same time assign the
random number that we get using that
rand function to a dice roll variable so
all we're gonna do in here is we're
gonna say dice rolled equals so it
assigning now we're not comparing Rand
one to six so as it stands at the moment
this will run forever and it will go
ahead and dice roll every time this
loops will be regenerated and assigned
to dice round so hopefully that makes
sense okay so now what we want to do is
for the condition we want to make sure
that it doesn't equal number i1 if it
doesn't equal the number you want then
in here we're gonna say you rolled a say
a 2 we need a 3 so let's say echo you
rolled a and I'm gonna put an X there
and then I'm gonna say we need a Y so
let's replace these variables in you
rolled a
and now because we've assigned that
variable here we can use in here we need
a and then number I want now I've put
these in curly braces here you don't
need to do that unless you were playing
something directly after it and in this
case actually we were we're using a
comma just here okay so now let's run
this and there we go let's go ahead and
add a break on just so it's a little bit
easier for us to see and you can see
here you rolled a two we need two three
you rolled a four we need a three you
rolled a two new three and so on and so
forth now this loop hasn't infinitely
run because the condition here is that
the number that's been generated while
this is looping doesn't equal number i1
so when we finish this loop it means
that it does equal the number we want
now down here what we can do is say you
rolled a number I want exclamation mark
and now we have the following you rolled
a three so as we refresh this we rolled
a three first time this will give us a
good idea about how this is working so
you can see that sometimes it's much
longer because the random number wasn't
three as we generated it but hopefully
this makes sense so this is kind of a
useful example of why you might want to
use this however again this will arise
as you need at to use a while loop and
then you'll know oh I can use a while
loop and when it does apply to you you
know exactly how to use it okay so you
need to be really careful when you're
writing while loops in particular
because they can cause infinite loops
all loops can cause pretty much infinite
loops but if the statement inside of
here like I said before never evaluates
to false the loop will run continuously
and this will probably cause your web
server to crash so I can quickly
replicate this if I just go ahead and
say while true obviously because we've
hard-coded this value in here it's never
going to stop now if i refresh the page
very quickly and then very quickly stop
it you'll see what I mean so if i
refresh that you can see it's constantly
loading and this isn't good so I'm gonna
stop it here just so we don't run into
any problems but that's something to
watch out for
check that the condition within the loop
will always at some point evaluate
or you will cause an infinite loop now a
variation of the while loop is something
called a do-while loop now if we look
back at the first example we looked at
which was while false and we echo out
this will never run we know that when we
come over to the browser we won't see
anything but what happens if you wanted
a while loop but you always wanted the
block to be run once before you started
to then evaluate within a statement well
in this case we can switch up and we can
use a do-while loop now this looks a bit
different we have do then we have our
normal block and then after this we have
while and then we end that with a
semicolon beforehand we didn't end it
with a semicolon so for example if we
say while like that we don't need to
place a semicolon there for this loop
make sure you have that in there or
you'll cause a syntax error so now if I
say false and then I echo out here this
will be run at least once we can see
that we do actually get that because the
block has been run and then the
condition comes into play and if this
eventually ends up at false will again
just loop the same amount of times so
again it's unlikely that you're gonna be
using a do-while loop day to day or even
a wire loop as long as you remember that
you have these two loop types available
you'll be able to pick the right one
when you need them but more importantly
though is the for each loop which we'll
probably be using for anything you build
and we're going to be covering that in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
