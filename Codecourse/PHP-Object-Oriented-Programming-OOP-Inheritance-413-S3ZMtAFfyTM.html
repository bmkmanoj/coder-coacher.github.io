we know how to populate it with
properties and methods we're going to
look at inheritance so firstly I'm going
to delete this person class and I'm
going to get rid of all of this and I'm
going to create a new class called bird
so class bird we're going to have a
constructor and this will take a
parameter file can fly and this is going
to be a boolean I will take a I will
take a leg count and or leave it at that
so we'll set these two properties so I
can fly and we'll duplicate this and
change the variables and we'll just set
these up here public can fly and public
account and now I'll just create a
getter for each of these so public
function well we'll just leave this as
can fly and we'll return this can fly
and then we'll get public function get
leg count and as you can imagine this
will just turn this leg count so now if
we go to our index file and we require
bird the PHP we can now instantiate it
so bird equals new bird can fly we'll
set that to true let's imagine that this
is a pigeon and leg count on the pigeon
has two legs so now what we can do is we
can echo bird get leg count and as you
can imagine we get 2 here because that's
what we set in the constructor so the
next thing that we want to do is create
a new class and we're going to call this
pigeon dot PHP
class pidgin and this is going to be a
little bit different because over here
we're going to say extends bird so what
this means is that every every property
and every method in this class here so
in bird is going to be included in
pigeon in other words is going to be
inherited and that's the technical term
so now what we can do is we can change
this to pidgin and change this to pidgin
a pigeon can fly and it has two legs
so that's alright and we'll just change
that and of course we need to include it
so now we get the same result so let's
just add a little conditional here so if
pigeon can fly then echo can't fly hit
refresh and there we go a pigeon can fly
so let's make one more example or call
this penguin dot php' cuss penguin
extends bird clothes all of these and
we'll just include it nope penguin and
we'll change all of these again and the
penguin can't fly so this would be false
hit refresh and we don't get anything
that's basic inheritance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
