server and transfer files quickly and
easily now we don't actually need to
install anything in this case since SFTP
stands for SSH File Transfer Protocol
which as the name hints at this works
using an extension of SSH and doesn't
require that you install an FTP server
separately on your server to actually
make use of this now I'm using FileZilla
as my FTP client so I can actually go
ahead and directly connect to my server
straight away so we'll be using the same
credentials as we use to access our
server before so basically the ones that
digitalocean sent to us when we created
our server so let's go ahead and enter
my IP address my server my username
which is root my my password as well so
let me just go ahead and copy and paste
this over now the port is going to be
different it's going to be port 22 so
let's go ahead and click connect now
this will give us a little bit warning
so let's go ahead and okay that's
because I've got a previous key cached
so you won't need to worry about this
because this shouldn't pop up for you if
you haven't done that before okay so now
that we have connected you can see that
we can traverse all of our directories
if we want we can go back we can head
over to far up the dub and see these
files so I could go ahead and edit these
files if I wanted and you can go ahead
and upload and download files in the
usual way using this method now there's
not too much more to explain here you're
basically now ready to upload files and
start using your droplet as a server
however what we're going to do in the
next part is take a look at securing
your server even more using SSH keys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
