second part of our register tutorial in
this part I'm going to go through
checking the existence of these forms
let me just get rid of these values
though these fields sorry that we're
typing in and gonna do a bit of
encrypting of the password and we're
also going to be removing HTML tags the
bare mind consider I'm it's considering
I'm encrypting for my login part which
let me just open this here this login
I'm gonna have to make a few adjustments
to my page here bear in mind we're
taking a password like straight from our
database so basically what we need to
say is we need to change this
dbusername' value and our DB password
and again if you haven't watched the
first tutorial you need to to be able to
write this code out okay so back to our
register and what we're going to do
first is we're going to check for submit
now I haven't something set that submit
variable at the moment so this is going
to be equal to dollar sign underscore
post okay and submit and this is because
when the user clicks the submit button
here the name is submit therefore this
will hold a value of the register and
this will basically say if the user has
clicked this button being the data that
submitted from that bun and we can carry
on our code now the other values we need
to get are the name of the user so the
full name of the user I'm just going to
type full name equals host and I believe
I called that full name we can see
evidence of this here okay so we're just
mimicking what names we've given each
once we've got full name username
password repeat password okay so we've
got full name username
user name I'm gonna do is whenever I
code these I copy and paste them down so
pathway to repeat password we've got
password and repeat password and we can
just change these values a lot easier
than type now over and over again if you
are quite new to PHP I suggest you do
type these out again and again
especially if you forget them easily so
we've got all our values here so if
submit what I'm gonna do now is just
echo them out to you to show you that
these all are all are you know have been
submitted correctly I suggest you do
this for debugging you might spell
something wrong it's not good when
you're trying to put data that's not
there into your database so what I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna say echo
let's say the username and I'm gonna
just do a slash and password and then
repeat password and then the full name
of the user and don't forget our line
terminator so we've got all our data
here that I have extracted from our form
so what I'm just going to do is comment
this out and say form data
you shouldn't have to grab this by now
okay so I'm just if the form has been
submitted I'm gonna echo this day out to
make sure it's all there okay so here if
I click register nothing's happening we
can see that I'm going to click it
nothing your fact is being done what I
can do here is just type my full-name I
can just type up a username choose a
password it's gonna be ABC for now click
on register and nothing's happened so if
submit posts up me this is why our form
action we need to set a method which is
going to be post I forgot to include
that so go back and edit this if you're
following it through we need a method of
post otherwise it's default I believe
default get yep you can see it all up
here
so what I'm going to do now is just
refresh this page
and I'm going to retype my data so
that's Alex Guerra and this is gonna
scream Alex and then ABC ABC so click
register and my data has been shown here
so we can check it's correct
my full name was Alex Guerra my user
name chosen was Alex and I've got a B C
here and ABC here now I want to encrypt
these passwords and if you read up on
Google or any search engine about md5
encryption that's MD 5 then just write
it down for you
it's a very useful way of encrypting
data let's just get rid of this because
we know everything's right its md5 and
this md5 function in PHP takes a string
or I believe it can take a numerical
value but we've got a string value or
just a data value and this is basically
encrypted to md5 encryption just say
encrypted Alex to md5 let's just echo
out and refresh don't resend the data so
just come straight back from here and
re-click on register what have we got
here
see if submittal ette stake this out of
our condition and refresh ok so that is
my name Alex encrypted in md5 no it's
always the same length and I believe
it's impossible to crack unless you
encrypt a string and then and then you
compare it to your but your two
encrypted values now if you don't get
this I'm going to put up a tutorial on
md5 encryption so don't worry go ahead
and read that or watch that rather and
what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to
say if submit then blah blah blah our
code but my full-name username is fine
my password what I'm gonna do is just
add this md5 encryption around my
submitted
password and the repeated password don't
forget that so then if I echo out and
let's say password and let's have a line
break and say repeat password then when
I go to refresh or rather when I go to
submit my form register I'm gonna say my
password is ABC and my repeat password
is ABC register that you can see that my
2 encrypted passwords are identical and
they're both there ready to put into the
database now if someone does say hack
into your database and finds out
people's passwords they can just go up
his password is 'abc I was have died in
there but the moment they won't be able
to find it because it's encrypted if
that makes sense
ok so the next thing we were just going
to do we've got our passwords encrypted
we're going to strip any tags off of our
off of our data and to use this we have
so we say strip tags there you go
strip tags now this will this will strip
HTML tags now when I'm using my password
I'm not going to say strip tags before
the md5 function on the md5 function to
encrypt the already stripped version of
my password if that makes sense
so that should be fine then let's just
copy and paste that down there
okay so that's done and we can see that
if we go
say for example back and I type in HTML
here and for my username I'm gonna say
body and I've just keep my passwords as
ABC
let's go and echo out username and we'll
just say break full name so echoing out
what we've typed in here I'm just gonna
type test after this and test after this
and this strict hug function should get
rid of this HTML and this body so we
should just have test and test being
given to us oh we've got a bit of an
error let's go back and check just
didn't it didn't use a line terminator
refresh and resend the data and we can
see that we've just got tests and tests
so whatever you type in here as a a tag
an HTML tag or any other tag it's just
blank so you know some people could be
funny and say my username is going to be
an image register that doesn't work
isn't echoed up here but if we say say
Alex and we click register is taken into
account so that's basically that I've
run a bit short of time so in the next
tutorial working with any checking that
they've typed every single field in as
they are all required for registration
okay I'll see you in the next part
