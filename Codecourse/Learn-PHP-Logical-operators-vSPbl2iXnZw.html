logical operators what they are they do
sound a little bit more complicated than
they are but we're gonna be creating an
if statement and basically just checking
expressions using logical operators to
check if the expression evaluates to
true or false so let's go ahead and
create an if statement we'll go ahead
and create a couple of variables as well
that will just hold both true and false
value so boolean values so I'm gonna say
admin equals true and I'm also gonna say
modder
rate equals true as well so inside of
our if statement we know that we
evaluate an expression to be true or
false so what happens if we say if admin
well this will evaluate to true so if we
echo out true we hop over to our browser
we can see that we just have output true
now what happens if we want to check if
both admin and moderator are true well
we can use the double ampersand which
basically just will check if both of
these evaluate to true so the entire
expression evaluates to true and then we
have a true value let's just add an else
onto here just to echo out false just so
you can see that we what we're working
with so if I was to say if admin and
moderator are both true and I changed
moderator to false then what we're gonna
happen what's gonna happen now is this
will evaluate to true this will evaluate
to false and therefore the entire
expression will evaluate to false
because both of these are required to be
true so when I go ahead and refresh now
we see the false string output now we
can also use or to detect if either of
them are what we expect so what we could
say is we could say if I'm just going to
put these in brackets if admin equals
true or
moderator the Eagles trip now this isn't
absolutely necessary because without the
brackets here and without the comparison
the top with the type checking its it
works in similar way anyway the only
difference here is that we are in fact
type checking this just makes it a
little easier to see what we're doing so
if this expression evaluates to true
which it will in terms of this because
admin is equal to true and moderator or
this expression here evaluates to true
which won't because we're false we're
still going at this line run because
when we're using or it basically means
this has to be true or this has to be
true and we can of course use this
multiple times as well if we had other
variables or or things that we want to
want it to check so in this case we'll
see true whereas before when we were
using double ampersand for and this
would equal false so basically this is
the the tail freitas that you'll see
used most and we also have the key words
and and or which have basically have
less presence over the double ampersand
and the double pipe so we have and and
or like this but there's information in
the PHP manual about these so you can go
ahead and and look that up
now there is one logical operator that's
extremely useful and you'll see it used
in many circumstances
let's just say let's just get rid of
this and we'll echo false now what we
can do is we can check if things are
false II by just using an exclamation
mark which makes working with if
statements a lot easier to just make
just shortens everything that we need to
do really so instead of saying something
like if admin well we can say Adam Inc
was true we can say if not admin so this
basically means is this a faulty value
in this case it's not so when we go
ahead and refresh the page you'll see
that nothing is output if this was false
you can see that
this outputs false now what happens if
we changed it to something like zero
because technically zero is false e we
still get false we still got the false
value so in the case that we wanted to
type check admin to check if it was
false it might be better to say if admin
equals false like this
so it really depends but if you're just
checking checking the value this way it
makes it extremely easy to read we we
sort of see this as not and it's called
the name of the logical operators not so
we're saying if not admin so that's how
you would typically read it if you were
reading out the code so that is a very
basic overview of logical operators in
PHP and how we use them we've looked at
and or and not and there are of course
other a couple of other operators like
the and/or operators and air X or as
well which can go ahead and look up in
the PHP documentation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
