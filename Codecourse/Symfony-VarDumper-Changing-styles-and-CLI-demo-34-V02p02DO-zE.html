really easy to integrate but what
happens if we want to kind of change
around the Styles here and this is quite
important because when you're working on
something and you want to dump something
out you need to be very easy to read and
as a default I don't think this is so
let's go ahead and look at how we
basically change the handler over for
when we go ahead and call this now to do
this all you need to do is pull in the
VAR dump of class that we saw under the
vendor symphony VAR dump a folder i mean
it go it's just this one here i'm going
to go ahead and pull in the namespace
and we're going to import this so let's
come over here and import this now what
I'm also going to do is use the square
brackets here so I can go ahead and
define in anything else I want to pull
in we're going to be pulling in a couple
of other things as well and you'll see
how this works in a minute if you've not
seen the PHP 7 series we have so that's
gone ahead and pulled that in now i'm
going to say var dumper and i'm going to
use a static sit handler method now what
this allows me to do us to do is go
ahead and pass in a closure into this we
get what we're trying to dump so this is
now the variable that we're trying to
dump so just to kind of test this out
I'm just going to go ahead and kill the
page here and I'm going to do a manual
VAR dump on this so let's do a manual
VAR dump on bar and we'll see this when
we call this it will go ahead and it
will do a VAR dumps let's give that a
refresh and you can see that we just get
the default so at the moment we have to
kind of override everything that the VAR
dumper would normally do when we use
this set handler because technically
what we're doing now is we're completely
overriding the handler and it's just not
going to work if we don't return
anything if I was to return VAR just
here you can see nothing really happens
as well but in this case we could go
ahead and substitute this for VAR dump
like that and we would just get the same
result when we call the dump function so
in here then we need to figure out what
we actually need to do and the way that
this far dumper generally works behind
the scenes so the first thing that
happens is we have a cloner now this is
a VAR cloner and again this is a class
that exists within that package so you
can go ahead and have a look at this if
you want to i'm just going to go ahead
and come and separate this in i'm going
to pull in that corner as well and if
you want to sure they
syntax here is essentially the same as
using this over and over again but we're
just pulling this from the cuts are kind
of same common name space so just kind
of tie these things up a little bit
rather than having to have three or four
lines here so the first thing we do is
we have a cloner now the purpose of the
clone it is to clone the variable before
we start messing around with it and
going ahead and dumping it out then what
we have is an HTML dumper so we go ahead
and create a new HTML dumper now you
might be thinking well why do we have to
have a sip for HTML dumper well let me
just go ahead and pull this in and I'll
explain when we go ahead and dump things
out we can either dump them in an HTML
format or we can dump them in a command
line interface format so maybe if we're
running the file on the command line
that we're working with so for example
PHP index.php obvious obviously we have
an error here but we'll fix this up in a
minute we get a completely different
output in the command line so we need to
allow this to be formatted when we want
to dump it on the command line maybe
you're working with the symphony console
component and you want to nicely dump
something out from here so really it
depends on what you're doing and I've
just realized that the cloner is
actually under a cloner directory so I'm
going to go ahead and just get rid of
this here and HTML dumper is also under
a different directory but what I'm going
to do is just pull this down and i'm
going to say cloner and i'm going to
pull in our far cleaner in here like so
and then down here we also have under a
dumper directory HTML dumper like so so
you didn't really have to include these
brackets but in this case we also need
to pull in a command line interface
dumper as well so let's go ahead and
pull this in now just so we can see so
command line interface dumper and let's
change this over to CLI dumper and of
course this comes from the dumper
directory so we can go ahead and pull
this in here so CLI dumper and we can go
ahead and get rid of these because in
this case we don't need to pull anything
else from these particular route
namespaces so now that we have our
vehicle owner to clone our variable that
we're trying to dump and we have our
HTML dumper to dump HTML and how CLI
dumpler to dump on the command line we
need to work out if we're working on the
car
line or if we're working within a
browser so in this case I would create a
new variable called dumper and I would
say PHP s API and I would check if this
is CLI that basically means are we
working on the command line interface
well in this case i want my dumper to be
my CLI dumper like so otherwise i want
my HTML dumper that we've nude up up
here and now what we can do is say
dumper and then on the dumper class or
the or basically either of these so if
we were to open up HTML dumper but if we
look at the dump method here it works
differently between HTML and CLI then we
can just say dump like we've seen and
then we can go ahead and say cloner and
we need to clone the variable that we
want to dump and in this case it's the
variable that we get through when we
call that dump function so pretty simple
clone something work out how to dump it
and then go ahead and dump it that is
all we need to do so now that we're
using dump and we've overridden the way
that this works we can go ahead and
check this out so we'll bring up our
command line interface just so we can
test this inside of here we get HTML
dumper not found that's absolutely fine
so let's go ahead and have a look and of
course that should be HTML dumper you
probably notice that let's go over and
give that a refresh we see the same
result let's do the same in the command
line now so let's run PHP index.php and
you can see that we get a fairly similar
output here it's just we have some
colors it's formatted nicely and of
course if we didn't have this and we
were using VAR dump by default then in
the command line particularly this
doesn't look as good as we would
probably want it so you can see it does
things like remove object we kind of
know it's an object and it goes ahead
and gets rid of the types as well and
just makes it a little bit nicer to see
in the command line interface so that is
how we fiddle around with the handler
when we called dump method so pretty
simple HTML dumper CLI dumper we choose
and we go ahead and dump it out now
there's one last thing I want to do and
that is the styling for this so to me
this isn't very easy to read I'd have to
probably increase the size of it to be
able to see what I was doing
so in this case I prefer a white
background so what we're going to do is
explore the HTML dumper and see what we
can do here so let's go ahead and open
this up and if we come down you can see
immediately we have things like some
methods here for the dump prefix we have
all of these Styles here and of course
what we don't want to do what we can't
do is go ahead and head and overwrite
these because they're protected so what
I would do in this case is I would
search for set and already we see set
styles so I know that what I can do is
use set styles to override any of them
default styles that are just up here so
in this case for the HTML dumper and in
the case of the CLI dumper what it would
probably do is just knew this up in here
because it's not really much need for a
separate variable for this and I would
go ahead and for the HTML dumper I would
go ahead and set styles like so and
unfortunately the way that this is Bill
means that we actually have to go ahead
and pass through all of this data here
and we don't need to pass through all of
this data we can just choose these ones
but for the default we hit basically
have a load of CSS in here so what I
would do in this case I would grab all
of this pop it in here under some kind
of default property we've already seen
that in fact I copy that over so I can
get rid of that and we can just go ahead
and start to change this around so for
the background color I'd probably
immediately set that to white or you
could go ahead and set that to
transparent entirely up to you why it's
probably a little bit better just
depending and I think to be honest
that's pretty much it for that obviously
the only thing is now we're not going to
see these properties here that were
originally in white so we need to go
ahead and change these over as well so
we know that here if we just have a look
down we've got public protected and
private we know that these are set to
all a light color so in this case of
white so we can go ahead and over I
these as well so i'm going to paste
these in here and i'm going to simply
change these over to maybe a very dark
color and when we come over there we go
so this obviously looks a lot nicer feel
free though to just change this around
to whatever you prefer but from
I can read this a little bit easier and
of course over in the command line as
well we've not really affected anything
because we've only gone ahead and
updated that for our HTML dumper not our
command line interface dumper but that
is pretty much it you would go ahead and
put this in some kind of bootstrap file
away from everything else of course in
here we've got it all in one page but as
long as this is a way you can go ahead
and update it whenever you want and it's
there for you to change as well if you
need to update it a later date</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
