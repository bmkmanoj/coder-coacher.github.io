lost ball we know at the moment this is
just going ahead and bouncing off the
bottom and actually interestingly if we
were to increase the velocity on the y
axis enough when we go ahead and release
the ball this game is pretty much just
gonna play itself so you can see that
that's just gonna go ahead and get rid
of all of the bricks so let's go ahead
and revert that velocity back and first
of all look when we create our game at
disabling the collision on the very
bottom so by this what we do is we say
this game physics much like we've done
for all of how prefabs our ball our
bricks and all that kind of stuff we say
arcade check collision and we say on
down well we just want to set this to
false all that's gonna do is when we go
ahead and release the ball and then goes
ahead and goes down it's just not gonna
collide off it's just gonna essentially
be lost
now this isn't enough just yet to go
ahead and detect whether that has
actually gone down and come out of
bounds we need to add a check on setup
ball or pretty much wherever else you
want but it's a little bit easiest to do
this in here and we want to say
something like in between here this ball
and we're gonna say events and on out of
bounds so on out of bounds
we want to add an event handler much
like we've done for other things in our
application and we're gonna say this
bullet lost so we're gonna call a method
pass through the current game and down
here we can implement that method and of
course just to test this out we can go
ahead and do a console log ok so on out
of bounds we call ball lost and we can
handle the lives being decremented so
you'll notice now when that goes out of
bounds
we see test ok so when the ball is out
of bounds then what do we want to do the
first thing is to decrement the lives in
our application we know that this is
part of our Global's so we're gonna say
game global lives and of course this is
going to go ahead and decrement that and
of course what we want to do is update
the lives text so that's going to go
ahead and update so we're going to set
this to lives and it's going to be
exactly what we've just decremented here
like so so we can test this out if we
head over to the browser and click
wait for that to go down the bottom and
of course lives are decremented now the
only thing that we're not doing here is
putting the ball back on the paddle
that's another thing that we want to do
and we know that when the ball is lost
we can just call the same method that we
used before this purple on paddle so we
go ahead and try this out now what's
going to happen is that's going to
decrement alive it's going to put the
ball back on the paddle and essentially
we can just start again until of course
it goes down now the only other issue is
once we get to zero that should be the
point that we switch over and end the
game but at the moment that's not going
to be the case because that's just going
to go to minus 1 minus 2 and so on and
so forth so that was a really quick way
of going ahead and checking that the
ball has gone out of bounds we're gonna
move over to the next part now because
this is going to be adding an entirely
new screen to out game once we get down
to zero lives we're going to show that
new screen so this is going to take a
little bit longer so now that we've got
this ball not bouncing off the bottom we
can move over to that part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
