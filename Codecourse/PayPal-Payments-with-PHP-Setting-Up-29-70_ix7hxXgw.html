everything set up that we need then
important to note that we're starting
with absolutely nothing so we're going
to be doing this entirely from scratch
just to make it as simple as possible I
am currently on a local development
environment I'm using vagrant feel free
to man pour wham or whatever you use and
there's nothing in here we're getting a
403 because there are no files within
this directory so it's starting
completely from scratch as mentioned
unique composer go ahead and and google
for the paypal PHP SDK over on github
and you might also want to Google for
own packages so you can see specific
versioning information we'll be pulling
this down with the composer and
obviously make sure you're signed up for
a PayPal developer account we'll be
creating the app in this video so really
the first thing I want to do then is
just set up my composer file to actually
pull in this dependency so really the
first thing that we're going to do is
create a new file within here let's just
save this out and we'll save this as
composer JSON you can do this from the
command line but we'll do here just so
it's a little bit easier so over on the
github page then it does give you the
repository name that you can actually
pull this down it need to be under
require it's all CA production
requirement and it does give an
asterisks here but you might want to
pull in a specific version of this
that's probably a better idea rather
than just pulling in the latest version
so when you do a composer update this is
going to install the latest version
which may not be obviously compatible
with what you've done before but either
way then let's paste this in I'm going
to use Asterix for now but just make
sure you make the right decision when
you are making a live app so we've now
got this all this means is that we're
pulling in this from that github account
or from packages we're downloading this
this sort of dependency and pulling that
into our application that all that's all
it means
just so we don't have to manually
download download the files so I'm
currently within this directory here if
we just do listing you can see the
composer JSON file that we created this
works on Windows as well if you are
working on Windows if you understand
composer you'll know all this but now
we're going to run
hoser just to make sure we have
composure installed if you do we're then
going to run composer install that's
going to install them dependencies for
us basically pull that PayPal SDK down
and SDK is just a software development
kit it basically means that we can
easily connect to PayPal in order to
process payment and this is a really
great library so that dependency is now
pulled down you'll notice I've in the
folders being created with your PayPal
SDK in here and we've also got this
autoload file as well which we can pull
in to pull in the functionality of our
of our dependencies so next thing we
want to go and create an app under
PayPal developer we can get rid of these
two now so I've already got one here but
let's create a new app and let's give
this a name so I'm just going to call
this website and you'll see that we get
a sandbox developer account here
remember we had that test account
facilitator account when we look to the
demo in the last part hit create app
that's going to go ahead and create that
application for you and there we go so
there's a couple of things that we need
to note here we've got a client ID and a
secret you're going to need these to be
able to actually access the API and this
is also the endpoint for the API is API
sandbox paypal calm now it's important
to know that when you do actually go
live you're going to need to switch this
over so you'll see your live credentials
we're not going to cover this because
it's pretty self-explanatory within this
PayPal developer dashboard but once
you're done you can you know figure that
out so the next thing we need is the app
redirect URLs these are basically the
authorized URLs that we use to redirect
back to our application so the app
return URL for testing is just going to
be this URL here so we can copy this and
just paste that in hit save and that's
going to go ahead and save that for us
and then we know that that's an
authorized redirect URL we specify the
URLs when we write the code but now the
it's all done you're going to need to
set up an account to be able to actually
sign in and use this so I've got a
couple of accounts already created I'm
going to be using this one here
but you're going to want to go ahead and
create an account set a password you can
set all of the information associated
with that account and then you are ready
to go so now that we've got our
dependency hold it in we can actually
start to build this payment
functionality in the next video though
we're going to look at the actual
process that we go through to be able to
actually define what we want the user to
pay for how we go to PayPal how we
return back so that's going to be a very
short explanation of how that actually
works because that's really key to
understanding how to process payments
with PayPal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
