side of things I want to go ahead and
build this back-end paginating list of
articles that will give me a JSON output
so what we're gonna do is go ahead and
build up the database and the table
within the database that we need and
then we'll go ahead and actually start
to build this back-end in PHP and again
if you're using another language and you
know how to do this in your language go
ahead and do that so we get this get a
similar output but the key here is that
we have this query string because what
we're going to be doing is ajax in to
this file and we want to specify where
we want to start and where we want to
end so at the moment I've included the
query string start as 1 and count as 2
so this would be the initial load of the
first two articles if the step was to
and all this step is is just basically
how much you want to display initially
and then when the user clicks load more
how much you then want to load on top of
that
so what gonna do is if for example the
user clicks load more we're gonna set
the start to two or three rather and
then the counter to 2 so that would show
the next two so that's the kind of idea
we want to get around and we'll go ahead
and build up our database and then start
to look at the output here and then
we'll go ahead and afterwards build in
the JavaScript so let's go ahead and
open up my SQL so we'll just go ahead
and log in so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna go ahead and create a
database here so let's create a database
for this test so create database load
more we'll call this okay so now what
we're gonna do is use the load more
database so that's changed and we need
to go ahead and create a table in here
so I'm going to create a table and I'm
gonna call this articles and I want this
to have an ID field title and a
description so we're gonna be displaying
the title and the description out on the
page as well as the ID actually and this
is going to be done with this sort of
templating that we're gonna use as well
so I want this to be not null I want
this to be the primary key and I want
this to be an auto increment the title
is going to be a varchar' and that's
going to be 200
characters and the description is just
going to be text oops so let's go ahead
and change this so the ID needs to be an
integer okay so now that we've done that
let's go ahead and just show tables so
we've got our articles table and let's
go ahead and just describe that articles
table so there we go so what we're gonna
do now is start to insert some data so
let's insert into this articles table
and we want to go ahead and put a title
and a description in for each one so for
the first article let's just say article
one and for the second or for the
description rather we'll say this is a
description for article one so I'm gonna
go ahead and do this 15 times so when we
return or if you're doing if you're
following along with this go ahead and
into this 15 times change the numbers if
you do have an already populated article
list that would be great I'm just gonna
go ahead and make 15 of these okay so
once we've inserted 15 articles let's
just go ahead and select everything from
the articles table so we've now got our
15 articles we know that we can connect
this and go ahead and output these based
on the paginate query string that we
talked about earlier so let's jump into
our text editor and start to write this
PHP code out so the first thing that
we're gonna need to do is change the
content type of this output since we are
actually outputting this as JSON
let's go ahead and use the header
function to modify this so we go ahead
and choose the content type and this is
going to be application slash JSON so
now we'll get a different response
header sent by a different header a
content type header sent to users
browser so let's go ahead and connect to
our database so we we instantiate a new
PDO object and we're going to go ahead
and provide the query string in here to
connect all the string to connect in
here so we're using MySQL the host is
localhost the database name
is oops load more and we go ahead and we
provide a username and a password and
we're done so let's just go ahead and
test that this works and nothing's
errored so everything looks fine if you
just check your network tab you can
click here and you can scroll down to
see that the content types changed to
application JSON so now we can go ahead
and start to test this out so the first
thing I want to do is store an empty
array just to store articles when we
loop through them or not loop through
them but when we go ahead and fetch
fetch all of the articles so it will
just declare this up here anyway what we
now want to do is go ahead we want to
determine if the start or count queries
are available so if the if the get super
global contains start will count we want
to assign at these start and count
variables a value so for example I'm
gonna have start and let me just set
this to zero by default and I'm gonna
say count and I'm gonna set this to one
by default
now the reason we start this at zero
it's basically because when we do a
query we're gonna use the limit clause
to actually limit the amount of records
that we get back basically and because
when you limit it's zero indexed we
always need the starts to be zero and
that means that if the start has been
provided in our browser as one we need
to minus one from that every single time
this is provided let's go ahead and do a
ternary operator just to keep things
nice and clean so let's just do an is
set so we're doing is set on the get
super global and this is start so if
this is available what do we want to do
well we want to use get start and apply
this value to this variable now we also
need to be really careful because this
is a user provided value we need to go
ahead and pass this to an integer
you prevent SQL injection so otherwise
we want this to be zero and as I
mentioned we need two minus one from
this so let's just run through this
we've got a start variable if the get
super global is set we then use the get
super global variable minus one
otherwise we just don't default to zero
so for the count we do a similar thing
but the only thing we don't need to do
is minus one off this because account is
account it's not indexed by anything it
just tells us how many results we want
to get so let's go ahead and do dollar
underscore get count here we do exactly
the same thing again making sure that we
cast this to an integer to protect
against SQL injection and then the
default here is going to be one so by
default if we don't provide anything
this is going to provide one record so
what we're going to do now is actually
construct the query so we create a
variable called article and this is
going to be the query method of the PDO
object that we have above let's go ahead
and add the query in here so we're gonna
select now we're gonna do things a
little bit differently because we also
need to do another query to get the
total amount of articles and we're gonna
be using SQL calc found rows as well as
an asterisks to say that we want all
fields to be returned so this looks a
little bit weird but we're gonna say SQL
calc found rows asterisk so we're
basically saying we want to along with
all of the other data get the amount of
rows in total and we want to do this
from the articles table the table we
created a moment ago and we want to
limit this by X comma X in this case the
start is going to just be the start
variable that we created a moment ago
and this is going to be the count which
we created a moment ago as well so up
here is the start and count we've now
used them in the query so we know that
this is going to perform this query so
like I said we also need to grab the
total amount of articles as well so I'm
going to create a variable called
articles total
this is going to be another query but
this time is it's just simply going to
be select found rose as counts so we're
changing the name of this returned
function and along with this we want to
go ahead and immediately fetch the
results so we want to fetch this as an
associative array so once we fetch that
as an associative array we can then
immediately access the count value so if
I just go ahead and echo this we'll see
what this results in this is 15 this is
giving us the total amount of records
that we created and we know that we have
15 records in here so now that we've
done that and we've got the actual query
to return the articles let's go ahead
and actually look at outputting these so
what we want to do is we want to check
if we have any results first of all so
we need to know if we have any results
so in this case we use article row count
so this is going to return either 0 or
positive integer what we also want to do
is store the articles count as well so
we're going to go ahead and we're going
to say articles count equals so we're
assigning that but also checking its
value at the same time it's useful to
have a count of what's been returned if
we need to use this in the future so
what we're gonna do now is inside of
here we're going to assign a value to
the empty array that we created up here
earlier so in this case we're gonna say
this is articles or article so this
query that we created here and we're
gonna fetch all so catching all of the
results and we want to fetch these as an
object because we're gonna put this into
the JSON encode function and we're gonna
store this in an array
so let's go ahead and build up this
array in fact let's go ahead and just do
a print our on articles just to see that
we're getting the results out that we
expect and yeah we are so we've got two
here because we're starting at one and
Counting it two and remember that
earlier I said if we're starting at
three in counting at two we get the next
two so we get three and four here so
we're now successfully paginating this
if for example the step was five we
would get five results back like this
let's go ahead and change that back to
two now let's go ahead and actually
output this as a JSON strip its JSON
string so we can actually use this in
our JavaScript so we're gonna go ahead
and echo JSON encode which will encode
this change it to a JSON string very
very handy indeed so we're gonna put an
array in here because we want to store a
few things the first thing we want to
store is the items so the items that
we've just print are done so let's go
ahead and do that so items is articles
so this on its own isn't enough because
we need a few other things so when i
refresh here you see that we've got an
items JSON string and we've got ID title
description you can see this is
formatted nicely in my browser you can
go ahead and download a Chrome extension
or something like that to go ahead and
format this nicely for you just
otherwise you'll just see a sort of a
string of you know JSON and it won't
look too pretty
so I'm formatting this within the
browser and this is how it looks so what
we're gonna do now is go ahead and add a
few more items onto here because what we
also need to do is determine if this is
the last page of articles so let's go
ahead and do that and then we'll test
this out using by changing around the
query string so what we're going to do
is we're going to check if the start
plus the count is larger than the total
amount of articles so the start up here
and the count if it's larger than the
total amount of articles and then we'll
know if this is the last record or not
so I'm going to say if start plus count
is greater than or equal
two articles total then this is true
otherwise this is false so let's go
ahead and check this out this should
show false because this isn't the last
page if the start for example remember
we have 15 articles if the start was 14
and the count was 2 you'd expect this to
be at the last page and in fact that
does show it is now the reason that we
do this is because when we get to the
last set of results we want to hide the
load more button with JavaScript so the
load more button that we were clicking
before we want to hide that so let's go
ahead and add a couple more on here
we're gonna do that we can output the
start and the count value just in case
we need it
so we go start and this is more for
debugging as well if we want to see what
the start and count positions are and
there we go so when we refresh now you
can see that the start is 13 and the
count is 2 now it says start 13 because
remember even minus 1 so this is what
would be fed into the query hence why
said it's probably good for debugging so
now that we've done that we know that
this works let's just revert this back
to 1 and 2 now all of this works we know
that you know stepping an extra 5 or
we'd get 5 results and doing the start
as 6 and the count is 5 we get the next
5 so we know that this is all working so
now that we've done this what we can
actually do is start to focus on
building the JavaScript up to actually
use this to go ahead and pull in more
articles as we need them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
