a blog with laravel very very simple but
it will teach you the fundamentals about
building this and of course you can then
go ahead and use this as your blog so
the first thing that we're going to do
is do a little bit of prep work set
everything up do the database do the
migrations so we have our database table
created if you don't know what any of
this means don't worry is very simple so
I'm going to assume that you've already
got laravel installed if you haven't
head over to the official website and
check out how to install it and you
should see something like this so as
long as you've got something like this
we can get started so the first thing
that I want to do then is just update my
app settings so I'm going to go into app
config and app sorry into database and
I'm going to change the MySQL database
username and password so the database
I'm going to call blog the username from
why MySQL server locally as root and the
password is root I am in fact going to
going to app and also set debugged true
just in case we come across any problems
we can then debug them please make sure
this is off for a production environment
that's really important so now that
we've done this we'll be able to connect
to our database but the first thing that
we want to do is create a database to
actually hold all this information so
inside of a MySQL terminal or using
whatever you do to manage your database
I'm going to create a database just
called blog and there we go so I'm now
going to inside of the directory that
I'm currently in you can see that's the
same as this one I am going to create a
migration so we use PHP to hit artisan
and we say migrate make and then we give
the name of the migration in this case
it's going to be create posts table so
once that's done we'll find the
migration within database migrations and
it's here so we can now start to build
up our migration so we can think about
here what kind of fields that we need
but we're going to use the schema
builder to create this migration now if
you're on it unaware what migrations are
it's basically version control for your
database it means that between different
developers or
yourself on different machines you can
just migrate all your database changes
over so you create a new migration for
every change that's basically what it is
so we're going to create this post table
we have a closure here and we can use T
start building up our table so we're
going to say T increments now increments
allows you to specify the name of her
field that is of Auto increment so this
will go from one two three four all the
way up depending on how many you
actually create this will hold up to
eight I think is it integer so we also
want a title for our blog post so this
is going to be a string I'm going to
call this title and that's going to be
at 200 lengths now I'm also going to
create a slug this is basically
something that looks like this the
probably seen in URLs
it just means it's more SEO friendly and
easier to read from the URL and I'm
going to set this to 400 you can change
these numbers though depending on what
you feel now we're also going to
introduce a draft status so we're going
to give the ability for each post to be
a draft so it won't publicly appear on
the homepage but you will still be able
to access it if you're writing this this
blog post so we're going to create a
boolean and this just in MySQL equates
to a tiny integer so draft here and
that's it so we obviously need some body
content and this is just going to be a
text type we don't need to specify the
character length here and we also want
timestamps now this is a method that
generates a created at and an updated
app field within your table and this is
what Lara vales eloquent uses when you
create a record or update a record we're
not going to be doing any creating or
updating from the app so you'll have to
manually set these when you create
records within your database table but
if you were this is what they're used
for
so what we're now going to do is on the
reverse side of things we want to drop
this table that's just in case we want
to roll this migration back
so let's now test migrating this I'm
rolling it back so we use PHP artisan
migrate and yes we want to run this and
it looks like it's done successfully so
let's use the blog table in here and
let's show sorry the database in here
let's show tables you can see we've got
a migrations table that just you know is
created when we do our migrations but
let's just describe posts quickly and
you can see that looks like it's created
everything we need cool so let's test
rolling this back just so we know that
it works roll back and lovely blog stop
post doesn't exist so let's read migrate
this and we'll just make sure that
exists there we go
so we've now got our database table we
have connected to our database here and
or our server here and chosen our
database and we have put debug to true
so what we can now do is start to build
up our template that we're going to
output things to this is very very basic
just to allow you to choose your own
design if you want to we're just going
to be creating the basic markup so when
it comes to outputting posts later it's
a lot easier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
