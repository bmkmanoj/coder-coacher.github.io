forward slash subscription page and
basically what this is going to do
obviously it's not available at the
moment because we've not created a route
for what this is going to do is it's
going to tell us whether the user is
subscribed or not so we're going to get
started very very slowly with laravel
cashier now obviously if we cast our
minds back to when we updated our user
model we use the billable trait and we
implemented the billable interface now
the billable trait contains methods if
we just check this out it contains lots
of methods here that give us all juicy
functionality to integrate stripe into
our application and do
subscription-based stuff and everything
like that so let's start to create our
routes out and then we'll start to look
at how we do this and bear in mind we
also need to migrate some stuff over as
well at the moment we've just got our
basic fields in our database so let's go
ahead and create a group here now group
if you're not too sure it's just
something you can group under and do
things like prefixing so I'm going to
prefix this under subscription now any
routes I create within here will then
have the prefix of subscription so for
example if I do routes and I want to get
just a forward slash this is going to be
called subscription and we're going to
use here a subscription controller and
let's just put that in single quotes so
subscription controller however we
haven't created this yet so let's
quickly create that let's not veer off
too much but we do actually need to
create this so under controllers let's
create a new file here and we'll
obviously call this subscription
controller and in here let's obviously
create a subscription controller class
and let's extend the base controller
cool so that's all done so what we now
want to do is
create this yet index method and for now
let's just return subscription just so
we can test this out so what's going to
happen now is we're going to go to
forward slash subscription and then on
the root of that that's going to use the
index method we just created there we go
so that's that done and we're going to
be doing that with throughout the video
because we're going to be adding more
roots within this group just to keep
everything nice and tidy so what we now
want to do is within here we want to
actually return a view so let's return a
subscription index view now we don't
have this either yet so let's create
that inside of the views folder we'll
create a new folder called subscription
and then in here we'll create a new view
called index.php and we'll just write
sub in there so now that's using the
view cool now what I want to do is I
want to pass to this view the user or
the earth user method and that's going
to give us all of the functionality that
we need remember because inside of user
we're using the trait in here we can
then use any of the billable trait
functionality under auth user and
remember we're already faking and logins
who are essentially logged in to our
application now instead of using auth
user over and over again I'm going to
store it up here and then I'm going to
store this in here so now you don't have
to do this it's entirely up to you so
I'm going to pass down user this user to
the subscription index now before we go
any further we need to generate our
laravel cashier migrations so basically
if we just run PHP artisan you can see
if we just scroll up we've got the
cashier table command
that's been generated for us so what we
want to do is we want to run cashier
table then we want to provide the table
that we are using for our users so
that's going to go ahead and it's going
to generate the migration we can check
that by heading over to database
migrations and you can see it here so
it's updating the users table and it's
adding all of these fields that are
going to that we saw at the start of the
series so let's just quickly do a PHP
artisan migrate and then we go we've
migrated it so heading over to sequel
Pro we can now see all of these nice
fields cool so we're going to modify the
stripe active field just as an example
just so we can get this to work but
otherwise this would automatically be
updated when you subscribe so we've
already created our template a default
template so let's extend a default
template here and under this we're going
to have our content so let's just type
in something here just make sure this is
a worked cool so it looks like
everything's okay effect so what we want
to do now is just do a quick check so
I'm going to say if I want to check if
user remember we pass this down here if
user subscribed so you can read about
all of the different methods that are
available inside of here so for example
if we want to find out if your User is
subscribed we use this so all of the
information is on the rhenium github so
if they are subscribed we want to say
something like you're subscribed thanks
so
like that and otherwise we want to say
looks like you're not subscribed and
then we're going to have an anchor here
which is going to link through and
obviously allow the user to join so say
join now now that's not going to work at
the moment so I've not added any link in
there there we go looks like you're not
subscribed join now if we modify the
stripe active field to one this will
obviously happen for us default later
you see that we get this message but
what we've done now then is in fact
let's just turn this back to zero what
we've done now is we've used one of the
methods on our user model to actually
check if a user is subscribed or not so
this is the first step in looking at how
we can do all the checks and all the
necessary checks like I said that all
documented here but what we're going to
do next is actually look at actually
allowing the user to hit join now enter
their credit card details be redirected
back here and be subscribed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
