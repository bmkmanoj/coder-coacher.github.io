looking at applying a box shadow to a
rectangular or square element on our
page but we're going to be creating a
bach cello like this one here that
renders inside the element and has a
slight curve to it and the way we're
going to do this is by using the before
and after pseudo selectors which I'm
going to explain fully if that's
something that is new to you so let's
look at some code for this in terms of
markup or we'll need is this basic HTML
template where we're linking to a knife
to a style sheet and we'll need inside
our body tags will need a div which is
going to be what we style up that's
going to be the box and that's where we
going to apply the shadow so I'm going
to give that a class of shadow for and
then we're going to target that in our
CSS so let's move over to some styles
the first thing I'm going to do is give
the body a background and it's going to
have a background color which is going
to be hache dee dee dee which is a light
gray then i'm going to remove some
default margin and on the page then
they're going to start styling the day
of itself i'm going to give it a
background color of white which is hash
FFF i'm going to give it a width of 400
pixels height of 200 pixels some padding
so margin and I'm going to float it left
so if I look at the page now I have my
box without any shadow so let's start
looking at what we need to do for the
shadow the first thing I'm going to do
is select the element with shadow for as
the class and I'm going to position it
relative and the reason I'm going to
give it a position which is relative is
so that I can position the pseudo
elements in relation to the shadow the
element with class shadow for so you'll
see that coming into play a little later
on and then I'm going to apply an
overflow hidden and the overflow hidden
means that we're only going to see the
blur on the shadow of the pseudo element
and not actually the pseudo element main
box shadow and which again I'll explain
that in more detail detail later on so
the next stage is to make the coelom
element itself so the way to make see
element is to select the Creator sector
for the element that we want to add the
sieve element to and then do a codon and
before or after and this in this case
we're doing using before and colon
before basically creates an element
which is going to be the first child of
the targeted elements of shadow for and
i'm going to type in the mandatory field
which is content and i'm going to just
going to give it no context we don't
want any content than there we just want
to create a box shadow and then i'm
going to position it absolute and give
it all i'm a width which is ninety-six
percent of its parent element i'm going
to move it up we have a height again to
give it a height of 15 pixels and then
i'm going to move it up 15 pixels so
that we won't see it because of the
overflow hidden and i'm also going to
move it slightly to the left so let's
give it tips in there i'm finally going
to apply a box shadow to it just going
to be 00 39 pixels and i'm getting
people to color of our DBA 00 0.8 so
let's see what we get with that there we
all we have a nice shadow at the top of
the page which looks slightly curved but
we're going to make it even more curved
and as i mentioned earlier by applying
the overflow hidden to the shadow for
container we only see the blur radius of
the box shadow on our pseudo element so
as to remove that you can see that this
is the shadow itself and this is the
blur of the shadow and so let's let's
look at them the shadow and if asked to
reduce the blur radius you can see the
blood disappears and if I increase it
would get a bigger and bigger player so
that is how that works so let's set it
back see what it was and refresh the
page and you can see this disappeared
now the final thing to do is add
shadowed bottom the box as well and the
way we do that is basically all the same
styles for maker and after sedo element
which is going to be the last child of
the shadow for element and the final
thing we need to do is just change the
word top to bottom so that we move it
below the shadow and then let's go back
to the page refresh and there we are we
have our box shadow one more thing we
can do to make this look even better
it's provide a border radius to make the
shadows and to make the box shadow
slightly a blit elliptical rather than a
circle and the way we do this is by
giving it two values the first one is
the horizontal radius and then the
second one is the vertical radius
so I'm it's important to separate them
with a slash like this and then
border-radius knows that we're providing
it with our values that are going to be
treated to create an ellipse so let's
copy that and put it in the after
selector as well I'm just format that
save this go back to a page and refresh
and you can see it's slightly more
curved they're just applying a finishing
touch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
