we're going to be looking at reflection
object and here we just pass in an
object which in this case is this
instant this user instance so user I'm
going to change this to our o just like
so and we'll delete this line here and
we're looking at browse and see what
method methods we can use and there's
quite a lot here it's very similar to
reflection class except it takes an
object instead of a class we have has
method get' method all of this kind of
stuff very similar so let's take a look
at one let's look at it namespace name
so echo arrow get namespace name and
because this is in the Acme namespace we
should see Acme perfect we can also say
just like in the reflection class and
method and property we can say get name
and we can say get short name to get
just the name of the class and if we
just died I took out that there we go we
have get constructor which we don't have
constructor but do play around with that
it's cloneable get file name so if we
say echo arrow get file name every fresh
and scroll down that's the path to my my
file where it's thought we have is
subclass of so if we had class user
extends class and if we said something
like arrow is subclass of it would be
Acme class because it's in the air
coming in space and that would return
true obviously we're going to get an
error since that doesn't exist and we
using the the word class which is
reserved
well anyway do play around with this if
you're getting into test-driven
development this is going to become your
best friend so do take the time out of
your day to just get a grasp of it won't
take five minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
