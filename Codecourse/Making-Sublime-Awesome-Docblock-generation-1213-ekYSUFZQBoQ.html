really nice ready to generate doc blocks
now if not work with doc box before
these help to generate documentation
like API documentation for your projects
so again we're not going to dive too
much into that but we look at doc
blocker and see how this can help us and
to be honest even if you're not doing
this it's really nice to have doc blocks
on any of your methods or classes just
to keep everything nice and simple to
read so let's go and install this and if
you've not seen doc blocks before you
can go ahead and check these out so
lessons so doc blocker wait for that to
download and now it is done let's just
open this file again all I'm gonna do is
a forward slash two asterisks and then
I'm gonna hit enter and you can see what
that's done is it's not only generated
my doc Doc's for me but it's also kind
of guessed what my parameter here is so
I have a parameter which is set to a
default of false and it knows now that
that's a boolean so all I need to do is
go ahead and fill this in I know that
this returns a string and I can go and
give a description here as well like so
so pretty straightforward stuff but it
really helps to have something like this
that you can just easily type in a
couple of characters and get going on
your doc blocks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
