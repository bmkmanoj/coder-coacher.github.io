this is a video tutorial on removing PHP
and other extensions from files on your
web server in this tutorial we're going
to be creating a basic page that allows
variable to be taken in the URL bar
don't worry too much if you don't know
about that it's gonna be about three
lines of code what we're then going to
do is go on to Crowl htaccess file and
we're gonna allow ourselves to specify a
file but without dot PHP or without Diet
HTML and obviously in this tutorial
we're gonna be focusing on moving the
dot PHP okay so you don't really need
any knowledge of htaccess it's very
simple three line you know code for the
HTT access rewrite rule and we're gonna
be using the rewrite engine to change
the way that urls are handled and I'm
gonna explain a little along the way
most of its regular expressions though
so they're sort of like another topic
anyway let's go ahead and do this so
I've got a page here called name dot PHP
which I'm gonna allow a variable to be
passed through and then just displayed
on the page and you can see that I've
got this file just here the reason I am
allowing a specific string to be passed
on like you can see here I've got name
equals Alex it's because eventually
we're gonna be removing this like that
so we're gonna want it to look a bit
cleaner
so you know that's why I've chosen this
at the moment that will just say object
not found because we can't find
something called name okay so let's go
ahead and we'll write our our PHP script
a few lines like I said and then we'll
go ahead and start to create the
htaccess file okay so I'm gonna
obviously open up the PHP tags I'm gonna
do a quick check in here if this
variable that we've specified in the URL
is set so if get name so checking that
except then I just want to echo out that
variable okay so it's you know
relatively straightforward it's just the
ability to pass this string here and
output it to the page so it's just so
we've got some kind of
I see to work on okay so now what we
want to do is we want to go ahead and do
the important part and set up our
htaccess file so I'm going to create a
new document and a pop of space in there
and I'm going to go ahead and save this
I'm gonna say this as dot HT access it's
important that you don't call it HT
access we want a blank file name with
the extension HT access so when we save
this out that will look like that dot HT
access and I've actually spelt it wrong
so let's go ahead and just rename this
so HT access with two sees okay so now
that we've created our htaccess file and
actually spelt it correctly let's go
ahead and start to actually rewrite our
URL or I'll app allow our rewrites to be
written or URL to be rewritten okay so
the first thing I'm going to do is go
ahead and turn the rewrite engine on and
that just allows us to be able to change
the URL specify conditions and rules
okay so the rewrite condition is the
file name that we're giving we're not
giving any paths anything like that blah
blah blah we want the the file name so
we use a percentage sign here in curly
brackets we use a request file name now
after this what do we want to do well we
want to let the rewrite engine know and
I'm not an expert on this but we want to
let the rear-engine know that it's not a
path to a file so you want to say naught
minus F and that was saying that that
basically means not as I would like an
operator in PHP say not a path to a file
so that's what we want to do we're
requesting a filename now we need to
create a rewrite rule that allows us to
specify it without a PHP but then add
that onto the file name so we need to
create a rewrite rule now the rewrite
rule uses regular expressions I'm going
to add this little hat symbol here and
then some brackets and inside of here
we're going to
apply the the expression so outside of
here I've got this dollar here believe
that just allows us to be able to pass
on not pass on but allows us oh no no
sorry and the the dollar sign well this
starts off the irregular Swiss and this
ends it okay I'm thinking of something
can be different anyway so right we've
got the start in the end of our regular
expression let's go ahead and do this
now what do we want to match we want to
match something and then continue to
match and we're matching a dot so we
have here this okay now what we're gonna
do after this is we're going to apply
what we've matched and essentially stick
a PHP on the end of it but the ability
to you know not not actually have to
specify it
so I'll write our first we say dollar
one which is obviously the what we're
taking from here and we're putting up
here should be on the end of it and I'm
just gonna put an end C on there and
that just ignores the case so the case
doesn't matter okay so let's go back and
just refresh we've got something here
that's been pulled for our URL and then
up here HP has been stuck on the end of
it that's probably you know the best way
I can explain it so let's go ahead and
refresh and see what happens well at the
moment we just got name dot PHP
everything's working we're not getting
in errors so I can assume that I've
types of eating properly now let's go
ahead and check if our functionality
actually works I'm gonna go ahead and
remove dot PHP and you see it's worked
we're actually accessing a PHP page
without specifying dot PHP okay so we're
essentially done if you want to go ahead
and blainley copy this here's the code
so why would we want to do this I'll
spend a minute just talking about why we
might want to do this well the first
reason is that let's say we for example
were to create an HTML file that I'd
know you know quite a few people access
per day but we then need to change that
to a PHP file for whatever reason we
either can be able to change any of the
rules in
to handle PHP within HTML all we just
wanted to you know switch over you know
easy well that means that if you don't
specify HTML on the end and users can
access you know say name dot PHP or
named HTML regardless without the
extension it means that you can update
your htaccess file to deal with this so
it allows your users to specify things
without and you know you don't get tied
down to extensions the other reason is
it's better for search engine
optimization
at least it's you know thought to be
better for search engine optimization
you know it just looks cleaner as well
so when you know when you have someone
visit the site if you you know have
something that looks without an
extension tends to look a bit nicer
anyway but anyway the main point of this
is the functionality which is here we've
seen that it works I've included this
sort of spacer specifying a variable on
the end that this outputs the the page
functionality just so you can see that
it looks a lot better this could be
anything really it could be output name
you know dot PHP but obviously we
wouldn't be showing the PHP so that's
the point of the tutorial but I hope you
found this useful it's a great thing to
do like I said I've listed some of the
benefits and that's how to remove file
extensions using HT access</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
