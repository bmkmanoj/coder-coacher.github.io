notifications with sweet alert and then
in the next video we'll move on to look
at notifies additional options which
allow us to customize these in any way
we want
so first of all let's just return back
to our route and see what we're doing so
we have this message which we know how
to get and we have this type which we
know how to get I'm gonna change this
back to success and I'm gonna say you
have signed in so over on our welcome
page then we're not writing markup here
what we're doing is we are writing some
JavaScript so in this case we can use
the SW al method and in here we can pass
things like a title so great job we can
pass in a type so for example success
and a host of other different things but
we'll keep this as it is for now so here
you can see that we get the following
great job okay
perfect so it's exactly the same concept
all we want to do is say if notifier
ready obviously in their if statement
here then in here all we want to do is
in double quotes I suppose say notify
message in here
notify type now we can see that when we
head over to notify we get you have
signed in so it's really that easy to
implement you might find that sometimes
if you have you have signed in or we
could say you are now signed in you may
have a character like this in there and
if we have a look here we can see that
we get this here so you may want to
within laravel if you know that you are
always sending your own data just go
ahead and don't escape the type message
I suppose the type doesn't really matter
too much but that we'll go ahead and
solve that problem for you if you're
having it so you can see that this makes
all the difference so that's how we
basically implement sweet alert but in
the next video we're going to look at
passing additional options in to notify
to allow us to customize our sweet alert
messages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
