activating an account by email and to do
this we need to take a few steps but
first of all we'll start with something
a little bit easier and that's just not
allowing people to log in if they
haven't activated their account now
we've got no users in our database at
the moment so let's just register a user
and register them there so we get our
normal email it should come through
there we go so hello you have registered
and inside of our database table we know
that active is zero so when the user
actually locks in let's just close these
for now so when the user logs in we know
that once the validation passes we look
them up by their username or their email
what we can do is add a where clause in
here to say where active is true so now
what's going to happen is when I attempt
to login it won't let us in so the next
step then is when we actually register a
user around this point what we want to
do is create an identifier a random
string from the random Lib that we've
already seen and we want to hash this
and store it in the database and the
identifier we want to send by email
within a link and this link when the
user clicks on it will pass through the
identifier we will look up the or hash
the identify look up that hash in the
database if it matches we can or
activate the users account so let's
start by just generating this identifier
this random string so identifier it's
gonna be app random Lib
random string and that's going to be one
to eight and what we can do now is when
we create a user's account we can set
active to false we don't really need to
do that but it's helps to be explicit in
the creation here and we can set the
active hash to a hashed version of that
identifier so we say app hash and we
hash the identifier so let's just kill
the page here and output the identifier
so we can see what's happening here so
we have a syntax error just there let's
get rid of that so when we register them
let's remove this record from the
database let's register as normal and
hit register okay so so the method name
is generate string so let's tidy this up
again and track details and register
so this is our identifier if we look in
the database table we can see on the
active hash we have a hashed version of
that identifier like I said going to
send this by email in a query string
when a user clicks on it and goes to our
activate root to which we're going to be
creating it will be looked up and
compared so that's done how do we send
the identifier to our email view well we
just put it in this array like we've
seen earlier we can send any data
through to here that's just identifier
and then we set that key to identifier
so what we need to do now then is just
update our email template to include
this link so if we go over to email and
the views or registered what we can do
is create a paragraph from this create
another paragraph and we can say
activate your account using this link
and then we want to generate a URL to
our
activate root which we haven't created
yet so don't worry we'll go ahead and
create that now so under root and earth
let's create a new file and we'll call
this activate PHP inside of here we have
a get root to activate we then have our
callback and we want to use app as
always and in here let's just echo out
activate just so we know where we are so
we're gonna call this root activate and
then under our register template we can
say URL for activate on the end of this
we want to append to the query string
remember when we send this email we're
passing through this user object so all
we need to do is say email equals and
then output the users email such user
email and you want the identifier which
is just the identifier so let's send
this email and see what this looks like
and we'll see what problem we come up
against when we just use your r4 so we
will return back to this make sure we're
not killing the page anywhere here no
we're not and we will remove this record
from the database and we'll go ahead and
register again ok so named root now of
course we haven't included our activate
root inside of our main routes file so
let's do this now
and let's try and resend this oh yeah we
get this because this record has been
created so that's just filling the
password again and hit register
okay so we've been registered we can
check our email and we should see a new
email here okay so everything looks good
we've got our email in here we've got
the identifier but we don't have the URL
for the site in here so we user can
actually click on this they're gonna
have to copy and paste it over to your
end of your domain which is really
annoying so how do we share the base URL
of our application with all views well
if we go back over to our before
middleware remember where we were
appending off to our views all about
views so you can check of your users
signed in or not well we can do this a
same with our base URL now where does
our base URL come from if you remember
under your config that we created
earlier we have app URL so we can just
pass this into there and that means that
when you go live with your project you
can just change your domain and all of
your views that use the base URL will be
updated so gonna say this app config get
app dot URL and then inside of the
registered template we can just output
that variable that we're sharing with
all views so once again I know we're
registering a lot here it's pretty
annoying but we obviously need to test
this out we're gonna register again now
we should see the correct link being
sent through so we'll wait for that
email and there we go so you can click
on that and we see our activate route
and we just echoed out activate so we've
got the email in here so we know which
user to identify we've got the
identifier which we can hash and compare
to the identifier that we're storing in
here so the the hash I mean what they're
restoring in here and that's pretty much
it and then we can activate the users
account so inside of this routes then we
need to take all these steps that we've
just spoken about the first thing is
pulling through this data so we'll do
the same as we always do request equals
request so we'll get our request object
quite a variable for the email which is
request and it's get this time not post
because Moritz in the query string so we
want to get the email and we want to get
the identifier as well there we go so
the first check then is all the first
thing we need to do is pick up the
actual user's account so we're going to
say user equals app user we're email
equals that email and we're active is
false and we'll grab that records so we
don't to activate the users account if
they already are active that would be
silly so now what we're going to do is
we're going to check either if that user
can't be found or if the hash doesn't
match so what we can do is up here
before we go on with this hash the
identifier so hashed identifier and that
is app hash hash identifier so we're
grabbing the identifier hashing it so we
can compare it to the one in the
database and here we're going to compare
that so we need to do is say app we
check for a false on this app hash hash
check we pass in the users active hash
and the hashed identifier so if that's
the case we can show an error and not an
authorized error or something like that
or we could redirect the user off to
just the home page with an error if we
wanted to so let's go ahead and do that
so let's say app Flash global there was
a problem
activating your account and then we're
going to say app response redirect and
will redirect to the home page otherwise
we just want to activate the users
account flash a message and then
redirect them again
so we're going to say user now we could
do something like update it here but we
want this activation functionality to be
reusable in case for example an admin
wanted to be able to activate someone's
account so we're just gonna use a method
called activate account on the user
object which we're going to need to
create now so if we head over to your
user model you can go ahead and
implement this here so I'm gonna say
public function activate account and all
we're gonna do in here then is say this
update and track to activate an account
we need to set active to true so we need
to set this to true and we need to
remove the active hash we don't want to
keep the active hash in there so active
hash equals null so now that we've done
that then let's close this off go back
to our activate page after we've
activated the users account we just want
to flash a message and redirect so let's
copy and paste this down and we all say
your account has been activated and you
can sign in and we redirect home so
let's go ahead and test this out then if
we just well we could technically just
refresh this page like that we've got a
little bit of an error there so in user
okay so let's open up that model and of
course missing symbol there it's when I
hit enter there there was a problem
activating your account so we need to
work out why this is and I knew this
this was going to happen so if we take a
look at our registered template we're
outputting the identifier just there
under activate we can kill this and
output the identifier so let's take a
look at how this is working so it's
closed this off and re click this link
so if we take a look at the identify it
starts with zero zero eight and it ends
if we just go to the end of this with SQ
j so we might think well this actually
looks okay well if you take a look at a
point where we have one of these plus
symbols you can see there's actually a
space in this hash so these hashes do
not match and the reason for this is
there are characters in here which need
to be encoded before we send through to
a URL so let's just basically start the
whole process over again and let's go
back to our home page and we will delete
this users account before we go and
register again we're going to fix this
up so under our registered template here
we need to URL encode this link now we
can't just use wrap this in a PHP
function but twig has a URL encode
function or encode ability in here which
does exactly the same thing it's URL
encode so that's how we do it so now
that that's your L encoded we'll be able
to see the difference between this URL
with these pluses and things like that
and equals as well and any other
characters that are put in here we'll be
able to see the difference when we
register again
so let's register again
okay so we registered let's take a look
at the email and in here you can start
to see now we've got URL encoded
characters perfect so when I click this
we see that it's exactly the same thing
we can see that we've got all of the
characters that we expect in here
including pluses so what we can now do
is we can go ahead and remove that die
there which is just going to act as if
we clicked on the link now when I enter
here your account has been activated and
you can sign in refreshing in the
database we see active one and active
hash set to null we can go ahead and
login with that account now and there we
go we're signed in so although that was
a little bit of a long-winded we are
making sure that we're not allowing
anyone else to activate anyone else's
account by generating a very large
identifier hashing that identifier
within the database table and then
obviously allowing the user to click
that link in their inbox to go ahead and
activate their account</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
