5.5 is the responsible interface which a
first can sound a little bit confusing
so we're going to look at a few examples
as to how we can use this effectively to
really importantly clear up our
controllers this is a huge problem
usually for lots of people you end up
with a huge controller method and you
need a way to kind of separate this out
so we'll start with a really simple
example and then we'll dive into some
really useful things that we can do with
this so the first thing that I'm gonna
do is just go ahead and make a
controller in here and this will be a
user controller this is something that
would probably use to show list of users
show an individual user in this case it
doesn't really matter too much so let's
create an index method inside of here
and we'll just return a string in here
for now let's go and head over to our
web routes and we'll create a resource
for this so just underneath here let's
create a resource for our users and
we'll hit that user controller all this
will do is if you're not sure it will
allow us to post delete show a
particular user or show an index of all
of our users so we just reference the
user control it in here without any
method so if we head over to the browser
and we go over to slash users we should
be able to see that user string now of
course in this case what we would do is
we would go ahead and grab a list of
users so in this case we would use user
and get or we would use user all and
you'd probably do something else in
there paginate it maybe and then of
course you would return let's say you
were building an API return just the
user collection here that would be cast
to JSON and you would end up with the
following if of course you go ahead and
import the namespace really importantly
so you'll end up with the following of
course at the moment we don't have any
users in the database so why don't we
just go ahead and use tinker to generate
a few out and using the factory that we
already have within laravel setup so
let's go and use our user here let's say
generate a hundred of these and go ahead
and create these all that's going to do
is a randomly generate 100 users which
we can now see in here now of course
this is incredibly simple if you're
doing something as simple as this you
wouldn't even need to bother using the
responsible interface maybe you're using
some kind of presenter or transformer in
this case it's very very simple now what
happens if you wanted to maybe just
check if this was an AJAX request and
then respond with JSON but if it wasn't
an ajax request you wanted to respond
with a view that you'd created i don't
find myself doing this too often but
this is a start in looking how the
response responsible interface can help
us so let's just take a look at the
responsible interface on its own first
of all so inside of the HTTP directory
because it's an HTTP thing we're
actually responding i would create a
responses directory inside of here for a
small project and then inside of here
I'd probably categorize this under sub
directories but in our case we're going
to say user indexed response really
important there here we want to
determine which or at least represent
which kind of method we're showing so
how does this work then well let's just
take a look at building this out and
then we will see this in action so let's
go ahead and create this user index
response class and inside of this we
want to implement the responsible
interface so we're gonna go ahead and
implement the responsible interface and
let's go ahead and just pull this in so
you can see that this is under here now
if we open up this responsible interface
notice that the interface requires us to
implement one method which is to
response and this will create an HTTP
response that represents the object so
if we just go ahead and copy the
structure for us because we need to go
ahead and implement this in our response
and let's just go ahead and return say
use a response so we can see the
difference here now what we've out
effectively done is we've broken up
whatever we want to respond with and we
can just return a new instance of this
user index response at the moment this
doesn't really seem like it would be
that helpful but let's go ahead and do
this anyway and just see what we can do
with this so create a new user index
response pull the name space in for this
and effectively what you've done is
you've transferred what you want to
respond with over to this object and
everything in here is nice and clean so
if we go ahead and refresh this notice
that we get user response so because
we're moving this over to a new object
to separate any potentially complex
logic that we have into a new object
which is of course one of the benefits
of object-oriented programming we can
extract things out to new objects and
keep things nice and tidy but in this
case of course this is very simple so
let's take a look at an example of that
user index response if we have an ajax
request so first of all i'm just going
to leave this alone and we're going to
do this inside of here and see how
complex things get so of course what we
would do is create a user's variable we
would use user to maybe grab all of our
users and in here we would use our
request which we can either use the
request helper like this or we can pull
the request into any of the methods that
we use now controller and we can use
that request variable just here now we
have an ajax method which will detect if
something is an ajax request but in this
case if we are making an ajax request to
this particular endpoint we want to
respond with json so we would go ahead
and pass the users in there otherwise
what we would do is go ahead and return
a view and maybe we had this in the
users directory and we had an index file
and we wanted to pass down the users so
we can compact down that users variable
into an array so let's go ahead and
create this view and then we'll head
over to postman and check out the ajax
request for this so under users let's go
ahead and create this index dot blade
dot PHP file this is gonna be very very
simple so let's go ahead and just do a
for each one each of these users so for
each user's as user let's come down and
end that for each and in here we would
probably have some kind of user div with
a class of user and in here we would
output the user name for example so
let's go ahead and do that if we head
over to the browser of course this isn't
an ajax request so we're just listening
through and showing the user's name on
each of these lines ok so let's go and
make an AJAX request inside of postman
this is just a rest client if we send a
request through normally we'll just get
the web response so you can see the mark
up here if we head over to headers we
need to work out how we can kind of
simulate this so this is just a kind of
side tip if you're trying to simulate an
ajax request within a client like
so just good to go ahead and kind of
divert away from this for a minute
if we open up the laravel request object
so illuminating HTTP request and we look
about ajax method this is calling a
method called is xml httprequest so this
will give us an idea as to what
determines an XML request or an ajax
request so if we look for that method in
here it can't actually be found this is
on the base symphony request so if we
open up this and we go to is XML HTTP
request is checking if the X requested
with header is XML HTTP request this
will happen normally when you're making
Ajax request but of course we need to
simulate this directly in here so let's
just change this over to the following
just a tip if you want to check now and
send this over and you can see that we
do in fact get that list of JSON
response so in this case then what we
can do is take this logic and extract
that out to our user index response just
to make things a little bit cleaner of
course this is still very simple you
probably wouldn't need to extract this
out to an object that implements the
responsible interface in this case but
if things did get more complicated you
could do that and we're going to be
looking a more complex example in just a
moment so what we going to do is copy
this or at least cut this out and I'm
going to paste it directly over into
here notice that we all automatically
get the request object in here so we can
actually type in this and then pull the
name space in for this if we want to and
of course we need to make a couple of
changes here because we need to pass
through the users into this new object
so let's bring back returning a new user
index response and we're going to pass
the users into this and over in here
we're going to accept these in of course
in our constructor so let's go ahead and
create out constructor here and we can
go ahead and assign these so let's go
ahead and accept in users if you wanted
to you could also type in this as a
collection of users it's entirely up to
you what you do so let's go ahead and
pull that in now anyway so let's go
ahead and assign this users to a user's
property and we'll go ahead and add that
property just up here now of course for
something as simple as this this
maybe overkill but if things got more
complicated you can see how useful this
is you can pass through as many
arguments as you want here probably
keeping it to a minimum of you know
three or two would be even better so
what we can do now is use the request
here to check if this is an ajax request
we can use our response helper and we
can render JSON of course this needs to
be this users now and we can do the same
for this as well we can't compact down a
property inside of an object so we have
to use the width method here passing
down users as this users so effectively
what we've done with this slightly more
complex logic is break this out into a
new object and we have a nice clean
controller if we head over to the
browser and give this a refresh just
check that everything is okay here and
in this case we get an error because
it's not expecting us to type him this
so in actual fact we can't go ahead and
do that that would be nice if we could
but it doesn't really matter too much in
this case so we have our request through
we do our logic and we end up with the
following if we head over to postman and
go ahead and resubmit this through it
works in exactly the same way so
essentially what we've done here is just
broken this up into a really simple
response that is pretty much all the
responsible interface does it allows you
to create an object return it from your
controller and whatever's in to response
will be output to the page of course you
can just go ahead and return a view here
if you wanted to but to be honest if you
are returning a view it's no problem to
just go ahead and do this in here let's
now though look a more complex example
something that would actually be really
useful with the responsible interface
we'll start with looking at how we can
change this user index response over to
transform the users that we get out at
the moment we're just returning all of
the data inside of here and although we
can hide things like the ID that created
that and any other columns from the
response it would be nice if we can make
use of a responsible interface object to
go ahead and transform this data so the
first thing that I'm going to do is just
get rid of the view here we're going to
assume that we're building an API and
this returns a list of users just in
here so even on our browser now we're
just gonna see a list
these so what you would normally do to
go ahead and transform data is use
something like fractal which allows you
to define out a kind of transform
diversion of each of these objects you
may have seen this before and there's a
package just here called laravel fractal
which makes this really really easy to
use inside of laravel but if you're
building a really simple project or you
don't want to pull this in then our new
responsible interface can make this
incredibly simple to do so how do we go
ahead and customize each of these
objects using this well of course we
could do this in the controller but the
whole point of extracting this out into
an object means that we can do this a
lot better inside of here so inside of
to response what we'd want to do is
perhaps map through each of the users so
because this is a collection we can go
ahead and use the map method on Lara
Fell's collection objects now for each
of these callbacks just in here we will
get this user and we can go ahead and
return the data that we want to see
inside of here for each user effectively
just transforming this to what we want
so in this case we can say well we only
really want the name and maybe we also
want the email address in this response
so we can easily do this to effectively
create a transformer without anything
else so let's switch this over to users
and let's reference the local variable
that we've just gone ahead map through
give that a refresh and we end up with
the following so super simple
transformer extracted out to a method
just in here now it would be even better
since we're inside of an object here to
go ahead and create maybe a transform
users method and go ahead and do all of
this inside of here
so let's paste this into here and
instead go ahead and return this users
map and then inside of our to response
method here we can just call that method
so we could say this transform users
like so and that has nicely cleared that
up so give that a refresh and we get
exactly the same results you can do this
with all your data depending on how
you're transforming things it's a lot
nicer to use something like fractal or
the laravel fractal package which of
course makes use of fractal but this is
a kind of first step of transforming
your data
if you want to and this is massively
cleared up using the responsible
interface okay so let's go over and look
now a slightly more complex example I'm
just going to do a bit of setup and then
we'll see what we can do with the
response we'll interface in a bit more
detail
okay so I've just created two more
tables here and of course create a model
alongside of these this is product and
sales we're gonna focus on sales first
and look at how we might want to output
within some kind of admin index how many
sales we'd had in total and also the
total revenue that we've taken as well
so let's say that we had a couple of
sales in here let's just manually add
these in for now and we'll go ahead and
create another one just in here so of
course this is two sales adding up to
fifteen pounds or whatever currency
you're using so how would we do this
then well let's think about the euro
structure first admin product and sales
this should give you a overview of the
amount of sales you've had and also the
total value so what we want to do is
create a controller for this so let's
create a controller in here and let's
call this admin product sales controller
of course the structure here doesn't
really matter too much for now so if we
head over to this controller then of
course inside of an index method we'd
want to render out a view which showed
all of these sales so let's return a
view just first of all so that's a admin
index and of course we want to pass
these down as an array perhaps inside of
here or using the width method it's
entirely up to you how you would do that
so we maybe have total sales and this
would be some kind of value so let's
just hard code this in for now and maybe
we also had total revenue again which
you know in this case it'd be two and
that would be fifteen so let's create
this view just down inside of here so
let's create an admin folder let's
create an index top blade PHP file we'll
keep this really simple we'll say total
sales and that all output the total
sales and then we'll just break down and
we'll have total revenue in here like so
and that will of course reference the
total revenue variable so in this case
then if we just go over to resources or
routes and web sorry and we just go
ahead and setup a really simple route
here so let's go and say root get admin
products sales and we reference the
admin product sales controller and the
index method we should see them two
values in so of course what we've done
now is not a lot inside of here but it
could be worse so let's go ahead and say
total sales and actually assign this to
the sale count we can see here that
we've just got this sale model in here
already and the same for the revenue as
well so we would have total revenue and
this would be the sum of the total
column inside of our database so in here
we can go ahead and reference total
sales quite simple and down here we can
reference total revenue so if we just
give that a refresh it looks like we
need to pull the sale model in there and
also fix up the error just here with
that spelling and there we go so we have
the total sales and the total revenue
now in this case things could get a
little bit more complicated this could
be more complicated you might be using
some where clauses in here we want to
extract this out to an object that uses
the responsible interface so let's
create a response just in here under
here and of course I'm just gonna put
this in the root directory but you could
categorize these and we're gonna call
this admin product sales index response
so if I was to create these I would say
well use the kind of same structure as
my controller with the method and then I
would add a response on the end of this
so let's go ahead and build this out so
a class of admin product sales index
response and of course we need to
implement the responsible interface like
so and go ahead and pull that in and of
course pull the namespace in for this as
well we need to of course if we just
head over to here to implement the true
response method so let's go ahead and
create this inside of here and we are
pretty much done so we what we can start
to do now is extract all of this out so
I can pretty much get rid of all of this
paste it inside of here
pull in the model that I needed and then
I could go ahead and just return this so
if we just return a new admin product
sales
next response we should get the same
result of course if we pull the
namespace in for this there we go so
already we've moved things over but of
course what we've just done is removed
one thing to another place pretty much
for no reason we could have kept that
inside of that method so the whole point
of this is if you do need to start
extracting things out to other methods
it's better to do that inside of here
than it is to do that inside of here so
what we could do is inside of our
controller create a total sales method
which when it returned that value but
we're cluttering up our controller here
with additional methods we'd rather do
that inside of the response object just
in here so what we can do now now that
we're in a new object or a new class we
can very simply say well I want to
extract out the logic to calculate the
total sales into a new method and I want
to do the same thing for the revenue as
well and now it's out of our controller
because of course we're gonna have other
methods inside of here like show we
don't really want to cost this
controller with lots of methods that
only relate to say the index method so
in this case what we can do is we can
take the total sales and we can just
simply return this from here like so and
of course in here this might be a little
bit more complicated and we can do the
same with the total revenue as well go
ahead and return that and of course we
can now clear this response method up
and we can just reference this total
sales method like so and we can do the
same thing for the revenue method as
well so this total revenue like so okay
we get the exact same result we've
extracted this out but it hasn't
Tufted up our entire controller now just
to further demonstrate this what if we
wanted inside of our controller a show
method which took in a product and we
wanted to show the specific sales and
the specific revenue for that product
well again if this logic got a little
bit more complicated or to be honest
even if it didn't and you just wanted to
start out very cleanly you could use a
class in here with a responsible
interface so what can I do is just
create one more of these so let's just
copy the name of this and in under
responses we're gonna create an admin
sailes show response and of course the
naming here is completely up to you and
it's just go ahead and grab the
structure of this oval though we're
gonna get rid of the entire thing so
what we want to do is of course return a
response in here and we probably want a
couple of methods that are going to make
our life easier and extract this out so
let's switch over the name of this let's
just return something from here so we
can go all of our routing setup and that
should be pretty much it for now over to
our controller what we can now do is
return a new admin product cell show
response we can pass through the product
that we're dealing with and everything
is nice and tidy so let's pull the name
in for this let's go over to our show
response here and make sure we accept
that product in to the constructor and
of course we can type in this because we
know that we're expecting a product to
be passed in here and we can go ahead
and assign this product to product
pretty straightforward and go ahead and
create the product property up there for
that okay so now that we've done this
what we should be able to see if we just
come over to say product one and then
sales we should see that in there once
we've created the route so if we have
over two routes and web and we just
duplicate this down using route model
binding with the ID as the default will
pass the product just into here and of
course we'll call the show method so if
we just head over and actually create a
product inside of here so let's just say
iPhone go ahead and add in the created
and updated app they manually what we
can now do is relate the sale to the
product so I'm just going to modify the
structure in here manually but of course
you'd create a migration for this so
let's say product ID just inside of here
this of course is going to be an integer
cost very rough we're just playing
around here and let's go ahead and add
in the product the way looking for so of
course this Product ID of one now has
two sales one at ten and one at five so
just a really rough way to do this now
of course what we also need to do is for
a product to be able to calculate the
sales we need that relationship set up
as well so let's create a sales
relationship and let's return that this
has many and it has many
or sales rather like so and that's of
course pull the namespace in for this if
it's in a different location so what we
should now be able to do is head over to
here
we should see this it's not working
quite at the moment because we need to
pull this in but we are now on that
route so if we have over to the
controller pull in the namespace for
this give that a refresh we of course
are expecting a product to be passed in
here so we're a little bit further along
now but of course over in our response
we just need to pull the namespace in
for the product so the type printing
works and we end up with the following
so with all that setup done what we now
want to do is show a view with the total
sales and of course we can use the same
view here so we could use the admin
index view we'll go ahead and use this
anyway but of course you would separate
this out into a new view so in this case
then we want to go ahead and return a
view and we're just gonna say admin
index but like I said that would
probably be a different view and now in
here we want to grab the total sales for
this product so total sales
maybe we call a total sales method like
we did before and we have the same thing
for total revenue as well so we call a
total revenue method what we can now do
is outside about controller start to
extract these out so total sales would
of course be a little bit more complex
than before we would have to return the
product that we went ahead and pulled in
we'd have to access the sales
relationship and then grab the count of
them and we can do the same thing for
the revenue as well that switch this
over to total revenue and of course we
would sum up the total amount that we'd
sold for that particular product so we
now see two and 15 in exactly the same
way now we can kind of prove this just
by going ahead and getting rid of this
particular sale and of course we know
that that's going to go ahead and just
update either way that is pretty much
the responsible interface we've dived
into this quite a bit if you find
yourself creating a lot of methods
inside of your controllers you can now
extract these out to separate classes
inject what you need in make sure you
implement the responsible interface and
you can return the response just inside
of here it's a really nice way in
laravel 5.5 that we now have to clear up
our controller methods</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
