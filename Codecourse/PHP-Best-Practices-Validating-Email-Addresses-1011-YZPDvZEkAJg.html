emails now this is a very simple task
that some people like to make difficult
for whatever reason I don't know to be
honest here's why did I created a valid
email variable and I assigned it to a
valid email then I created an invalid
email and assigned it to hello world
which obviously isn't a valid email and
then created its valid which is equal to
Craig match I may have this super long
regular expression and then we pass in
the valid email and below here we're
just saying if it's valid echo valid
email provided else blah blah blah so if
we go to our browser and they refresh we
get valid email provided which is
correct this is a valid email if we pass
in this variable instead so invalid
email we're going to get invalidating
your provided so this is fine everything
is working right well it works but it's
not the way that I would go about it not
only is this super super unreadable
but it also makes a difference in speed
it's not a super significant speed
difference but it does make a difference
especially if you're running running
more than one expression so I'm going to
replace all of this with just one
function and we're not going to use any
regular expression at all so we're going
to say filter var we're going to pass in
the email and then we're going to pass
in a constant filter validate email and
this tells PHP that we want to check if
this is an email so now let's go to a
browser hit refresh valid email provided
perfect this is a valid email replace it
with invalid email refresh invalid email
provided so this is a much more clean
much more readable much faster way of
going about validating emails</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
