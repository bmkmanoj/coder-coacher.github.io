org and in this video I want to talk
about a new text editor that I've
recently been personally using and will
now use for PHP academy' tutorials from
myself which will obviously be the
majority of tutorials so this text
editor is called sublime or sublime text
2 to be precise I recently purchased it
and following a sort of comment I posted
on the facebook page PHP Academy
Facebook page it seemed like well there
was an overwhelming response that you
know I simply have to use this text
editor in tutorials now from the view
that you see at the moment the full
screen view I can understand why and a
lot of you have said you'd prefer a dark
theme to this so this kind of dark
effect here with light text on the top
so I need as much feedback about this as
possible there's already been loads on
the facebook group so if you go to
facebook.com forward slash learn web dev
there'll be a link in the description of
the video head over there and enter you
know give me as much information as you
as you can about this or feel free to
email me Alex at PHP academy' de org so
this new text editor I sort of I mean
what the main reason for focusing on
something like this is to switch over to
focus on the code rather than have this
menu bar that we had in first of all
context which I've used since 2009 right
through to notepad plus plus which I
still feel is a bit too bulky for what
I'm trying to achieve so really we're
focusing on the code and you know
because these are videos we want to
focus on code and you know you want to
listen to what what's being taught which
is understandable by really when I was
studying a lot of feedback from people
that are watching videos because
obviously you guys and the most
important people here so you're you know
you're the people you're the audience so
yeah so I've had a few suggestions on
this in terms of theming sublime also
the syntax highlighting
like that but if you've got any
suggestions font sizes anything that you
feel that you want to start seeing in
videos it doesn't even have to be
related to sublime it could be anything
you know the way I'm teaching the way I
explain things absolutely anything as
much feedback as you can give please
please do so go ahead comment in the
video drop me an email to Alex at PHP
Academy to org head over to the Facebook
page over to the PHP Academy forum
anything that you right I'll always take
on board so so be really really useful
but generally well basically now we're
just going to be using sublime for
tutorials so hopefully allow us to focus
on the code and start building some
really good applications from here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
