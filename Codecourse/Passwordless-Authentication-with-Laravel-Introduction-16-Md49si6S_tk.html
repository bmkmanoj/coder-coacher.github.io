be baking password less authentication
into our laravel application now if you
have absolutely no idea what password
list authentication is of course I'm
going to show you a demo right now and
we're going to take a look at how this
works so the first thing to know is the
login page here which is the kind of
login page when I click this link up
here it looks completely different
obviously we don't have a password here
what we can actually do is still login
with the password if we want but we're
really focusing on how to do this with
no password now the first thing I'm
going to do is just sign up now notice
that we are allowing a password in here
when we sign up really what we can do is
change this around to do whatever we
want so I'm going to leave it completely
open so if you wanted to disable
passwords altogether or change the flow
of this or really just do whatever you
want that's absolutely fine but for now
what we're going to do is assume that
the user is going to sign in with a very
strong password or at least register
with a very strong password and then in
the future they may want to sign in
without a password so they might not
want to have to keep entering their
password so in that case then once I
have an account registered this is in
the database we obviously have a
password stored but now when we log in
by default we go ahead and enter our
email address we can check to be
remembered so this will work in exactly
the same way and then we can send a
magic link so once we click this what
this will do is it will fire off an
email which will allow us to then go
ahead and click a link to sign in now
I'm using mail trap here just to test
this it's just a very quick way to test
sending email without having to send it
to a real email address but in this case
it would be emailed to Alex a code
course comm so notice here then that we
have an email just pretty plain for now
we're not going to bother styling this
up but we have a long token in here and
then we also have remember equals zero
because I didn't check remember when I
went ahead and signed in if I were to
have checked that it would go ahead and
pass this into the query string and then
I would be remembered when I eventually
sign in and then we also fur just a
little bit of further protection also
have the email address in the URI
and this is really important because we
don't want to leave this open to
potential abuse so we've kind of
implemented two security factors here
one the email has to match and of course
the token has to match as well so when
we click this we're literally just
signed in now notice that the link has
expired I happen to have set this to a
very short period of time but we can
adjust that so since the link has
expired let's go ahead and just kick
this flow off again so again it's really
important that we do expire links makes
a lot of sense so here's my new magic
link I click it and I happen to be
signed in so that is pretty much it to
be honest we're gonna leave this open so
you can customize it however you want
we're gonna leave it so we can configure
it however we want and generally make it
so it's just very very easy to work with
and doesn't really get in the way of
your application it just allows you to
kind of tack this on so let's go ahead
and in the next part look at setting all
of this up and we'll finish this off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
