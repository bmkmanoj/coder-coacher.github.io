out of the scope of this video but what
gonna do is look at installing this
package and then creating an editor
config file and all editor config is is
a package that allows you to port over
and edits a config file around with your
projects that keeps things consistent so
we're not dive into that too much we'll
just look at an example so the first
thing I want to do is install this
package so it's editor config that's
going to install this wait for that to
download and it is done so for example
let's say I have some kind of PHP file
here so we know that when we look to our
settings out default settings we saw
that I set things like translate tabs to
spaces now if you are working on a
project perhaps an open source project
and people are downloading your code to
then contribute to they might not have
this set so what you can do is commit
with your project and edit a config file
and that is just a dot file and it's
just called editor config so we create
this file we port this around with our
project and it means we can set the
standards directly within here and as
long as someone has this editor conflict
plug-in enabled it means that everything
will just happen automatically so just
for the purpose of this why don't we get
rid of translate tabs to spaces or we
can just explicitly set it to false in
here so that means that inside of my
index file here when I do a tab I'm
actually seeing a tab character that's
what that line just there means so let's
go and set up our elders editor config
file and I'm gonna set the root to true
here you can obviously read more about
this on the editor config website and
I'm going to set my indent style equal
to a space I'm gonna set my indent size
to 4 cuz I know I want 4 spaces and what
I'm also gonna do is I'm gonna say end
of line equals LF that's just the type
of end of line and then I'm gonna say
insert final new line true so the last
thing you need to do is just
specify what these apply for you can
obviously choose different patterns here
but I'm just saying well I want these
settings that apply to all files so
let's save this out and close off our
index dot PHP file reopen it let's do a
tab when i refresh you can see that now
we actually have four spaces rather than
a tab character and what this also means
is that once I'm coding and I save if I
just do an echo here or something
notice that when I save now it inserts a
final new line for me which is great so
everything here is brilliant I'm all set
up ready to go I can pour editor config
around with my project and the standards
remain exactly the same it's really
really useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
