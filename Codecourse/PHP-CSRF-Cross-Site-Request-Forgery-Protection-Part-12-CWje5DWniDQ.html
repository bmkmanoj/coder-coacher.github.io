cross-site request forgery protection
we'll be explaining what cross-site
request forgery is we'll be looking at
the example that you can see in front of
you and then we'll actually be building
the class that will allow us to generate
tokens and send them with our request
now this will sounds a little
complicated if you're new to the idea of
a cross-site request forgery but like I
said we'll be explaining how this is
with this small example so you can see
at the moment we have a representation
of perhaps adding the quantity of an
item to a shopping cart now this
functionality doesn't actually work so
don't worry too much about what this is
actually doing don't worry about
validation or actually adding this
product to a car that's not the point
here the point is that we're going to be
protecting against cross-site request
forgery so what is cross-site request
forgery well if we take a look at the
source of this form we have a method of
post here we have a field here which
allows us to enter a particular quantity
so assuming numerical but this doesn't
really matter in this example we've got
a submit button and we have a hidden
field here which represents the product
ID we've also got this token but we'll
explain that in just a moment so what's
happening here is when I go ahead and
submit this I'd go ahead and type in the
number say 1 a click order and we get
this response here process order so
everything there has been successful now
what happens if I go ahead and change
this form to a get method so using the
super global get in PHP well let's just
go ahead and replace this so we'll do a
find and replace on dollar underscore
post and we'll replace this with get so
let's go ahead and replace all so let's
change the method of this form to get
and we'll go ahead and refresh okay so
what's going to happen now is when we
click or type in one and click order
you'll see that the same thing happens
process order and
we have these variables in the euro bar
as you'd expect now ignoring this token
for now if we would not to have
implemented the protection that we can
see in the form at the moment we would
have the ability to pass the quantity
that we wanted to place an order for and
the product ID as well so let's just say
I was an attacker and I wanted to allow
someone to basically purchase something
or order something without them knowing
so perhaps they're logged in to this
website and and an attacker knows that
they're logged into the website or
perhaps doesn't and forces the user to
view this URL or essentially make a
request to the server with these
variables if you like now this could be
something like a redirect it could be
for example a JavaScript redirect it
could be embedded at an image which
would then load the resource and and
still make the same request so if this
you imagine is embedded in the source of
an image it would do exactly the same
thing
however this happens when we hit enter
now this isn't going to work but that
would process an order for a user so for
example we were to remove the you know
what we've already implemented this
would go ahead and it would place an
order for a user so if I redirected you
to this page and you were logged in this
would execute the same functionality as
if you had submitted the form yourself
so the essence of this is that an
attacker can almost make you submit a
form that's probably the basic way of
putting it so we want to protect against
this so what we really need is some way
of the user
that's visiting the page to actually
submit a token along with their request
now you saw the token in the URL bar a
moment ago that was because we've
generated a token and we've stored this
on the server so we've stored this as a
session a PHP session and then we have
checked
the token that's submitted by the user
with the token that's been stored at in
that session so what's going to happen
is I'm going to land on this page and
inside of the form you'll see that I
generate a token as a hidden field now
this is a random token it's randomly
generated so if I hit f5 on my keyboard
you can see that this token changes
every time now really it depends on the
strength or the actual randomness of
this token we using open SSL and open
SSL function two generators we'll look
into at any moment but basically you
want the ability to generate the most
random token you can so as long as we've
generated a sufficiently random token
what we'll actually do is we'll store
this token every time we refresh the
page inside a session which an attacker
will not have access to then when we
submit the form the token is sent along
with this form and then we can check it
on the the PHP side so on the server
side we can actually check this token
now if the tokens match for example now
if I click order the tokens have matched
and therefore we have a success
now what happens if I go ahead and I
modify this purposely in the form so I'm
just going to add an A on to the end of
this and hit enter now what happens when
I hit type in one and hit order nothing
happens so the data is sent the quantity
has sent the product ID has been sent
the tokens been sent but with this not
matching
we have protected against cross-site
request forgery so it's a very very
basic concept but sometimes it takes a
little while to get to get used to but
by doing this on forms on it could be on
any form but particularly on forms that
are susceptible to this kind of attack
we can protect against people basically
having things done on their behalf by an
attacker so what we're going to go ahead
and do is we're going to go ahead and
write the class for this which makes it
super easy to go
head and generate a token and actually
check that token on the server side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
