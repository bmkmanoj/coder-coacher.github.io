classes extremely flexible if they deal
with maybe storing items now essentially
what this will allow you to do is use
PHP z' count function on an object to
return some count now this really
doesn't matter what it is but we're
gonna be implementing a collection class
which allows us to add items to a
collection and then maybe you could do
something else with them iterate through
them but what we're interested in here
is being able to count them and if
you've used a framework like laravel
you'll know that laravel uses a
collection to store things perhaps that
come back from the database and in fact
within laravel you can actually use
count on some kind of collection so how
do we actually do this well let's start
- just to find out a collection class
and we're going to implement countable
now I'm going to get rid of this just
for now just so we can see what it looks
like without but in some kind of
collection the whole idea of this is
that you would have some kind of items
stored within here and you could have
the ability to maybe pass some items
into the constructor as you create a new
instance of this so maybe an array of
items you may have other methods that
allow you to add items but we'll keep
this nice and simple and then what we
want to do is set there my terms - what
we pass in so the way that we use this
is we would say a collection and this
could be a collection of user models
anything and we create a new collection
now for this purpose we're just going to
be passing into this some kind of a
write of strings of course it really
doesn't matter what we pass in here the
whole concept is the same so we have one
two and three now we could go and
implement a count method and that's a
really good idea anyway so if we just do
this and return count now we can use the
count function in here because we can
just say this items which happens to be
an array and we can use count on an
array so if we were to echo out
collection count we would expect to see
three let's go
here and there we go so bringing in the
countable interface this means that you
wouldn't have to do something like if
collection count and then say is greater
than zero you could actually improve on
this and regardless of whether you use
it it's nice to have it in there anyway
it doesn't really take much extra effort
so what we want to be able to do is say
count like this collection now at the
moment as you'd expect by doing this on
an object this will actually work but we
won't get that back the result that we
would expect we actually get back a 1
now what we want count like this to do
is represent the amount of items we have
in this property now we already have a
function called count or a method rather
called count which allows us to retrieve
this value bar as soon as we go and
implement countable on here what will
happen is when we call the count
function on this collection the
interface that we've defined requires
that we have a count method and that's
what will be called when we use count so
if we head over to the manual you can
see this it requires here a count method
so let's just take a look and see what
this does and there we go we see the
value 3 so a tiny bit of extra effort
literally just implementing countable
and of course if you had a class that
didn't necessarily deal with counting
you could implement one anyway and then
go ahead and return a sensible value
really depends on what you're doing
either way that's a very simple
interface that's incredibly useful
within classes just to allow for a
little bit more flexibility</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
