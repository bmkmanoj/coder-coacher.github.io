will mean that if we need to create any
other pages down the line these will be
easy to extend and we can keep exactly
the same structure you may remember
doing something like require headed up
PHP and then somewhere down here require
footer.php and then in here would go
your content and this is kind of exactly
what we're doing so under views I'm
going to create a new folder called
templates and I'm going to create one
template you can create other templates
for different kinds of pages but we're
just going to have a default template
I'm going to call this default wig so
inside of here we want to generate some
HTML and you can go ahead and copy this
but essentially this is just a plain
document layout so up here we can give
this a title so destructive and
obviously we want all of our content to
sit just in here so to actually pull our
content in with twig we use blocks so we
say block content end block so how do we
use this template on home well it's
pretty straightforward all we do is at
the top of this page we say that we want
to extend that template so we give the
full path to it so it's templates /
default wig and then we define the block
here with all of the content in and what
that will do is it will place your
content just here so we'll see how this
works so over on home we say block
content down here we end up block and in
here we say home so now if we head over
to this page and refresh it doesn't look
too much different but you can see we
have our title here and if we view the
page source you can see that we've got
everything and it's placed that content
within here so whenever you need to
create a new page and you've built your
design with in here and you've may be
loaded in style sheets or you've loaded
in scripts down here you can just create
a new file extend this
template and include content and in the
next video we're going to be doing just
that by pulling in Twitter bootstrap and
we're going to be creating a container
with in here and then we can eventually
build up our form on our homepage which
will allow us to send a message</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
