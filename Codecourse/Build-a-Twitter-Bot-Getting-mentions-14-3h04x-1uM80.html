building a Twitter part that performs
sentiment analysis on any mentions that
it receives so we're gonna take a look
at how this works and then we're going
to have a look at some of the services
that we're going to be using to pull all
this together now this isn't a
production ready version it would still
work and it's perfectly acceptable to
use this but I would recommend you check
out the laravel version of this series
that we have if you want to pull this
together and build your own bot so let's
see how this works
now I have a Twitter account already set
up just here called code course bot and
if I just tweet it you can see I've been
playing around with it here I am very
happy for example we go ahead and tweet
that now what's gonna happen when we
refresh this page is the first thing is
we're going to come over and use the
mentions timeline part of the Twitter
API this will pull back all mentions and
then we're going to hit a service called
monkey learn which we'll talk more about
throughout this series but essentially
this will allow us to send text off for
sentiment analysis as part of one of
their modules but will like I said
explore that later so when i refresh the
first thing that's going to happen is
we're actually checking a database of
things we've already mentioned because
we don't want to repeatedly reply to
people that would be pretty annoying and
once that's done you can see here that
if I just check out this tweet we have a
reply so a happy face just here and it
works exactly the same with these being
sad so it rained today for example so
something a little bit more complex if
we go ahead and reply refresh here and
if we come over you can see that this
has a kind of neutral face so let's get
started with this we're going to be
doing this all on one page just so we
can get to grips with it like I said
check out the laravel version if you
really want a nice way to build this but
let's start from scratch and build this
up so the first thing that you'll want
to do is set up a Twitter account to
test this out and of course you don't
need to you can use your own account but
sometimes it's just nice to have a
separate account to test these out so
what we're going to be doing then with
Twitter is setting up an app so if you
come over to dev Twitter comments
have your account or if you're using
your own account you want to come over
here and you want to just scroll down
just to here to manage your apps so apps
Twitter comm so we're going to create an
app which will allow us to authenticate
with the API and this will of course
allow us to basically take any mentions
that we receive and then act on them so
let's create a new app and we'll see
what we need to do here so we can say is
something like code course sent if but
these have to be unique names so you
probably won't get the name that you
want and I'm just gonna say a sentiment
analysis but and we can go and just end
to any website here so code course comm
in this case so we don't need a callback
URL and we just want to make sure that
we read and agree to the terms of
conditions here and once we have created
this we will get our consumer key and we
will also get a secret key as well just
here and what we're also going to need
to do is create an access token
because what we're not doing is
authenticating with this app there's no
need to do that we're not signing in or
anything like that all we need is an
access token so we can start to use the
API send tweets and receive tweets so
now that we have our account set up
we're going to use a dependency called
code bird which is a really nice way
just to interact with the Twitter API
doing this without a dependency is just
more messy than it probably needs to be
so I have in my text editor an empty
file ready to go and the first thing
that we want to do is just pull down
this code bird dependency and then see
if we can grab all of the mentions and
we can obviously test this out so if we
just go over to composer if you don't
have composer already go ahead and
download this I'm gonna be using this to
install code bird PHP so what we want to
do then is over in the terminal we want
to make sure that we're within the
directory we're working in and run a
composer require on this and just wait
for this to download so now that's done
we can
over to index dot PHP we obviously have
a composer that JSON file created for us
and we have all of our dependencies in
our vendor folder and we just want to
require in vendor autoload and we are
good to go so up here let's just use
code bird code bird that's the
dependency and here we are going to set
our consumer key so we just say code
bird we have a set consumer key static
method and in to this we need to pass in
two arguments and if we just head over
to the app that we created it's this
just here like so
and it in this one just here as well so
we're just gonna paste this in like so
so now we have our consumer key set we
just want to grab the instance of code
bird that we're going to use so get
instance and just down here we want to
change the return format when we
actually hit the API so by default this
will be an object but we want to change
this to be a array or an array so we're
gonna say set return format on code bird
and in here we just give the code bird
return format array Global just like
that now the other thing that we need to
do is set an access token because we're
not authenticated with the app like I
said earlier we need to manually pass
this in so we're then automatically
authenticated and we can start using
mentions or tweeting anything like that
so to do this we use our code bird
instance and we set our token just on
here and again this takes two arguments
we have our access token just in there
and then we have our access token secret
so we can just grab that in there like
so so now we are fully authenticated
with Twitter and we can actually start
to grab mentions so to do this with code
bird it's pretty straightforward we just
say mentions and we're going to use code
bird to grab the statuses and we use
mentions time
like so now the way this works within
code bird if you just come down to the
github page when we map the API methods
to function calls we basically just take
it and then we give like a camel case
like this so if we come over here we've
got statuses mentions time line we get
rid of the underscore and T becomes
uppercase so that's pretty much how we
do that with code bird now there's a
really important argument we need to
pass into the mentions time line and
that is the last ID now I already have
my database set up we're going to go
through this in a bit but this will
basically just keep track of all of the
items that we've already replied to the
reason being is we don't want to grab
any mentions that we've already replied
to that would be silly we would just
keep repeatedly replying to people then
so into here we will eventually pass in
that last ID when we hit our database to
grab this back so we can now just test
out the mentions so that's just a var
dump on this and we can kill the page or
not head over to our browser hit refresh
and we should see here a load of
mentions now it's really important to
note this will return the 20 most recent
mentions so what we're actually going to
be doing eventually is running this
every 20 minutes if you were to set up a
chrome to handle this it would run every
or say 15 minutes this would also get
around Twitter's rate limiting as well
because this endpoint is rate limited so
you get 15 requests every 15 minutes so
if we run this every 15 minutes that's
more than enough to get around this we
don't need to reply instantly and you
could probably tweak this to make it a
little bit better as well in terms of
the timing so now that we have our
mentions the first thing that we want to
do is just check if we actually have any
mentions and to do this we can just say
well is the first key set here so you
can see we've got an array of 22 items
and we have the first key here now the
reason that we have 22 items so if we go
down to the bottom you can see that we
get an HTTP status which is obviously
too
this has worked and we also have a rate
as well so you can see here that we have
a remaining limit which is now 14 and we
have a limit this will reset after 15
minutes so if this is not set we just
want to return now obviously this isn't
ideal because it's on a single page but
like I said if you followed the laravel
version this is going to be a lot better
so now that we have our list of mentions
what we need to do is go through them
and create an array of tweets that we
can actually do something with so we
essentially just want to extract out the
data here that we need because there's a
lots of information here that we really
don't need so to do this I'm just going
to create an empty tweets array and I'm
going to go through each of the mentions
so I'm going to give these an index like
so now for each loop here mention will
be each one of them tweets but we have a
slight problem in the fact that it will
also include the HTTP status and the
rate so to get around this we just want
to say if is set mention ID this will
give us a good enough indication the
fact that if the ID is set here then we
know that this is a tweet otherwise we
know it's probably not a tweet so we
have that if statement in there just to
make sure we're only looping through
tweets or at least where are you doing
something with tweets so what we can now
do is append to that tweets array that
we created up here and what we need are
the ID so we want to grab the mention ID
we also need the user's screen name so
let's say user screen name and we'll go
and grab this from user and then it's
just screen name so that's just here we
scroll up a little bit we've got user
and then we've got screen name this will
allow us to obviously reply to that
person and obviously we need the text
because we need to perform sentiment
analysis on this text so we just go
ahead and pull that back
so now if we do a var dump on the tweets
that we've got we should see the
following so this is a little bit nicer
we can use the ID to store this once
we've replied and of course we can use
the text to perform sentiment analysis
and then the screen name to act the user
in a tweet to reply to them so what we
now need to do is only extract the text
because we're gonna be sending this off
to monkey Learn for analysis and monkey
learn will allow you to send off a
collection of text which will then be
analyzed and then will be returned and
we'll see how that will work in just a
minute but to do this we just want to
say something like tweets text and then
use a ray map to go through this tweets
array and then only pull back the text
so to do this we just have a closure
just in here for the second argument
it's the array that we want to map
through and then inside of here we get a
tweet so to do this we just return tweet
text and if we just do a var dump on the
tweet text we now should have just a
list of the text so we can send this off
to monkey ler and this will give us back
an indexed array of the result for each
one so say this would be neutral this
would be positive this would be negative
and monkey learner returned all that
information to us so now that we have
our mentions back and we've extracted
out the tweet text we're going to go on
to the next part where we're going to
look at getting monkey learned set up
learn about what monkey learned does and
how we use it and then we will actually
start to perform the sentiment analysis
which will put us in a good position to
reply to that user based on their tweet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
