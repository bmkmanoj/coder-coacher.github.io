something like MAMP or lamp or even zamp
for your local development environments
and that's fine for beginners but as you
advance into building more advanced kind
of applications and websites you begin
to need more in you begin to need more
from your development environment things
like PHP extensions encrypt is a very
good one a few months ago before I
started to use vagrant I was using MAMP
and I wanted to start getting into
laravel the problem is however laravel
requires M crypt witches would pay a PHP
err password extension and MAMP made it
extremely difficult to install M crypt I
mean it took about an hour of googling
but if I had known about vagrant back
then then my life would have been much
simpler ok so getting into the lesson
now the first thing that you want to do
is go to virtualbox.org and hit
downloads and then you obviously want to
choose your your operating system here I
already have mine installed so I don't
need to worry about that but once that's
done go to vagrant opcom hit download
and then just choose your operating
system and follow the instructions so
once that's all done you want to go to
your command line and you want to make
sure the vagrant is actually installed
so all you have to do is type vagrant
and if you get a list of commands like
this then everything went fine so now
that vagrant is installed the first
thing that we want to do is make a new
directory and I have a dedicated
websites directory for this but it could
it could be on your desktop or anywhere
it really doesn't matter where you make
this so this directory is going to be
the name of the website or application
that you're working on so in this case
I'll just call it vagrant demo
so once that's done you want to see the
in the vagrant demo or whatever you
called your application sorry a
directory and then what you want to do
is type vagrant sorry not up we want to
type vagrant in it and what this will do
is create a vagrant file inside the
directory so if we just list everything
here you'll see that we have this
vagrant file and if we edit it and let's
just set the syntax to Ruby you'll see
this file so most of it you don't have
to worry about at all the only things
that you really do have to worry about
is this so all you need to do is replace
the space here with your box I recommend
a bun to slash trusty 64 that's what I
always use the next thing that you want
to do is just uncomment that line and
that's all you need to do here so if we
just get rid of that what we can do now
is type vagrant up okay so once that's
done what you want to do is say vagrant
SSH and then hopefully you'll see this
screen so to access our site we want to
go to localhost colon 8080 and the
reason that we're not seeing anything
here is because we haven't installed
Apache or nginx so to do that we need to
use the apt-get command and we need to
use sudo as well with that and the first
thing we're going to do is say update
and that's going to update the apt-get
repositories so once that's done you
should see your screen like this next
thing that we're going to do is actually
install Apache so sudo apt-get Apache
sorry
so to add get install apache2 then we
want to hit Y for yes just to confirm
that we want to continue and give it a
couple of seconds and that should
install Apache for us so now if we hit
refresh in a browser we should see this
default Apache Ubuntu default page now
there's something that we haven't
covered
yet and that's something called shared
folders so if we just go to Vegas and
this yep this is it
so if we say touch index dot HTML what
that does is it creates a file called
index dot HTML and then if we open this
open a Finder you'll see that that index
dot HTML was created there now if we
delete that here and list everything
here and our VM you'll see that it's
gone so this is a shared folder
everything that we create in this
directory inside the VM is going to turn
up in our default operating system and
vice-versa so with that in mind if we go
to VAT www and list everything you'll
see that we have this HTML directory and
inside here is index dot HTML and this
is this page that we're seeing here so
all we need to do is start vela ping our
website right well not quite
we need to change the apache document
root to our shared folder so we can
develop our application on our operating
system so to do this we say sudo nano et
Cie Apache to sites enabled and 0 0 0
default comp and down here you'll see
this document root we want to change
this to that vagrant directory where we
just were now if we leave this like that
we're going to get a forbidden error so
to fix this we need to add a couple of
lines of configuration just below here
we're going to say directory vagrant
which is our shared folder then we're
going to close that and we're going to
set some options so we're going to set
indexes follow symlinks and multi views
and these are case sensitive so follow
along follow along closely we're also
going to allow override all and this
allows us to
override our configuration inside our
directories and then we're going to say
require all grunted so if we write that
out and exit and then we restart apache
and we do that with sudo service apache
to restart don't worry if you see this
message it's normal
so here refresh now and we get this
forbidden error and that's because we
don't actually have anything in this
directory if we were to say touch index
to HTML and let's edit that hello world
and there we go our site is working now
there is one problem let's get rid of
that file there and let's create an
index dot PHP file let's insert some
actual PHP so if we write that out and
visit the page in a browser we get this
and that's because PHP isn't installed
so that's very simple to remedy all we
need to do is say sudo apt-get install
PHP 5 and we also want to install mod
lip Apache so I have this pasted in my
clipboard because I can never remember
it but it's just on the screen there if
you want to copy it so all you have to
do then is hit enter but once that's
done you should be able to use PHP on
your server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
