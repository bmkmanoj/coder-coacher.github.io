getting set up with foundation using
Bower and gulp and if you're not sure
our and go our don't worry we are going
to go into that briefly just so you can
understand the benefit of why we use
this otherwise if you know what Bower
and gulp are this is just going to be
very much a follow along just so you can
get set up properly and start to
customize foundation in the right way
rather than overriding lots and lots and
lots of styles and creating additional
styles so first of all let's just take a
look at foundation I'm sure if you're
watching this video you know what
foundation is front it's a front and
framework lots of components some
JavaScript libraries as well that run
off jQuery so we're going to be getting
setup with what you can see here we've
just got a basic navbar this drop down
here so actually control with CSS but we
are going to be including scripts here
as well for things like alerts and the
other components as well and you can
choose which components you want to
include in your project to reduce your
JavaScript file as much as possible so
Bower on the other hand is a package
manager for the web so what we're going
to be using Bower for is pulling in
foundation as not a dependency but as a
package and then with gulp what we're
going to be doing is we're going to be
building our front-end requirements or
front-end files we're going to take the
Bower components folder and look through
that find what we need put it in the
right place
push files together or and concatenate
files together and then we'll just end
up with an app dot CSS file and an app
J's file and this is really useful
because it means that you can do things
like eventually down the line minify CSS
all in one go we're also going to be
briefly looking at watching as well so
gulp gives you the ability to basically
watch files so all the compilation of
files and all other processes are just
done as you change files basically
that's probably the easiest way I can
explain that so this is what we're going
to be doing we're gonna get started
completely
scratch and we're gonna start to build
up everything that we need and and end
up with this result and just make it a
lot easier to manage your front-end and
manage foundation in particular so
before we get started let's take a look
at what we're working with initially
within my text editor all I have is just
a basic document
there's nothing here at all and you'll
notice that I'm working within this root
directory project but then I've got a
public folder within this with my index
to HTML file in and this is really
important because all of our node
modules Bower components the assets that
we create which will be our custom
scripts and custom Styles files will be
outside of this directory we don't want
we don't need them to be publicly
accessible it's not massive it's not a
massive problem if they are but it's
best to keep everything tidy like this
so the public folder that we're in here
is going to be your your root directory
your publicly accessible directory so
you're obviously going to need to
install certain things to work like this
depending on how you're going to
eventually be hosting your project
you're going to need these installed on
a server as well but once you get to
grips with this that shouldn't be too
difficult when you do get to that stage
so the first thing that we want to
install is Bower
so if you head over to bower i/o it
gives you very clear instructions of how
to install this and you need to use NPM
to install this so make sure NPM is
installed as well so checklist item one
is NPM number two's Bower and then third
you want to install gulps if you go over
to the github repo you can see exactly
how to do that with NPM so that's pretty
straightforward once you've got them
installed globally we're pretty much
ready to go
so the first step then is to initialize
a bower project so we're going to head
over to our text editor we're gonna keep
this open we're gonna bring up a
terminal I'm currently within my
directory here and not in the public
directory in the root directory and I'm
gonna type our in it and this is going
to create a bower JSON file
for us this might take just a little
minute but it's going to prompt us for
our project name so I can just type
project here we're gonna give a version
so I'm gonna say nought point one point
zero or something a description a
project all of these are optional by the
way main file we don't really need to
specify here we don't need to specify
the types of modules either we don't
need specify keywords authors or license
home page set currently installed
components as dependencies we don't have
any so let's just skip past this and add
commonly ignore fast ignore list I guess
we can do that as well
would you like to mark this package as
private we're gonna say yes and does
that look good so you can see here we've
got our name of our project version the
authors we've got a description the
licensed private is true and we ignore
like commonly ignored files so I hit yes
and that's going to go ahead and create
a bower JSON file for us now the reason
we have this is because inside of here
eventually when we start to install
things we're going to have things like
foundation as a dependency so what we
need to do then is next install
foundation so we're gonna say bower
install foundation save now the save
will store it inside of that Bower JSON
file so if we wait for this to finish
you can see here that it's actually set
dependencies to foundation now this
could be a div dependency so we could
say save eV instead this is probably a
much better option since you're not
going to use this for anything else
other than development so we can go
ahead and just get rid of that and
you'll also notice here that we've got a
bower components folder that's been
created for us and there's a lot more in
here than we expected just by installing
Foundation and we've got things like
jQuery which foundation requires to be
able to run its JavaScript we've got
things like j.crew placeholder on cookie
which I'm not going to be using
we've got moderniser which we are going
to be using because there are checks
within the foundation javascript files
that detect features using moderniser
and obviously we've got the base
foundation
which contains our s CSS files which
we're going to be using within gulp to
compile using gulp sass so it this might
all sound a little bit confusing if
you're very new to this but don't worry
it's going to become very clear as we go
through all of these steps so the next
thing we want to do then is go ahead and
initialize NPM so we're gonna head over
back to our terminal I'll just clear
this and I'm gonna say NPM in it now the
reason I'm doing this is because we're
going to have to install node packages
things like gulp gulp sass belkin capped
and these just help us with our build so
here I'm just gonna say project I'm
gonna give it another version a
description entry point test we're gonna
leave these all empty and it will warn
us about things but don't worry too much
about this because it's not in the scope
of this tutorial so now that that's done
let's just clear that we have a package
JSON so the package JSON then is going
to contain all of the things like I said
gulp sass
gulp itself and we can go ahead and and
start to use things then so we want to
install gulp now so we have a back over
to our terminal and we're gonna run npm
install dope and we're gonna save that
as a development dependency because
obviously we only need it when we're
developing ok so now that we've run that
command we've got our node modules
folder here we've got inside of here
we're gonna fill this up quite a bit
because we're going to use different old
package it MPM packages to do with gulp
so now that we've got that done we're
going to go ahead and create our gulp
file so under project let's create a new
file here and we're gonna call this gulp
file dot J s so inside of our gulp file
we're going to create a default task now
eventually what's going to happen is
within our
terminal we're gonna run gulp and what
that's going to do is it's going to take
Foundation pull it all in for us pull in
all the scripts put them inside of the
public folder within CSS J s directories
all nice and tidy so we can just include
them in our page so we need to create
our initial gob file so we need to
define gulp here we need to require it
in so we're going to just requiring goal
remember goal is now installed because
we just installed it with NPM and we're
gonna create our first task and this is
just going to be an empty task we're
gonna call this default we're gonna
within this callback we're just gonna do
a console log so you ran go so now we
can run gulp so if I type don't and hit
enter there we are so you can see that
we get a few things happen here it tells
us which gold file that we're using
which we know it tells us which task
it's starting this is the output from
the task usually you wouldn't output
from the task but in this case we just
did to test it and then it tells us that
it's finished and gives us the time that
it finished in as well so it gives us
useful information here so the next
thing we want to do is we want to just
copy over some markup for foundation
just to look at it in its original state
so let's close our glow gulp file and
let's go over to Foundation and let's
search for the navbar and we're gonna
just copy and paste this code in it's
going to be a little messy the
indentation it's not gonna be quite
right but we're only really just testing
here so paste this in let me just kind
of reinvent it and let's preview this in
the browser and it looks rubbish because
there are obviously no Styles included
usually what you do with foundation is
just plunk it in your public CSS
directory or something like that but
then you don't get the benefit of being
able to update it with Bower you don't
get the benefit of being able to
concatenate everything together minify
if you want to etc so we'll look at
doing this a bit later we're not going
to minify but you can work out what you
need to do from from then
so now that we've done that we're going
to create an assets directory within our
root directory just here so let's create
a new folder called assets these are
basically all of our scripts and styles
but they're not the public files that
are going to be accessed these are what
they're going to be read using out got
using gulp and then something's going to
happen to them along the way so we will
concatenate files we'll minify them
we'll uglify javascript if we want to
and then there will be hooked into
public j/s and then we put into public
CSS so we'll create them files now
folders now so we've got them there so
inside of assets then what I tend to do
is I have a Styles folder and I also
have a scripts folder so now that we've
got our public j/s and CSS file folders
and we've got our styles and scripts
directory we want to create our goal
Styles
task to actually pull in the styles then
we can include them in our head once
they've been put into this CSS directory
so let's go ahead and do this now let's
pull up our gulp file again and this
default task here we don't really need
this because we're not going to be
running a lot of stuff in here so when
you get rid of this temporarily we will
bring back the default task because the
default task is basically what runs when
you just run gulp like this so we're
going to define a new task so we're
going to say gulp task this is going to
be called styles styles and this is
going to obviously have a callback here
and we're gonna do something so in this
case all I'm gonna do is console.log you
ran styles now we're going to find our
default task and tell it what other
tasks we want it to run so we're gonna
say go
task default and instead of a callback
we're going to pass an array of
different tasks we want to run so we're
gonna have stars from for now but
eventually we can have things like
scripts and then anything else you want
to include in your default bill
as well so let's change up two styles
now what's going to happen is when we
run golf on its own is going to say oh
we need to run styles it will run this
and then we'll console.log so let's take
a look let's clear this and let's go
ahead and run gulp and there we go so
you can see here it says starting styles
you ran styles finish start starting
default finish default so we know that
this is running the Styles task so what
we now need to do is install gulp sass
which is going to be able to compile
sass for us or parse sass so we need to
install this by going ahead and running
NPM install gulp sass and we want to
save it as a development dependency so
we wait for that to finish and then
we'll check out our package JSON file
and see that that's been installed in
there in just a moment so that looks
like it's finished so let's head over to
our package JSON you can see in here
we've got gulp and we've now got gold
sass so we can use this in here gulp oh
let's call it's just sass is a lot
easier so we're gonna require in gulp
sass there we go so now what we can do
is we can take our foundation sass which
is in bower components foundation SCSS
we can take all of this we can run it
through our at this task and we can go
ahead and do things like pipe it
well we pipe we we pipe sass through and
then we can do things like concatenate
on which far we want to add this to we
can put it into a destination we'll see
how this works in just a moment if that
doesn't make sense it's pretty difficult
to explain so what we want to do now is
we want to actually create our first
custom a CSS file so inside of scripts
then I'm gonna create a new file
sorry inside of styles I'm going to
create a new file and this is going to
be called a PS CSS and this is where
we're going to require in found a
from we're not going to do that just yet
we're gonna take a look at a basic build
here so what I'm gonna do is just write
some normal CSS inside of here and we're
gonna say something like body background
color and we'll choose a nice background
color so we'll say something like e d e
f f zero and our goal is to take this
run it through sass and then place it
inside of our CSS directory as apt or
CSS so what we want to do then is go
ahead and use gulp sauce to choose this
so we're going to return gulp dot sauce
and inside of here we have an array of
source files in this case our source
lives in assets styles at that is CSS
that's the file that we've just created
over here so this isn't going to do
anything it won't fail we can still run
this so we can still run gulp it's just
not going to do anything but what we're
saying is we want to take this and then
do something with it so what we need to
do is pipe sass through which remember
we've included up here that's going to
go ahead and compile our sass and then
what we want to do is we want to place
it inside of our public CSS directory
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
install Vulcan cat which allows us to
concatenate files we're not actually
going to be concatenated any files but
if you did have any additional file
scripts that you wants to concatenate
and put into one place this is a really
useful package to have or module to a
driver so let's just finish that line
there we'll finish this off in just a
moment let's go ahead and install
gulp concat and you can google for all
of these just to find out more
information if you if you want to find
any more information about them and the
different options that they have and
what you can do with them so now that
that's finished it's obviously been
placed inside of here so what we can do
now is we can include this so I'm going
to say far and cats and we're going to
require in go
it's perfect so what I'm gonna do just
to demonstrate it is I'm going to say
oops I'm gonna say that pipe concat and
I'm gonna choose the file name so we can
just do this if we want to so I'm gonna
say I want this to be stored as app dot
CSS but you can obviously have different
options here to combine different files
if you want to and then we're going to
pipe it into a destination so we're
going to use gulps dest to do this so
we're going to pipe I'm gonna say dope
best we don't need to install anything
from this is part of gulp and then we
choose the file the destination so in
this case it's public CSS so let's just
recap what we're doing here first of all
we're returning all of this that's just
going to let gold know that this task
has finished we are initially passing an
array of files out sort of source files
we are compiling our sass we concatenate
in this case we're just choosing the
file name and then we are piping through
the destination and we want this to go
in public that's public slash CSS so
let's run gulp now what this is going to
do then is take this compile it put it
inside of this CSS directory so let's
clear this and run dope and there we are
so you can see that that app dot CSS
file has been created with all of our
styles so we're now ready to include
this file into our page so let's do this
now so we're going to include CSS app
dot CSS that's it that's all we need to
do and then when we refresh we get our
nice background color there so what
we're now going to do is actually pull
foundation in which is the point of this
video so what we need to do here is
inside of app s CSS remember not app dot
CSS we're going to include foundation in
fact first we need to include foundation
paths in our goal file and this will
make sense in just a moment so inside of
sass just here we want to go ahead and
pass in out
food paths so include paths and we want
to pull in Bower components
Foundation scss sorry this should be an
object so the reason that we're doing
this is because we don't want to
manually include all of these files from
this apt or CSS file what we're actually
doing is we're saying well when we when
we pipe through this sass or when we
compile our sass we want these files to
be included as well and then we can just
use them as we like so let's just run
gulp again so nothing different has
happened here we've not actually
included foundation within our app dot
CSS bar and the reason for that is
because we've not included them within
our app dot s CSS file and this is where
the include paths come in because now
what we can do is we can just say import
foundation settings which we'll look at
in more detail in a moment because we're
going to customize our settings and this
is the beauty of working like this and
we're just going to import foundation so
the settings are going to be what we can
override in order to customize the
foundation framework to suit our needs
without having to write lots of
additional styles to override all of the
CSS and that's the benefit you get with
this rather than just having the
foundation dot CSS file download
inputting some kind of public directory
so now what's going to happen is when we
run gulp all that's done is it's taken
the foundation settings it's imported
them and the actual framework and it's
now placed that within this app dot CSS
file here so it's taken the settings
obviously there are lots of variables
mix-ins and things like that that are
replaced at the same time so now we see
the following so we've now got this up
and running so we're now gonna look at
this custom settings file that i've been
talking about and and this is you know
why i love doing it this way so inside
of our styles we're going to create a
new folder
called Foundation and then we're gonna
create a new file in here which is going
to be an SES s in s CSS include called
settings s CSS so this is going to be
our custom foundation settings file and
we find that in bower components
foundation s CSS foundation settings so
we're going to copy this close this off
we're going to paste it inside of here
so let's take a brief look through this
before we start playing around with
anything all this is is for each of the
components that foundation gives us as
well as things like the base stars the
grid Global's and media queries we can
customize any part of this of these
settings and that's going to change the
way the foundation components look
without having to write lots of
additional CSS which I've already
mentioned so let's look at just go ahead
doing a head and running gulp again we
get no difference here because most of
this stuff all commented out there are a
few things I think that are not but
generally everything is so when a
refresh we get no difference but what
happens if I want to start customizing
this navigation bar all I do is over in
my settings I go ahead and look down
this menu for nav bar which is also top
bar so I'm going to find top bar and we
get to the top our section here and you
can see we've got all of these lovely
settings that we can start playing
around with and to allow these settings
to take effect all we need to do is
uncomment them and you need to be really
careful because if for example I wanted
to change the top bar background color
this oil variable doesn't exist at the
moment it's commented out at the top so
what I'm actually going to do is I'm
going to scroll the way up let's check
which line we're on first of all let's
go back to the top bar so we're on line
1 3 8 4 let's remember that and I'm
going to say well I want the background
color to be JA I know it can be anything
we don't really care
let's say snow so I'm going to uncomment
this this variable and we're gonna get
back to the line that we were on before
I think that was one three five four
no it wasn't okay so one three eight
four so I'm going to change this now to
that that variable I just uncommented
which was snow so let's go down and
let's find this again and change that to
snow so that's all we need to do we've
now got this snow variable and we've
changed the background color now this
isn't going to take effect straight away
because we've not ranked gold we're
gonna look at watching for changes a bit
later on that's gonna make it a lot
easier during development but for now
let's just go ahead and run gold
manually and there we go so all that's
done now is change the background color
pointless in this case because we can't
see anything but then you could go ahead
and customize the colors of the buttons
the text on here you can just customize
anything so I'll leave that up to you to
do so let's just uncomment these again
for now we'll just go ahead and get rid
of all of them changes but now you know
that you can have a really good look
through this massive settings file and
start to customize all of the elements
foundation that you want to control so
let's go ahead and add this watch task
now actually just to make it a little
bit easier for us and we'll see how this
works
so this is really straightforward we
don't need to install anything
particularly with NPM for this because
gulp has a watch task already or watch
functionality already so I'm down here
I'm gonna define a new task and I'm
gonna say gulp task and this task is
going to be called watch and here we
have our call back all we're gonna say
here is gold watch I'm gonna choose
which files we want to watch out for in
this case we want to watch inside of
assets inside of styles and we want to
watch all scss files so what's going to
happen then is when that does happen we
want to run a particular set of tasks or
a
tasks so in this case I'm gonna run
styles so what's gonna happen is every
time I change an SPSS file it's gonna
run this task recompile everything or
rerun everything build everything and
then we can just refresh our browser so
let's take a look at this in action
we'll go ahead and change the color of
the nav background again but inside my
terminal I want to run gulp watch now
and we're gonna this is gonna do
something a little bit different it's
not actually finished because it's
watching this is never going to finish
unless it errors because it's just going
to run that Styles task every time you
change something so let's go back to our
settings file here so settings stop s
CSS inside of here and let's go to our
top bar again and let's change the
background color I'll just choose the
CSS color now just say FFF hash FFF and
what's happened here is because I saved
the file while this was around this
doesn't exist so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna run go watch again I'm gonna
just change something and save this time
it hasn't errored because there were no
errors but you can see that as I saved
we started this new Styles task or it
started this Styles task and we finished
the Styles task and without having to
run gulp manually this has changed so I
can go ahead and change this to say 2 to
2 and just refresh my browser so now we
can just run gulp watch when we want to
start developing start changing things
and then we can just refresh the browser
as normal so that makes it a lot easier
than having to run gulp every single
time so what we're now going to focus on
is foundations scripts so we've handled
all of the styles we know that these
will work let's go ahead and get rid of
this again so we're gonna focus on
scripts now so what we want to do is
come over to foundation here and we're
going to search for alerts and we want
to obviously we have our style so this
is going to render properly but we won't
have the functionality like that so
let's copy and paste this
into our index.html file let's post this
in and in then this and just say hello
there
so we have the Styles but we can't click
this button so let's bring up our
console just so we can debug if anything
goes wrong and we're going to start to
build our scripts now so this is a
little bit more complicated but it's not
massively complicated that it you know
it's too much trouble so we wanted to
find a new task so just under here I'm
gonna say gulp task scripts run out
callback and the first thing we want to
do is pull in jQuery or we want to
define jQuery as a source we want to
define Foundation jus as a source and
foundation but alert Jes as a source as
well you can pull in all JavaScript
files just using an asterisk if you
really wanted to from foundation but if
you don't need it then there's no point
and bear in mind there are a million of
different ways you can write your gulp
file this isn't exactly how everyone
would write it so you can choose how
best looks and works for you so let's
just take a look inside of foundation
then inside of this j/s directory
we've got foundation KS which we want to
include we're not going to include the
minified version because if we do want
to run a minify on this task we can do
so we don't need to do this and we're
also going to pull in foundation and
then foundation but alert dot j s as
well so we're going to do that from our
components foundation J s we're also
going to pull in jQuery concatenate that
into one file and then dump it inside of
our Jas public directory down here so
we're gonna say gulp that sauce again
we're going to choose within this array
the files that we want to include in the
source so we're gonna say bower
components forward slash jQuery dist
jQuery KS remember that jQuery is
installed along with foundation because
it is a requirement so we're putting in
this far here we also want to include
Bower kanpai
Foundation J s foundation J s and we
want to include our components
foundation J s foundation foundation dot
J s so there's a lot there okay so you
may have noticed that we're repeating
ourselves here with this bow components
we are going to tidy that up a little
bit later just so we don't have to keep
repeating the path because if the path
does change you use a different package
manager it's going to be really annoying
to have to go through and change it so
we will be changing that in just a
moment but the first thing we want to do
well the next thing we want to do after
we've chosen the source files is to pipe
through concatenation which we already
have included up here which we used down
here as well and we're going to just
provide the file name here now what we
want to do is we want to pipe this
through into a particular destination in
this case it's going to be public j s so
it's going to take jQuery it's going to
take foundations base JavaScript file
and it's going to take the JavaScript
functionality for alert boxes call it up
J s and place it inside of our
JavaScript directory in public so we're
nearly done what we also want to do is
include moderniser as well so the last
command I give I'm gonna return gold
sauce I'm gonna choose the source
this is bower components moderniser
moderniser Jas and I want to pipe this
pipe this through destination so I'm
gonna say public j/s now the reason that
I've done this is because modernizr need
to be included or it doesn't need but
it's best included in the head of your
document so we need a separate file for
moderniser so we're taking all of these
and putting them into a PAF's and we're
taking moderniser
and putting it into public j/s as well
so we'll end up with two files inside of
our public jeaious folder so let's just
cancel this and let's just run gulp as
normal now what's happened here is we're
not running our Styles task because
under our default we're only running a
scripts task sorry we're only running
our Styles task so that's just included
scripts here as well so let's run gulp
again and there we go so we've run
scripts we've run styles and if we look
inside of j/s here we've got app KS
which contains JavaScript if we scroll
down we've got foundation here as well
and we've got the specific functionality
for our alert box as well so we've got
everything that we need in here now so
what we can do is on our index file we
can go ahead and include moderniser
so j/s moderniser ojs and we can scroll
down and down here we can include J s FJ
s so now if we refresh we shouldn't get
any errors because we've got everything
sort of included modernizers being
included at the top if we just have a
look at the page source here that's all
there and at the bottom there we've got
a plot J S which we just looked at a
moment ago so now this will work or
hopefully will work ah it won't now the
reason this is not going to work is
because we have an initialized
foundation now we need to include inside
of let's just close this off inside of
our scripts directory we're going to
include something called just app dot J
s again this could be CoffeeScript and
you can come
CoffeeScript using gulp as well but
we're just going to create a normal
JavaScript file just to test this out so
we're gonna say document dot foundation
that's going to initialize foundation
that's all we're going to do here we are
going to be adding our JavaScript files
to our watch task as well so we'll take
a look at that in just a moment if you
needed to just write some code in here
and have it automatically run through
gulp so inside of our gulp file then we
need to include this new file within
here so let's go ahead and do that now
so we're gonna say assets scripts fjs
assets scripts is that's gonna also be
put into our main app jeaious inside of
here so let's go ahead and run gulp
again and let's go ahead and refresh and
it should work now there we go so what
we'll do is we'll go ahead and add this
to the watch task so I'm gonna duplicate
this line down I'm going to change this
to scripts and we want any JavaScript
files to run our scripts task just here
so now what we can do is test this out
so let's clear this and run gulp watch
and we're gonna go over and modify our
app.js file in a console log hello
without running gulp we refresh and
there we go
so we've got our updated JavaScript
files and you can see here that's run
script it hasn't run styles as well
because there's no need to we only
update to the JavaScript file so that's
just a little bit more efficient so now
that we've done this we're just going to
tidy up our gulp file a little bit
because I'm not happy with the fact that
we have bower components repeated again
and then again and again we're also
repeating assets as well what if we
change this directory name it's going to
mean we're having to go through and
update it again and again and again so
I'm going to create a path object here
and inside of here I'm just going to say
Bower that's going to be
our components and I'm gonna say assets
and that's going to be assets so now
what we can do is we can just reference
paths bow or paths to assets down here
so let's get rid of this and say path
stop Bauer and let's just copy and paste
this just so it's a little bit quicker
so let's paste it in here get rid of
this paste that in get rid of this paste
this in and down here as well like so
and that looks about it so let's do the
same for our paths to assets so we can
get rid of this and we could say paths
got assets and we'll do the same for
this so anywhere where we use assets
here and we also use it just down here
as well pop that in there and let's pop
that in there so let's just clear this
run go up again just to make sure we
didn't mess anything up let's run go
watch again just to make sure we didn't
mess anything up let's add a console log
back in here and we'll go ahead and
refresh that looks like it's fine and
let's just change something in our
settings file as well so a nav bar top
now rather top bar now and let's just
changed the background color again to
white and there we go so that's all
working so we now have a fairly
efficient table file it's very basic and
we are being fairly explicit here about
what we are putting in there are like I
said really clever ways to do this you
can do all sorts of stuff just to you
know tidy this up and make it a lot more
efficient but you're now in the position
where you have a Styles folder again
bringing this specifically back to
foundation Styles where you can update
your settings
you can import additional s CSS files
inside of here either to overwrite
foundation styles that can't be changed
with settings and you can start to
create all of your own stars for your
application as well they're all going to
be put into a plot CSS you can reuse if
you want to the variables from
foundation here so in this case we're
setting a body background color but what
we could do is we could go ahead and
just pick something like a color from
here so say you define all of your
colors here let's say something like
let's pick black so we're going to
uncomment black out we're gonna save
that make sure we've got gulp watch
running let's just clear this and go
watch save that oops we've got an
undefined variable oil so we're if we
included that top bar yes sorry we
included that there so it's uncomment
this and let's clear this and run gulp
watch again so back to this color that
I've on commented out which is black
inside of inside of my app dot CSS file
I can now reference black if I wanted to
and what that's going to do is it's
going to take them stars from foundation
and apply them to my document so you
wouldn't really necessarily always want
to do this but it's a good thing to know
that we can reuse elements from this
settings file and what I find most
useful is the media queries from here so
if we just have a look at the media
query ranges what we can actually do is
we can reuse these variables inside of
other stars that we manually create so
we can keep this in sync with
foundations
media queries ranges so it you know it's
really useful to be able to have things
set up like this it does take a little
bit longer to set up after you've seen
but in the long run this is gonna save
you a lot of time and a lot of hassle
and it's generally generally a really
pleasant way to develop just saves a lot
of time in the
and a lot of effort in the future once
you've got this set up so that is how we
set things up with foundation using
Bower as our package manager and using
bolt as our build system to get
everything set up for our front-end
