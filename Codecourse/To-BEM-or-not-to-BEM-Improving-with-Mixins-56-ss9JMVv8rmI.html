this as easy as possible to write out at
the moment this is fine
but we can do a little bit better with
the help of mix-ins so I'm going to
create a mix-ins file within my Styles
directory so we'll call it mix ins 2's
CSS and the goal of two of our mix ins
are the only two mixes that we're going
to be writing here are to automatically
output a element and automatically
output a modifier based on the name of
our block so that doesn't make too much
sense don't worry we'll see how this
works in just a moment so let's to find
out our mix ins so mixing and we're
going to call this e for element so this
works just like a function really we can
pass something in and then we can output
some CSS so here what we're going to do
is essentially create a shortcut for
what we have done here so let's just get
rid of our modifier quickly you can see
that all we're doing here is we're
saying well we want this to take the
route name we want to have two
underscores and we want then the element
name but really having to write this out
over and over again sometimes it can get
a little bit tricky to have to keep
writing this and we want to reduce the
speed of development as much as possible
so by calling e and passing in our
element name the actual name of the
element we want this to be so in our
case it would be list item we can then
just output the CSS that we've already
seen so we just do a ampersand to take
the root element and then we just go and
we pull in the name of the element here
so that's just how that looks and then
we say pull in that content okay so
let's test this out and see how it makes
our app a CSS file look so rather than
have this what we can now do is we can
include so we can use @include e item
and then we can write our styles so
margin bottom zero and of course if you
wanted to you could call this element
and now what's happening is you're
seeing
and then you're seeing the word element
so it makes it a little bit clearer and
of course what you're not then having to
do is write out ampersand underscore
underscore item every single time you
want to create a new element you just
use E or if you want to call it element
that's fine
so now we can implement a modifier so we
can do exactly the same thing here so
I'll just copy this to save a little bit
of time and we'll call this M will say
modifier will call this modifier and
then all we do is replace these with a
dash dash so now we can do what we did
before so inside of here we can include
a modifier we can call this last and
then we could say we want the margin
bottom for the last element to be zero
so there we go we've got our block at
the top which is pretty self-explanatory
then we've got our element and then we
have our modifier and of course we could
use the modifier within here as well if
we wanted to change the overall style of
the top list so there we go let's take a
look at a patsy SS and of course what
we've not done is included this within
here so make sure you do that so this is
just make sense okay so over in Aptos
CSS then we now see exactly the same
thing we've got a flat file we've got
our block we've got our item and we've
got our item modifier and of course
heading over to the browser this looks
exactly the same and I think we set the
margin bottom there to zero so we can
change that we see it looks exactly the
same now so we can now see that we've
made this easier to read we have reduced
the amount of code we have to write or
at least the amount of tricky code like
this that we have to write and we don't
even have to think about it now we can
just use e or if you've decided to call
it element you can use that as well but
going even further obviously at the
moment we're using the S CSS syntax if
we use the sass syntax this becomes much
cleaner and it will be so clean in fact
that
be very quick to write and really easy
to look at so let's jump over to the
next video and we'll look at switching
this out for the SAS syntax</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
