adding and accepting French requests so
we've got quite a bit to do here before
we start again make sure you have a few
users in your table at least two and you
have your friends table empty so you've
got no relationships in there whatsoever
and I'm signed in up here with the user
Alex and I'm also signed in in another
browser with the user Dale so I can test
adding and accepting friends requests
between these two users that's really
important so the first thing I want to
do is go over on the user model and the
implement a load of methods that we're
going to use and I'll explain what each
of these are going to be used for so
when we come to use them it'll make a
lot more sense so the first thing we
want to do is get any pending friends
requests but this is going to be
slightly different because it's going to
be using the friend of relationship so
I'm going to implement this now friend
requests pending and this is going to
return this friend of where pivot
accepted is false so bear in mind we're
doing exactly the same thing here when
we're doing friends of instead of
friends of mine so this two-way
relationship kind of thing and we just
get that so we could grab a collection
from that so the next method is going to
be to check if if a user has a friend
request pending from another user
because we need to use that
functionality so here we're gonna
implement a method called has friend
request pending this is going to be
slightly different because in to this
we're gonna pass in a user which we can
then use to compare and see if the
current user has a friend request
pending from this user so to check if if
a user has a firm request pending we
want to say return this friend requests
pending where the idea of the user
equals the user ID that we passed in
and we want to pull the count back from
that and then we can just cast this to a
boolean so that will give us a true or
false value if we want to check if Dale
has if we have a friend request pending
for Dale we can just go ahead and pass
that user in and it will give us a true
or false value so now we want to
implement a method to check if we have
received a friend request from a
particular user and these are all going
to be used within our controllers to
check if we're trying to add a friend
that we already have a friend request
pending for or if we're trying to accept
a friend request that we have already
received so it's just basically it's you
know very short helper methods to allow
us to do this that we can reuse so has
friend request received so in here we do
a very similar thing we pass in user we
type hint this and again we do a similar
thing that we did with the has friend
request pending method but this time we
use the friend requests relationship or
the friends request method rather than
the friends requests pending so we
return this friend requests where the ID
equals that user ID pull back the count
and then we can just cast this to a
boolean so we'll again either get a true
or false value here so the next method
is to actually add a friend and then
we're gonna create a method to accept a
friend request so these are pretty
straightforward
so I'm gonna have add friend and we
obviously need the ability to pass in
another user here so we can add them as
a friend and we just say this friend of
and we're going to attach that user ID
and we'll see how this works later when
we actually call this method in the
controller so the next one is to accept
a friend request just slightly more
complicated
and again when we accept a friend
request we need to say which user were
accepting the friend request from and we
use the friend requests method where the
ID is equal to the user ID so this then
will pull from the friends requests that
obviously this user will be in mixed or
accepting a friend's requests a friend
requests from the list of our friend
requests we want to grab that user that
we've pulled just pulled out from that
list and we want to update the pivot
table in relation to this so that will
mean that we will pull out this we want
we'll pull out that user then we want to
find the pivot where that that is and
they're not just update the accepted so
we say pivot update and we pass in an
array so in here we would just say
accepted true simple as that so we now
have a list of methods that are useful I
guess another method that would help us
since we're outputting the whole process
all of the buttons that we need is going
to be is friends with that's going to
tell us if we are friends with a
particular user
so rather than duplicating all this
functionality we're putting it all
inside of our model it makes it a lot
easier to work with so we want to check
if we're friends with a particular user
and again we return similar to the
method has friend requests received or
has friend requests pending but this
time we're checking inside Vow friends
method that we created which is just a
list of our friends and we say we're ID
equals that user ID grabbed the count
and we cast that to a boolean to get a
true or false value if none of these
make too much sense at the moment when
we actually use them within our
controllers it's going to be a lot
so we're gonna focus on now then is
inside of our friend controller we're
going to implement a method to add a
friend and accept a friend and also
inside of our profile what we want to do
is if we have a friend request pending
we obviously want to output a button to
accept it or if we don't have a friend
request pending we want to have a button
to add a friend request so what we'll do
is we'll implement all of this now
regardless of whether we're going to see
it just yet and then later on we will
see this see this these buttons output
so the first if statement then is going
to be our author can authenticated user
has friend request pending from the
current user so bear in mind we're
looking at this users profile so I'm
just going to end that if the in that if
there and I'm going to say waiting for
user get name or user name to accept
your request so we can actually test
this out so say we are on our friends
page or rather on someone else's page we
can start off on a friend's page so
let's say the you know database table we
have user ID 1 and we have user ID 2 as
a friend ID under my account then that
will be a friend request from Dale now
can click on that and we see nothing
here but if I'm on Dale's account and I
go over to Alex waiting for Alex Garret
to accept your request because Dallas
and the friend request to Alex so this
is working this part of it so on my
profile then I need when I'm looking at
Dale to be able to actually add her as a
friend so we need to add to this if
statement we're gonna have lots of if
else is here you can obviously modify
to make it a little bit nicer you can
put these checks anywhere you want so it
really doesn't matter so we're gonna
have else/if and this is going to be if
the currently authenticated user has a
friend request received from this user
then we are going to output an anchor we
have a class here of button button
primary and the text in here is accept
friend requests let's just stick a hash
in there for now so here on Dale's
profile I can accept her friend request
she sent me a friend request from here
she can see on my profile that she's
waiting for me to accept it and I can
see that she sent me one I can click on
that so now we need to deal with a
situation if a user is friends so we
have another else--if and again feel
free to put these wherever you want just
tidy it up if the currently
authenticated user is friends with the
user we're currently viewing the profile
on we just want to say you and X are
friends in place of X we can obviously
put the user's name it's a user get name
or user name so now we are kind of
waiting for this phone request to be
accepted once we have accepted it which
we'll build in in a minute
you and down from now friends when I go
over to here
you and Alex Garret friends so we've got
that functionality in there now so
otherwise if no relationship exists at
all we always want a button there to be
able to add a friend request so let's
delete this and the moment we'll see
nothing on both of these users accounts
so we need a final else here and we're
going to create an anchor this is going
to be add as friend
again we'll have a class on here a
button button primary I'll have a hash
just in here for now and there we go so
we're not friends at the moment there's
no friend request pending but obviously
now we see both them buttons so now what
we're gonna do in the next part is deal
with when we click on this we're
actually want to insert a record but we
have a few conditions for this because
if a friend request is already pending
or if we're already friends with the
user and the user hits this link in
their browser if they they obviously
know the link for this then we're gonna
be in trouble so next we're gonna look
at actually inserting that into the
database so this is a lot more dynamic
we don't have to keep creating records
in the database ourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
