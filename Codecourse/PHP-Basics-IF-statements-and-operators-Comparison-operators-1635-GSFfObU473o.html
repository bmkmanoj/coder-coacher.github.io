we run to comparison operators which
sound a little less scary and we've
actually already covered one comparison
operator which is the double equals and
as we know this checks if something that
we provide is equal to another value in
this part though we'll cover different
ways of comparing variables and values
and you can actually combine these with
the logical operators you've already
learned to build up more complex checks
depending on your needs so let's go back
to basics and look at the equals
operator because there's still one thing
that we haven't covered yet so we know
that we can place this into an if
statement within the condition and let's
just say we have something that says
uploaded and we set that to true we know
that we can either do if uploaded this
is a little bit shorter or we can do if
uploaded equals true like so so there's
a couple of ways to do things now it's
probably better to do things this way
because it makes it a little bit easier
to determine what we're comparing we
know that we're comparing this with a
boolean now we also know let's just go
ahead and output uploaded here so we
know that this runs let's head over to
the browser
we know that runs we know that we can
also have potentially one as a true
value now if we go ahead and check this
notice it still runs the block now
there's nothing necessarily wrong with
this but it can be a little bit
confusing and that's where we are going
to introduce the triple equals
comparison operator now this will give
us strict type checking and why would
you want to do this well this gives us a
little bit more safety and control over
what we're checking if you wanted to
ensure that a value is exactly the value
and the type that you want it to be then
the strict type comparison is very
helpful and it's a good idea to get into
the habit of using triple equals over
double equals
otherwise you may run blocks that you
don't want to so in this case then if we
say uploaded is true
and we say well does uploaded not only
have a true value but also actually is a
boolean then we know that this is going
to work however now if we set this to
one and refresh it doesn't work anymore
now remember that a -5 value is also a
true value if we get rid of the strict
type checking we know that this will say
uploaded maybe we don't want this to
happen because minus 5 could mean that
there's an error somewhere so we use
triple equals and we see that it doesn't
run because we're expecting a boolean
value so it's a little bit more safe now
let's look at a more interesting example
just to see how this can give you
problems later on let's say we're
booking a restaurant table and we're
gonna say well are there tables
available well let's say there are and
we're gonna go ahead and we are going to
check if tables are available then in
here we want to book a table maybe we
run something to actually go ahead and
book the table give that a refresh we
know that this should work because we do
have tables available now what happens
if tables available is set to one false
now that might seem really weird but
let's have a look at what happens it
still says book a table what's actually
happening here is behind the scenes PHP
is typecasting this value so it can be
compared so let's just take a rough look
at this I'm going to comment this out
I'm going to come down here and have a
look so I'm gonna echo out the value 1
Alex that might seem odd but bear with
me so we see 1 Alex as we would expect
now we haven't looked at type juggling
and casting 2 types but if I was to cast
this value to an integer this means that
it's saying well I actually wanted
integer from this please cast it to a
integer for me an INT is obviously short
for integer let's refresh and you see we
get 1 now what's happened here is
because it has cast it to a value we've
gone ahead and we've removed the TEC
and it's now been cast to the following
so it can be a little bit confusing but
that's pretty much what's happening here
if we were to var dump this we will see
that we will actually get an integer so
let's do a var dump on the following and
we get an int and it's the same thing
here as well for true and false values
if we were to go ahead and cast this to
a boolean or bull for sure you can see
that we actually get a bull value
despite the fact that I define this as a
string so this can all get really messy
because PHP will automatically castings
for you so the best thing to do is use
triple equals and we're gonna say well
if there are tables available if this
actually equals true then we're gonna go
ahead and book a table in this case it's
not true
this is not true because it doesn't
absolutely equal it if we were to get
rid of that this will be typecast and we
see book a table so really the best
thing to do triple equals and we know
that it will always work if we have a
false value here it doesn't work so what
I'd recommend is go ahead and play
around with this kind of things typecast
things type jugular things to different
values and you'll see what I mean it can
get a little bit tricky but with time
these things get easier okay so now that
we've got that important operator out of
the way the triple equals let's focus on
the other comparison operators that we
can use so the opposite to the equals
comparison operator is not equal and we
can do this in a couple of ways so let's
say we wanted to kind of reverse this
and say well if there are no tables
available instead we want to say no
tables available make sense well in this
case we would say if tables available
doesn't equal true and notice we're
using an exclamation mark and then two
equals we can do one but remember we're
using type checking then we're gonna say
no tables available so let's give this a
refresh and we see no tables available
because this is set to false we set this
to true then we do have them available
so we don't run that block now there's
another way that we can do this we can
say if not tables available and this
will work
if we change this to false it will work
in the same way but just remember that
this will also not use strict type
checking so for example we could say 1
in here as a string and we see the
following and this will basically work
as we've already explained so if we set
this to false the best way to do this is
to say not equal to true and this is a
lot safer and it makes sense and it
reads a little bit better as well so the
other way that we can do this is
actually by using a less than and a
greater than sign so here we're gonna
say no tables available because we have
false and we have true here as well and
then that goes so I've never used this
particular syntax while I've been
writing code and I think it's a lot
clearer to use exclamation and then
double equals to say not equal to again
take into account that strict type
checking ok so the next one or a couple
of operators we're going to look at is
greater than or equal to these are
pretty simple and we've already kind of
seen an example of this but let's take a
look at a more practical example so
we're gonna say rooms requested and
let's say that we are booking a hotel
room we are requesting that we want to
book four rooms and let's have another
thing saying well how many rooms do we
have available at any time so let's say
we have three rooms available and we're
trying to request four rooms
obviously this isn't in a work so to do
this and to check this with an if
statement we're gonna say if rooms
requested is greater than the rooms that
are currently available then we're gonna
say sorry not enough rooms so again it
really gets simple example but you can
see how this works let's go over and
refresh sorry not enough rooms let's say
we then request three rooms well we have
three rooms available and because we've
used the greater than then obviously
three is not greater than three so we
don't see that error now of course we
could switch this up if we wanted to
let's just change this back to four we
could say well if rooms available is
less than
rooms requested so it's basically the
same check but just the other way round
then we output a message now in this
case rooms available which is three is
less than the rooms that are requested
which is four so therefore we don't have
enough rooms and we see that error back
again okay so to move on to a similar
operator let's suppose in this scenario
you always need it to keep a room free
in your hotel so you wanted to check if
the room requested is greater than or
equal to and then you want to show an
error so what we would do is we would
say well let's just get rid of this if
the rooms requested and let's do what we
did before we said greater than rooms
available then output not enough rooms
so in this case rooms requested is for
rooms available is three we see the
error now if we were to say well we want
to request three rooms this works
however in our scenario we want to make
sure that we have one room always free
so in this case we say equal to this
means that if three is greater than or
equal to the rooms available then we
show an error in this case not enough
rooms now in this case we'd have to book
two rooms and leave one free because we
have three available and this works
again now as you've probably guessed we
also have a less than or equal to
operator so again we can switch this up
we can say if the rooms available are
less than or equal to the rooms
requested then not enough rooms we get
the same result here if we choose three
rooms we get that again so again this is
pretty straightforward everything is
more or less just reversed okay so
lastly just to drill this in we're going
to combine this with a logical operator
now taking a look at the example we've
just seen we're going to improve this to
not only check if we have too many rooms
being requested for the rooms that are
available we're also going to set a
maximum limit on the amount of rooms
we can book for this imaginary hotel so
let's set up the variables first these
are more likely gonna be things that are
posted through in a forum to you and
we're gonna look at how we do that later
but let's say the maximum rooms that we
are allowed to book is 5 let's say that
we request four rooms and the rooms
available are a much higher number so
let's say 20 so now we need to create an
if statement that combines a couple of
checks using the comparison operators
that we're learning about and also use
the logical operators that we've already
learned about so let's start with the
first check if rooms requested is
greater than or equal to rooms available
then we want to echo out something like
please choose less rooms that's just a
generic message for either of the
conditions that we're trying to meet so
we have rooms requested is four rooms
available is 20 let's add an else to
this and say your booking is complete
just so we can see something else other
than a white screen so let's go over
your booking is complete because we have
requested four rooms and we have 20
available let's say we have two rooms
available and we're requesting four
please choose less rooms so obviously
you would make something a little bit
more friendly but you get the idea
okay so now if we have 20 rooms
available but we want to request 7 rooms
then this check is fine because we have
enough rooms but we're saying that the
maximum rooms that you're allowed to
burke is 5 now in this case the first
thing that I would do is wrap this first
check in parentheses so it can be
evaluated away from anything else that
we put in now what we want to do is say
or and then another check so we're now
putting them in parentheses the rooms
that we've requested are greater than or
equal to the maximum rooms allowed now
you could change that to greater than or
equal to it's entirely up to you either
way what we're now doing is we're
checking if we have an
rooms and if the rooms are not being
requested over the limit that we've
specified so now let's set this to two
and we should see your booking is
complete because we have enough rooms
this is under the max room limit now let
me set this to seven or six or whatever
there we go please choose less rooms and
of course in this case you might want to
break this up into an additional if
statement to actually drill down into
the real reason that you're not allowing
the booking either way we've now seen
combining these two things that we've
learned about into one if statement and
used a couple of variables along the way
so that just about covers it for
comparison operators combining these
with logical operators you should now be
able to use an if statement to basically
build up the conditions you need for
just about anything
I'd recommend creating your own fake
scenarios creating a couple of variables
and then creating if statements to test
out specific roles as we've done here
either way that's it for our comparison
operators</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
