file and this is going to take in to get
variables firstly the ID which is the
last idea that's been registered into
the database ie the ID that's just been
registered by using our query here mysql
query this is our unique ID and the
we're also adding our activation code

hotmail account click comment inbox I've
got an email from admin at PHP up dog
academy com saying activate your account
I come down hello Alex Garrett you need
to activate your account with a link
below so obviously you can have HTML
code to this I have just done it in sort
of like a copy and paste I'm going to
copy this and paste light in there a
press enter your account is activated
you may now login I didn't even
demonstrate the fact that it wasn't
activated to start with I do apologize
but what I'm going to do is now show you
in the database if I browse here this
obviously our activated or PHP was
successful and it activates is one of
our code is there which matches our code
where is it which act which act sorry
match so go there the ID 15 matches the
ID 15 here so everything's matched up
and our account should be activated so
let's go back that's too hot now okay

links in make it a bit more professional
than why I'm doing and I can now login
as Alex with the password Hayden and I'm

popular demand the how to activate your
account with an email a registration

might have done or if you need anything

with and I'll be happy to help otherwise
before asking any questions about the
email function itself or the mail
