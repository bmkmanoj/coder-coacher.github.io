about the structure of our application
and how all the files that we're going
to create and build are going to come
together we've obviously got index dot
PHP which is the father shown here at
the moment there's nothing there at all
except this basic document markup we've
also got global dot CSS which I already
have included up here as a star sheet if
you're building this into your website
you're most likely already going to have
a style sheet so you can just go ahead
and add the stars to that or create a
new file and you know can caseinate that
with what you already have or however
you're going to do this we've also got
upload dot J's which will be go ahead
and including in later and we've also
got upload dot PHP which is what's going
to actually process the file upload so
the way this is going to work is we're
gonna submit the request for the
multiple files to be uploaded from index
dot PHP it really doesn't matter that
it's a PHP file we're not doing any PHP
on here
I've just chosen to name that PHP in
consistency with all the other files I
have so when we go ahead and click
upload what that's gonna do is upload is
is going to process the files that have
been chosen and that's gonna send an
ajax request to upload dot PHP
now what upload dot PHP is gonna do is
send a request back and say here's the
data you know everything's fine these
are the files that have been
successfully uploaded and these are the
files that haven't so that's how our
files are gonna work now let's go on to
actually build the markup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
