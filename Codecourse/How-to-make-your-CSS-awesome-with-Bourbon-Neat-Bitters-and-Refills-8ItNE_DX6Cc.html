once again I am excited to make this
video for you it is a really great one
aha right now you should all be familiar
with using SAS for pre-processing CSS if
you're not that's okay check out this
video here to learn about what
pre-processing is and check out this
video here to learn about how I use my
favorite preprocessor sass and and also
check out this video here it's called
Gangnam style watch it for the first
time because it's obvious that you've
been living under a rock for the past
three years I'll just flip it but for
the rest of you I have got an awesome
video that's going to flippin blow your
minds today I'll be showing you bourbon
and very exciting I have Kyle Fiedler
here from thoughtbot the makers of
bourbon to talk to us about it after
which I'll be stepping us through
getting set up and started with these
awesome tools so say hello to Kyle okay
hey thank you so much for joining us
here on def tips and we're looking today
we're looking at bourbon and a lot of
the products that go along with it
bitters and refills and and neat so why
don't you tell me a little bit about
what your relationship is to these
products and and who else is really
involved with this so yeah I've been
involved with almost all of them um
bourbon was the one that kinda
kick-started it fill up air one of the
other designers at thoughtbot maintains
maintains it and he does a really great
job yeah basically that grew out of a
need of at the time I thought Bob we had
four designers and we were all kind of
creating our own mix-ins and extends for
each project and they were loosely based
off of you know the css3 stuff that was
getting really popular as a cobbler
probably about three years ago now and
so each project has its own set and so
we kind of Phil did a great job
consolidating them and then it's grown
from there so can you describe for
somebody who's never used it or seen it
like really quickly like what it is and
why they should use it um it's a small
library of mix-ins and functions to help
you get started on projects um these are
all mix-ins and functions that we've
found really helpful um basically
counteract a lot of like the css3 stuff
that hasn't been totally implemented
like right now we're doing flexbox which
hasn't been totally implemented or as
implemented different ways different
browsers ya know ya mix-ins to kind of
help alleviate writing multiple lines of
CSS so how does bourbon compare with
something like compass so compass is a
lot bigger than bourbon um when we
started out come compass was was already
open source we just felt that there was
a lot in compass that we didn't really
use on everyday on projects and we
wanted to keep bourbon really small
really compact make sure that it's stuff
that you're going to use on almost every
single project so that was the whole
thinking behind it um we've tried to
keep it small so that like there's
certainly a need for bourbon and there's
certainly a need for people who use
compass so I like to think that they're
more partners and growing the SAS
community so they serve different
different needs for the now that's
bourbon kind of like a foundation for
all of these other extensions of bourbon
can you go is to walk us through the
other ones neat refills and sorry neat
of bitters and refills yeah sure
sony came out of me and another designer
at thoughtbot right uh our frustration
with taking over bootstrap sites so I
get like either wireframes or something
that was done with bootstrap and I look
at the CSS or the HTML really and the
classes are all jangled in there um and
I I have like a real passion for naming
things semantically not not like grid 3
yeah I think we don't know I think we
kind of grew up in the same school like
reddit right at the you know the the
pica or the turn of the Semantic Web and
if you kind of came up during that era
that's going to mean a lot to you so I
so yeah it's definitely cringe-worthy
when you see it's like like
uber divs and multiple classes on some
type of framework so I definitely grew
out of our frustration with that so what
I would end up doing is not go in and
remove it and at the time I wrote two
functions that were in bourbon um
one was a grid like a static grid so you
affixed with grid
mm-hm um and then I later built a
flexible grid based off of that
um when responsive design started become
popular and so I wrote those and those
were great for me but it every time I
talk to someone about them they feel
like all those are so awesome but I
don't really get it um and so what we
did with me was we made those those
simple functions into a whole grid
system so that is really flexible you
can name your your classes whatever you
need to you don't have to have these
wrapping row classes if you don't eat
them um it's it's like it's a grid
system for people who don't like grid
systems don't like grid libraries would
you agree with the idea that it moves
the grid out of the mark-up in into your
style sheets yeah exactly and in us
exactly what we wanted it to do we
wanted it for people like we wanted so I
wanted it easy enough for developers who
like to bootstrap the idea of bootstrap
of just throwing in a class into the
HTML mm-hmm so simple enough for them to
do the same thing with the CSS but then
you know complex enough so that at me as
a designer I didn't have to use like a
960 grid system so I wasn't fixed to a
certain grid that you can go into neat
and change the gutter spacing the max
width like almost anything you can
change and make it your own go through
the cool so that it's not you're not
fixed into this certain type of grid
would that come in a workflow before or
after bidders
and you're in like your inner compiled
sofa bidders is so we're top on is
consulting agency we we build a lot of
web apps and it's come out of we used to
have what was called FLE D which are
basically a base style sheet so that as
soon as you started a new project it
wouldn't look like you wouldn't have
times new roman' all over the place and
he's really janky like classmen classic
messages um but we found like over time
that was growing really stale and we
were overriding on so like we'd have
these flirty styles and then we'd
override them in CSS later and that is
extra scruff that we don't want the
application so bitter is the idea behind
bidders is mostly those same styles or
the same idea behind those styles so
that you know once you start a project
you throw bitters in there and it gives
you a nice looking site right from the
start
um but instead of it sitting in a gem
somewhere or somewhere where you can't
touch it you actually throw it into your
project files and it helps you get
started faster so it has things like a
variables folder or file extends folder
with where you can dump all your extends
same thing with mix-ins
it gives you based typography forms and
stuff like that and the nice thing about
it is so you throw it into your your own
project your new project and you can
like rip things out make it your own
and basically it becomes the start that
in a great starting point yeah
and now I was looking through the commit
history of a lot of the products we're
talking about right now and it looks
like bitters is your baby is that that
right yeah it has turned into our baby
yeah you have the most commits out of
like by far in bitters that's awesome
and the the website they the you know
the front-facing gh-pages websites for
each of these are like really nice and
easy to understand as well so I'll link
to those down in the description below
for everybody watching
um and then what's what is refills so
we've gotten to the point where a lot of
people are coming to us and asking like
they see what's happening with
foundation in bootstrap and they see all
these like components that are priests
pre-made like a lot of developers who
are coming to these is preset you know
frameworks are looking for these
pre-made components so that they can
just kind of plug it in and go mmm
and essentially that's what refills is
it's a bunch of components that you can
copy and paste code to and have like a
header and a bar or main featured area
or you know a section of three featured
areas a drop-down or breadcrumbs and
it's basically this styled so that it
looks really nice but minimally styled
so that it's somewhat easy to kind of
rebrand it or redesign it so that it
looks great for your site
alright so would you say that the
refills are what they evolved as a
competitor to the components of
bootstrap and foundation yeah I'd like
to think that they'll they'll start to
be competitors to both of those who know
like we're having we're taking a
different approach to both bootstrap and
foundation where like they include
everything and we want you to like
include only include the things that you
want so like if you want you know you
start off with bourbon if you need a
grid layout
you couldn't need if you if you're
starting out on a project you used
bitters um if you need these components
you copy and paste the ones that you
instead of just having all of them yeah
so wasn't that was a look when I was
exploring it for myself I kind of got
got my head around this eventually but
bourbon neat and bitter sorry yes
bitters are all things that you install
like that they're they're defined
packages you put the directories where
they should go and link them all in and
then your you can use them whereas the
refills are are these components where
you go to your website and cut and paste
the the markup and the styles and if
need be the JavaScript and you can use
them one by one you feel like cut and
paste each one that you want being
selective about it but yeah I thought
that was really interesting is as
opposed to and I guess this gets back to
what you were saying initially that the
weight or just not maybe not the page
weight but the cumbersome Ness is that
word cumbersome this the yeah like like
it covers a mess of something like
bootstrap or foundation wear and all of
these things are included from the
get-go unless you say otherwise
yep awesome okay so um I think that's
that's going to be it for this little
little interview I'm really I'm so
grateful that I have you here to discuss
this I think it'll make
understanding and appreciating the work
that you guys have thought at thoughtbot
have done go a lot further to the people
who watch this video so thank you so
much yeah well thank you for having
names is nice to be able to kind of
explain what are all those bourbon stuff
does yeah excellent all right well this
concludes this segment of the other
video and now we're going to go look at
how to use these tools that we've just
discussed you with Kyle Kyle thank you
so much take care men yep thank you
right
here's a fun way to think of sass and
bourbon if this guy this little Steve
Rogers here is CSS when he gets injected
and becomes Buffy becomes sass right now
if you add bourbon you're adding his
whole Avengers team on it you got
bitters and refills and neat and
together they create an awesome world
saving team of a bitter class extensions
I'm starting off with a simple file
called example and really simple
index.html here I'll show it to you it's
just a you know it's bare-bones HTML
outline and we have one link to a style
sheet called app CSS so we don't have
anything else in this directory so we're
I have to make my app dot CSS right now
we're going to do that by creating a
folder called CSS and in that folder and
create a new file called app sass know
now I'm going to use app dot sass to be
the endpoint for all of my sass it's all
going to be compiled right to here and
then output to app dot CSS which is
linked to in my document it so if I
write body and say back ground it is
going to be a CCC like alike right you
need to find a way for this back
background to be compiled into a app dot
app dot CSS now the way we're going to
do that we're going to install sass on
our machine and then from there we're
going to go in and install the things
we've been talking about bourbon bitters
knee and also we're going to use refills
so starting with sass I'm gonna say sudo
install Oh gem install
sass and my password is just kidding I'm
not telling you right we have sass
install now I'm going to do the same
thing for for Bourbon pseudo Jim install
bourbon wait while that installs and
looks like it's all good so let's get
sass running open a new tab and I'm
going to need a CD into my working
directory so that's going to be my
desktop and examples when I call this
thing and then a CSS now that I'm in
there I'm going to write a sass - -
watch I'm going to identify my sass file
a sass and I'm going to say : to
identify the output file I want to be
app CSS and go okay it looks like it
it's all good it's it wrote the new app
dot CSS right here
background CCC and when i refresh my
browser wind right here I can see a
background in sits night nice light gray
and I can also notice that sass is
watching this directory for changes and
I can stop it in time by pressing ctrl C
so if I change this to a pink then my
browser window will be a background of
pink pretty easy okay oops that was long
thing so let me show you how a sass will
overwrite my style so I change the see
the CSS to pink to give you this browser
but I so yeah so I did a big no-no you
don't ever want to change the body you
want to change the sass because I did
want to rant ass again or rather when I
save my sass
a SAS application in my command line
rewrote my output CSS so now our body is
green so all right I'm going to change
this background actually I don't even
care what the background is the first
thing I wanted to show you guys is
bourbon and how that works to understand
bourbon to work with bourbon we have to
install it first thing I have to do is
CD into my projects folder which is on
the desktop and it's called example and
CSS and I have to say Bourbon install
cool now when I go over here to my my
project folder I can see that bourbon is
a new folder inside of inside of my CSS
now this would be okay if I wanted to
kind of keep it small but I want to also
show you guys how I architect my sass to
allow for bigger project to happen later
on what I want to do is is since this
bourbon is not my code it's a plugin
that I don't want to be altering too
much I want to shove that into a folder
called zero plugins
plug in and there's the plugins I also
want to create a new a few of it of
these folders here a new folder called
one base that shouldn't be in my plugins
photostream I set my CSS and I want to
make another folder called two modules
and the final one of this type is three
layouts now this is great inside of
these I can put a file called I'm gonna
call this one
plugins der da SAS and do the same thing
for each one of these major folders this
one's going to be called base - der that
sense modules Donna
/ - der dot SAS and finally layouts
- der Doc's ass now I use these
directory files as a way to import
everything in the directory and that way
when I'm writing my app dot SAS I can do
something as simple as mu port what do I
want to import 0 - plugins / plugins -
der and do this four times
this is going to you face this is going
to be modules and we Lance same here now
three two one base and modules cool so
these are sucking in
or rather importing these files here and
then what I went when I want to add to
any of these types of directories I
could just add it to the smaller
directory I don't have to worry about
going into my bigger one and kind of
finding what water wants to go because
honestly these can get quite big but
we're going to start small and now the
first thing we do is at import bourbon
slash prove it
okay so let's take a look at our sass
compiling it looks like everything
compiled just fine and with our output
CSS great we have a blank page that is
fantastic
the reason I'm happy about that is
because bourbon is a library of plugins
not sorry mix-ins and of functions and
helpers add-ons so it's not actually
going to render down to any CSS without
initializing it yourself like it's not
going to do anything on its own it needs
to be these are just tools in your tool
built to use at any one time and they're
going to not and they're not going to
add any bulk to your project and I
really like that about it I really like
that about okay so the first thing I
want to do is show you a few of my
favorite bits in bourbon so let me start
by creating a layout a new file called
home dot stats and I want to import this
import home and how it helps should be
imported for these other guys okay and
then in my mid-20s box
all right and then here's a paragraph
with some where is it okay here we are
this with some Wharram
in it and there we go okay so rendering
which looks like a paragraph as'll art
let me show you quickly how I can like
manipulate these things quickly with
with my ribbon so the first thing I
wanted to show you is the size function
so are the size mix in box signs 100
pixels I want to make the background
pink and margin point okay now we see
that the size let's look at our rendered
CSS the size is outputs our height and
width really easily and now this is not
this is not rocket science but it's just
saving time which I really like about it
I had to right order the hood I'd right
I had to right size 100 pixels and it it
knew that I was talking about height and
width now that's really cool and it's
even better when it gets to something
larger like something that could have
five CSS class rules surprise CSS rules
to to accomplish so something like this
position
absolute let's say 100 from the top auto
from the right Auto from the bottom and
200 from the left now this positioning
would see it how it you know this
positioning was really easy to right
here in the SAS and it was just in one
line and it's really easy to read and
edit as well but it's CSS that you know
it's five lines and again it's not
rocket science but we're just trying to
save some time in complexity and this is
exactly what bourbon does for us and I
really that really makes me excited
happy in fact it's one of the first
things I started using the Bourbon to do
and again that's why I like it because
it is an add-on library it doesn't force
you to use any of it right away and it
doesn't it doesn't alter any of the code
that you've written previously so if you
have a big old library or big old
codebase you could add on bourbon today
and it wouldn't change anything and it
wouldn't make anything not work and then
you can just sprinkle it in as you go
because because it's you know so because
it's just a library of mix-ins another
one that's really cool is that they have
predefined font strings so if I go to
that paragraph and I say font family
where's the why font family dollar
Helvetica I could see that you know they
they've changed all the Helvetica right
here but it's not just how Vetta qey the
output CSS is going to have Helvetica
neue Helvetica Robotech Roboto Arial and
sensor so it's a whole backup string as
well I have backups for all of these
font declarations and this is cool if I
look at the documentation for Bourbons
for Bourbon are our font families we
have a Georgia loose idiot grande mono
space and verdana which all kind of have
of their relative vacuum so Tahoma is a
great backup from the city of ground but
not really necessarily Helvetica so
that's a really great really cool thing
to do okay so let's go back to here I
made this box pink early let's make it
red and let's imagine a nice root of
cherry red there there are a lot of
color functions built into sass but tint
is one that that bourbon adds and it's
really easy to use just tint you know I
don't say ten forty percent and then
when I look at my red error it's a nice
you know it's just knock down a few
notches and it's not as saturated so
it's cool
tint means you're adding a little white
so okay let's take all of these boxes
get rid of this positioning here let's
float them all right or left yeah see
how they work
oh look yeah they floated left just like
I wanted but I but I forgot this you
know I didn't want my pet expert graph
to be on on the right of all of them one
of them too to break like a block
element just right down here so I need
to have some type of clear fix built in
there and I can go into the parent right
here boxes and throw a clear fix on that
element that will help that paragraph
break down so boxes plus clear fix done
and thank you thank you bourbon really
nice the next great oh there are a few
other things I'm not going to type them
out I'll show you an example just
there's tons and tons of awesome things
but here like something like the wilder
ones timing function so we know that CSS
has Bessie a timing you know easing
built right into it but here are like
predefined Bessie a timing sequences so
easing it out back watch as I hover over
these horses blue that jump around she's
going to go a little bit over it and
it's going to end where it should be
some of them will go fast and then slow
down I mean this is all just the these
are all predefined easing
busy a calculations so those are really
cool to use I've used them quite a few
times when I just want like um you know
I don't want my my animation or
transition to be linear or easy now I
want to be something really unique you
can just pop one of these in and pop a
few of them in and try different ones
and you're going to get something that
you know people don't see every day
that's really nice and another one you
can easily change your pixel
calculations over to ms which is pretty
cool I like that you can even set the
baseline within the function that the M
is calculated based on so that's pretty
cool I really like that okay and this is
bourbon it I mean it's tons and tons of
things I recommend going through just
you know spring climbing into sprinkling
them into your work flow as you go about
your work I think you're going to really
enjoy it but next I want to show you
neat bourbon neat is a is the
lightweight semantic grid framework for
sass so it's really easy to use I mean
when it says semantic it's saying that
it allows you not to have you know all
of these bloated class heavy divs
wrapping everything around just to get
things lined up so the example here is
they have section aside article inside
of a section so for the section they say
include the outer container just make
that to contain a wrapper and then for
the aside make it three columns and make
the article nine columns wide so this
will be three columns that's the side
and the article the nine columns fine
it's pretty easy let me show you how to
install bourbon I'm going to jump back
over to my terminal here and remember
that I'm in CSS but I've added these
I've added these really specific
directories so on a CD in to zero
plugins and on the plugins and I want to
I want to do a pseudo
chan install great and now that I'm in
plugins I can install it so it's a neat
install and when I go over to clog ins I
can see that neat is installed I need to
go into my directory and say neat neat
cool neat is really cool let's go to
back to our example and see what we got
going on here ah
let's take home that's how so let's take
these boxes and I want to make this the
container
not what we call it outer container and
then I want to take my boxes and I want
to say that they should be a span
columns look like a good dog c-span
columns yeah there should be a spin
column they should each be four because
there's three up oh no there's I don't
know how many other tighter one two
three four five
let's make four and you can spin column
3 because 3 times 4 is 12 and we're up
12 come grid great so we have a 4
columns here the width in which we could
just you know put any cut type of junk
want like you do with columns now one of
the cool things about neat is that they
have this thing let's go into settings
visual grid they have this thing called
the visual grid is a cool but turn this
on by typing true here and when i
refresh I can see that there's this
awesome visual grid that I'm working
with so if I put this paragraph here
into an outer container I wouldn't
normally do like this but whatever I
could see that it's lining up nicely
with these and not this visual grid here
and I can even take this visual grid and
make it go to a front run and change its
color to Lions blue
so that's awesome huh so it's a lot of
awesome tools built right into bourbon
neat and it helps you you know have a
nice semantic grid from the get-go
without having to go into my markup look
at my markup nothing has changed it's
really semantic and easy to read
especially when you're showing it to
other people and you know you have other
developers working with you and it's a
really nice way to keep things clean and
easy okay so let's jump into bitters
bitters are a little bit different than
bourbon and meat in the fat in the way
that they do give you output CSS from
the from the start and what they do is
you can think of it kind of as you know
in like bootstraps CSS properties it's
going to define the styles for your
forms here your tables and you know your
other things your code subs up all of
these different types of things
blockquote that need styling and even
down book things like flash messages
your headlines buttons and you know
things like that so let's install what
is this
hope this is the wrong place let's
install bitters ons a pseudo Tim install
bitters
cool successful so we're already in a
plugins directory and MSA bitters
install bitters files installed to slap
that is great so when I go back to my
plugins directory I seek bitters is
there I should go to my plugins
directory file and say at import bitters
/ bitters now a word about bitters it
doesn't include a reset or normalize
which I'm going to do myself
I finally minified normalized I create a
new file called normal lives dot CSS and
make it s CSS so I could just paste it
in and save and I'm going to import it
here at dash
and okay cool and Ruby tells me that
Williams Oh I spelt normalised wrong
here nor alas there we go and okay we're
all good my output app CSS is going to
have normalized in it and actually that
was my this is the code for my uh my
bourbon neat grid so let's turn that off
visual grid off a false and I'll go back
to a fire oh good okay our resulting
rendered CSS will have normalized at the
top and then did we import bourbon
really I'm sorry do we import bitters
okay bitters and then after normalize
will have bitters which will be styling
for you know things like Mara H ones are
going to be health data cut you know
text rendering all these kind of things
that we want to make sure we do but
they're just kind of so tedious and to
do in especially if you go product or
project pretty quickly there's going to
be great like baseline for us to start
from now bitters is going to have a
variable sheet where we can go in and
remember bourbon head Helvetica what if
we change this to mono is it mano-a-mano
space in this little space no it would
be monstrous uh-huh cool um that'll be
for the whole site so our variable sheet
is really powerful and you can out and
you can define the different colors that
are going to be used like the base text
link color you know the borders and also
you can define what's going to be used
in bidders to set the basis for the free
a file or for all of your defaults so
the in the example here we have you know
the headings paragraphs list styles form
elements all this stuff is stuff is
going to is going to be styled and look
great it's like the the base the
baseline standardized styling so for any
new element you want to add a form
it's going to look good it's not going
to look like the default browser Styles
all right and the last bit we want to
look at is something called refills
refills are a little different than
bourbon bitters and meet in the pet in
the way that they are you know thought
out navigation patterns okay so how
we're going to use those let's just
close the majority of these things here
I'd get rid of these boxes and go into
our home senses get all this stuff okay
now these patterns so let me show you
what I'm talking about
we're going to go into our body and I'm
just going to copy the code and paste
now I need to style it so I'm going to
this is going to be a module new file a
new top now I don't CSS
and in them in the modules directory I'm
going to say at import top now now when
I go to my rendered file I should have
this beautiful navigation across the top
awesome there's a little problem here
and that is actually because bourbon was
just updated and this needs not to be 0
names to be Auto I know that because I
mess around with over earlier bourbon
used to allow you to use that position a
mix in and say if you wanted it to be
skipped or auto you would write zero now
you have to write out Auto explicitly so
now and refresh them that will be where
it should be what that means is that the
refill just needs to catch up with the
the newest version of bourbon which came
out just last week so it's not not a big
it's not a big gap worried let's just
recently so the next module on a grab
from refills is going to be this cool
hero unit look at the code here copy it
put it into my index out HTML copy the
code the mark copy the styles module
called hero
he wrote on CSS and import hero into
into my directory navigation hero and
save so when I go back to my example I'm
going to have this really nice hero unit
and again look at I have the defaults
that that I put in bitters are flowing
throughout and I have a amount of space
type in my hero that's pretty cool
now these are really really easy to
change this is the icon here I can go
into hero unit and I want to kind of
change this background out it so here's
the background I have this cool bling
thingy put that in and easily update
yeah so nice let's see what else we got
uh ooh these are really nice these are
good for sales copy copy the mark now
again this is just the pattern that
we're falling and all these things are
set or you know easily editable copy the
styling and I want to create a new
module and I call these like all the
points py points
and import the points and then check it
out
there we go okay so and we notice that
we have we don't have you know the
pleasing margins that we were hoping to
have automatically and even though these
points are responsive they're just kind
of like I don't know they don't look
that great right by default because they
that they're crashing right here up
against this this other module and you
know what at first you're like oh it
didn't work automatically but then you
think you know that's actually actually
preferable because you can never tell
where you're going to put these modules
I mean what if this showed up inside of
a you know like a my kind of overlay
modal or something you know and you need
though any damata
margins to be a little bit different so
that's good but we do need to go in and
kind of carve out a place for them now
this is different than the modules I
wouldn't go into edit the modules of
points directly I would go into the
layout that this pages in so this is the
home page I'll go back into that layout
SAS and deal with these and and so like
what are these guys call them they're
called bullets or something yeah bullets
is the class oops went to copy and paste
it so home let's say bullets
patting 50 and see 100 zero
so they have a nice paddle for the top
but also we're kind of like crashing
right here where I don't think we should
now this is where I would use meat I
would say you're going to be an outer
continuum and that's just making the max
with 960 and it could be centered with
margins so that's why I use padding
right here not margin because I wanted
to make sure that I was going to have
the ability to to Center these guys with
a outer container cool and that's all we
need to do to fix that out and that's
layout contextualized actually it should
be something like that home dump bullets
and then on your home you know HTML you
would say class huh then you would start
your home you'd scope all of these
styles into home oh this is winter
thinking big though so it does matter
whatever cool next one is an article oh
these are cool I like this a lot because
you can go in and choose what style of
articles now these are going to be
scoped these styles and such are going
to be scoped to the article itself which
is really handy because even though I've
said that I want my site to be mono
styled I can you know I'm going to
choose a which is a slab I can have um
you know whatever styles are are are
attached to this article itself so I'll
show the code grab the mark-up here and
throw that in my index.html file and
grab the styles and I'm going to make a
new module called article called our two
comb got
ESS and that's going to have my article
in it and I need to again import that
into my modules directory let's take a
look and here's my article heading cool
it's dialed just how I would like it
it's it's really beautifully styled but
it's not it's not a centered in the cut
it's not but it's not styled in the
context of the layout so this layout is
home so we go back to my homes dialing
in and say article
you are going to be a was it called an
outer container and all your children
are going to be a their net of spam
columns and let's say eight columns and
let's move you guys with a shift
two columns she goes nice centered how
does that look
well it looks good that's really great
okay let's go refill it a lot of other
things let's give a few cards these are
cool comment styles comment modules tabs
goodness tables all these are awesome
vertical tabs um wow that's cool these
are cool oh it's even cooler
yeah let's grab this show the code copy
the markup hit my name mix and these are
all like you know all the content and
these icons these are all customer as
well I want to call this module grid of
squares perfect great items grid items
good items oh dear good items dot CSS
okay and I'm going to throw that in my
directory and save what have we here
I'm assuming it's going to be full with
okay cool yeah that's really great it's
full width though and I did like the
look of it being um you know kind of not
post I guess you'd say
what is this call cochlear done good
atoms liens in the context of my layout
I'm gonna say that good Adam lines you
need to be an outer container
cool nice nice nice now you can change
all these content you can change the
width and the spans of these of these
grids this is cool article gets a little
close there that's okay
all right let's close this up let's put
a footer here others a footer show the
code copy the mark-up and after my
gridlines put my footer module create a
new module called footer dot s CSS and
copy it cutter looks good fight good
footer uh head directory oops
and you should be ah go to the footer
cool so I'm going to say those grid
items in my home I need a little space
below so padding-bottom 100 pixels
ooh the marsh bomb that that revealed
was lying there but I don't want so
margin-bottom will take that oh that's
just because of the way the bits anyway
cool so this is this is a pretty good
start to a good looking website and that
was all done just using real refills I
didn't you know really design or code
any of this markup and the cool thing is
that it's all customizable really simply
put and all of the things I wanted and
none of the things I did not want which
is not an option when you're when you're
working with bootstrap or foundation
