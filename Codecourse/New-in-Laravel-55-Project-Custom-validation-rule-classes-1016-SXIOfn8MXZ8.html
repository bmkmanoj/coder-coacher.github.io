within Merivale but we now have the
opportunity in 5.5 to define out
class-based custom validation rules and
this allows us to be a little bit
cleaner and use more functionality to
build up our rules now we're going to
take this part to go into a full example
so this is going to be much longer and
for this we're going to use male guns
email validation service so rather than
just determine whether an email address
has the right syntax to it using the
regular expression used within verifies
default rules we're going to of course
use syntax checks here as well but also
dns validation and spell checks as well
so let's just take a look at how this
works if I go ahead and type in my email
address but get rid of the e this is of
course is not a valid domain so it's
going to give us back that we have an
invalid email address and interestingly
as well if for example I was to say a
hotmail email address but leave off the
L what this is also going to do is give
us the suggestion here as well so did
you mean Alex or hotmail com so we're
going to build this out and we're going
to go through exactly how to build all
of this out in this part so let's go and
look at what we can do this okay so to
take a look at the basics of this I have
ghazal installed because we're going to
need to make a request to mail guns API
if you don't use mail gun don't worry
the concept is the same for any
third-party services or just any
validation rules whatsoever so of course
if we go ahead and submit this with an
invalid email address we see lhara fills
standard validation rule kick in and
this is over in the earth controller
just here over in or the auth section
over in the register controller so we
just have a standard list of rules now
we've always always been able to pass in
a custom rule in here in terms of using
something like rule exists and I'll show
you how that looks but we're going to
pass our own class in here so really the
first thing to do is just define this
class out if you're not sure how to
normally create custom validation rules
all that information is over on the
laravel documentation what we're going
to do is not add this to a service
provider we're going to build this up so
what I technically do is put this inside
of HTTP since that's the kind of layer
that we're dealing with and we could
maybe create a validation folder or
folder you know whatever you want to do
so in here let's create a class out and
I'm going to call this valid email makes
a little bit more sense to give it a
name like that and let's go ahead and
create this class out and see what we
can do so valid email and let's bring
the name spacing for this so there are
typically two methods that we want to
define here for this the first one is
passes this will of course determine
whether is passed
given the attribute that we're dealing
with and the actual value so what going
to do for now is just go ahead and
return false in here so we know that
this always fails now the other thing is
really great we can actually define out
the custom message in here within a
method so this gives us the opportunity
to switch this message around if we need
to and we are going to be doing that
based on the results back from mailgun
so I'm just going to say failed in here
just so we can see how this works
now before we go any further we need to
make sure that this implements laravel
from rule contract so let's go ahead and
pull the namespace in for this just here
and that's pretty much the basics of our
custom rule class now over an hour
validator just here what we now want to
do is include this but now inside of an
array now unfortunately what we can't do
is use this entire string in an array
because this is just one item now and
that's going to be seen as an entire
role in itself so what you do have to do
is just go ahead and separate out rather
than using a pipe separate each of these
strings as an array item so once we've
done that we'll be in a position to go
ahead and use our new valid email rule
and because this is a class we can go
ahead and pass in any dependency pair
that we're going to find useful so let's
bring the namespace in for this just at
the top here and we'll come back over
here and give this a refresh of course
we need to go down here and just I don't
know come on the end there and we end up
with a following so when I go ahead and
register now we do get that traditional
email kick in a mail rule here but if we
were to get rid of this and we go ahead
and refresh you'll see that we get
failed so that's the rule kicking in now
this is as easy now as just going ahead
and determine what you want to do with
the value so you can add you know pretty
much anything in here that
one extract out any more complex checks
two different methods down here
protected methods and pretty much do
what you want but what we're now going
to do is look at using the mailgun api
service to validate this and switch over
this message based on what we get so the
first thing we want to do because we
want to eventually change this let's go
ahead and create a protected proxy at
the top which we can switch over later
on so I'm going to say in here sorry
invalid email address like so and from
the message we're now just going to
return this message so that's going to
work in exactly the same way if we go
ahead and click register now we see that
message in there so that's pretty
straightforward now in terms of the
request to the API like I said this
means that what we can now do is
potentially extract things out to other
methods makes things a lot tidier so
maybe we want to implement a method
called get mail gun response and then we
wanted to pass in the email address in
here and implement a method down here to
go ahead and actually make that request
now of course into this class we're
going to need to pass in guzzle this
might be on our container but what I'm
going to do is just new up an instance
of this inside of here but you probably
would want to pull that out of your
container so let's go ahead and pass
mailgun into here sorry guzzle into here
so let's create a constructor of course
because this is a class we can now
accept ghazal in so let's go around up
the top use guzzle HTTP client am I
usually alias this as ghazal so we know
what we're type printing it's going to
accept guzzle in just here and we can
call it client or guzzle whatever you
want to do and let's go ahead and set
this client to client and go ahead and
of course create a protected client
property up here I'm not going to add
dock blocks in here but you can go ahead
and do so with your own rules so now
that we've done this over in our
register controller like I said you can
pull this out of your container but on
what I'm going to do is just pass in a
guzzle HTTP client instance and accept
this into here so let's do a die dump
here on this client just to see that
this is all working and what we should
be able to do is submit this through and
see our guzzle client brilliant ok so
now that we have that we just need to
make a request and then we can
first of all with the response back from
mailgun check if it's a valid email
address in terms of their validation and
then we can switch around that message
so let's go ahead and make a request
here with ghazal and of course we're
going to use this client and we are
going to make a get request over to this
API so I'll just pull in the endpoint
just here and into this we pass in to
the query string both the address and
our API key so the API key here I
already have stored it in my EMV far so
I'm going to go ahead and pull this in
from mailgun key but of course that
could be in config as well and you can
just as easily use the config helper if
you want to do so for the address then
let's go ahead and pass the address in
and we'll probably accept this into here
so we can go ahead and get that of
course you can pretty much do whatever
you want and that should be pretty much
it to see what we have so let's add ID
dump and we'll JSON decode the response
we get back so we use request get body
to do this and it's going to just submit
this through and see what we get
so we get a response back here the email
address of course is not valid and we
see is valid false and we also see this
did you mean section here so we'll
explore that in just a little bit so
what we can now do is of course go ahead
and return this response that we get
like so and then up here we can of
course just return response is valid and
that will go ahead and use that third
party API to validate that email address
so if I go ahead and refresh now and
enter a click register we should see
sorry invalid email address of course
this is a bit slower because we're
hitting an external API but if you do
need to do that for any kind of
validation rule then you know you're
always going to see some kind of delay
okay so now we've done this we know that
that works but what if we want to check
that did you mean well it's just as easy
now to go ahead and check this so we can
just say if from the response we get
that did you mean value back which would
be a default of null then we're going to
go ahead and set the message to
something else so what I'm going to do
is again extract this out to another
method so it's a little bit tidier so
we're going to say something like bill
suggestion error and we're going to pass
through the response so we can extract
out that suggestion so down here let's
go ahead and implement the method build
suggestion error and into this we will
receive in a response and we can pretty
much just go ahead and return what we
would like to see so let's return a
string in here what we want to do is use
the original message so as we have that
as a property we can just go ahead and
do that and then we just want to say did
you mean and then using the response go
ahead and grab did you mean with a
question mark
and we're pretty much done so we of
course check that set the message and
then go ahead and return false still to
check that that was false II so of
course now what I can do is go ahead and
just enter say an invalid domain in here
and we'll see sorry invalid email
address and as we saw from the
introduction if we go ahead and type in
say Alex our hotmail but just miss off
the L it will say sorry invalid email
address
did you mean Alex at hotmail com so a
really simple example here but you could
go ahead and use this for you know
pretty much any third-party service that
you need to hit in order to check
validation rules and this was something
that we could do before with our veil
but now that we have these class-based
custom validation rules it makes it just
that a little bit easier to separate
things out and create a really nice
clean class where we can inject these
entities in that we need in order to do
this so there we go
I'll leave the code for this and the
course downloads as well so you can go
ahead and check that out if you want to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
