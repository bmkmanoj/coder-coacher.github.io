our user registration tutorial what
we're going to do in this is tidy up a
few bits and piece together our lot
registration and login process and just
give it a full test run so you can see
that it works okay so from the last part
you saw that I registered myself into
this database everything's worked out
okay and I'm at the login screen here
now if I go and try and login with this
let's say username is Alex and my
password which was the password that I
used I can see that when I click login I
get an incorrect password now this
doesn't mean that my username hasn't
moved found so for example if I typed in
a lower difficult that's for stupid
laptop typed in the load of rubbish here
and then typed in my password it will
get tell me that my user doesn't exist
what this is saying is that my user does
exist but in fact my password is wrong
now the reason my password is wrong is
because my plaintext password at the
moment is being compared to my only five
acquitted password inside my database
the way we do this is is we go back to
our login page which you know is from
the tutorial prior to this one the user
login tutorial and at the part where we
compare compare our passwords so check
to see if they match that's you know
sorry that's yeah that's checking our
username there and this is checking our
password what we need to do is we need
to check our password at the moment
let's say I typed in my password which
is slice the UK one it's just a password
I've used since I was about ten years
old but slicer UK 1 now that's the
password I've been typing in here so
slicer UK 1 ok and this is checking this
now this password here is equal to
slider k1 but this password here is
equal to so we're not getting a
comparison
and they will just change this is we
encrypt our password so now this will
actually equal this so this is encrypted
encrypting slicer UK 1 which is in fact
this being equal to slicer UK 1 if
immittance so we're comparing our md5
encrypted password to our md5 encrypted
password in our database and let's say
when I resubmit this form login let's
try again ok 1 login now I still not
getting it alright so let's give this a
check password leak was post password so
md5 of that password let's maybe go back
refresh this password so right now I
know the probe the problem here and the
problem is that our md5 password is
absolutely correct but what has been
come what is being compared to is
password that's been cut short in our
database due to the fact that if we go
to our structure and we go down to our
password field here and edit this we've
currently got a length of 25 as its
limit so what we want to do is we want
to say the limit for this is let's say
100 I'm not exactly sure how long an md5
string is but I'm going to say length
values equals 100 so we'll save that out
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
browse my table and I'm gonna delete
this value and I'm gonna go back and I'm
going to re-register so register full
name in there choose a username let's
say Alex like I said before choose a
password and I say slicer UK 1 silly
password and I'm going to click register
you have been registered return to the
login page now if we check our database
again we can see because I've changed
the
the length of this this is look looking
a bit longer already it hasn't been cut
sure so now hopefully fingers crossed
when we try to look back in this
properly we can log-in and we're in okay
so check for things like that check
string length so I've been a bit lazy in
this but hopefully you've caught onto
this if you want me to sort of expand on
this tutorial at all
please just let me know but that is
basically the use of registration and
this is followed on from our user login
tutorial so by putting this together
we've got a fully functional user
register and login process what I will
be doing is using this in a lot of my
project work so for example I might
create a project on something that uses
a user login or a user register and a
login so I'm going to be using this a
lot so you can check out my projects as
well to get a good feel of a user login
and registration okay now if you've got
any questions or you'd like me to expand
like I said on anything please just let
me know and if you haven't subscribed
already please do subscribe for updates
future video updates and I'll see you
guys soon thanks a lot for watching bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
