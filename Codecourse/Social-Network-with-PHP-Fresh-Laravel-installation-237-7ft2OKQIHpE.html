fresh layer of our installation and give
our app a name now if you're familiar
with setting up laravel you can
obviously skip this step it doesn't
really apply to if you already know how
to create a laravel fresh installation
it's worth noting I'm also using
homestead which I'd highly recommend you
use for local development when you're
working with laravel if you don't
already have it installed we have a
guide on doing that so you can go ahead
and watch that before returning back to
this video so let's just take a look
around my directory structure just so we
can understand how I'm setting things up
I have this folder dub dub dub or
ww-with in my home directory this
contains a load of rubbish but I have my
homestead folder just in here and I'm
working with an older version of
homestead but it's pretty much the same
if you're working with a newer version
so inside of my terminal I'm currently
within my homestead directory and we're
going to take a look at my homestead
Yamma file if you've set homestead up
successfully you'll have a homestead
Yamma file you can edit to be able to
create sites like chatty dev or whatever
you're calling it dev so let's have a
look at my homestead yamo file and for
my sites amongst a load of other sites
you can see here that I'm mapping chatty
dev to home vagrant dub dub dub chatty
public so dub dub dub is that folder
here we don't have a chatty directory
here at the moment will create that when
we create a new laravel project but it's
important to note that we're going
straight to the public directory once
you've done this you can go ahead and
provision vagrant again by using vagrant
provision and that will go ahead and
take all your settings into account and
make sure you have chatty dev in your
hosts file as well you can see that will
look like this if I just go over and CD
over to Etsy and then I do a fin on
hosts just like my password you can see
here that I've got one two seven dot dot
dot one map too chatty dev
okay so now that we've done that let's
head back over to our dub dub dub
directory and we are going to go back
into our homestead directory and we're
actually going to SSH into our virtual
machine so now we have this dub dub dub
directory we can go into this remember
corresponds to the directory that we're
in here so whatever we do in here will
be reflected locally from our virtual
machine so inside of laravel when we
install it we can actually download the
laravel installer using composer this
makes it really easy to make I'll create
a new layer of our installation by
running laravel new and then the name of
your project so let's first of all just
run this this may take a little while
and once that's done go ahead and clear
the screen and we can use that command
that we saw earlier laravel new and then
whatever we want to call it so all we
need to do here is say laravel new and
I'm going to call this chatty and that's
going to craft that application and then
we should be ready to go great so now
that that is done if we just return over
to our finder you can see that that
chatty directory has been created just
here with all of levels fresh
installation so what I'm going to do is
over my text editor I'm just going to
copy this over because this is what
we're going to be editing remember we
now be able to edit all of these and
they'll be reflected over on our virtual
machine but if you set everything up
correctly now you should be able to see
when you refresh your hostname you
should see your fresh laravel
installation and it's worked here and
hopefully it has worked for you too and
we can now get on with building our
social network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
