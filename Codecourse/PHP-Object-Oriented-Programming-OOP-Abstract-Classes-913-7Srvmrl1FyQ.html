abstract classes so I can't think of a
good example for this so I'm just going
to use the classic fou so filled up HP
and this is going to be a class and it
will contain one method public function
bar and we're just going to return fubar
now you may be thinking to yourselves
why is he teaching is this we already
know what this is so if we include this
Fudo PHP instantiate it foo equals new
foo foo bar and echo fubar and we get
foo bar I'm going to add abstract before
that class definition here and now we're
going to get an error cannot instantiate
an abstract class foo and that's because
any classes that I declared as abstract
we can't instantiate them so the only
thing that we can do is extend them so
if we create a new file and call this
bar so class bar extends foo I will add
a new method public function bars and
this will return cooks so now if we
require that file and we say bar equals
new bar and echo bar plus is that Oh yep
bar Baz we get cooks and because this is
extending foo we can also access this
method since it's being inherited now
here's the interesting part
an abstract an abstract class is kind of
like an interface because we can define
abstract methods
so if we say abstract public function
foo bar and add a colon there a
semicolon at the end of the line just
like in an interface we're going to get
an error class bar contains one abstract
method and must therefore be declared
abstract or implement through the
remaining methods foo foo bar and we've
seen this before when we created our
interface
so now what we can do is implement this
method public function foo bar and then
we can return something like I don't
know bar cooks I didn't call it I what
is it
ah foo bar and we get our bar cooks and
this is what we call an abstract class
and the way I like to think about it is
an interface in which we can define
default implementations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
