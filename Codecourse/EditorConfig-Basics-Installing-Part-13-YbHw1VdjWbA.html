about editor config files and how to use
them now if you want to maintain
consistency throughout our project
specific files or across all developers
on your team then using an editor config
file with your text editor can help you
do this now I already have the editor
config extensional plug-in installed for
sublime we'll go ahead and talk about
this later because it will support other
text editors as well so if you're using
another text editor or ID don't worry so
you can see here I've got a editor
config file inside my root directory
don't worry if you don't know what this
means we'll cover each of these
properties and we'll talk about these
later I'm going to go ahead and open up
global dot CSS an example this is inside
the CSS directory under this main
directory so if I were to create a class
for example the first thing that's
actually happened here probably without
you know you've been realizing is that
is indented here automatically by two
spaces because I defined that in my
edits a config file when I go ahead and
type my property name and I hit save you
can see it's automatically inserted a
final new line so that's another
property that's taken place here also if
a developer or you know anything insert
additional whitespace I've just done a
couple of white spaces here you can see
that my cursors just here when I save
that will automatically remove that
trailing whitespace and I've also
defined this these files are all of my
files as utf-8 so there are various
properties that you can actually use to
enforce consistency without all of the
files in your project and as long as
you've got your edits a config file with
you and your text editor supports editor
config and you have everything installed
as a plug-in it will just go ahead and
take these properties and apply them now
as you can see if we just head over to
editor config it's supported by a wide
range of popular editors so you
shouldn't find it hard
integrate this with what you're using
now I'm using sublime so we're going to
start fresh and install editor config
with Sublime's package manager
so now sublime for me is completely free
of the sublime package manager and also
editor convict so I'm starting as you
would if you didn't have anything like
this installed so on this website here
the package control website we can
install this and there's instructions
here to go ahead and install it I'm
going to copy this Python code and I'm
going to paste it into the sublime
terminal and I've done this by hitting
ctrl and backtick so if I paste this in
here this will install sublime package
manager once this is done we can in we
can access the package manager or
package control from the console this
will bring up this little box here what
we can then do is choose to install the
package and this will give us a list of
the available packages in this case I
want to edit install editor config so I
hit enter here that will install that at
the bottom you can see the status and
then that's done so now editor config is
installed and as long as I have an
editor config file with the design
properties I can go ahead and apply
these to the files that I'm working with
so in the next part we'll look at
actually creating this editor config
file and we'll introduce some properties
and we'll talk about what they do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
