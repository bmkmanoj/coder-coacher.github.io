creating a database table to store the
links that we're going to be shortening
and we're also going to be setting up
our illuminate database component so we
can easily use this for models to
basically retrieve data as you would
within the laravel framework now we're
not using the laravel framework we're
just borrowing a component from it to
make our lives a lot easier so let's get
started with actually creating the table
first of all so I'm going to create a
new table just in here called links and
hit add doesn't matter which database
client you're using to create this by
the way and this is automatically
generated me an ID with a type of
integer length of 11 which you can
reduce if you want it's unsigned and it
also has an auto increment extra here
and it's obviously the primary key of
this table so auto increment just means
we're going to increment from 12 to 23
every time we create a new record and
we'll see how we can adjust this later
to give ourselves slightly longer URLs
if we want to so we'll see how that
works in a minute let's fill out the
rest of these we're going to have a URL
field called URL and I'm just going to
set this to a varchar with 255 in length
but you can play around with this if you
think you're going to need longer URL
storing go ahead and do that also going
to have a code here so that's again
going to be a VAR char and again I'm
just going to set this to 255 it's just
habit but you can reduce this
significantly because your codes in the
URL at the end never going to mean that
long so last of all we're going to
create our created at so that's a
timestamp this is when the record was
created and updated at which is a
timestamp as well now we're not going to
be using updated app but eloquent which
we're going to be pulling in is well
basically requires that we have created
at and updated as well and it just makes
it a lot easier if we just think food
both from the start we don't need to
mess around with things so that is our
database table created let's go ahead
and create a initial record
just so we can test things as we go
along so for the URL let's say duck duck
go calm and let's have a code in here
let's just say D you see k DG I or
something like that you know like
something as an example and for the
Creator that date will set to now so
this is how our database is going to
look as it fills up with URLs that in
shortened the URL won't be duplicated
unless it has something like www put in
front of it in which case it will be
duplicated but if we pass this URL
through to our application in the API
will just get this code back it won't
create a new record because it's a waste
of space to generate a new record for
the same URL so now that we've done that
then we need to actually set up a
database connection with an hour app so
we can work with it and this is slightly
different to what you might be used to
you might may be used to using PDO or
mysqli or something like that to connect
to your database using eloquent is going
to make it a lot easier for us to create
models and generally access our database
in a nicer way so instead of app then
let's create a new file and we're going
to call this database PHP this is just
going to be our database configuration
so inside of here lower valves database
component makes it easy to be used
outside of larval so we need to do a
little bit of setup here to make this
work but after that it's a breeze so we
need to pull in illuminate database
capsule manager but we're going to call
that capsule rather than call it manager
so we're working now within
instantiating an object that we're
calling capsule so we're going to create
a new variable here called capsule
that's a new capsule and then we're
going to say capsule add connection this
is essentially the connection details to
your database so because
this uses p do we need to specify the
driver that we're using this this allows
you to connect to other database type so
if you do have another database that
you're working with then you can specify
that here we also need to define the
host that we're working with in this
case it's 127 done order one or a local
host and we need to specify the database
name which for me is shorty you saw that
earlier just here obviously this may be
different for you and we need to provide
the user name and password obviously for
me the username and password are both
root and we need to specify character
encoding as well and that's utf-8 and we
need to specify a collation as well and
that's utf-8 unicode CI and we can
prefix if we want that will leave this
empty so as long as you are successfully
connecting to your database we can boot
eloquent and this allows us to use
eloquent on our models you don't know
what this means don't worry it will
become very clear when we actually start
to create our models a little bit later
on so let's just finish up by including
our database file within our start PHP
file and we are ready to go now so if
you have any problems along the way for
the rest of the series it's more than
likely that you have some kind of
details here not specified correctly or
obviously there's some kind of error in
here but we should be good to go now and
we can move on to creating our first
model and then we can look at how we can
actually use eloquent to pull data from
our links table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
