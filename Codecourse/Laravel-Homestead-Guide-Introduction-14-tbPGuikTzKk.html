recommended way to install and develop
with laravel and this is using
VirtualBox vagrant and laravel homestead
which you can see on my screen just here
now this might seem a little bit
complicated at times and you might have
never heard of any of this software but
it's actually pretty easy to get set up
with so we're gonna be going through all
these steps and after you're done you'll
be good to go forever so first of all
what a virtual box and vagrant we'll
take a quick look at what these are
first because we kind of need to
understand what these are to be able to
develop with that of our homestead you
guess you don't need to but it's a good
idea to so VirtualBox which I have here
if you head over to virtualbox.org this
is a hypervisor which is basically a
piece of software that allows you to
create virtual machines on your computer
so this means that whatever operating
system you're using whether it's Windows
Linux OS X you can create a virtual
machine that for example runs Linux and
vice versa so you can have an image
install that and you can run a virtual
machine whatever operating system you're
working on and this is the first thing
that we're going to install which we'll
be doing just in a moment so you might
be wondering why do I need a virtual
machine when I can just install Apache
MySQL PHP and whatever else I need on my
computer and just start developing and
that is a good question because most
people are used to doing it this way now
the reason a virtual machine is so
useful is because when you're eventually
hosting your project which I assume you
will be you're likely going to be
running a server on Linux meaning that
while you're developing on your computer
you are going to be working with a
system as close as possible to what you
eventually will have on your hosting
environment if you use something like a
virtual machine so this basically means
they're going to have less problems when
you go live it's just going to be much
simpler you're not going to see errors
that you didn't expect etc so let's move
on to vagrant so think of vagrant as a
helper and this basically lets us using
VirtualBox easily create virtual
machines because we're not going
directly creating virtual machines
through virtual VirtualBox we're gonna
be using vagrant to help us so now our
homestead uses vagrant to create a
virtual machine so we will need to
install our of our homestead too but
think of laravel homestead is just a
predefined environment and this makes it
as easy as possible even more easy than
just using vagrant on its own to set
everything up now you might be thinking
do I really have to install all of this
software
well because vagrant allows you to
easily manage your virtual machines and
laravel homestead makes it even easier
to set up different domains for
different projects locally and basically
comes bundled with a huge amount of
software this will make your life a lot
easier when you have to start
configuring your virtual machines and
starting and stopping them and stuff and
it's all made lots easier with Homestead
so if you're still not entirely
convinced or you're still not sure it's
a good idea to just give this a go and
it will kind of transform the way you
start developing it really does make a
massive difference it's like anything
until you actually try something you
kind of don't think you can live without
it but when you do you couldn't possibly
live without it so you're going to need
to install VirtualBox and vagrant so
I'll let you go ahead and do this
yourself because it's different for
different operating systems here we're
specifically focusing on doing this on
OS X on a Mac but if you're using
another operating system it'll work
slightly what more or less the same but
slightly different so go ahead and
install VirtualBox and vagrant if you do
have any problems a quick search with
your favorite search engine should
basically turn up any common problems
you might get along the way installing
these and once you have installed both
VirtualBox and vagrant we'll take a look
at exactly what our homestead is and how
we install and work with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
