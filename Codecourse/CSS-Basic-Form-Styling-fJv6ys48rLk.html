look at styling forms just very
basically just enough for them to look
nice and this obviously includes
responsive as well so as the container
that surrounds your forms get smaller
everything still looks fine so this is a
sort of visual image of what we're going
to be building you can see here that
we've just got a text area we've got a
just a normal input of text we've also
got a checkbox here as well we're using
labels to allow for accessibility and
we're also going to be styling these
submit buttons or buttons as well just
to give it a little bit of padding and
make everything a little bit larger so
on a smaller device things are more
accessible but you can also chop and
change these forms this will work with
radio buttons as well as well as a
variety of other different input types
so let's go ahead and start styling of
basic HTML form out to look like this
okay so we're starting out with nothing
at all here we've got a basic document
with just child character encoding title
and we've also got this stylesheet
linked in within a CSS folder and that's
just called main dot CSS we have nothing
in there at all at the moment though so
we're starting in terms of CSS
completely from scratch what we're first
going to do is we're going to build out
this form just so we can see what it
looks like in the browser without any
styling but I'm going to wrap this all
in a container so I'm going to create a
div element here with a class of
container and this is just going to act
as my viewport if you like this is a
very rough example of how we can just
create a container and basically just
set a width and a maximum width as well
you can just adjust that to see how this
responds so I'm going to create a width
of 100% here and then I'm going to go
ahead and I'm going to add a maximum
width just to stop it there that means
that when we resize the browser window
everything within it will squash in as
much as possibly can they're obviously
better
to create container but this depends on
where you're building everything let's
put that down there so it's out of the
way and let's start to actually build
our markup and we'll look at what it
looks like and then we'll discuss how
we're going to go ahead and actually
style it so let's create our form we
obviously have an action in the form and
we have a method but we're just going to
leave these blank for now now I'm going
to set autocomplete to off just so that
the suggestions don't pop up and annoy
us so what we've got actually going to
do is we're going to create things like
our input type of text which may have
already seen before in our text area and
our check box but we're going to put
these within label elements and this
means that what we can do is to aid
accessibility have a label associated
with that input so for example I'm going
to create a label here and end it there
and what I'm going then going to do is
inside give the label but I would want
to see so for example title now
underneath I can then put my input say
type of text give it a name give it any
classes I need to whatever I need to do
really so in this case it's just going
to be an input type of text and I'm
going to say name title so let's take a
look at what this looks like it's going
to look a little bit messy you can see
that the text box is very small you
won't typically find text boxes this
small anymore and titles just next to it
we can notice we can actually click the
title which is really good and that will
actually focus on in on this box that's
a handy way that we use a label like
this okay so let's do pretty much the
same thing here but let's use a text
area instead so let's imagine this is
the body of some kind of post we create
a text area element here like so and I'm
going to give this a name of Oddi we
don't really need to do this and this is
more important than rows now I'm not
going to use styling to control the
height I'm going to use rows there's
nothing really wrong with this
necessarily but we are controlling the
width of this element
with CSS you don't want to use the
Cowles attribute so when i refresh now
we get this it's starting to look
completely messy so all we'll fix this
up in a moment now the last thing I want
to add before we look at adding the
check box a little bit later is an input
type of submit so this will be obviously
the button that submits this form
through and we can give that a value as
well we can call it post or something
like that there we go is down there so
this all looks a little bit of a mess
it's all in line by default we've got
our little post button down here it
doesn't look great obviously so how can
we resolve this well we're going to head
over to our stylesheet the first thing
that I'm going to do is give a Oddie
font and then we'll incorporate our
input and text area into this as well
now I'm just doing this rough so I'm
going to say 1m and Georgia this can be
anything that's obviously better options
for the typography on your website so
now you'll notice that the styling has
changed here but also inside of this is
where if I just zoom in this has changed
as well so for right title sorry this
hasn't changed so you can see that the
the font in here remains the default so
we can combat that by literally just
input text area you may even have a
separate body element because you might
be adding things like widths and Heights
here or background so you may want to
separate these two from the body but
either way you want body input and text
area to contain this so now what's going
to happen is you'll notice that this
actually has the same font size and it
has the same font as well now that was
also if we just go back to 200% that's
also increased the size of these boxes
just because of the nature of the font
sites that we've used but we're going to
do better than that
so the first thing I want to do is just
give my form a margin bottom of 20
pixels just so wherever we place it
there's always going to be that nice gap
underneath now for the input
text area and button elements what we're
actually going to be doing is we're
going to be creating a separate version
of this submit button using the button
element like so in fact we can actually
add it in now that might just make sense
and we'll be targeting the input here
the text area and the button and we're
going to be giving these a padding of 10
pixels and we're going to be giving
these a width of a hundred percent the
reason we've done that is because we
want the input and the text areas have a
width of 100% and the button we want to
have padding too as well as these two
we're going to reset this a little bit
later though because we all find out
that we don't want the button to have a
width of a hundred percent and we also
don't want an input type of submit to
have a width of a hundred percent
because that's the button for your form
so now what you'll see as we get
something that looks like this now it
already looks slightly better because
we've got a full width element here and
we've also added the padding in there so
you can see that we've got a little bit
of room around here so it just looks a
little bit nicer easier for on smaller
devices as well for the user to just hit
he did with their finger and and be done
with it so we need to fix the issue of
these buttons being too too large
basically but let's go on to looking at
actually making the label here have a
little bit of a margin on the bottom
just so these aren't so close together
so remember we're wrapping all of our
elements within label so what we can
actually do here is we can say label
margin bottom of 20 pixels so that's
then going to push everything down
that's wrapped within a label and you'll
see this hasn't actually worked the
reason being is that a label is
display:inline if we just pull up our
developer tools
I will inspect this a lot our developer
tools you'll be able to see that we have
a display of inline just here so we can
fix that down here what I'm going to say
is I'm going to say label and input
remember that includes things like
our input types of text are in a text
box as well a text area as well let's
have that in there we want these to have
a display of block and there we go now
that that's got a display of block you
can see that we have our orange bottom
as well now you'll also notice that the
padding has actually pushed the inputs
away from the width of the actual
container so what we may want to do is
we may want to add in here box sizing
border box and that will change the box
model so what's actually going to happen
then if this is going to fit nicely
within it the padding isn't going to
push this out there our vendor prefixes
for this we're not going to go too much
into that you might want to look like
that up so you can support older
browsers or different browsers to the
one that you're currently using so we've
done a display block on this but now
what we want to do is actually reset
this for some of these elements so we're
going to specifically define here input
type of submit we also want to reset the
styles for the input type checkbox' and
the input type radio' as well
and we also don't want the button to be
100% with either so we can say a width
of auto on these and we can say display
inline like so so that sorts out the
problem with the buttons you'll notice
the subtle difference or the fairly big
difference between these here and you'll
notice that if we were to for example
add a specific order to these that
actually does sort of solve the problem
now there are subtle differences between
these two you can go ahead and figure
out how to do this just play around with
the styling and see what you can do and
don't forget to check that cross browser
I'm going to leave this out for now
though
and let's just go ahead and for the sake
of it just get rid of say the input type
of submit which is the one that's a
little bit trickier here so we've now
got our title our body and our post and
it's looking okay we've got a label text
up here which may could do with a little
bit of sort of spacing between that and
the actual element so let's go ahead and
change that as well so what we're going
to do is we're going to say label and
within that label we want to target our
input and we also one then within a
label want to target our text area and
then we're going to do a margin top here
of 10 pixels so let's take a look at
preview this perfect now you'll notice
the earlier I did an input type of check
box and radio let's just remove them for
now and see why we need to do this with
the width auto in the display inline so
let's add in here a label and I'm just
going to say sign up for my newsletter
and then here I'm going to do an input
type of check box and we'll give this a
name of newsletter okay so you'll notice
that this now actually has a display of
block and if we just take a look at the
actual styles we've got a margin top
which is fine a display of block and a
width of a hundred percent which is
pushing this down it's not letting this
text naturally sit next to it as it
normally would so when we add that in
what we're doing is we're taking away
the hundred-percent width that we
applied up here and water saying we want
this to be a display inline rather than
a display block and what that will then
do is allow that to just naturally sit
next to it as an inline element would so
let's finally just test the container so
I'm going to set the max width 200 pixel
so imagine you're scaling your browser
in you can see that this scales in
nicely if you had say a slightly larger
container 600 pixels these will move out
as well so depending on what kind of
system you're using to lay your website
out you might be using a grid system you
might just be using containers or one
container that perhaps just handles
everything and everything sits within it
then these will automatically feel the
width of that container so there we go
we have basically starred some elements
we've not done everything here because
that's you know always a little bit
tricky depending on your requirements
but you should have a general idea about
how to style out a page like this I've
also just noticed that we have this
small post here now if we were to add
button to this list of fonts that the
font that we added to this list of
elements later that's going to go ahead
and increase that for you so we're now
finished off with a nice looking form
very very basic CSS for this but will
work cross browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
