operators we're gonna take a look at how
we can basically manipulate values
through addition subtraction division
multiplication and we'll also look at
modulus as well so remainders very very
basic there's not really much to talk
about here and of course expressions can
get extremely advanced but in this case
we'll basically just look at performing
calculations between different numbers
and then setting them back to variables
so we're basically gonna have a couple
of numbers so for example I'll say num1
and this could be xx and I'll go ahead
and say num2 and this could be 40 I'm
gonna create a new variable called
result and we're just gonna add these
together so we'll use the the operator
the plus sign to perform an addition so
it's basically num1 plus num2 and all
that will do is it will perform this
calculation and assign it to this result
variable and on the same line we'll just
go ahead and echo this out so in our
browser now what we can do is we can see
the result of this so in that case it's
60 48 20 or 60 we can do exactly the
same thing as well with - so subtraction
in this case will refresh and get the
result minus 20 we can also perform
multiplication divisions so
multiplication use an asterisks you
obviously don't go ahead and use an X it
wouldn't make sense in in this case so
we're using an Asterix to perform
multiplication in this case we get the
result 800 and we can also divide as
well so we can get a result of 20/40
which is 0.5 or 1/2 so in the case of
these they're very very basic there's
not really much to to talk about I guess
the only thing to bear in mind is that
when you use brackets you're obviously
setting the precedence of what needs to
be calculated first so in this case I
might want to say num1 plus num2 and
then I want my want to divide that by 2
for example so in this case we get 48 20
which is 60 and then half of that is 30
now if we were to take this away what
result do we get well if we refresh we
get a completely different result and
that's because we're saying num1 plus
num2 divided by two so it's the same as
doing this for example and we get the
same result so it's you need to be
careful where you place your brackets
it's um it's one of them things now what
we can also do is we can also use
modulus and basically this gives us the
remind the remainder of a number now you
might be thinking well why why do I need
to find it remainder well this is useful
for things like working out if numbers
are even or odd or not so if we have an
um here let's say 4 and we say echo num
mod 2 even otherwise odd so let's go
ahead and preview this in the browser
when we refresh we see L sorry there we
go so in this case we see even output
because we want to check if the if the
the remainder of the modulus operation
is 0 or not and we could of course also
do something like this using our
comparison operator so we see even there
if we go ahead and change this to odd
then we see that it's an odd number we
see that this comes out with odd so this
is useful for things like if you're
looping through results and you want to
perhaps add a class to each row of a
table to determine if it's odd or not
there's a variety of things you can do
for this but it's it's often overlooked
as a solution to the most basic problems
in terms of that there obviously are
other more complicated things you can do
with arithmetic operators but in this
case we've just had an overview of the
basics of the operators</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
