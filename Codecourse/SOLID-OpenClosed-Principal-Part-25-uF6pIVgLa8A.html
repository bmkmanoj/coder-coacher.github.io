single responsibility principle now
we're going to look at the open-closed
principle now this principle is district
described by Rob Martin as you should be
able to extend a class's behavior
without modifying it and also classes
should be open for extension or closed
for modification so to demonstrate what
this principle is about I've created
just a small project here we have our
paper ipn and we've wrapped that into a
class so we're instantiating that here
and then we're instantiating a payment
manager class which is this and we're
inserting this using dependency
injection which is what we could see we
have our type in tting and restoring it
in this instance animal calling payment
manager process which is just calling
paper ipn process which we can see here
now back to this class here we're
actually breaking the open closed
principle what if for example we want to
change this so users can pay with a
credit card well we'd have to go through
here would have to change this would
after what we'd have to change pretty
much everything and we're going to
change that we're going to create a new
class a new file sorry and this is going
to be called payment method interface
interface payment method interface and
this is going to call one method which
is going to be processed payment so back
in here we're going to change this to
payment method interface and this is
going to be payment method same as this
this and this and this and because we
and because this is an interface here we
know for a fact that this method is
going to exist because you can't have a
class that implements an interface
unless it contains all of its methods so
this is one thing we need to do now we
need to implement payment method
interface and now this code will still
work but we can just as easily add a new
payment option so we can close all of
these we can create a new file called
credit card we can say PHP class credit
card implements payment methods
interface you can say public public
function process payment which is the
method that we need to implement and
this is just going to process that
payment so now the only thing that we
need to do is create the instance here
cause new credit card and change this to
use the credit card instead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
