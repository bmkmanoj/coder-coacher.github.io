creating a contact form a very simple
contact form with PHP that'll allow you
or your users of your website to go
ahead and enter their name enter their
email address and of course enter a
message and then hit Send and that's
going to send through to your email
address with their details so let's go
ahead and check the email out we just
got and there it is you can see that
we've got a message from me because I'm
using my gmail account to actually send
the message so we'll learn about hooking
up your SMTP details for this and it's
saying here from and then the name I
entered the email address I entered and
the message just down here so we could
click on this and just reply for example
so it's going to be very simple we do
have some very basic validation as well
so for example if I hit Send without
entering anything we get the errors here
and also obviously if I if I enter my
name this just stays in there so it's a
lot easier for the user to complete the
form so we're going to be building this
let's take a look at how we start the
code out okay then so to start things
off we've got a basic design here I'm
not going to be going through how we're
going to design this but let's take a
look around the directory structure and
we'll get a feel of how this all fits
together so under my root directory
which is just contact form this will be
the root directory of your website
perhaps we've got index dot PHP this is
basically what you can see at the moment
in the browser we have a form with three
fields on the first one is the name so
the user's name the email address of the
users email address and then the message
here which is a text area all of these
have these name attributes which
basically tell PHP how we pick these up
we've also got a submit button as well
so go ahead and create your form you can
see I've linked in the style sheet here
with the following styles if you did
want to copy these you could very very
rough just put together styles we're
pulling in a font from google fonts API
as well but basically that's what we're
doing so we've got our basic design here
with no PHP on at all this will need to
be a PHP extension because we will be
doing some logic within here
the top and also we're going to be
looping and outputting any errors just
here you can see in the browser at the
moment the star for this is just as of
gray box here so that's everything setup
we've then got contact PHP which are
file you need to create again in your
root directory now this far has nothing
in at the moment we'll be doing
everything from scratch within here and
lastly we've got thanks to PHP which is
basically just a standard document with
a stylesheet linked in and a small
message there so apart from that we need
to depend on a library and that will
allow us to send email now the reason
that we're not relying on our native
mail function in PHP is because this
becomes really tricky when you're moving
things to a server it tends to be slow
insecure so it's best to rely on a
well-established library like PHP mailer
so I currently have this inside of a lip
so library directory inside my root
directory but again if you install this
with composer if you know how this is a
lot better I'd recommend this solution
I'm just doing it this way just because
it makes more sense for those who
haven't used composer so we've got a
folder inside of lips called PHP mailer
and it's got these four files so these
are the four files that you'll need to
include from the github repository so go
ahead and just download the zip so hit
this file here and you're going to need
to copy over class dot PHP mailer dot
PHP class dot pop3 PHP class dot SMTP
dot PHP and the PHP mailer autoloader so
we're going to be including this inside
of our contact dot PHP file so we can
actually send email so that's pretty
much our directory structure let's go
ahead and start to actually write out
the code that we need to actually send
some email so the first thing that I'm
going to do is obviously open a PHP tag
here and I'm going to start sessions now
the reason I want to start sessions is
because we're going to be transferring
the information that's been submitted
into this form and posted to this file
back again
so things like errors or old form data
so we start the session and obviously we
need to include our PHP mailer autoload
that I've just spoken about so let's go
ahead and require this in and that's in
libs PHP mailer PHP mailer autoload dot
PHP so that's now included let's just go
ahead and submit this form and then we
see weird transfer through to contact
PHP and if we just inspect the page and
open up our Network tab you can see that
when I hit Send here we see we've loaded
contact PHP and the method here is post
that's included in our form just here so
method of post and we can actually see
the data that's been sent through so if
we just scroll down here you can see
we've got form data name email a message
so it's quite good to know that you can
inspect things like that so let's get
rid of that for now because we don't
really need that we know that including
our PHP mailer has been okay let's
create an array here now this is going
to store all of our errors so I've
called this errors you may instead of
using an array literal you may actually
need to use the array like this so
define an array like this depending on
what which version of PHP you're using
but this is an array literal and I'm
going to be using them throughout the
video so what we now need to do is
create a quick if statement to check if
the name email a message that we just
saw posted through our set so that
doesn't mean that they have any content
in them it just means are they set have
they been posted through to this page
and we access posted variables using the
post superglobal so everything within
everything that's been submitted through
to the page via post request will be
within here so we can actually test this
out if you are unsure of how this works
we can actually just do a print art on
the post superglobal and we can actually
see what happens here so I could enter
anything here really so I'll just enter
a few bits and bobs and hit Send and you
can see that we've got an array now
we've got name email a message and they
all have the data that I've submitted
through so now that we know that works
we can do an is set and
you can come and separate this we don't
need to use it multiple times so you can
say is set name email a message and
that's it
so if that is set ie the user hasn't
just landed on the page and not
submitted anything let's just echo all
set so let's check out how this what
this looks like so if I hit Send we know
that that's going to work because I'm
using the form to submit through however
if we just reload the contact page on
its own that doesn't work so what we do
need to do here is include and else and
we're going to append tell me our errors
now we'll be looking more at this in a
moment so don't worry if this doesn't
make too much sense I'm just going to
write something went wrong okay so
obviously if this if this data is set we
want to do something a bit more useful
than output all set and what I'm going
to be doing here is I'm going to create
another array which is going to store
our fields in so let me just pull this
down we've got going to have key value
pairs here which is going to be name
which corresponds to the posted name I'm
going to have email which corresponds to
the posted email and last but not least
you'll probably have guessed it's the
posted message you might be thinking why
are we doing this this surely is over
complicating things by storing this an
array we can for each loop it and we're
going to be doing this because we want
to check if all of these are empty in
our case all of these fields are
required so all we need to do is having
them stored in here we can do a for each
which basically iterate over each item
of this array so we can say for each
fields as field data now field
corresponds to the key and data
corresponds to the value of this array
so in here we now have access to both of
them so we can do a quick if statement
and we use empty to check if a
particular values empty so if this ie
the data that's been posted through is
empty we can append on to this errors
array and obviously because we have the
name of the field we can actually use
this so I can
say the X field is required like so and
I can replace X so just concatenate on
here the field so let's just kill the
page here and let's do a print our on
errors and we'll stick some pre tags
there just so we can preserve the
formatting of this so when I hit Send
now you can see that we've got an array
filled up with the name field is
required the email field is required a
message field is required if I enter my
name hit send we only get two error
messages as we would expect so we've now
got a collection of errors that we can
actually send through to index.php then
inform is at the moment we're not
redirecting anywhere so right down here
I'm going to use the header function to
relocate us to index dot PHP this will
just redirect us back so at the moment
is now going to look like this I hit
Send and oops no we killed the page here
so let's get rid of that so if I submit
there we go we're literally just being
redirected back to index so because of
this we now need somewhere to store
these error messages that we've looped
through and added to as well as this one
is worth this one does exist so down
here what I'm going to do is I'm going
to use the session superglobal and I'm
going to store the errors in here so
that will store the array in there so
now I have access to this inside of
index.php as long as I've started
sessions here too so let me just open
and close a PHP tag at the top here
let's make sure we start sessions so we
can actually make use of these let's do
a print our on session errors now we'll
get an error initially maybe you might
not see one yeah we get an error
undefined index errors that's basically
because we haven't actually set any
errors yet although we did do all this
we've just added this line which means
that that index is set we'll be looking
at how we can deal with this in a clean
way in a moment but if I were to type in
something and leave the other two blank
you can see now that that will output
exactly what we saw a moment ago
so we're now sending that data through
to index.php and we can do something
with it so we can loop through and
output the errors as well as if we just
go ahead and land on contact PHP on its
own we get that something went wrong
error that we saw it what we added
earlier you'll notice that however many
times I refresh this page this data
persists we don't want that to happen
because the user could navigate away
from this come back to it and then
they'll find themselves with errors so
what we want to do is at the very bottom
of index dot PHP we want to say session
destroy and be really careful with this
because if you are using other sessions
on your website for example you're
logging a user in this is going to kill
the pay at kill them sessions so you may
want to use unset instead so you may
want to say unset session errors in fact
we'll stick with that solution just so
it's a little bit clearer so we run
setting these session errors so now what
happens is when i refresh it goes so I
for example into something we get our
errors and when i refresh they go okay
and we get our undefined index error so
now what we want to do is we want to
deal with old form data so let's say I'm
a user and I come along and I into my
name I interr well maybe don't enter my
email address and I say hello there blah
blah blah it's a really long message and
I hit Send we've now just lost all of
that data and hitting back sometimes
doesn't work so what we're going to do
here is we're going to preserve this
data so how do we do this well it's
quite simple all we need to do is also
sort store this information in their
session so we say fields equals fields
that's basically the data that we
gathered here so now inside of index we
should also have access to the old field
data so let's hit enter let's enter say
my name and hello there and hit send and
there we go so we've got hello their
name as well as the error so we don't
want to just print our on these it's
absolutely silly so what we want to do
is we want to create an errors variable
just up here now of course we could just
say
session errors and then we could loop
down here which we'll do in a minute but
it gives us the same error because this
isn't actually currently defined in the
session superglobal if we just do a
print our on session we should get an
empty let's just refresh here yet so we
don't have an errors key in there so
we're basically accessing this undefined
index okay so let's get rid of that we
can use a ternary operator here just to
do an is set check around this and then
we can say if it is set we want to
assign the same thing to that otherwise
we want to assign an empty array if this
confuses you don't worry it basically
just means we're setting something
inside of this errors variable if
session errors is set set this to this
or set this with this value otherwise
set an empty array and the reason we're
doing an empty array is because we're
going to use the empty language
construct in a minute down here so we
can do the same for field so we can
literally just duplicate this line and
we can change this over the fields
fields fields cool so we've now got that
and we should not see any errors perfect
so let's loop through the errors now
just so we can output them down here you
see I've got this div with a class of
panel and in here we can just put
anything we like now what I'm going to
do is I'm not going to show this panel
unless there are actually errors there's
no need so what we can do here is with
some shorthand syntax I'm going to say
if not empty errors if it is empty there
will be an empty array here which makes
sense so let's do an ENDIF on that and
let's just indent this so now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to use implode
which is a PHP function that takes an
array and it basically takes it out of a
ray form and joins it by a string so I'm
going to be doing a little trick that
just makes this a little bit shorter to
write but a little bit more difficult to
understand so we're going to have an
unordered list here
and it's going to have lists items so
that's basically how it's going to look
so will be this is an error obviously
don't we don't hard-code it like that
but let's just change that there so
that's eventually what it's going to
look like so if there are no errors we
want to output the first unordered list
and the last unordered list tag so we're
opening and closing this tag what we
then want to do is open and close an Li
as well you might be thinking why are we
doing this it doesn't make sense what
I'm going to do is I'm going to echo out
the value of the imploded errors array
and this is how we join by a string so
at the moment what this is going to show
us is it's going to show us all the
errors joined by a comma which is
absolutely fine if you wanted to do this
you could so you can see here we've got
one list item we've got the first error
and if we just zoom in you can see that
we've got this comma separated here so
this isn't what we want to do because we
want to have them each as list items so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
join by an endless item and a start list
item so what this means is we're
starting a list item will output the
first error then we'll close it then
we'll start a new list item and by the
time that we get to the last error we
automatically end this here so now you
can see that when I hit Send we get this
and if we just inspect this you can see
that the mark-up has been generated
exactly as we want it we've got an
unordered list containing three list
items so that's just a little handy way
to do things a little bit harder to
understand but it makes this a hell of a
lot shorter so now that we've outputted
our errors what about our old form data
well let's have a look at this so when
we submit through we have an attribute
called value so I could just write Alex
in here and when I hit refresh you can
see that fills it in so what we want to
do is we want to create this value
attribute if the field that we've
submitted through has data so what we're
going to do is we're going to do a
similar thing to checking if the errors
empty but what we're going to do here is
we're going to
echo out if the name field is set we
want to output something otherwise
output nothing
so this basically means if this field of
name exists up here in fields then we
want to output the value so we can just
enter value here and this could be
anything so I'll put it - blah now so
what's going to happen now is there we
are now the reason it's persisting is
because we haven't unset it down here
like we did with the errors again this
is the another reason why we need to
unset our data because otherwise it will
just persist so that should just go now
so now when I enter say Alex in here and
nothing in these two we get the errors
but we keep blah we obviously don't want
to keep block because we've hard-coded
that in so we want to change this and we
want to concatenate on fields name now
before I go on I'm going to talk a
little bit about security here what
we're allowing this to do is potentially
execute JavaScript code and so if I
enter Alex here
it's send this remains in here but
because this is user data that's now
being put onto the page we need to use
HTML entities just to prevent against
cross-site scripting or any other sort
of injection of JavaScript maybe with
the eval function or something like that
so let's take a quick look at the
security it's pretty important now
inside my main directory I'm going to
create a new folder called helpers you
can store this any way you want if
you're using a mini framework or
something so inside of helpers I'm going
to create a new file and I'm going to
save this as security dot PHP it could
be anything I mean this is just
somewhere to store it I'm going to
create a function called e for escape
and this is going to take in a string
now from this what we want to do is use
the HTML entities function to actually
escape this value so I'm going to return
the result of HTML entities if you're
not sure what HTML entities are for
example in in injecting JavaScript
probably use script tags like this now
this is a less than sign so it would be
converted to this which would just leave
it to be rendered on the page rather
than actually executed so play around
with this once you once you implement it
and you'll see what I mean
so we need to pass in the string to be
converted into eight entities we need to
provide the quotation flag so int quotes
will convert single and double quotes we
need to provide the character encoding
which is really important that you've
set the character encoding up here you
can see I've set the character set to
utf-8 to make sure you've done that and
let's take a look in here we also need
to then pass in false now basically the
last option is whether you want double
encoding by default it's on we just want
to turn that off so we've now got this e
function that we can include into
wherever we want really I mean this is
getting a little messy but we can you
can tidy this up depending on your your
website so I'm going to include in
helpers security PHP security and we now
have access to this 'if unction so let's
just take a look at how this works I'm
going to echo e script and we'll just
say alert one in there so let's take a
look at what this looks like there we go
so this is being rendered out onto the
page we can prove this by viewing the
page source and we can see that the
entities as I mention early have been
formed using the HTML entities function
so now what we can do is just really
really simply now that we've done that
is just wrap what we output like that
simple so let's copy and paste this just
so we don't waste too much time and we
can just paste this basically down to
the next field which is the email
address so we can say if the email
address is set output the email address
otherwise nothing for the message it's
slightly different because we don't have
a value attribute on a textarea element
so if we paste this in here all we need
to do is get rid of this here and we
want to change this to message and
change this to message so let's test
this out we'll test it out with each
field so I'm going to enter Alex there
hit Send and that stays I'm going to
enter an email address here and that
stays and I'm going to enter a message
here and that stays as well perfect so
now what we need to do is actually get
on to sending the email itself so under
contact dot PHP we can now make use of
our PHP mailer autoload so how do we do
this inside of our contact page well
after the for each we can now check
whether our errors are empty or not so
if we do a quick if statement here we
say if empty errors that basically means
there are no errors so we can just go
ahead and send the email so in here what
we need to do is we need to instantiate
PHP mailer so I'm going to create a
variable called em just for mail and
just because it's short sometimes you
see mail being written but M I just
prefer and we're going to create a new
PHP mailer instance now what we do now
is we set a variety of properties
through front through methods and and
obviously properties so for example we
want to use SMTP so I'm going to say is
SMTP that's a method and then I can say
M SMTP or equals true so we use SMTP
authentication now with regards to
sending email through SMTP it's the
preferred option there are services that
provide the ability to send email
threats on TP but I'm going to be using
Gmail settings this is perfectly fine to
use Gmail on a very small basis like a
contact form to send email so if you're
using Gmail you can follow along with
the same port numbers and everything
otherwise if you have another mail
provider go ahead and look up there SMTP
details and you can just replace them in
here so I'm going to say the host is
smtp.gmail.com that's the server and
we're going to say username now the
username in a gmail circumstance is just
your email address I'm going to enter
that
year and for the password that's
obviously going to be your password so I
love cats one and SMTP secure and this
can be TLS or SSL in my case it's going
to be SSL and we also now want to define
the port in this case it is not a string
it's 465
so we've now connected to well we
haven't set up the connection ready to
actually send the message at this point
we're not hitting Gmail server so to
debug this you can actually use M SMTP
debug and you can set that to one or two
depending on the level that you want to
debug out so if you are having any
problems do go ahead and use that
so what we're now going to do is set
things like the subject so again it's
just using a property equal to subject
and I'm just going to say contact form
submitted and we want to go ahead and
set the body now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to cram all of the users
details into the body we saw at the
start of the video how this looks in
Gmail when I received the email you
could set a reply to field but Gmail I
don't think supports this I might be
wrong but either way what I'm going to
do is just put this all into the body
and then we can do what we want with it
so I'm going to say from and that's
going to be the name so I'll call that X
in him want the email address that's
going to be called Y and then I want to
create a paragraph element and I want
this to be the message so I'm going to
call that Zed now in order to send
messages with HTML we need to say M is
HTML like that so we've now got from
let's just concatenate on these details
so we have fields name and then in here
we have fields email you can of course
use double quotes for this and then use
the curly brace syntax to include these
but I'm just keeping consistency so in
here we want fields message there we are
so that's our body sorted out you can go
and include an alt body as well which is
basically just a text plain text body
just if you want to now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to set a from name
otherwise Gmail will identify this as
root user so I'm going to specifically
define the from name and I'm just going
to say contact it can be anything you
want so as I mentioned earlier if your
if your mail provided does support it
you can use add reply to Gmail
unfortunately I think ignores the reply
too so when you hit the reply button
you'll be replying to yourself the email
address that you sent this from in this
case it's the same email address here so
you could do something like fields email
and fields name like that in my case it
doesn't work but go ahead and try out
for your mail solution so we now want to
add an address by sending this message
to because we haven't done that so far
don't confuse that with these details we
are using these details to connect to
our SMTP service we can send the email
but we're not adding an address so let's
do that now this is a method so we type
in the email address that we want this
to be sent to and then we type in the
name so I'm just gonna ex Kara so we've
now included all of our details it is a
little bit messy it's probably better to
use some kind of third-party solution
but if you're just sending email
normally on your website it doesn't
really matter too much
so inside an if statement here I'm going
to use the send method on PHP mailer
what this will do is it will send the
email and it will also return a boolean
true or false and it will tell you
whether the email has been sent
correctly so we can send use this in a
if statement now if the email has been
sent
I want to just redirect the user to
thanks PHP this could be anything I've
just included that as an example I
probably wouldn't recommend just having
a page dedicated to thanks you might
just want to redirect the user back to
the home page and put a little message
at the top or something like that
whatever you want to do otherwise we've
got an error so we can append to our
errors and we could say sorry could not
send email try again later
there we are so now we're pretty much
good to go let's test this out so I'm
going to have written anything wrong
this should all work so let's enter some
details here and by the way we don't
actually have email validation I'm going
to leave that for you to check out using
the filter var function you can include
that and then use the errors to actually
redirect the user and display the fact
that the email address isn't valid what
you could also do is maybe set this as a
type in here as a type of email and you
will get some front and validation but
obviously don't rely on this so I'm
going to type in the hello is my message
I hit Send and there we go so I can
assume that that works let's check out
the message that we should have got
through to our email client and there we
go we've got a message from contact
which we explicitly set
it's from Billy and then the email
address and then the text that was
entered here so let's just check out
what's going to happen if we enter some
incorrect details perhaps here or our
server can't be connected to so let's
just change the password like this and
let's go ahead and go back and submit
this again
there we go so we get the error as we
expected so that's basically how we
create a contact form with PHP very very
simple using just a Gmail SMTP account
to go ahead and send the email we've
included some security we've included
some validation as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
