sessions now this tutorials going to
cover a few aspects of PHP it's going to
cover an HTML form that will be
submitted checked whether for presence
of username and password it's going to
process this against a database I'm
going to show you how to set your
database up with your username and
password how to connect to your database
and also it's going to process a logout
function obviously we are using sessions
so your user will remain login until
they press the logout button ok so to
start with I'm going to create my HTML
form and then I'll take you through some
of the MySQL things that we are going to
set up ok so HTML form we're going to
have the action going to a page called
login dot PHP and we're keeping separate
pages to keep it simple and our method
is going to be post and its end our form
and start creating our input in perfect
pipe that's going to be a text and the
name of this is going to be username ok
and we'll break that and we'll say in
fact we can take this and all we need to
change here is this we're going to
create this as a password and this is
going to be called password the reason
we do this is because this will be
starred out and or circled out depending
on which operating system you are using
and finally we are creating a submit
button and the value of that is going to
be login ok so at the moment what we
have is we have let's refresh we have a
page here index table PHP with a
username a password and login button
which currently goes to a post that
doesn't exist now let's make it a bit
more user friendly just type out labels
in here and we have got it ok so now
what we're going to do is we're going to
create our login dot PHP pipe in fact
know what we'll do first is I want you
to open up PHP myadmin if you're using
an exam it will be installed by default
under local host forward slash PHP
myadmin if you haven't installed it i
suggest you google for
and install it copy over to your
localhost your web directory and you can
start using it from there so we run this
okay now basically what we're going to
do is we're going to create a new bit
new database so here create new database
and we're going to call this let's say
PHP now let's call it PHP login ok and
we click create ok right we can see it's
come up here and we're going to start
creating tables now if you're not too
familiar with SQL and we've got a basic
structure is a database stores tables
and tables store different rows and the
rows store your values so we're going to
have the name of this as users we're
going to have to say ok ah ok number of
fields now what I like to do is when I
create a new database I open up a
notepad and or a context document and I
note down every field that I'm going to
use so we're going to use ID for a start
we're going to use a username and a
password and there's nothing much else
we won at the moment and you can
obviously add a username or sorry a
first name a date of birth depending on
your program but for now we're using
these three so that is a total of three
fields let's go back onto here
that's three fields and that will create
that for us now we're faced with typing
in the field names we're going to have
ID we're going to make this an integer
and what we want is this is the primary
key and we want it as an auto increment
now what this will do is every time a
new record is created the ID value will
increment by one so for example the
first user that registers will have an
ID of 1 the second user that registers
will have an ID of 2 and so on and so
forth ok our next one is going to be
user name and our last one is going to
be password now these can be set as
varchars I'm going to
set that as 25 characters and the
password is 25 characters as well just
to be simple now there's nothing much
else you need to set for these so if we
go down quite a small screen here let's
say safe okay so once that saved right
you can come down and see this here you
can insert and values in which we're
going to do because we're testing I will
be doing some tutorials or we'll already
have some tutorials up on how to make a
user registration form so this would
remove the need for this at the moment
okay so the value of our ID we don't
need to put in it as it's auto increment
that will go to one straightaway our
user name I'm going to say Alex and my
password is going to be ABC okay I
wouldn't recommend you ever use that
password but there you go okay so my
username Alex password ABC shouldn't
have trouble remembering that click go
and that's already been stored to browse
you can just click the Browse tab let's
go down and we've got username and
password as Alex ABC and like I said ID
has been set to one already okay so what
we need to do now is we're going to
create our our login dot PHP page let's
save this how quickly as login dot PHP
okay so we're working with this now
obviously we create our PHP tags and we
need to take into account some post
variables as in the index we use the
method as post so what we'll be doing is
we'll be setting our username as dollar
sign underscore post and the name of the
variable which is username which is
found here and our password is going to
equal a post value and that will be
password
okay so first of all what we need to do
is check that they've entered both the
username and the password because we're
not going to start validating the form
it's completely unnecessary unless we
know that the user has typed both of
these fields in so I'm going to say is
I'm going to create my if statement and
this is going to quite be achill the
code that I'm going to require after
this has been checked it's going to go
in here so what I'm going to do is going
to say if username remember username on
its own is a valid true and condition it
will this will equal this will be equal
to true and we're going to say and
password so require the user name and
the password this to be true and to
execute this block of code here so what
we're going to write in here now we need
to connect to our database so to do this
what we basically need to write is what
we need to do is say create a variable
called connect and that's going to be
equal to MySQL connect
and inside this we're going to have our
first first parameter is going to be our
host that is localhost for me the second
is going to be the username I'm using
root and the password I believe for me
may be nothing but I'll check that in a
minute after this we can say or die and
then what we can do is give an error
message so for example couldn't connect
so if this in fact isn't my password I
think it might be something else but
I'll give it a go in a minute then we're
going to say couldn't connect okay now
we need to select our table to our
database I'm going to say MySQL select
dB that's a another built-in function as
long as you have the PHP module
installed this does come with xampp so
if you're using xampp you should have a
problem and for this I'm going to say I
think we've called it let's have a look
PHP login so PHP login so assuming this
is all okay and I can add an error
message here as well hidden
find DV okay so let's refresh our page
first of all we're logging we'll click
login now nothing's happened and let's
just edit our if statement I'm going to
say else echo or rather the best
function is died on its own this will
just stop executing anything after this
point after this function is called and
it will also pass a parameter of a
message of your choice so here I'm going
to say please enter a user name and a
password okay so here refresh this will
resend the data and we've got this error
message so I'm going to type Alex and 1
2 3 or ABC so let's login ok nothing's
happened we've got no error messages
that means I've obviously connected ok
to my database and I'm going to start
this tutorial here because I've run over
a bit of time and in the next one I'm
going to find what you're going to find
out how to connect to your database and
we're going to check the user name and
password
