you work with laravel pagination this
will generate for you a very specific
markup with specific classes and this
really is for Twitter bootstrap it works
with other front-end frameworks as well
but of course at some point you might
want to change the way this markup is
rendered now the approach in laravel 5
is that it uses presenters rather than
actual views to go ahead and render the
pagination so what we're gonna look at
is creating our own custom presenter and
that will allow us to control pretty
much everything about how the mark-up is
generated so just to start with then I
have a post model already set up so this
is just hooking up to my database table
and I just have a database table here
called posts with about 100 records in
so over in my routes file then you can
see that all I'm doing is just as an
example here I have a route with the URI
forward slash posts I'm just grabbing
the post model and I'm paginating and
I'm placing 5 for each page so I want
this to be split up so pretty
straightforward stuff and you probably
already know all of this so what I'm
going to do then is just create a view
so let's create a view under say a posts
directory and we'll just call this index
blade PHP and under this we are just
going to we're not really going to work
with templating or anything like that
just going to create a very basic layout
here so inside of here then we would
have something like if posts count and
we want to go ahead and just iterate
through these so for each post as post
and then we just end that for each so in
here we can just put this in h4 it
doesn't really matter what we do for now
so post title ok so in that case then
outside of this loop we would obviously
want to render the pagination so we do
this just by saying posts render like so
so let's just return this view here so
let's
turn host stock index and we'll just say
with posts and we'll pass them posts in
and we see the following so obviously at
the moment this isn't displaying
properly we need to go ahead and pull
bootstrap into our project so if we just
head over to the bootstrap site and go
ahead and hit download let's go ahead
and just pull this in so over now
template here just pop that in there
simple okay so now that that's done we
can refresh here and you see we get a
nicely styled pagination but of course
you've come here because you want this
to change so how do we actually do this
well to kind of understand how this
works
we need to look at what is actually
created when we use the paginate method
well to do this we can just get the
class of posts and we'll see exactly
what this is
it's a length aware paginate ER so we
know that if we go and look at this we
should have a render method so this is
what we call in our template just down
here so our length we're paginate then
returns if we don't give it a presenter
a bootstrap 3 presenter so we can go and
open this up and see what this looks
like so in here we have a couple of
traits which we'll look at in a moment
we have a paginating instance that's
passed into this we have URL window as
well which we'll look at in a little bit
later and we have a few methods in here
as well and notice that this implements
the presenter contract so we can go and
have a look at the presenter contract
and see what we have in here and if we
just open up pagination presenter so
we've got a render method we've got a
has pages method so our goal then is to
crown own presenter implement the
presenter contract and then we basically
want to just copy a lot of what's done
here we can even copy the entire class
and I don't see anything wrong with
doing that there are other ways that we
can get around this but to be honest
this is the best way in terms of just
having complete control so why don't we
just create our presenter let's just
start to do this and I'm going to create
a pagination folder within my app
directory and in here let's just call
this custom
presenter so obviously this is
namespaced
under app or whatever your namespace is
your then the namespace and it's under
pagination so this is a custom presenter
and of course like I said we want to go
and implement this presenter contract so
you can go and grab this just from here
we can pop it up here and then we can
implement that okay so obviously at the
moment we have our presenter we haven't
put anything in there yet we need to go
ahead and put them two methods in but
how do we actually use this well we're
going to look at a slightly different
technique rather than use the render
method and pass this presenter in we're
going to return a view so we're gonna
have a view that will then use this
presenter passing in our post model and
then it will render the results that my
name makes sense at the moment but we'll
take a look at how this works so inside
of our bootstrap 3 presenter we know
that this extends our present a contract
so pagination presenter and of course we
have a render and has pages method so
before we do any of that we want to
basically take a constructor here and
use it in here as well and the reason
for this is we're going to pass in our
paginate in to our presenter now
remember our paginate is essentially
just that posts variable because that is
now a length aware paginate err so
there's a couple of things here we need
to sort out for example your our window
that is within illuminate pagination so
all we need to do is up here say use
your window and I think that's about it
for now we have a paginate contract as
well here so we can just copy this
across just here okay so this is done
let's implement the methods we need to
do so it's a render method and it has
pages method so let's take a look at our
bootstrap 3 presenter and see what this
does so here it says if this has pages
then we want to basically return new
HTML string which
just a way of taking this and generating
some HTML we can even take a look at
this in here so it's under laravel
support and we have things like to HTML
etc so we need to pretty much do this so
we're gonna actually just go and take
this over here and then for has pages
we'll see we just take a look at that
inside of our bootstrap presenter it
just returns the pagination we've passed
in whether it actually has any pages so
these are the only two we actually need
to get going just for now this will fail
because we don't have these methods
either in at rate or within this class
so we'll look at how we deal with this
in a moment and the kind of levels you
can go to customize this so now that
we've got this done let's just start to
think about the kind of implementation
so over in my index file here rather
than use the render method I want to
include a view and I'm going to stick my
custom pagination into here now this is
an a view to actually build up your
pagination it's just to go ahead and
render it and I prefer this method of
course there are other methods of doing
this but it's entirely up to you this is
just how I prefer to do things so I'm
going to call this custom blade of PHP
and inside of here all I want to do is
create say a pagination wrapper so that
might be useful I don't have to keep
doing that on every page and then in
here with that new presenter I want to
pass in the posts or you know obviously
this is reusable so it could be anything
it could be users or topics whatever so
here let's just say new app pagination
custom presenter and we want to pass in
the paginate err so paginate or okay so
from this then we want to render because
our custom paginate err or custom
presenter rather has that render method
so we now have this markup here and this
will give us what we need but we need to
go and include it from over here
so in here rather than use our render
method
it's include pagination custom and then
we'll pass in our paginate err and that
is our posts so we have this let's just
go and check this page out we may have
spelt something wrong so app pagination
custom presenter let's just take a look
in here yeah a written customer
presenter okay so there we go this is
fine so now we have class app pagination
HTML string not found that's fine
because we know that inside of our
bootstrap presenter under our render
method we're using HTML string and of
course this is under illuminate support
HTML string so over on our custom
presenter we can just go and use that at
the top pretty straightforward so now we
start to get to the place where these
methods aren't actually defined so let's
just take a moment just to explore how
this works and what we might need to
pull over into our custom presenter so
get previous button where is this being
called from well it's being called from
here
so let's while we're doing this just
refer let's close everything else off to
our bootstrap presenter so in here let's
search for a get previous and it can't
be found so we can't find this get
previous button method in here well
that's because it comes from our
bootstrap 3 next previous button render
a trait so quite a mouthful
but if we go and open this we can see we
have get previous button and we have get
next button now it's entirely up to you
whether you want to actually copy these
two methods over or just simply use the
trait or even create your own trait the
reason I'm not going to create my own
trait because this does everything I
need it to do however I have the option
here to pass through what I want for the
next and previous buttons so at the
moment these are just arrows these
double arrows but in our case we can
just go ahead and modify them so what
I'm going to do is much like within the
bootstrap 3 presenter I'm going to use
this trait so it's under illuminate
pagination so in our custom presenter we
can say use illuminate
pagination pull this in and go ahead and
use it on this class like so and while
we're at it we might as well add our
paginate er and our window methods so
now we see get disabled text wrapper so
disabled text is just anything that we
can't click within our pagination again
let's head over to our bootstrap 3
presenter and search for get disabled
text wrapper and it is in fact here so
it's safe to say we can go ahead and
just pull this across so let's pull this
across down here there we go so now we
have a get links method that isn't found
again let's have a look for in here and
you can see we can't find it and we know
it's not within this tray it's actually
now within this URL window presenter
trait so let's have a look inside of
here and here is get links this is just
how everything is built up for us so we
want to go ahead and use this trait as
well so again if we come over to our
custom presenter use illuminate
pagination pull in that trait and go
ahead and use that as well so now we
just have a couple method so get active
page wrapper that's pretty
straightforward it's just the wrapper
for the page that the user is currently
on so let's go and search for this in
here and there it is so let's pull this
over as well
there we go and again we have get
available page wrapper so this is just
the wrapper for each of the pages that
are available so let's go and pull this
in as well and put this down here and we
have get dots as well so get dots that's
again pretty straightforward and this
actually calls but get disabled text
wrapper method because obviously the
dots in between if you have lots of
pages you're not gonna want to click on
them there's nothing to click on there
so let's paste that in as well so now
we're at the state where we're using our
custom presenter but it looks exactly
the same obviously because we've just
pulled over what we need so here we can
just start to play around with things
the first thing I want to do is just
give an example of showing all of these
available pages but without the dot so
this kind of gets you into the mindset
of how can I change this to exactly what
I need so if we look at this URL window
klass here you can see that down here
when we make an instance of this like
we're doing in our custom presenter we
have the ability to pass in on each side
so on each side will just tell us how
many on each side we want to generate
how many links we want to generate so in
our case what we want to do is just
simply use something like PHP int max
you don't have to do this you can just
give a large number but this will just
ensure that we always have all of the
links that we need so this is probably a
rare case you might not want to always
show all the pages but if you do and
you're styling this another some other
really nice way then you know how to do
that now so let's go ahead and just get
rid of that for now but at least you
know how to do that and why that works
now we're gonna look at separating for
example the next and the previous
buttons so you can see here that we
start off with this render method and as
long as we have pages we generate the
pagination so in our case we have get
previous button oh I think we've kind of
forgot to talk about this as well so I
did mention that if I were to pass in
some text to this it would actually
change so at the moment we've got these
horrible text icons here and if we
wanted to down here for the previous
button we could say previous and for the
next button we could say next if we
wanted to and that goes ahead and
changes everything for us so it might be
that you want to do something as simple
as that and that's absolutely fine you
can go ahead and do that so what happens
for example we wanted to split up the
previous button the next button the
links so we wanted a previous button say
to float to the left in some container
the next to float all the way to the end
and these to be maybe centered we're not
going to go too much into this because
obviously your specifications will be
different how you want to style this but
let's take a little go at doing this now
so obviously here we're using s printf
all this is doing is it's taking this
it's placing the previous button here
it's placing the links here and it's
placing the next button here so we could
just modify this here so let's say you
had some kind of div with a class here
of pagination rather than that Arnold
List and of course what we did is under
our pagination here we gave this class
here so we can even just get rid of that
and have that in here it's entirely up
to you how you work this and we may have
within here some kind of div with a left
float for example we then might have the
pagination sitting in between and then
we might have another div with a class
of right and all we need to do here is
just place in our string placeholders to
be replaced by s printf of course you
can manually concatenate these in as
well if you wanted to so this looks a
bit odd obviously but obviously what we
have now is we have up here a left
floating element we have our pagination
in here which currently still has items
so what we could do is in here just say
items and then down here we could say
well we don't want these to be list
items anymore maybe we just want these
to be spans or you know whatever you are
doing with this obviously this entirely
depends on how you want everything to
look so we can get rid of the list items
we have our anchors here as normal and
now we have something like this so we
have our previous which is now separated
we have our items which are now
separated and our next button which is
now separated and of course these work
in exactly the same way if we want to go
to page nine or whatever works perfectly
and we can go next next next as well so
we're not going to take this too much
further because you already have
everything now set up to go ahead and
create your own custom presenter for
pagination and what's really great about
this is what you could technically do is
create one custom presenter and you
could create lots of different
variations and just extend your custom
presenter and this would work quite
nicely I suppose you could just go and
over in your custom pagination view
folder you could just create another one
with a different presenter here so you
might have a simple presenter you might
have a vertical presenter I don't know
it really depends but you now have the
flexibility to go ahead and create your
own pagination within laravel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
