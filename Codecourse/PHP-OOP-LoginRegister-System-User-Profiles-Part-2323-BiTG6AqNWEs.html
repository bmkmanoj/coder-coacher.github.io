page that's going to allow us to display
profile information of whatever user
that's that's currently registered in
the system so again this is going to be
straightforward because we already have
the ability or we already have the
functionality that we require to output
profile information depending on what or
user we've chosen so let's go ahead and
get straight into writing the code on
our profile PHP page so I'm going to
require in core four slash init dot PHP
so our initialization file and let's go
ahead while we're at it and just update
the link on the the home page of this of
this site to profile PHP user equals and
then we're going to output our our
username so we can basically just copy
and paste this output here to there so
what we now get is when we're on the
home page we can click our own username
we redirected to profile PHP and the
query string the key here is user and
the value is Alex so what we want to do
is output the user's full name on the
page now if the user doesn't exist we
want to generate a for at forever which
we've already dealt with in our redirect
class that we created and we have a the
ability parson numeric for it for and
that generate an error so the first
thing we want to do is check if we don't
have a user name supplied so we're going
to say if not username equals input get
user then we want to redirect to index
dot PHP now we're setting this at the
same time so we now have access to this
username variable so let's just go ahead
an echo username onto the page and so
what we can now do is is just see
anything that we apply here so doesn't
matter whether the user exists or not it
just looks the same so what we now only
want to do is check if this user
actually
lists or not so let's create a user
variable say new user and pass through
the username now let's just refer back
to our user class when we construct we
have a user here and what we want to do
is we want to if this this does exist we
are checking or we're making a check for
this using the find method the find
method checks if it's numeric or not so
if it's a user name there's a string it
will it will find this in by username so
we're now grabbing a user by username
and we can actually check if this exists
or not so we can say if it doesn't exist
so if user exists so if it doesn't exist
we want to redirect to a 404 otherwise
we'll just output exists so let's take a
look at what this looks like so if i
refresh it says exists because the user
Alex does actually exist let's just type
in here actually exists and type in
someone that doesn't exist and it says
oops that page cannot be found so we're
still staying on the same page not
redirecting anywhere we just generate a
404 error in the browser and outputting
our data so now that we know that we
have a data user that does exist we're
going to set data equal to user data
using the user data method here which
remember just basically returns the data
that we've stored once we've you know
found the user information so now what
we can do from this is we can just
basically come down here
and start to output some data so I'm
going to create an h3 element and I'm
going to echo the escaped value of data
username and then here the paragraph I'm
just going to say full name and again
I'm going to echo using the escape
function data name and that's it so now
when we refresh the page here obviously
we're on Pali at the moment because tab
Alex
it says Alex here and the full name Alex
Garrett and the same with the other
users that we have in our database as
well bill so that's really as simple as
it is you could use
htaccess file and use your rel rewriting
to perhaps do something like the ability
to provide like that but you know that's
something to look at look up and try but
for now we've basically got down the
core functionality you can make the the
profile page look however you want but
the main point here is that we have all
the functionality we need we've just
utilized what we've already written and
we then have access to user profile
information so that's how we recreate
user profiles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
