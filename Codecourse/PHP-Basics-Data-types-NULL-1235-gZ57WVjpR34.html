already but there's one you may see a
lot and that is null now it's usually
written in all uppercase or lowercase
like this so it's null or null in all
uppercase
now null represents a variable with no
value now null happens when a variable
is assigned the value null or it's been
unset or simply hasn't been set a value
so let's take a look at each of these
scenarios so we can better understand
when we might see null and how we deal
with it so let's create again let's go
back to basics and create a named
variable and assign it the value null
now we can either do this in all
lowercase or we can do it in all
uppercase but again if you are using the
value null to set a initial value make
sure you keep consistency either always
a lowercase or always uppercase so let's
do a var dump on name and we can go over
to the browser and see what we get so
you can see we have null simple as that
now you might be wondering why would we
even do this well in this case what
we're saying is we want to set a
variable called name but we're not quite
sure what the value will be yet now
later on in our code we might have some
kind of condition that allows us to set
a value to name maybe based on the
resolve an if statement which we briefly
looked at earlier so setting a default
value like this is quite often very
helpful since we know that somewhere in
our Cobra are eventually going to update
this value putting it at the top here or
somewhere we'll just say we are gonna
set this but we don't quite know what
the value will be just yet so if we did
want to update this later on in our code
we could simply go ahead and overwrite
it as we've already seen this will just
update the value and then we get out a
string so the reason that we do actually
assign this null value is we can't do
something like this or we can't do the
following it just won't work we'll see
an error and if we go ahead and declare
say a name variable without setting
anything it just doesn't work so what we
need to do here then
take a look at what happens when we try
and var dump something that just simply
does not exist so let's say H let's give
that a refresh and you can see we get
pretty much the same result undefined
variable age not only do we see an error
here or a notice here we actually still
see a null value so if you are trying to
access a variable that doesn't exist
hasn't been set anything it will by
default be a null value so lastly but
kind of less importantly you won't see
this too often is if you did have a
variable set like this so Alex and you
were to use the PHP unset function on
that variable this will go ahead and set
it to null and it will basically just
unset this so we can't really use it so
let's go ahead and just test this out so
let's echo out name give that a refresh
we see Alex
now let's unset it and go ahead an echo
out name we see we get an undefined
variable because we've unset it if we do
a var dump on name not only we will see
that warning we will also see the value
null so if you see the value null
anywhere it's usually been set prior to
something being overwritten but if you
do see null along with a notice like
this you know that essentially you're
trying to access some kind of value or
some kind of variable that just hasn't
been set and doesn't exist now in this
case there's not really any reason to
unset a variable if you did want to
clear this what you could do is later on
in your code go ahead and explicitly set
that to null that would mean that this
variable does exist we won't see the
notice that we saw just here however we
will see a null value so it's best
practice if you want to kind of clear
something out to go ahead and set it to
null either way that should give you a
good ground as to what null is you will
see this a lot while you're working with
PHP but now at least you know what it is
and how it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
