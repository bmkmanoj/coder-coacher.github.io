once again I am excited to make this
video for you it is a really great one
AHA I now you should all be familiar
with using SAS for pre-processing CSS if
you're not that's okay check out this
video here to learn about what
pre-processing is and check out this
video here to learn about how I use my
favorite preprocessor sass and and also
check out this video here it's called
Gangnam style to watch it for the first
time because it's obvious that you've
been living under a rock for the past
three years I'll just play it but for
the rest of you I have got an awesome
video that's gonna flippin blow your
minds today I'll be showing you bourbon
and very exciting I have Kyle Fiedler
here from thoughtbot the makers of
bourbon to talk to us about it after
which I'll be stepping us through
getting set up and started with these
awesome tools so say hello to Kyle okay
hey thank you so much for joining us
here on def tips and we're looking today
we're looking at bourbon and a lot of
the products that go along with it
bitters and refills and neat so why
don't you tell me a little bit about
what your relationship is to these
products and and who else is really
involved with this yeah here does a
really great job yeah basically that
grew out of a need for designers and we
were all kind of creating our own
mix-ins and it stands for each project
and they are loosely based off of css3
stuff that was getting really popular as
Carly probably about three years and so
each project has its own set and so we
kind of Phil did a great job
consolidating them and then it's grown
from there so can you describe for
somebody who's never used it or seen
that like really quickly like what it is
and why they should use it it's a small
library mix-ins and functions
to help you get started on projects
these are all mix-ins and functions that
we've found really helpful
basically counteract a lot of the like
the css3 stuff that hasn't been totally
implemented like right now we're doing
flexbox which hasn't been totally
implemented or has implemented different
ways in different browsers yeah though
we have mix ins to kind of help
alleviate writing multiple lines of CSS
so how does bourbon compare with
something like compass so compass is a
lot bigger than bourbon when we started
out compass was was already open source
we just felt that there was a lot in
compass that we didn't really use on
everyday on projects and we wanted to
keep bourbon really small really compact
make sure that it's stuff that you're
going to use on almost every single
project so that was the whole thinking
behind it we've tried to keep it small
so that like there's certainly a need
for bourbon and there's certainly a need
for people who use compass so I like to
think that was there more partners and
growing the sass community so they serve
different different needs
now that's bourbon kind of like a
foundation for all of these other
extensions of bourbon can you go is to
walk us through the other ones neat
refills and neat of bitters and refills
yeah sure so neat came out of our
frustration with taking over bootstrap
sites so I like either wireframes or
something that was done with bootstrap
and I look at the CSS or the HTML really
and the classes are all jangled in there
and I have like a real passion for
naming things semantically not like grid
3 yeah I think we don't know I think we
kind of grew up in the same school like
write it right after you know the the
pica or the turn of the Semantic Web and
if you kind of
came up during that era that's gonna
mean a lot to you so I so yeah it's
definitely cringe-worthy when you see
like like the uber divs and multiple
classes on some type of frameworks so
definitely grew out of our frustration
with that go in and remove it and at the
time I wrote two functions that were in
bourbon one was a grid like a static
grid and then I later built a flexible
grid based off of that when responsive
design started to become popular and so
I wrote those and those were great for
me but every time I talked but I don't
really get it and so what we did with
Nene was we made those simple functions
into a whole grid system so that is
really flexible you can name your your
classes whatever you need to you don't
have to have these wrapping row classes
if you don't need them it's it's like
it's a grid system for people who don't
like grid systems don't like grid
libraries would you agree with the idea
that it moves the grid out of the
mark-up and into your style sheets
yeah exactly for people like so I wanted
it easy enough for developers who would
like to bootstrap the idea of bootstrap
just throwing in class into the HTML
mm-hmm so simple enough for them to do
the same thing with the CSS but then you
know complex enough so that at me as a
designer I didn't have to use like a 960
grid system so I wasn't fixed to a
certain grid maybe you can go into neat
and change the gunner's spacing the max
width like almost anything you can
change and make it your own go through
the cool so that it's not you're not
fixed into this certain type
would that come in a workflow before or
after bidders in your in like you're in
your compiled bidders is so consulting
agency we build a lot of web apps and
it's come out of we used to have what
was called which are basically a base
style sheet so that as soon as you
started a new project it wouldn't look
like you wouldn't have times new roman'
all over the place and he's really janky
like classmen but we found like over
time that was growing really stale and
we were overriding a lot of it so like
we'd have these Flutie styles and then
we'd override them in CSS later and that
is extra scruffed that we don't lock in
the application so bitter is the idea
behind bitters is mostly those same
styles or the same idea behind those
styles so that you know once you start a
project you throw bitters in there and
it gives you a nice-looking site right
from the start but instead it's sitting
in a gem somewhere or somewhere where
you can't touch it you you actually
throw it into your project files and it
helps you get started faster so it has
things like a variables folder or file
extends folder with where you can dump
all your extends same thing with mix-ins
it gives you based typography forms and
stuff like that and the nice thing about
it is so you throw it into your your own
project your new project and you can
like rip things out make it your own
and basically it becomes the start in a
great starting point yeah and now I was
looking through the commit history of a
lot of the the products we're talking
about right now and it looks like
bitters is your baby is that is that
right yeah it has yeah you have the most
commits out of like by far in bitters
that's awesome and the the website the
the you know the front-facing gh-pages
websites for each of these are like
really nice and easy to understand as
well so I'll link to those down in the
descriptions below for everybody
watching
and then what's what is refills so we've
gotten to the point where a lot of
people are coming to us and asking like
they see what's happening with
Foundation and bootstrap and they see
all these like components that are
priests pre-made like a lot of
developers who are coming to these is
preset you know frameworks are looking
for these pre-made components so they
can just kind of plug it in and go and
essentially that's what refillz is is a
bunch of components that you can copy
and paste code to and have like a header
nav bar or a main featured area or you
know a section of three featured areas a
drop-down or breadcrumbs and it's
basically this styled so that it looks
really nice but minimally styled so that
it's somewhat easy to kind of rebrand it
or redesign it so that it looks great
for your site right so would you say
that the refills are what they evolved
as a competitor to the components of
bootstrap and foundation yeah I'd like
to think that they'll they'll start to
be like we're having we're taking a
different approach to both bootstrap and
foundation where it like they include
everything and we want you to like
include only include the things that you
want so like if you want you know you
start off with bourbon if you need a
grid layout
you couldn't need if you if you're
starting out on a project you use
bitters
if you need these components you copy
and paste the ones that you need instead
of just having all of them yeah so one
thing that was like when I was exploring
it for myself I kind of got got my head
around this eventually but bourbon neat
and bitter sorry yes bitters are all
things that you install like that
they're they're defined packages you put
the directories where they should go and
link them all in and then your you can
use them whereas the refills are
are these components where you go to
your your website and cut and paste the
the markup and the styles and if need be
the JavaScript and you can use them one
by one you feel like cut and paste each
one that you want being selective about
it but yeah I thought that was really
interesting is as opposed to and I guess
this gets back to what you were saying
initially that the the weight or just
not maybe not the page weight but the
cumbersome nest is that word comes from
this the yeah like like the cumbersome
nests of something like the bootstrap or
foundation wherein all of these things
are included from the get-go unless you
say otherwise yep awesome okay so I
think that's that's going to be it for
this little little interview I'm really
I'm so grateful that I have you here to
discuss this I think it'll make
understanding and appreciating the work
that you guys have thought that
thoughtbot have done go a lot further to
the people who watch this video so thank
you so much stuff does yeah excellent
all right well this concludes this
segment of the the video and now we're
gonna go look at how to use these tools
that we've just discussed here with Kyle
Kyle thank you so much take care of men
yep thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
