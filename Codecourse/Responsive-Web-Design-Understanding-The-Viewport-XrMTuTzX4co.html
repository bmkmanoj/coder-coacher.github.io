design is understanding idea of a
viewport the viewport is what determines
the size of the HTML element and what's
exactly as you'd expect on a desktop
browser so as you can see as I resize
the window here the page is responding
that's because of on a desktop browser
the viewport is the window you can see
at the smaller width here and the page
is still responding quite nicely to the
size of the window so you'd expect that
when we look at this on a mobile browser
we'd get a nice-looking layout so let's
have a look and oh so we're not getting
this nice layout that we've got over
here we're getting really small text
quite a difficult page to read so why is
this happening well over here on the
desktop browser what we're resizing when
we resize the browser window is what's
called the layout viewport on a mobile
you can't change the size of the window
and actually you can't change the size
of the layout viewport the only way you
can change the size of the layout
viewport on the mobile is by changing
the orientation and that doesn't
actually work in all cases and we'll
talk more about that later on
so the viewport that mobiles manipulate
is called the visual viewport and that's
just the part of the page that the user
is looking at at the moment and the
visual viewport is kind of a window
through which we look at the layout
viewport so the layout viewport never
moves and that's where the content
really lives so let's look at a quick
diagram of this so you can see here we
have our layout viewport and then our
visual viewport can scale and pan freely
within the layout viewport if we want to
zoom in we make the visual viewport
smaller to focus on a smaller area of
the layout viewport if you want to zoom
out we make the visual viewport larger
to focus on a big area of the layout
viewport but we never actually directly
affect the layout viewport it always
stays in the same place so if the user
can't control the layout viewport how do
we know what size it is this differs
from browser to browser but commonly
you'll find that the mobile browser will
have a layout
report of 982 pixels with the layout
viewport 980 pixels wide we need to make
the visual viewport very big to fit that
in so we get a very small look we're
very zoomed out that's why we get that
effect we had over here so this is quite
annoying and ideally what we want is to
be able to control the size of the
viewport and we can so I'm going to jump
into sublime text and this is the page
that you were looking at on the browser
and on the browser so I've hidden the
body here because it's just a bunch of
really stupid filler text it's really
riveting stuff so the way we control the
viewport is through the use of a meta
tag and I'll show you that now so say
meta we give it a name of viewport so it
knows what we're talking about and we
give it a content if I can spell content
of width and we can define the width
that we want to give it so let's give it
a width of 400 pixels making sure to
close that tag and then let's look at it
again on our mobile browser and you can
see now it's much more suited to the
mobile device we're definitely not
zoomed out so much although ideally what
we'd want is to have no zoom at all so
to do that we we need to make sure that
the layout viewport was the same size as
the device so how can we do that well
there's actually a keyword that we can
use in here we just say width equals
device - width and then then if we look
at it it's going to look quite similar
but you can see it's a width that's more
suited to this device there is still a
slight problem here in that when we turn
our device sideways
we haven't recalculating the viewport so
we're not take making use of this extra
horizontal space what we've done is
we've just zoomed in and again we don't
want any zoom at all until the user
decides to zoom so to make use of this
extra horizontal space we're going to
force this
of no zoom and so instead of giving the
viewport and explicit width we can give
the viewport an explicit scale so we can
say initial scale equals one so that's
just a one-to-one scale and then if we
refresh that now you'll see that we've
made use of the extra horizontal space
and the layout viewport is recalculated
when we change the orientation of the
device and you find that this for the
most part will work just fine on its own
and it will have brilliant results but
in practice it is best to use the
explicit width as well of width
device-width and and use of both and
then it's a little bit more cross
browser compatible and that won't affect
the behavior on the orientation change
so you're still going to get that nice
recalculation on there so this is the
great line and it will make your
websites look much better on mobile
devices unfortunately that's not the end
of the story so this line is not really
standardized anywhere it's something
that Apple introduced a few years ago
and like loads of people followed them
and so now like most browsers you see
are going to support this line but
there's actually an emerging standard
that lets you do a similar thing but
within your style sheets
it's called CSS device adaptation very
fancily and yes I say unless you do the
exact same thing but within your style
sheets so the way it looks is like this
so you have art viewport you have a bit
curly braces and you have very similar
things to what you have here so you have
width device-width and then instead of
initial scale we just say zoom is 1 and
that's it
so at the moment this isn't very widely
supported but in some browsers there
certainly
a certain case in ie10 where you do need
this declaration so if you are
interested in the best possible cross
browser compatibility then this is
something that it doesn't hurt to
include but it's not that important at
the moment because it's still very new
and it's not very widely supported you
will still want to use your browser
prepare your vendor prefix history so
ms4 for Microsoft and - OH - for opera
and they're the only two that support it
at the moment so that will do just fine
that's it really so now the viewport is
under your control and your mobile
websites will look just great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
