series for beginners in this first video
we're going to simply be installing the
Java development kit and the development
environment so we can actually program
in Java so the first thing we're going
to do is head over to google and type in
JDK for Java development kit and we can
go ahead and click the very first link
here you should land on the official
Oracle website and what we're going to
do we're going to download this one hit
the JDK and whatever current version it
may be at the time of viewing this and
then NetBeans also whatever version it
may be so we should land on this page
here you can accept the license
agreement and then now you need to pick
the correct version of Java for your
operating system I have a 64-bit windows
computer that means I choose this one
the x 86 is for 32-bit systems so just
make sure you select the correct one for
your computer I'll select this one here
then you can download it I've already
got it downloaded so once you've
downloaded it you can bring up the
Installer here it may take a couple of
minutes to initialize the installation
that's what happened for me anyways so
once you're on this window here you
simply press next it's pretty standard
installer we can install j-unit here
we're not going to be using it in this
beginner series but it's worth
installing it just so we don't have to
later
you can't really change the default path
unless you run it as an administrator
but we want to keep it we want to keep
it in this default path anyway then you
can choose where you install net
NetBeans too and then we want to check
this box saying check for updates
because when we're programming in
NetBeans we always want to make sure we
have the latest version of it then we
can go ahead and press install now this
will take varying amounts of time
depending on the speed of your computer
but once this is all installed we can
begin looking at programming our first
bits of Java so when the installation is
finished you'll be greeted with this
screen and you can check or uncheck the
contribute to NetBeans
project so let's hit finish and
hopefully boots up NetBeans for the
first time if it doesn't launch
automatically just double click the icon
that should have appeared on your
desktop if you've already had that beads
installed you can go ahead and click YES
on this and then we'll wait for it to
load up and let's just make this the
correct size
okay so now that we have NetBeans
installed we're greeted with a
completely blank a pretty much blank
window you got the you've got your
projects over here and this big white
space here is where we're going to be
actually programming so the first thing
we're going to do is make a new project
we can go ahead up here and click new
new project if you can't see this button
for whatever reason you can just go
ahead and press file a new project like
so and we want java java application hit
next and then we can name the
application something and then we want
to save this to a location that is
relevant to us and we'll remember it
usually NetBeans if it's the first time
installing it will create a folder in
your documents called
NetBeans projects so I'm going to just
save it in there and then you'll see
here it has this create main class thing
we're going to uncheck this and then it
finish so now we're greeted with our
project on the side and still nothing
over here so we can click the plus to
expand our project and we have source
packages and libraries
now in this libraries folder is
basically the Java development kit this
is basically Java in a nutshell we never
really want to touch this libraries
thing this basically just holds all of
the default classes default libraries
for Java that we're going to be using in
our projects so source packages is where
we want to be looking at so we can open
this and you see we have this default
package here so the first thing you need
to know about Java is it organizes the
programming into things called packages
and packages are quite simply just
folders which are relevant different
bits of code so depending on what
project you make you'll have different
packages that organize your code
together just like you do with any other
projects you're doing when you're making
different folders so we can go ahead and
click new Java package and this could be
called whatever we want but we're going
to stick to Java naming convention for
packages which is basically making sure
the package name is all lowercase and
also
we can't use anything like special
characters or anything like that
so I'm going to name this package
tutorials and hit finish so now we see
we have this package here it's still
empty we're going to right click new and
say Java class and then we're going to
call this class main with a capital M
and then it finish so the class that is
generated for us you see there's a lot
of text already we're going to remove
all of this and then type everything
from scratch just so we can get a feel
for what the java programming language
is like now if you've ever done any
programming before then some of it might
look familiar and if you haven't ever
done programming then don't worry about
it because I'm going to be explaining
things as we go along
so without going into too much depth
about what every command I do does just
make sure you copy it how I write it
down and rest assured everything I write
will be explained now or at a later date
depending on when it's relevant so on
the first line here we need to write
package tutorials now this first line
here simply states that we're using this
class here is within this tutorials
package and this is just the thing that
we have to do in Java whenever we have
packages we need to make sure we declare
what package the class is in it's just a
way of organizing all of our Java files
together again not going to go into too
much depth about what the stuff does
they will be covered a later date so
we're going to go down a couple of lines
and then this is where we're going to
make we're going to basically declare
our main class here we're inside this
file called main Java and Java works in
by using series of classes and conquer
it's too much detail yet again sorry but
we will be covering this more in depth
at a later stage in this series I just
want to make sure that the absolute
beginners here aren't thrown that
doesn't don't have loads of information
thrown at them which isn't going to make
much sense so
all you need to know about the next line
of code that I'm going to write is that
it is basically an entry point for our
program if you've ever done programming
before you'll know that you need a kind
of main entry point for the program
where the compiler looks to and says
this is where the code starts this is
the first bit you need to run and that's
exactly what we're doing here so just
copy it copy it as I type out we're
going to write public class Bane and the
you can see in draw you could see
already that we have these highlighted
blue words these are key words in Java
there's a lot of icon remember exactly
how many but there's a lot of set aside
key words in Java which we're not going
to be able to use for when we're like
naming variables and stuff like that and
there's a lot of words like this which
would just reserved for Java because
they do something specific so we're
going to write public class main make
sure that main here is spelled exactly
the same as whoops make sure it's about
exactly the same as the filename that's
one thing we need to make sure that the
class name is always exactly the same as
the file name so after we've written
public class main we're going to open
and close these spike brackets here I'm
not sure the official name for them but
it's if you hold shift and it's the
square brackets to the right of the
letter P on the keyboard hopefully that
makes sense so it's those spoke brackets
there then we'll make a few line breaks
here and make sure we keep correct like
tabbing convention in Java it should do
it for you automatically but basically
as you sort of go down in code with more
and more brackets you want to indent
more and more because it makes the it
makes sure that your code looks nice and
it's easy to read so after we've written
public class main we're going to come
down make sure we're tabbed in so it
looks nice we'll make some space just so
it's easier and now that we've declared
the class we're going to declare the
main method and this main method is
pretty much going to look the same
throughout this entire series and pretty
much into the future when you start
programming Java by yourself but all you
have to know about this main method is
you don't need to know the exact syntax
of it and what all the words mean you
just need to know that this is
the entry point for the program and when
you hit this run button up here the
first code that's going to be run is the
code inside this main method we're about
to write so we're going to write public
static void main like so make sure main
has a lowercase M in this case and the
fact it's called main isn't to do with
the fault the file name unlike the class
name is so the class name is the same as
the file name but this main method here
just happens to be called main because
we named our class here this class could
be called anything that we wanted but
this main method is always called main
so we're going to open normal brackets
parenthesis now then we're going to
write the word string with a capital S
then do an open and closed square
brackets like this and then we'll do a
space and say args
Arg s for arguments then we're going to
do a space and open the spoke brackets
that we used for the class declaration
and then in that means if you just hit
enter it's going to automatically make
that closing bracket make sure you don't
get confused with the brackets in Java
as you can see if this one's missing you
can see we get an error down here
because it's trying to use this last
bracket as the closing one for this and
it means this one was never closed so
just make sure you don't get confused
with opening and closing of the brackets
so we can delete let's go ahead and
delete this white space here so again
don't expect to know what any of this
means I know it's kind of throwing you
in the deep end at the start but it's
kind of necessary for starting the basic
stuff this is pretty much the most
complicated part of this beginner series
just remembering what to type for this
bit but all you have to know is the we
have a main class I know I haven't
really explained what class actually
means but we have a main class here and
then we have our entry point of the
program which is called the main method
and you don't need to know what any of
this any of these keywords mean in here
all you need to know is that the code
inside these two brackets is going to be
run first by the program and we're going
to go ahead and make a HelloWorld
program we're going to print something
cut to the screen and again the print
to the screen doesn't look too nice
either especially for a beginner we're
going to write system with a capital S
and then do a full stop
and we're going to say out and then full
stop and then print Ln for print align
and then it we can open closed brackets
you see it puts a semicolon at the end
automatically we need to make sure we
add those semicolons to the end of every
line we're going to do the double
quotation marks not single quotation
marks it has to be the double ones and
then we could finally write hello world
and make sure we put a semicolon on the
end so to sum up this tutorial you don't
have to know you pretty much don't have
to know what any of this up here I've
typed is all you need to know is after
this public static void main this is the
entry point for our program when I hit
run here it's going to run all of the
code inside of here and the code that we
have written this system out print line
you don't need to know the intricacies
of how this works you just need to sort
of memorize the system dot out dot print
line and remember that when you write
this with the brackets whatever you put
in speech marks it's going to print out
to the screen so we can go ahead and
click run it's going to come up with
this will select the main class the only
class we have hit OK and you can see the
output down here it has hello world
build successful so a lot of that would
have made sense already I know but in
the next few tutorials we don't have to
worry about any of this up here we're
just going to be working inside this
main method we're going to be learning
the basic syntax of Java and then later
on in the series we're actually going to
be learning what this main what the main
method means and what the class is made
and stuff and then it will all come
together hopefully at the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
