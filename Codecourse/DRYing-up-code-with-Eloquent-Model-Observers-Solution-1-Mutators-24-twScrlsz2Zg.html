to look at is not necessarily the best
solution but it does have its place
depending on what you want to do so what
I'm going to do is hop over to the topic
model and we're gonna create a mutator
and by this I mean that within our model
we can define out that when we get which
is an accessor or set we can use an axis
or a mutator so in this case we would
say well when we're setting the title
attribute on this model we're going to
get through a value because we know that
that we're we're going ahead and setting
it so if I just do a die dump on value
here we know that over here we are
setting this here now if I come over and
refresh you can see that we actually get
that value dumped out so this is
basically something that you could use
to hook in the creation of a slug
alongside a title now the only problem
here is that the way that we set things
is we say this attributes we go ahead
and define the actual attribute in this
case its title and then we set it to
that value and this is useful if you
wanted to maybe make the title all
lowercase if you wanted to change this
title in some way and of course this
will work with any attribute that you're
setting now the only problem here is
that we can set the slug in here but we
also have to set the title as well so we
could do something like this we could
say STR slug value so we're taking the
title
slugga fiying it and setting it to slug
and therefore when we save this model
the attribute will be set and that will
be stored in the database so if we just
get rid of this slug here or at least
comment it out so we can go ahead and
have a look we know that this is stored
in the database here let's get rid of
this one first of all and come over and
see what we get now so you can see that
this will have done exactly that now the
reason this is not the best solution is
that we actually have to do this as well
and you can imagine that your model if
you are doing this multiple times for
different attributes would literally get
filled up and that's not always great it
looks a little bit messy and really this
kind of thing is meant for doing this
it's more meant for just the attribute
you're setting so that's one solution
and this does have its place like I said
if you wanted to do anything with the
value that you're currently setting you
could
this and what I will also do is probably
extract this out to a trait and use it
within your topic model rather than go
ahead and define them all here I would
create a trait for this personally just
to keep things nice and tidy either way
that is the simplest way that we could
do this but not the most clean in the
next part we're gonna take a look how we
can set up a simple observer to actually
do this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
