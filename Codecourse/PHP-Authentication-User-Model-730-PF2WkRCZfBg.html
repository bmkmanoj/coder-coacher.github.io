and if you aren't familiar with the
concept of models within object-oriented
programming all this means is we're
going to create a class that represents
our users table this means that we can
use that model to create a new user we
can update an existing user we can
delete all users if we wanted to it
basically provides us a gateway into
this table and all of the records in it
so we're gonna be doing something
slightly different here and we're going
to be using Auto loading to load in all
of our project files within a specific
directory and namespaced
directory and we're gonna be creating a
namespace for our application much like
we can see here all this means is that
it it provides us a way to first of all
not conflict with any other files that
we have in our project and also gives us
a chance to structure our project in a
really nice way so we can find things
easily update things easily and also
reuse code easily as well so we're going
to inside of our app directory create a
new folder now this folder name depends
on your projects name it can be your
business name or it can be your own name
or just whatever like a normal project
name now I'm gonna call this directory
code course but you can call it whatever
you want as long as you know the name of
this folder which I assume you will do
then your autoloading will work but it
basically provides you the ability to
namespace it under your application name
so inside of here we're going to be
creating a variety of different folders
which are gonna store things like how
male wrapper to send email our helpers
to hash things
slims middleware which we'll get to a
bit later on and our models as well now
I'm gonna separate my models into
different directory names so I'm just
going to create a user directory inside
of here so inside of this user directory
I'm going to create my user
and I'm gonna call this user dot php'
now notice the structure of this we've
got code course user user so that is
going to be the namespace when we
eventually autoload with composer and
this sounds more complicated than it is
so don't worry too much so inside of
this user model then let's first of all
just create a very basic class for our
user model and we won't do too much else
with it so class user that is it this is
going to represent our users table so
now we're going to look at why we're
going to be using autoloading and
essentially why it's going to help us
along the way
so inside of say start dot PHP if we
wanted to use this user model usually
what you would have to do is require in
you know that file but we don't want to
do that we want to auto load and we're
gonna use composer to help us with that
and all that will do is it mean that
when we come into here an auto load all
of the files within this code course
directory as long as they're namespace
to properly will be automatically
available for us to use so inside of
composer JSON we're going to define how
we're Auto loading in these files so
we're going to create an auto load
property here and inside of here we're
going to be here self for auto loading
and this is just a standard of Auto
loading for PHP that follows a specific
convention you can read more about this
on the PHP fig website so go ahead and
search for that if you want to read more
so the third that the key for this is
going to be the overall vendor namespace
which I know is code course but in the
place of this you want to put what you
called this folder here and then we need
to prepend on a or append on sorry a
backslash but you'll see that all of
everything else has sort of gone red
here because we need to escape that
backslash so that's the reason we do two
backslashes because we need to escape
the first one for the value of this we
need to define where this vendor
namespace starts and that is at code
course so we just say app code course so
again this and this need to be the name
of your directory here anything else
under that doesn't really matter as long
as it's as long as you namespace based
on the directory structure we'll get to
that in just a minute so now that we've
done that we actually need to dump our
autoload files again because composer is
now not going to recognize this because
we haven't
recreated the autoloader so if you bring
up your terminal within your root
directory that you're working in where
we have our composer JSON file in and
that composer dot phor file in we're
gonna run composer dot phor much like we
did when we install dependencies but
this time we're going to dump the
autoloader and we're going to parse the
optimized flag on so let's hit that and
wait for that to finish it's done
already
and now anything within this code course
directory will automatically be included
we can just create any files we want in
here and they'll automatically be
available for us to use so let's look at
just an example of how we might use that
within here so if I was to say user
equals new user now this isn't going to
work because well it could work but we
need to namespace this according to our
directory structure so let's go and
namespace this under code course user
like that so this is the class name this
is the folder above it and then this is
the vendor namespace here so now what we
can do is we can say new code course
user user so that's how we access this
user model that we've created it doesn't
do anything at the moment because we're
not using eloquent on this we're not
we've just created a standard class
basically that's the overall concept of
psr-4 autoloading what we now need to do
is actually look at extending eloquent
within our user model so we can actually
hook
to our database that's what we did
earlier when we created our database
settings from eloquent so all needs to
do in here is extend eloquent but
where's eloquent coming from well we
need to import this so we're gonna use
illuminate database eloquent model but
we don't want to call it model we're
gonna call it eloquent so there we go so
now this will be hooked up to our
database there's a couple of things that
we can do we can set the table name we
could now start to play around with it
if we wanted to so we could start to
create users using this using this model
we can do whatever we want we're not
gonna do that yet we're going to look at
that when we actually come to working
with our user model the other thing that
we want to do is define what we want to
be fillable to essentially prevent
against mass assignment which is
protected against automatically with
eloquent so we need to define the
fillable of the fields this will be when
we update user details or whatever you
want to do so I mean here's just an
array of the column names that we want
to be able to be written to so in this
case it's email or updated it's going to
be username password the active status
of the users account the active hash
remember identifiers and remember token
and if you do add any more columns to
your database and you need them to be
updated by grabbing a user and updating
them you want to add them to here or you
will get an error you'll get a mass
assignment exception we've now created
our user model we're not going to use it
yet so we're not going to go into the
fun of actually using it but what we are
going to do is add it to Slim's
container and by this I mean attaching
it to the container so we can use it
anywhere in our application without
having to you know create a new instance
of it or anything like that so what we
want to do then is down here we are
going to set our user model into our
container put our user model into our
container so to do this we say app
containers this is all part of slims
functionality we use the sets method we
choose a name for what we want it to be
in the container then we have a callback
just here and we return a new user we've
already seen how we create a new
instance of a user but I'm gonna say new
user and then I'm going to import the
namespace up here so I'm gonna say use
code course use a user like that so now
we have this user model inside of our
slim container so what we can do is to
access that or do a var dump on App user
and that's it so this name here
basically will be this name here so
let's check this out in here and you can
see we've now got an object code course
user user we've got lots of different
things in here that we haven't actually
defined in our class we've got things
like we've got relations you know all of
this stuff that comes from eloquence
that's basically why all that stuff is
in here so we have now as part of this
video looked at psr-4 autoloading within
composer we've regenerated our auto
loader so we can load in our
dependencies or basically any classes in
here that follow the name spacing
convention so remember code costs
user and then the user class we've
extended eloquent and defined the table
that we're using which we don't really
need to do by the way because eloquent
will pick this up for us we've defined
the fillable fields and we are ready to
go as it is now inside of our
application container so now that that's
all set up we can go ahead and start
logging a user in and registering them
but we need to learn about routes within
our application which we already saw
earlier when we created that example
test route but we're going to also in
the next part dive into views and how we
can set up our views and we're gonna be
setting up our overall template for our
website although this does look very
basic it's open to expansion through the
use of templating so let's jump into the
next part and take a look at how we can
pull in slim views Twigg and set up some
routes and we'll be creating our home
route as part of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
