within laravel 5.5 and i'm gonna show
you an example of how I've been using
this just to clear up my views so the
first thing is I have laravel 5.5
installed
I have authentication generated and I'm
currently signed in what we're gonna do
is just head over to the command line
I'm going to make some kind of model in
here something that has a one-to-one
relationship so for example in this case
to a user a user probably just has one
address and this is going to demonstrate
nicely how we output that user's address
if it exists and I'll explain more in a
minute so I'm generating this along with
the migration let's go over to the
addresses table migration and we will
quickly fill this in it's a bit of a
long example but it will give you a good
idea as to how this works
so let's go ahead and just assume we
have a postcode for this and of course
we're also going to have a user ID as
well so this will relate to a particular
user let's go ahead and add in that user
ID and in this case this could be a
one-to-many because of course you are
including the foreign key here but in
this case it doesn't really matter too
much it's just to demonstrate this out
okay so let's go ahead and migrate this
so PHP artisan migrate and what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna fill in a user
address immediately so the user I have
here has an ID of one so let's go ahead
and fill this in and we'll just put this
in here as anything and save this out
and I'll go ahead and fill these in just
so we don't see any problems so let's
fill these two dates in ok so now what I
want to do is over on my dashboard so
over on home blade dot PHP I just want
to go ahead and output the address of
the user here so this might involve some
kind of invoice something like that
where we want to output the user's
address now in this case if the user
doesn't have an address we're gonna see
a problem so let's just go ahead and
output the postcode here using the
author helper function well access the
users address and then we'll grab their
postcode so this is something that we
would typically want to do and of course
if we just set the relationship up here
before we do anything else so let's
create a dress relation and it's going
in return that this has one and pass in
the address model name space string in
there okay so we see the
oh that's absolutely great but in this
case if the users doesn't have a
postcode or sorry doesn't have an
address we're gonna see an error so of
course trying to get a property of an on
object because but there has one
relationship this won't return a laravel
collection it will return either an
address model or it will return null so
essentially what we're getting here is
null okay so how would we rectify this
well previously what we would have to do
is say if Earth user address or if
you're just doing this within a
controller of course you can assign the
user to a local variable and then of
course we would end the if there we
could do that for every single property
of this users address their postcode the
address line one so on and so forth so
that goes ahead and fixes the problem
until we go ahead and add address back
in now the only issue with this is we're
having to wrap this in an if statement
and ideally we don't want to do that so
this optional helper can have uses
outside of inside of your views it
doesn't really matter but in this case
what we do is we take what we're trying
to access like so we go ahead and wrap
this inside of the optional helper and
then try and access something on here
now we're going to take a look at the
optional helper in just a minute and see
how this works but essentially what this
is gonna do is it's gonna introduce a
dynamic getter on what if we've passed
into the optional helper function and
that means that if the property were
trying to access doesn't exist it's just
gonna go ahead and silently return null
so you can see here that we've already
fixed up the problem using that helper
ok so let's add an address back in just
so we can see that this is definitely
working so I'll just add anything in
here and save this out head over here
and you'll notice that works in exactly
the same way so that's pretty much the
optional helper but let's dive in just
to see how this looks so you can use it
with perhaps other things objects you've
created yourself so let's open up the
helpers dot PHP file over in illuminate
suppor and it's come down to optional it
looks like this is returning a new
optional class so let's go ahead and
open this up and see what this does okay
so of course into the constructor here
we're passing over the value that we're
giving in this case it could either be a
user object and address object null it
could be absolutely anything so
assigning that to value just up here now
down here we have this dynamic getter
which allows us to check if this is an
object first of all because of course
the point of the optional helper is to
return null silently if we have a
property that doesn't exist or the
actual object itself doesn't exist we're
checking it's an object first which in
this case it might not be so for example
null would be returned if that user
relationship just doesn't exist well if
it is an object we're going ahead and
returning the key from that object
otherwise down here obviously we're not
doing anything but we're essentially
just doing this we're just returning
nothing so that is how it works we pass
in a value and it tries to give us out
something otherwise it silently returns
us not just to further demonstrate this
if I was to pass in null into optional
and try and access a property from here
notice that it still just silently fails
of course if we were trying to say well
I want to get the postcode property from
the value null of course this is just
you know not valid syntax but hopefully
you get the idea so if you are doing
something like that and wrapping loads
of ifs into your views and wrapping
things in lots of ifs then the optional
helper is really going to help you out
and of course you can use this
absolutely anywhere it's not just
limited to views so you can use that to
further tidy up your code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
