comparisons with carbon and this just
means comparing dates with either
certain things or each other so we can
compare two carbon objects to each other
in different ways to see if they're less
than greater than etc etc so this is
really handy when you are checking for
certain things
and we can do comparisons and really
really easily so let's start out by just
creating two variables we're gonna have
a new carbon instance you can go ahead
and use the carbon now or carbon
tomorrow yesterday create pars any of
them methods that allow you to create a
new carbon date and then what we're
going to do is we're gonna create a
second variable just called c2 this time
what we're gonna do is we're gonna pass
in say plus two days so we now have two
objects one is the current date and time
and one is in two days time so what we
can do then is we're just gonna go ahead
and just var dump these just so we can
see the result this will obviously be a
boolean value will obviously get true or
false depending on whether the result of
which method were using is equal or
greater than or whatever we want to do
so let's go ahead and first of all check
out comparing if two days are equal so
all we need to do is use the e.q method
to do this and the argument that we pass
in here is the other date we want to
compare so obviously if you're not var
dumping it it's just going to look like
this so we could go ahead and maybe put
this in some kind of if statement or
anything we wanted to do really that's
how that's going to work but for now
let's just fire dump it so we can see
the true or false value so we know that
these two objects are not going to be
equal to each other because this one is
two days into the future so let's go
ahead and check this out and we'll see a
false value obviously we already know
that was the case but now we know that
we have an equals method to check if two
dates are equal or not so now let's go
ahead and use GT which I'm sure you can
work out is greater than so we're
basically checking if this is greater
than this
so let's go ahead and see and we know
that the result is going to be false if
we obviously go ahead and switch these
up we'll know that C 2 is greater than C
so we will see a true value here so
there's plenty of options here you've
got things like less than as well so you
can use less than in this case this will
be false because we know sorry LT there
not le we know that this is going to be
false because C 2 which is two days into
the future is not less than the current
date and time so we can do also things
like great less than or equal to or
greater than or equal to as well if you
need that control in terms of making
sure they're greater than and equal to
and we also have some more not advanced
but some more interesting methods that
we can use as well and that is between
so let's say we had a third date here
let's go ahead and call this C 3 just
for the sake of this and let's put this
10 days into the future just remember
that all these dates can obviously be
custom created dates from dates from
your database or you can go ahead and
just create the manually say from user
input if you use a specified a year
month and day in some kind of HTML form
so what we're going to do here then is
do a var dump on whether C 2 is between
C and C 3 so it's as easy as that so
we're making sure that this state here
or we're doing a check for this if this
state here is in between the current
date and 10 days into the future and we
know that that's the case we've passed
in the two arguments here which is the
first state we want to check in the
second and obviously we use in the
between method here and we know that
that's going to be true because we know
that two days into the future is between
the current time and 10 days into the
future so really really straightforward
so what we're going to do now then is
get rid of all of these and we're going
to look at some other methods like is
weekday or is weekend which as you can
probably imagine are going to be really
handy if you really want to check
the date that you're working with so
let's do a fart dump again on C is
weekday and that's just a method called
is weekday now I'm recording this video
on a Wednesday so we should see true
here because we know that Wednesday is a
weekday and we can also use week end as
I mentioned as well so here we'll see
false so what we can do is we can go
ahead and say new carbon and let's take
a look at a method that we looked at in
a previous video which is ad days so
because it's Wednesday if I were to add
three days to this we know that the this
should be a weekend because will end up
on Saturday so if we refresh we can see
true there because we've added three
days to that date so you have a
tremendous amount of control as well as
the flexibility to use all of the
methods to manipulate dates and then
perform comparisons so we also have
other ones you can obviously find these
all in the manual we can say things like
is yesterday
now today isn't yesterday so we'll get a
false value obviously as we've seen
before we could say something like C sub
day like that and when i refresh we get
true because taking away one day we can
obviously do sub days one is going to
result in that being yesterday and as
you've already probably guessed we have
is tomorrow as well ah if you want to be
sort of less specific you can say things
like is future so what we'll get here is
false because the current date and time
right now which we get from just
instantiating carbon is not in the
future but again we can go ahead and so
C add day so we're going to add one day
to this and we're gonna get true that
will be the case for any date in the
future and again pretty straightforward
we also have is past as well so that is
how we do comparisons of dates within
carbon which is going to be
really useful if you do need to do any
checking of dates that have either been
passed into your application or you're
retrieving from another source</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
