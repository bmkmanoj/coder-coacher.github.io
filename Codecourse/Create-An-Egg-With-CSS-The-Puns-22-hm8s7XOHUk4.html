egg shape with CSS it's nothing too
exciting but let's take a look at an
example here you can see we just
basically got a rounded shape here we're
creating this purely with a div element
and we're gonna give it a background
color and then I'm gonna round off the
corners with border-radius so nothing
too complicated here let's go ahead and
look straight at the source code of this
so to save a little bit of time we've
already marked this page up and I'm
linking in a style sheet just here so
again nothing exceptionally good about
this so let's first of all start off
with the markup I'm gonna create a div
with the class of egg and this is all we
need so over in the style sheet here
we're gonna use the class selector to
select this egg at the moment if I just
refresh track from the previous example
with nothing on the page at all so we're
gonna start very very simply here okay
so the first thing what we want to do is
give this a width and height so let's
give it 120 pixel width and we'll say
the height slightly bigger than the
width because obviously an egg has that
specific shape you can't see anything at
the moment because we're not giving this
a background color so I'm gonna give
this a background color here of tomato
so just to confuse things even more when
i refresh we see this so it's already
you know starting to look like it could
be egg-shaped okay so the really the key
to this is just the border radius
property so the css3 bought a radius
property now normally when we define a
border radius we do something like 10
pixels this'll do the following set
rounds out borders just here or we could
give a percentage so we could say
something like 50% and what that's going
to do is round out so it's starting to
look a little bit more like
except when we can't just provide a
border radius values like this because
we're not going to have a shape that we
want we want to modify this so it's not
an elliptical radius so to do this all
we do is we provide a slash in the
middle of these values so what we're
gonna do is I'm gonna put a Naut Naut
Naut Naut here and then your slash and
then normal more nought again so
basically we are gonna add percentage
values here to build this up and what we
gonna do is we're going to examine
what's happening in the console sorry in
the developer tools here on this element
so we can examine exactly what we're
doing inside of here we can mess around
with the values if you want now these
values don't have to be exactly we can
just experiment in them so you know
really you can play around with what
kind of X shape that you want
excellent so the border radius to start
with we're gonna have 50% and then we're
gonna do 50% here begin 50% again
and 50% again and all this really means
is the top left the top right the bottom
right and the bottom left so all that's
done is not well it's not done anything
because we need to provide the other
values in order to make up this non
elliptical radius so here what we do is
we slightly vary things let's first of
all do 50% 50% 50% and again we'll
experiment with these
pelipper tools so there we go so we've
now got that rounded shape that we saw
when we just gave a 50% value initially
excellent so now what we're gonna do is
slightly modify these and see how that
changes things so again let's go over to
our CSS properties here and I'm just
gonna start to bump this value here up
and there you can notice if I do it high
enough you can see there's a slight
change in the top left here you can see
that it's less elliptical so so I'm
gonna set this at 60% and that will give
me a sort of point ish at the top and
then I'm gonna do the same for the top
right as you can see that's already
starting to bring it in at the top more
than it is at the bottom you know the
bottom we obviously want this to be a
lower value because we want it to be
larger so if we do 40% of 40% you can
see that now that has formed a perfect
egg shape so go ahead and play around
these values if you want a slightly
different thing but otherwise we have
created a egg with CSS the only thing
that we need to do now is just copy this
paste it into here
give that pony to refresh and there we
go excellent crated an egg with CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
