application at some point you're going
to need to search around and find
different PHP functions and find things
that you can do with the language now it
would be impossible to cover every
single function in detail there are so
many of them what I'm gonna do now
though is talk you through the PHP
manual which we haven't looked at yet
and we're gonna look at a few functions
we're gonna see how we use them I'm
gonna explain how this is formatted in
the PHP manual and we're gonna go ahead
and use them in our text editor and see
how they work so let's just first of all
take a look at the PHP manual this is
just php.net I'll leave a link to this
in the course links and we're gonna
start to search around for some
functions and I'm gonna give you a
scenario when we might need to use them
and then we're gonna look at a practical
example now of course it's very
important to note that you can also use
your favorite search engine to go ahead
and look for things and the first
function that we're gonna look at is
determining the length of a string so
for example if I didn't know how to
determine the length of a string in PHP
all I need to do is just search for
something like PHP string length now
quite often you'll find that this will
go ahead and just turn up in the first
result just make sure you are looking at
php.net and you will get the most
up-to-date way to use this try not to
use older resources and they could cause
any confusion so here we go get string
length in PHP and you can see here this
is the function name at the top now what
you can also do is search on the PHP
manual directly so you could say string
length and we'll go ahead and search for
this and you can see here we get the
same result okay so let's go ahead and
look at the format of this I'll explain
exactly what's going on here most of
this should make sense because we've
already covered different data types and
we've already looked at using some
functions as well so the first thing
you'll see like I said is the function
name so we know that this is how we call
the function so the next thing is the
description so this can be very very
simple or it can be very very
complicated depending on how you use the
function and then it will give you a
brew
description of the function as well now
the parameters here are like we said
before what we pass into a function so
in this case we have one parameter which
is a string because obviously we are
determining the length of a string and
this will return this is the return
value and integer we also have more
information here on the return values as
well so the parameters are the string
this is the string being measured for
length and the return values is the
length of the string and 0 if the string
is empty so let's go ahead and use this
and we will see how it works so
obviously to use this we use STR Len and
then in to this we pass in a string so
what we would expect to get back is an
integer we can test this out with var
dump as well but let's go over to our
browser window here and you see four so
again we can prove that this returns an
integer by doing a var dump on the
result of this or the return value of
this function and if we come over we see
we get an int just here so that is
probably one of the most basic PHP
functions and likewise the manual is
pretty simple for this ok so the next
scenario then what happens if I want to
take a name or just anything really and
convert it all to uppercase well we can
go over to the manual and we can search
for uppercase and see what we get so if
we have a look
STR to offer so STR we know stands for
string and to upper pretty much sounds
like it's going to convert a string to
upper case and in fact that is exactly
what's happening so we know here that we
must have an argument because we need
something to convert to uppercase and we
get a return value of a string so again
let's come over and test this out let's
echo STR to upper and you'll notice this
as well that my text editor actually
gives me a hint to this as well so
depending on the texture that you're
using this will go ahead and either fill
these in for you or give you a little
tip on them so here then if I go and
refresh over in the browser we see Alex
and uppercase now we can pretty much for
lowercase string guess what we would use
we've
Str to upper we've probably got STR to
lower so let's go ahead and look STR to
lower and we do indeed so this is pretty
much the same thing it takes the same
data type in and gives us back a string
so again we can come over and say STR to
lower go ahead and check this out and of
course in this case le X was lower case
but a has been converted to lower case
okay so let's go and look at something
else and I'm going to talk to you about
the trim function which strips
whitespace now again a Google search for
this would have turned up this PHP
manual page probably so again just go
ahead and google around for things and
try and look for things in the PHP
manual so this function strips
whitespace or other characters from the
beginning and the end of a string it
takes in a string it takes in a
character mask which is optional and
we'll read about that in a moment and it
returns us a string so the most simple
use of this would be to just go ahead
and add in a few characters like so and
then go ahead and use trim now just
before we preview this why would this be
useful well if you are say registering a
user for a website or you're doing
something else and they enter their
username or their email address with
lots of spaces on either side it's
probably likely that you're gonna want
to trim these off before you start to
use them or store them because we know
that if we were to do something like STR
Len on name which is the string length
and we come over here we know that we're
gonna see a large number like 19 so it
would make sense to trim things so we
can just use this in its simplest form
before we start to calculate the length
this will automatically strip the left
and the right and it will go ahead and
give us the actual string length and we
see here we get four so you can combine
these like we know functions will return
a value and then you can use them within
other functions so we know how to use
trim let's just take a look at this
optional character mask so optionally
the stripped characters can also be
specified using the character mask
parameter so what does this mean well
what we can do is we can specify a range
of characters that we want
be stripped now let's say we wanted to
strip out dots for example let's go
ahead and apply a load of dots here and
we'll see this work now trim on its own
isn't going to trim the dots because of
course it's just looking for whitespace
let's go ahead and refresh and we see
the following now if we were to say trim
and then provide a dot here we go ahead
and get rid of them dot so it's really
important to read these things because
otherwise you may end up using more code
than you need in this case we have a
character mask that we can go ahead and
apply if we want to and you can see here
that we have some tabs here you can
provide that you want to strip tabs or
carriage returns or anything like that
okay so very similar to trim what if we
want to just trim white space or any
character from the left or the right
well let's go ahead and check this out
let's go ahead and add loads of spaces
on the left now you can kind of guess
these once you get used to PHP function
names but we also have a function called
L trim or our trim which obviously
stands for left and right so let's go
ahead and look this up in the manual so
L trim and there we go strip whitespace
or other characters from the beginning
of a string and again we've got that
character mask in there so we can use it
in exactly the same way as trim so again
this will just work and it was trim
space from the left hand side and of
course you can use our trim as well it's
pretty straightforward once you start to
learn these they'll kind of become a lot
easier to use okay so let's look at a
slightly more advanced thing what
happens if we want to basically extract
part of a string well let's go over and
let's search for substring this again
will return up in Google results if you
google anything similar to there to
return part of a string get part of a
string it will all come up so in this
case we have a few arguments but you'll
notice that in here we have these
brackets what these mean is this is an
optional argument so this is just the
way that PHP defines out an optional
argument or parameter now you can see
that down here so you can see this is
actually optional and you can tell from
the description down here if length is
emitted the substring star
thing from the start parameter until the
end of the string will be returned so
let's go ahead and use this and see what
we can do this so let's again just to
find a simple variable like a name out
and let's change this over and now let's
start to use this so we're gonna echo
out the return value of sub-string now
let's look at the arguments here so
we've got the string that we need to
find that's easy we know that that's the
name then we have a start now it's
really important here that this is zero
indexed again so if you wanted to start
the very start of the string and maybe
take the next two characters you need to
provide 0 not 1 so again 0 index like an
array and then the third but optional
argument is where we want to go up to or
the length so in this case then what we
would get here if we just go ahead and
refresh is the full string this is a
little bit pointless now let's say we
wanted to grab the first two characters
now this isn't 0 index so if it was 1 it
would be the first character 2 would be
the second and so on and so forth so
let's go ahead and grab the first
character youcb if we wanted to grab the
first two characters so 1 2 we see the
following and then so on and so forth
like that now if we were to provide and
let's just check this a number here
that's greater than the string let's
just test this out you can see it just
works as normal so there's nothing
necessarily wrong with doing this of
course this particular function is
handing that for us but these are the
things that you want to be really
careful with if for example you wanted
to grab half of this string how would
you do that well in this case we know
that we can use a STR Len function so if
we were to grab the string length of
name divided by 2 then we go ahead and
round this up then we know we've got
roughly half of the string now to round
up we use Seal we already saw this as
part of the series and we just wrap it
in like that so we've got as the third
argument the following so I'll just
bring it out to it's a little bit easier
which is the length of the name divided
by 2 and round it up so there we go
we're going to place that in there
this will give us the following B il if
we were to say something like Aleksandar
this is slightly longer but of course
now what's going to happen is it's
always going to work because it's always
grabbing half of the string so hopefully
that makes sense and you can see here
how you can combine things just to make
your life a little bit easier while you
are developing okay so let's look at a
nother function let's say we were using
a query string so again we've already
learned about this let's say we have
page just here let's go ahead and pull
in that value from our super global
array now in this case when we echo out
page we know that what we can do if we
just go ahead and refresh here is check
if this is defined or not so we could do
something like this and then say well we
want it to be one by default like so but
what happens if we would say page equals
but then not provide a value well you
can see here it's gone so we're not
actually pulling anything in what if we
wanted to check this value was empty so
again we would search for something in
Google in my case I know that the
function that we need is empty so this
will determine whether a variable is
empty it returns a boolean so it will
return a true or false and here you can
see we have mixed this basically means
that we can pass any type in there's not
a specific type that this is expecting
so let's go over and see if we can use
this so here we're going to create an if
statement we're gonna say if empty page
then we want to set page equal to 1 and
you can use a ternary for this if you
want just to make things a little bit
cleaner now that we've done that we come
over even if we don't provide a value
we've gone ahead and given up the value
1 and this is really useful for when you
are maybe registering a user or
submitting any form where you have to
store data you want to check if the
values are empty or not and you may also
want to combine this with trim so you
could go ahead and make this a little
bit more robust so for example I could
do a load of spaces in here and then I
could trim it and in this case it's
within the query string so it's getting
rid of them anyway but of course you can
go ahead and combine this just in here
with trim too
the value then check if it's empty so
you're getting rid of all of white space
then checking it for value is empty
okay so we've already seen the number
for mapped function but I'm going to go
ahead and I'm gonna show you this anyway
because on the manual we'll find a lot
more information so remember earlier
when we were playing around with this we
saw that we can use the number format to
basically control the amount of decimal
places so for example if we had some
kind of large number let's say five
point and then a load of decimal places
when we go and echo this out we're going
to get that number and of course this
could come from some kind of
mathematical calculation where you want
to get rid of these format a price of
something whatever you wanted to do so
we have the following and of course we
can use the number format method or
function on its own so we can just wrap
this number in there and this will go
ahead and get rid of all of our decimal
places and round it up or if we didn't
want to do that we could provide the
amount of decimal places we wanted now
things get a little bit more complicated
here because what we can actually do is
we can define the decimal point that we
want to use if we want to change this
over and we can also define out the
thousands separator as well so let's say
for example we had a very large number
so let's say 1 million or let's go for a
billion and we were to run this through
number format with two well in this case
we would get the following so you can
see we've got comma separated values
when we use that and then we've got two
decimal places afterwards because we've
used two if we were to use 0 here we
don't get the decimal places but we have
that comma separator in there now this
looks weird because we haven't defined
that we wanted a comma separator well
what this means and as we already know
from looking at functions is a these are
defaults so if you use this and don't
specifically define your decimal point
and don't specifically define your
thousand separator it's going to be a
comma by default this is what it means
within the PHP manual so we can actually
override these as we already know we
just pass them in so in this case we
know that we want a dot for our
separator we have to define this because
it comes before this one and then we may
want to change
the comet or something else so let's go
ahead and change the comet over to I'd
know and underscore it doesn't really
make sense but you'll get the idea so
now when we refresh we get the following
obviously pointless but you can see
exactly what I mean so the PHP manual
then in this term can be really really
useful because you can find out exactly
how to use a function and it makes a lot
more sense okay so let's look at one
more example now we already know that
when we say submit a form or we do
something else we're probably going to
want to redirect the user to another
page so what we're going to do is we're
going to look at the header function
which you may use quite a lot if you're
building small applications now what
this will do is you can see here it says
void now whenever it says void in a
function it means that it's not going to
return a value it just doesn't return a
value at all we can have a function that
doesn't return a value but it might do
something so in this case PHP actually
gives us an example it says that we can
redirect over to another page here and
it also gives us a little bit of tip
here if we are outputting anything
before we use this function then this is
going to error so this will give an
error note the output above which is
before the header call all this means is
if we're outputting anything before our
PHP tag we're not going to be able to
use this header function let's just take
a look at this I'm gonna go and I'm
gonna define this out and if you're not
too sure about HTTP headers this will
basically set a header and in this case
if we use a location header this is
going to redirect us off to another page
so let's go ahead and try this out then
let's say header location page PHP let's
go and create this file so page PHP and
you are redirected here great so now as
soon as we hit index dot PHP we're going
to be redirected off to page dot PHP and
you can use this to set other headers as
well but of course since we're looking
at the very basics we're not going to
cover that just now so let's go over to
our index file then give that a refresh
and you can see that we've been
instantly redirected over to page dot
PHP so this is useful for things when
you are submitting a form to register
a user you might want to redirect them
to the home page after they've been
registered or redirect them to an error
page whatever you want to do so I think
that's just about it for PHP functions
once you start building applications
it's going to become a lot easier to
start to look through the manual and
understand exactly what we're doing here
but what we've done here is we've spoken
about the PHP manual and how you can
look at this and see exactly what's
going on there's a lot of information
here so it's always a good idea to go
ahead and read through these before you
start to use any functions and like I
said a quick google search around will
usually give you the information you
need from the PHP manual</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
