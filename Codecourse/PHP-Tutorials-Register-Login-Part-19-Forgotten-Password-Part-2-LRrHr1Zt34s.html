forcing password change part obviously
this isn't entirely necessary but I just
thought it'd be a nice addition because
it means we can modify a few things and
start to get into that routine of
working around things changing things
that we've already done so you don't
have to follow this but it's just one of
them one of them things okay so now that
we've logged in as Billy with a new
password everything's fine we can start
using the sign clicking on stuff but I'm
going to start this process all over
again make a few changes and force the
user to change their password so the
first thing I need is some kind of flag
against the users row in this database
table to say whether they've recently
changed their password or whether
they've changed their password and
haven't changed it back so I'm going to
add a new field to all well to this just
just this table as a as a whole and this
is going to be password changed or let's
just call it password recover now I want
the type to be an int and I'm going to
set the default to zero and this is just
going to mean that nothing's you know
nothing's happened recover equals
password recovers nothing now you may be
confused but the reason that we do this
is when the user changes their recovers
their password we're going to set this
to one when they login if this value is
equal to one we're just going to
constantly redirect them to the page
that forces them to change their
password okay so we need to only allow
them to log in log out or change their
password before they can start using the
website okay so how do we go about
changing this value well let's go back
over to our code just after we change
their password before we email them
can be after this isn't really matter
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to
use the update user function to update
this value in the table so update user
requires a an array of data and it
sanitizes this data which isn't entirely
necessary here and then it performs a
query and updates a specific value so we
already know the in actual fact we can't
use this now the reason we can't use
this is because this this base is it on
the current users ID the user that's
logged in and also if we're recovering
in an E AB password then you know we
don't have access to this session data
so we've got one of two options we can
either modify this update user function
to take a user ID without involves going
back and doing stuff we can't use any
other function here because nothing else
deals with this quite like it does so
what should we do I think actually we'll
we'll modify this update user function
and the reason being it's just going to
make it a lot easier we'll also get rid
of this global variable that we are
declaring here it's going to get rid of
that global variable and we're going to
have to we're going to ask now to pass
in a user ID and the update data and
this will also need to change as well to
user ID because we're checking here
we're setting these bits where the user
ID equals user ID now because we've
changed this function we know that this
is used in the update process so let's
go ahead to settings and we know that
this is used down here update user
update data so here let's just go ahead
and pass in session user ID and remember
session user ID is found in our init
file here which is here and that is just
basically the session that we're setting
so now we've modified that it's going to
make it a lot easier for us to go ahead
and update this user so what do we do
well we need to go ahead and
Hoss they would be user ID which we know
so I'm going to say update user the user
ID is user data and user ID now we need
to pass through an update data and array
of fields much like we do here's her
first name is equal the first name
element is equal to something or holds
this value so what we do is we can just
do this within here I'm going to say
array hold some value and that is going
to be the field name and the value value
is going to be one and remember the
field name is password underscore
recover password underscore recover
perfect
so that'll update our user and then
it'll email them and that's it done so
let me go ahead and just pretend I've
well I'll log out first and then I'll
just pretend I forgot my password again
I'll email it to myself again recover
and wait for that email to go through
done go ahead and check my email I've
got one in my inbox perfect and there we
go this is my new password now it's
generated me a new password but also if
we go ahead and refresh this it's set
the password recover flag to one which
means now when we log the user in or the
user logs in for the first time we can
check if this is equal to one and if it
is tell them to go and change the
password so how do we do this where
we're going to do this within init dot
PHP so if logged in equals true that's
important we only want to make this
check if the users logged in we are
first of all checking if the users
active blah blah blah but now down here
we want to say if something then we want
to redirect the user
to now change password file is called
just change password dot PHP so change
password but PHP and then accept there
so what is our condition now this is
going to be slightly tricky because of a
few things the first thing is if the
user is on change password PHP this init
file is still going to be is still going
to be included at the top therefore we
might end up with an infinite loop and
that's definitely not what we want
second well when the user goes to logout
this page is included so it's not going
to let them logout it's going to
redirect them before it can process the
logout so we need to grab basically the
page name or the current page that we're
on and I'm going to just I'm going to
basically define this up here so I'm
just going to say current underscore
page or current underscore file and this
is going to be equal to the magic
constant file and I'm going to say base
name file and basically file let's just
go and echo this out and just we'll just
see what it looks like
