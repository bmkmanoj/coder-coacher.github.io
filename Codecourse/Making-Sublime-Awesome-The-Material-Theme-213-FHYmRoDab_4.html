really nice and since I've been using
this I really just haven't wanted to
change so in this video we're gonna look
at installing this and getting it all
set up so we can head over to the github
page to read out more you can see a
preview of it just here you can read
installation instructions let's just go
and head over to sublime let's hit
command shift + P let's install a
package and let's search for material
theme and there it is so let's hit enter
and wait for that to download and there
we go so this is our kind of packaged
message here you can see that all we
need to do is have these two lines just
here to our settings file so to access
your settings you want to press command
+ , and this will just open them up like
this so all we do here is append these
on let's just tidy this up a little bit
as well hit save and there we go we're
all done so this is automatically
refreshed and we're now using the
material theme let's just drag over a
folder as well so we can see the sidebar
so you can see here that everything
looks a lot nicer and we will be diving
into our settings a little bit later on
so remember that's command + , and we'll
be adjusting a few things here as we go
next we're gonna look at choosing a nice
color scheme</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
