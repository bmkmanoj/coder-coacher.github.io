form we can enter an email address we
can enter a message and we can go ahead
and generate a hash and store the
message alongside this and then later on
we can email it to someone they can
click on that link and we can look up by
that hash but let's focus on just
storing this in the database first of
all so what do we need to do well over
in our home twig file at the moment
we're not posting to any particular
action that's because we don't have a
root set up to be able to post so let's
quickly set this up now rather than a
get request we're making a post to
request to this and this is going to be
/co so you can call this whatever you
want though really doesn't matter so we
have a normal closure just here with the
items we see here so we have requests we
have response and we have arcs so what
we're going to do now is set the name
for this route and that will allow us to
reference it within our homepage that
means that if the URL changes we don't
end up having a hard-coded URL like four
slash post in here and that's the
benefits of routes you can actually give
them names and then you can change the
URLs around without affecting the rest
of your application so we're just going
to call this send but of course feel
free to call it whatever you like and
inside of here we can now generate our
hash we can store it into the database
and we can redirect the user back to the
home page so just while we're at it
let's set a name for this as well so
this is home just so we when we do
redirect we can generate a path for that
again rather than redirecting to forward
slash so the first step then is to grab
the parameters that have been posted so
to do this we use the request object
that's passed in and we say get params
you can also use get / ram and then give
the name for example email but we'll
store these up here so we can just use
them down here a little bit more
conveniently so let's now generate a
hash and to do this I'm just going to
use the unique ID function I'm going to
pass true for more entropy and then I'm
going to md5
hash this these don't have to be super
unique because we're physically deleting
them after we're done so it's unlikely
that two are going to ever be the same
so now let's set up a prepared statement
to get this stored remember we are
taking user input and putting it into a
query so prepared statement means we're
protecting against SQL injection so all
we do is say this DB we already know we
just set that up in the last part and we
say prepare so here it's just a simple
query to place this into the database so
it's insert into messages that's our
table name we're putting the hash and
the messaging and the values here are
going to be hash and message so using
placeholders with colons at the start so
this won't actually execute anything at
this point but we now need to execute it
passing in them values and this will be
stored so we just say message execute we
pass in an array of values and that is
hash which will replace in a moment and
message which will also replace so the
hash is pretty straightforward just
comes from up there where we generated
it and the message is just params
message so this get params method on the
request object will return an array and
we can just access the keys like this
and this relates to the name that we
gave this so we gave this name of
message and this a name of email so we
can use that later on when we actually
send the email so all this left to do is
redirect the user back to the homepage
which happens to be our form so all we
do is we return response with redirect
and now we want to generate a path for
the home page so to do this we use app
Rooter path for and then we give the
name of the route that we want to
redirect to which is forward slash so
this is the name of it will redirect
forward slash so we just type home in
there that means that whenever you
change this so to home your application
will work in exactly the same way
because we
generating the path from here so that's
all done but there's a couple of
problems one app isn't available in the
scope of this function just here so what
we need to do is at the end of hearsay
use app let's remember the variable
that's set inside of bootstrap just here
so we also need to update our form just
here to generate a URL for that new post
route and this is a little bit different
we have a helper with inside of our twig
templating and if we cast our mind back
to when we set up our views that's this
ad extension part here we have a twig
extension if we go and open this you can
actually see here if we go down we've
got path for and base URL now we're not
using base URL we're using if we look at
our bootstrap far we're using the URL
that we setting out config but basically
twig extension will give you access to
help us within your views so to output
something twig we just use double curly
braces and we just use the path for
function in here and we give the name of
the root again so if that root name
changes or the path changes this will
just update to reflect back so now we
can go back to our form and we can test
this out so i'm going to type in an
email address type in a message hit send
and we see we're redirected back over in
our database you can see that that has
been stored so we've now managed to
submit the form store a message but we
obviously need to send the email off now
so let's jump over and do that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
