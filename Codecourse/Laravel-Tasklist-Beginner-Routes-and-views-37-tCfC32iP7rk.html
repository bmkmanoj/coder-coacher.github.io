views now if any of these terms sound
confusing don't worry a route is
essentially just the URL into what you
want to display and your view is what
you want to display so just think of it
as a URL and then the mark-up that you
see on the page that is it now we're not
going to be dealing with controllers in
this series but if you want to you can
check out the same version of this
series but the intermediate version over
on code cost comm and that will cover
controllers as well as lots more so
let's start by just heading over to our
routes file you can find this over
in-app HTTP and routes
now by default we have a route here for
the homepage which is returning this
welcome view let's just get rid of this
comment as well and we will check out
what this looks like
so the Welcome view is over in resources
views and then welcome and that is
literally just what we see on the page
here so if we were to change this to say
home and we go over and refresh you see
that changes and of course if we wanted
a different URL we could change this
over here as well by going over to home
simple as that so now that we have this
view just here we need to start thinking
about what kind of actions we need to
take to create a task so we're going to
define out our routes first of all so
the first route that we have then is
obviously the home page that is just
what we'll see when we land on the site
and we will see a list of tasks as well
as the ability to create a new task now
what would you also need to do if we
just copy and paste this down is post to
task now what this will do is it will
create a new task I'm going to get rid
of this view here as well so when we
post to this route here we will be able
to create a new task in the database now
this obviously means that when we submit
a form we need to send through a post
request much like you would normally see
outside of a framework like laravel now
we need a last one and this is to delete
a task so we're gonna say task but this
time we need to know which task we want
to delete so this will be the ID of the
task and remember the ID of each task is
stored in the database so they are our
three routes we have get we have post
and we have delete so now that we've
done that we need to start to look at
our views so I got rid of the welcome
view being returned here so at the
moment if we just head over to the home
page we just see nothing what we want to
do is put together a very basic kind of
template for our application and we do
that within views and we create a folder
something like layouts now if you've
worked with a templating engine before
like twig maybe in PHP this will be
familiar to you but if not just know
that it's a very nice way to structure
out your project you don't have to
include anything anywhere you just
extend a base layout and it's a lot
easier than it might sound so we want
then a base layout and I'm gonna call
this app blade dot PHP now blade is
laravel x'
syntax for creating views we can do
things like loop we can create if
statement we can output things and we'll
see how that works soon so I'm gonna
create a basic template just here just a
standard document and I'm just gonna
update the title and in the body area
what I want to do is define where my
content sits so I'm gonna create a div
with a class of container and inside of
here I am going to say well any content
I create in any pages I want it to sit
within here and that means that we can
create lots of different files we can
extend this template and then place the
content in here rather than including a
header and a footer on every page which
you may be used to doing outside of a
framework so now that we have this then
we're going to be working with the front
end framework bootstrap is just very
quick to get going with obviously it
doesn't look great out of the box but
it's just nice to just start working
with I'm gonna head over to the
bootstrap website to just get bootstrap
calm and I'm gonna go down and I'm gonna
pull this in via a content delivery
network just so we don't have to
download it to our computer and all I
want to do is paste that into the head
of my page so we want to create then the
index for our task so this is the only
view we're going to be creating but
obviously later on you're going to be
creating lots of different views within
laravel so inside of here I want to
create a new folder called tasks and
inside of this I want to create a new
file and I'm gonna call this index blade
HP so this is the task view where we see
our form and a list of our tasks now we
know that we want to extend our based
layout so to do this we say something
like layout dot app now dot just means
go into the directory you can use
forward slashes if you prefer
I just prefer using the dot syntax and
in here we want to define out the
section so in this case it's content and
then down here we end that section like
so so if we place something in here say
task index what should now happen is if
we return this view rather than our
default welcome view which we can
actually get rid of we should see this
content here placed within here so that
is the basic idea of templating so over
in routes then let's update our home
route to return view much like we did
with welcome but this time it's tasks
dot index and again you can use a
forward slash here if you want so now
when I head over to the home page just
here we see tasks index and if we just
view the page source of this you will
see that we have this content
placed where we wanted so that is it and
there we go and we can already see this
looks a little bit nicer than what we
would normally see because we've gone
ahead and pulled in bootstrap
so now that all that's left to do for
this part is to create the form just up
here that we will be posting through to
this route to create our task so if we
go over to here we can start to define
out this form now I'm going to be using
some bootstrap
if you're not familiar with bootstrap
don't worry just go ahead and copy down
why right and of course if you want to
learn bootstrap later on you can do so
we have a div here the class of panel
and this will also have a class of panel
default this will create something like
the following like so and inside of here
we can create another class panel body
and we get the following there we go so
it's just a little bit of a nicer way to
represent what we want now inside of
here we're gonna have a form the action
is where we want to post this through to
and the method is the method we want to
use now we know we want to use the post
method because we define this out just
here so we're posting through to that
route so for the action then we need to
know where we're posting this through to
and to do this we use the URL method and
then we give the name of the URL in this
case it's tasks so or tasks rather so we
just see tasks there now there are other
ways of doing this we will cover that in
the intermediate and of course in any
other laravel series we have so last but
not least for this form I just want to
give it a class of form horizontal like
so and that will just add with these
styling so for the task then we have a
form group again this is just bootstrap
styling and we have a label so we can
say tasks and then we have an input as
well so inside of here we can create our
input this is going to be the type of
text we can give this a name which we're
just going to say name we're going to
give this an ID of name as well and we
can update our label so that clicks
through into that input and we want to
give this a class of form control as
well so let's just preview this and then
we'll tidy up if we need to so that
company looks like the following so it's
not great let's just wrap then out in
put in a smaller column so we'll say 6
so this is just bootstraps grid system
like so so we should now see the
following that looks a little bit better
but of course we can just go and update
our label here with a similar thing so
we can give this a class
Column small and this will be six or
three rather and lastly what we want to
do is also give this a class of control
label which should make it look like so
perfect well not perfect but as good as
we want to learn laravel so the last
thing that we want then is a submit
button to actually submit this so just
under this form group we can create a
new form group just here and inside of
this we want a small column or on a
small viewport we want to offset it by
three and we also want it to be six
columns in width so again don't worry
too much if this doesn't make a lot of
sense of course you don't need to learn
bootstrap to work with laravel so this
is going to be a button with a type of
submit inside of here I'm gonna write
add tasks let's just quickly take a look
at this so looks okay and just to make
the bus and look a little bit prettier
we can add a class here of BTN and there
BTN default and this will create a nice
start button like so okay so now that we
have this done we can look at submitting
this and then because we've covered a
fair bit here we're going to go on to
the next part and look at validation so
when I click on this notice that we see
an error token mismatch exception if
you've tried to work with Larry over
before you might have seen this so we're
gonna look at cross-site request forgery
in the next part which again sounds a
lot more complicated than it is so there
we go although we've had to write a lot
of bootstrap markup which isn't entirely
necessary we've gone ahead and looked at
our roots which are really important and
we've looked at our views so now we can
move on to validation and we can look at
fixing this cross-site request forgery
