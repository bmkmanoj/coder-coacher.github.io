up how we want our output to look before
we start coding we just want to make
sure that we've got the output in place
so we don't have to worry about that
when it comes to it so what we're going
to do is we're going to start completely
from scratch we're gonna write a little
bit of CSS just to space things out
particularly with the form on the poll
page let's go ahead and start to do this
so I'm gonna create a new file within my
PHP whole directory and this is gonna be
called index top here's P this is where
the polls are gonna be output so they're
just gonna be listed here so at the
moment this is obviously blank I'm using
Emmet just to speed up doing things like
generating an html5
bit you can just type all this out if
you want to so what we're gonna do here
is we're gonna link in a style sheet so
this is basically just a rel attribute
of Star XI and that's going to link
through to a CSS folder and main dot CSS
so now that we've done that let's create
that style sheet so we're gonna create a
new folder inside of here called CSS and
then in here we're gonna create a new
file and obviously name that main dot
CSS okay so now that we've done that
let's mock up what we're gonna see when
we actually list the holes that we
currently have available all of our PHP
code is gonna go at the top here just to
separate what we're doing at the top
from out sort of view if you like so
that's where our code is going to go and
but in terms of poles we're just gonna
display them in an unordered list so
inside of here we're gonna have list
items now inside of each of these list
items we're gonna have an anchor that's
just going to link through to the pole
so this could be pole one for example
and let's link this through to pole dot
PHP which doesn't exist yet and it's not
gonna be much used because we're not
specifying which pole we want to see but
we'll do that in a moment
so hold two here as well so we've got an
unordered list to list items and
obviously this will grow when it becomes
dynamic it just shows that you can click
through pull one pole two and pull three
and whatever you have so now let's
create the actual pole page this is
going to be where we see the
question the options and the submit
button to actually submit the forms this
is a little bit trickier but still
there's not really too much involved
here so we're gonna create poll THP and
again we could probably just copy this
and paste this in here this is where our
style sheets going to come in because
we're gonna want to control how this
form looks just to make sure it looks
half decent so when we display it to a
user it doesn't look cool in line and
not very nice okay so in here what we're
gonna do is we're going to create a div
with a class of poll and this just
allows us to target poll if you're used
to CSS this this will be obvious to you
and we're also gonna create a div called
poll question this could probably be a
header or something it's probably best
as an h1 tag on h2 tag or whatever but
this is basically going to be the
question so I'm gonna say this is the
whole question so let's just start to
star this up the form by the way it's
going to go down here so we'll do that
in just a moment but we're gonna star
the poll container and the poll question
to make that a little bit older so
inside of here let's say poll and we're
basically going to give this 20 pixels
padding and we're gonna give this a
little border it's a 1 pixel solid and
something like CCC maybe something you
know a little bit nicer but that's
basically how that looks what we're now
gonna do is we're gonna star the poll
question so this is basically just gonna
say I want a font-weight:bold if you
using a specific font with font weights
you can choose them I'm gonna have a
margin bottom on this of 20 pixels so
the poll question will leave a little
bit of room at the bottom like so so now
we can actually start to add our form
this is sort of the fun part where we're
actually gonna be able to submit this
form and obviously go through and
actually vote so inside of here let's
create a form and this is going to have
a method of post so we basically are
going to form with an action this is
where the data within this is submitted
through to this is vote dot PHP we
haven't created this far year so let's
just quickly create in
neuf are here and save this out as vote
dot php' this is gonna be a pure PHP
page so we're just out up here it should
be tagged there we'll close that off for
now so once this form is submitted it's
gonna go through to post dot PHP sending
this in the HTTP request Adi not the URL
that's what post does and inside of here
more interestingly we're gonna have lots
of Paulo options so we're gonna have
poll options to contain this and then in
here we're gonna have Hull option and
we're gonna have a few of them so we'll
create one of these just first so inside
of here we want an input and this is a
type of radio the name of this is going
to be choice and so we'll the other
inputs because that allows us to group
them them together so more than one
can't be selected we are gonna have a
value here and this is going to be the
choice ID so for now let's just set that
to one and this is also going to have an
ID just to make it unique and we're
gonna say something like c1 and that
will also be dynamic so we choice one
choice two choice three so the label is
going to be just after it so we have a
label element and this is going to be
four see one two three four four on and
on and this just means that this label
corresponds to that particular radio and
this is going to be the choice in here
so we're gonna say choice one for
example so what we can actually do is we
can duplicate this code here so if we do
that a few times we can change this to
choice two and we can change this to
choice three this will become two and
three these these are the actual choice
ID whereas these are incrementing from
one so this could be choice twenty could
be choice 35 whereas these will always
be c1 c2 and c3 and these will be
targeted at c2 c3 as well so overly that
makes sense let's just check out how
this looks okay so it doesn't look too
bad we can perhaps make a few style
adjustments here so let's do that now so
I'm gonna say Paul or
and basically what this is going to do
is just give this a margin on the bottom
and then for each poll option we're
going to give this a margin bottom of 10
pixels that's all the styling that we
need so let's close that off and that's
just space things out a little bit so we
now need a button to actually be able to
submit this form that's really really
important so down here just after the
last the div for the options we're gonna
have an input type and this time it's
obviously submit we are going to have a
value here which is basically just the
text displayed to the user so submit
answer and then down here we need an
input which is hidden or hidden input
field and the reason for this is we need
to identify when we submit this request
which poll we are submitting this for so
in this case we're just gonna have an
input type of hidden the name of this is
going to be polled and the value of this
is going to be 1 2 3 or whatever the
poll ID is so now we've got our button
here to submit our answer when we hit
that it goes through to vote dot PHP so
once that's what that's going to do when
it does go through to vote dot PHP as
it's gonna basically detect which choice
was made it's gonna submit through the
poll ID as well and then we can actually
determine which paly is if you want to
sort of find out more about how this
works you can change the the request
type to the vote dub hitch PFR to get to
the request and then if you hit choice 1
for example even choice tune to submit
it you can see that we get choice of 20
because that was the value and then Paul
won so that's pretty much how things
work except with post-its sent in the
request body so that is basically the
front end we've done all that we need we
have an index page which lists our polls
out and then we have the actual poll
question the choices and the ability to
submit an answer so now that we've done
that done that we can sort of focus away
from this onto the actual PHP code
that's going to make this boy
so let's go ahead and do that in the
next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
