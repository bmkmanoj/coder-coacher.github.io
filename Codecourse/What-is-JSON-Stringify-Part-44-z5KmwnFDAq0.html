part of the JSON objects in JavaScript
is stringify now this takes a real
JavaScript object and converts it into a
string JSON string which we could then
pass on to another application to go
ahead and pass in its own way so you'll
only really need to use this method if
you're wanting to store information
that's already been captured in this
session so perhaps user input or you've
gathered information on something with
it I want to pass it back to the server
for storing or something so you could
also use this to gather user settings
and perhaps store it in a cookie which
could then easily be read using json dot
parse and applied as required so let's
take a look at how this works we'll go
ahead and use the same object example we
saw initially so let's recreate this
object in this string e dot HTML file so
I'm going to go ahead and create a
object like this I'm going to go ahead
and create a people property this is
going to store an array as we saw before
and within this array we're going to
have two records or objects if you like
one with the name of Alex and another
property online with a value of true and
the second object with the name of Billy
and on line false now we need to do is
use json stringify to convert this so
let's store this in a variable that we
can output in the console in a minute so
I'm going to create a variable called
string and I'm going to call JSON dot
stringify and within this I'm going to
go ahead and pass the object that I want
to convert to a JSON string so let's go
ahead and console.log this string value
and take a look what happens
so you can now see that in my developer
tools we've got a string with no white
space so it's nice and compact ready to
send perhaps via an HTTP request to our
back-end and store it where we want it
to be processed because most back-end
languages have the ability to pass JSON
that composite go ahead and storage
record within here in a database or
wherever required</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
