up with hosting now hosting can be a
real pain to get set up particularly
managing your hosting and also scaling
your hosting if you need to then you
might have found yourself in the
position where for example you're unable
to update your PHP version or you're not
able to go into your server and update
PHP settings and this can be really
annoying so in this series we're going
to be walking through pretty much
everything you need to know to get your
hosting set up on digital ocean and
digitalocean is a really great way to
host with very little cost a little time
and little effort and what you'll have
by the end of this series is a server
that you can fully manage you can upload
to you can access with the domain name
so we're going to be looking at
attaching a domain to our server and
we'll be covering all of this so you're
literally ready to go now if you're a
little bit worried about not using a
hosting service like GoDaddy or any
other solution that basically sets
everything up for you you don't need to
worry either
so digitalocean has made it really easy
to get everything you need installed and
working so that includes Apache PHP
MySQL and obviously the operating system
you're running on to something like
Linux now there will be a slight
learning curve so it might take you a
little longer but trust me it will save
you a lot of time in the future by
hosting this way so for example if you
need to go ahead and update your PHP
version you can jump right into your
server and update it yourself or you can
go ahead and install additional services
you might need and if by the end of the
series you're still stuck with anything
digitalocean has this amazing community
with loads of tutorials to learn staff
and they also have a forum where you can
ask questions as well just so you know
this video has been created literally
from a pure love of digital ocean is
thing to do with an affiliation we're
not being paid to promote digitalocean
but it really is a great service and a
great community so it's purely just a
recommendation so for everything you
need to get set up let's head over to
the next video where we'll be creating a
digital ocean droplet oh and before you
do that make sure you go ahead and sign
up for a digital ocean account</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
