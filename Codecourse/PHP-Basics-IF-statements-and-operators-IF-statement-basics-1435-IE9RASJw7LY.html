your application by checking a certain
condition and then running some code
based on whether that evaluates to true
or false
now we've already covered the boolean
variable type and we've already seen a
really basic example of an if statement
but let's dive into if statement and
take a closer look so you'll use if
statements quite often when building
applications and they're pretty
straightforward but we're also gonna be
talking about some best practices when
using them just to make sure your code
ends up as clean as possible
easy to read and easy to maintain so
first let's just to find out a variable
and check this under a condition so
we're gonna say day of week and set this
to one so let's just assume that one
represents a Monday and we want to
output what day of the week it is based
on what this value holds the first thing
we might do is create our if statement
so remember we have the if keyword we
have our condition within rounded
parentheses and then we have square
brackets just here to represent the
block we want to be run now to compare
if day of a week is equal to one what we
don't do is say day of week equals one
what we're technically doing here is
reassigning the variable so if we were
checking that day of week equals two
then down here what actually is going to
happen is day of week will end up being
the value of two and we can prove that
by refreshing the page so we've got to
be really careful here when we compare
things we use either a double equals or
we use a triple equals now triple equals
is a little bit different we're gonna
speak about that later that also
compares the type but let's stick to a
simple double equals for now so if day
of week equals one then we want to echo
out it is Monday simple as that so let's
get rid of this echo down here and let's
go ahead and refresh the page so we know
that this works if we switch this over
to two we know that this statement here
doesn't evaluate to true or this
condition here because we're comparing
the value to one which will return false
because day of week is
- and therefore we don't see anything so
now that we've done this we need to deal
with the other days of the week so for
this we could use an else to output
something if this condition is false so
for example I could say else run another
block if this condition here doesn't
evaluate to true and I could say
something generic like it is not Monday
like that so now we have that - in there
we're saying it is not Monday and again
when we switch this over to one we see
it is Monday now in this case what we've
built isn't very flexible at all ideally
what we'd want to do is check every
single option and output something
according to that so if it's one it's
Monday - it's Tuesday so on right up
until Sunday now just to warn you this
here isn't the best way to deal with
this problem we're going to demonstrate
this very very quickly but then I'm
gonna show you a better way to do this
so let's go over and in here rather than
say else we're gonna say else if and
then we have a new condition so in this
case we're gonna say if the day of the
week equals to remember that double
equals then we want to go ahead and run
another block and then we can literally
just keep chaining these on so I'm gonna
say else if day of week is three I want
to run another block so in this case
we'll just stick to Monday Tuesday and
Wednesday so let's go ahead and fill
these in and here as well so Wednesday
and then if we change this up so for two
we see the following let's change it
back to one we see Monday and of course
if we change it to 3 we see Wednesday
and anything outside of this we won't
see anything because there's nothing to
deal with this now if you wanted to do
this for every single day of the week
and then you wanted to say that it isn't
a valid day of the week if it falls
outside of the scope of one to seven
then you could go ahead and implement an
else for this so let's just imagine for
the sake of this so we can save a bit of
time that there are only three days in
the week now else and this is our final
else we're going to say that is not a
valid
day so now if we choose say four five
six or seven we would see that is not a
valid day because none of these
conditions here have been met so as I
said you could continue this on and on
until you've checked every single option
from one to seven but this isn't the
cleanest solution now to actually create
a cleaner solution to this can you think
of a better way to assign a specific
number to a string we've already looked
at them you would use an array for this
so what I'm gonna do is just divert away
from if statements very quickly and
we're gonna go ahead and implement this
so you have a practical example of how
you would actually do this and then
we're going to return to some more
complex things later so if it doesn't
make sense them all well we'll see you
later so the first thing I would do in
this case is go ahead and just assign an
array to a variable maybe something like
weekdays or more appropriately days of
week this would now be an array and what
we could do is we could assign one the
value Monday we could do two and assign
the value Tuesday and we could basically
just do this over and over again so
three Wednesday now what we're doing
here is we are creating numerical
indexes on our own so when we do a var
dump on days of week we should see in
the browser that the following one is
Monday two is Tuesday and so on now what
we would do is we would up here say day
of week now let's say this is something
that a user has provided so maybe they
choose one now down here we can create
an if statement to check if this value
provided is within here now to do this
what we would do is say in array now
what we need to do is pick out the keys
here so to do that we would use a
function called array keys and then we
would go ahead and say days of week so
just so this makes complete sense let's
just
take this part out go down here and
let's go ahead and do a VAR dump on this
so I'm gonna comment this out and we'll
take a look at what this gives us you
can see here we have a new array with 1
2 &amp;amp; 3 you can ignore the keys in this
case because they've just been reset now
again if this doesn't make sense don't
worry we'll be covering things like this
later but this is just an example just
so you know so the in array function
that I've used here takes the value so
for example 1 2 3 or 4 and this will
give us a true or false value so the day
of the week that we've provided is just
called day of week what we're saying
here now is if this evaluates to true
which is the result of the inner a
function we take a first parameter in
here which is the day that we've
specified we take the array keys which
is 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 and we're checking if this is
within these values here so if that's
the case we can then echo out days of
week and then at the day of week that we
gave so this might seem a little bit
complicated but by the end of the series
this will make complete sense so let's
give that a refresh Monday here we say
Tuesday Wednesday and so on now if I
were to do for this doesn't work but
what we could do you say else and then
say that is not a valid day there we go
because we haven't defined for in here
if we were to define for in here like
this but obviously that is a Thursday
then this would work so a little bit of
a diversion there but if that doesn't
make sense take a look at this code very
carefully and see if you can really work
out what's going on here hopefully that
makes sense though okay so let's move on
to nesting almost anything in PHP can be
nested inside another block if you have
blocks so for example let's build out a
very small thing that goes ahead and
tells us our name and then also will go
ahead and tell us if we have a long
name so if I were to define out my name
here so Alex and I were to create an if
statement just here we're gonna say if
name so we make sure that's set we're
gonna echo out your name is and then
we're gonna concatenate on name so this
should be pretty straightforward we have
a name to find if we do have a name
defined then we echo out so let's go
ahead and refresh here your name is Alex
if for example this was set to null as
we saw earlier null inside of an if
statement will evaluate to false and we
don't see anything so I hope do that
make sense okay so now what happens if
we have a pretty long name well what we
can do is we can nest an if statement
inside of this if statement block so
let's say my name was Alexander James
Garrett which is actually my name then
we can in here create another if
statement to see if this is a very long
name now to do this we're going to be
using a function that we've not looked
up and that is STR Len now this stands
for string length and if we pass in a
value like name this will give us back a
number of characters of our name so in
this case we can say well is this
greater than 10 and we haven't looked at
these kind of comparison operators yet
but we will do later then we're going to
echo out oh and you have a very long
name like so give that a refresh there
we go your name is Aleksandra jane Skara
oh and you have a very long name and to
make this a bit better we could put a
dot just in there and that would go
ahead and create two sentences for us
now if I change this back to Alex like
so we see your name is Alex and we don't
see that other string so you could
technically nest as many if statements
as you needed you could nest something
else in here and then you could nest
something else inside of that but
essentially this makes your code very
unreadable and also very difficult to
maintain as well just looking at it it's
pretty confusing so here's another way
to write this out exactly what we've
done here but make it a little bit
cleaner now we're going to be interests
using something called the inversion
operator here so what we want to do is
first of all check if we don't have a
name and then not do anything so to do
this we're going to create an if
statement and we're gonna say if not
using an exclamation mark name now in
this case this block will be run if we
don't have a name so in this case we
might do something like return which
will basically break the execution of
the script and nothing will be run now
to prove this down here I'm just gonna
echo out hello and we're gonna go ahead
and see this so if I go ahead and
refresh we see hello if I were to change
this to null we don't see anything
because at this point here the scripts
been broken and nothing else down here
will be run okay so now that we know
that that works what we can now do is
just leave this on its own it just makes
a little bit more sense and down here we
can do things we want to do if there is
a name because we know if there's no
name it would have been killed at this
point so let's return our name to Alex
or whatever your name is and then we're
gonna go ahead and echo out here your
name is and we can concatenate that on
like so there we go now let's
concatenate on a final full stop and
again you can use double quotes here if
you prefer go ahead and refresh your
name is Alex now what we can do on the
next line is use that same check using
STR Len to check if the name so the
length of the name is greater than 10
and then down here we can say oh and you
have a long name like so so a lot
cleaner than nesting it's always a good
idea to try not to nest if you can and
there we go change this over to
Aleksandr James Garrett and there we go
it works exactly the same way but we've
kept this all to one level and it's a
lot tidier so now we're going to look at
the other things that will cause a if
statement to be run now earlier we spoke
about how one is a true value and zero
is not and we know that if we do if
true for example then this will always
be run so this will always be run let's
take a look and there we go we know that
we can't get away from this because true
we'll always evaluate to true similarly
if we have false this will never be run
so pretty straightforward now the thing
to always think about is if you are
using numbers inside of a condition if
one then echo this will always be run
this kind of makes sense because one is
a truth devalue let's refresh and we see
this will always be run now if I were to
say if zero zero kind of is a false
value so we don't see that block run so
really important to be careful with
these kind of things however if I was to
say if minus five what do you think is
going to happen here well this will be
run this doesn't make too much sense
really if we think about it because
technically you would cast this as a
negative or false value but it's
important to note that any positive
number will always evaluate to true zero
will always evaluate to false and any
minus integers that aren't zero will
always be evaluate to true as well so
the reason that I bring this up is that
sometimes things can get a little bit
more complicated when you're using an if
statement if you're putting a variable
into a if statement condition first try
and understand what you're working with
and we can do that using var dump as
we've already seen if you're not too
sure so that pretty much covers what we
want to look at with if statements you
should be able to now create if
statements and create variables and use
these to check if a condition has been
run and we've looked at some practical
examples along the way as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
