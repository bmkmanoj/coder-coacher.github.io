look at an effective way of preventing
form spam so any automated messages that
are received as part of a form based on
your website and personally I've used
this and it's been extremely effective
for example going to perhaps 100 emails
or automated emails a day via a contact
form to probably not even one a week so
this could still let spam through
depending on how your site is being
targeted this will determine obviously
how effective is but it's such a simple
change in whatever language you're
working in that is worth giving a go so
I'm working in PHP I'm going to
demonstrate the functionality of this
and how to prevent this this kind of
form spam with PHP but whatever language
you're working with it doesn't matter
the theory is the same and it's equally
as easy to implement with any web-based
technologies so here you can see we have
a contact form relatively
straightforward we have the ability to
enter a name email address and a query
and you can see on the right I've just
got my element inspector open and I can
just have a look at what we have in the
in the mark-up because we're going to
make some sort of fundamental changes to
the mark-up which don't affect the user
but do actually affect automated
submission of this form so we're going
to consider making this change we're
going to give this a little test out so
at the moment what's going to happen is
I can go ahead and enter a name and
email address and the query and by
hitting send this basically pulls us
over to contact PHP detects that these
fields are available have been submitted
to us and then just outputs the text
sends us an email we'd actually have any
functionality working in this instance
now let's just take a look at the code
here we can see that we've basically got
a form 3 field so for a name email and a
text area for the query and a submit
button so this is how a
but would see your code and it would
pick up on the fact that you had three
input fields essentially obviously
textarea isn't an input element but it's
still you know an element that you would
input data into and then it would go
ahead fill these in the values so
something like value equals baat or
whatever they the value of that input it
would do the same for the other two and
then it would submit this form now
there's a small workaround to your form
adding a little bit more markup to
protect against this so let's go ahead
and do this so if we think carefully
about this you're the bot filling out
the form isn't probably isn't half as
intelligent as you think it is so if we
were to go ahead and introduce another
input here that bot would probably
automatically fill that in so let's go
ahead and just introduce a new form
field here this is just going to be the
type of text and we'll give this a name
and let's just say phone for example or
we could just say something like title
so what's going to happen now is we've
introduced a new form onto our page and
when we refresh we can see that that
form is in fact on in within our field
set now the reason for this is that when
a bot sort of hits your site it's going
to fill this in but what we can do is we
know that we don't want this to be
filled in it's not useful to us so we
can actually detect if it has been
filled in and if it has been filled in
we can go ahead and kill our page or
something like that so let's go ahead
and first of all hide this now in mice
in my stylesheet I have a hidden class
which basically has display:none
visibility hidden I'm using both
properties purely for the fact that
screen readers might read this content
out if it still has if it has
display:none so using both just ensures
that the majority at least of screen
readers for visual impaired users won't
read this field out because that would
be detrimental to their experience of
using your site they might think that
you know having to fill out this field
is it's
necessary so in that case we want to
make sure it's definitely hidden there
might be some situations where screen
readers will read this out but you know
the research can be done to to prevent
this go ahead and and check which screen
readers will or won't read this out or
just test it yourself so we can apply
the hidden class to this element and
let's jump back over to our actual page
and refresh you see that that's gone so
now what we can do is we can go ahead
and fill the the query or the form out
hit Send it still sends us an email now
we'll go ahead and just introduce a
little bit more code into our contact
PHP page now basically all this code
does is it checks if the name email and
query have been set so the required
fields have been set and then it goes
ahead and echoes this send us an email
string now what we want to do is we want
to introduce another check in here and
again whichever language you're working
with it doesn't matter we want to
introduce another check to basically
just say if this form field that we
don't want to be filled in is set so
title and we also want to check if it's
not empty
so basically has this field been filled
in if it has then in my case I'm going
to use the PHP Die function which will
basically kill the page and it won't
allow any further any further execution
if you like or anything passed this to
be run so now what we do is we can still
go ahead as a as a sort of legitimate
user submit the details that we need to
submit in hit Send however if I was a
bot let's go ahead and just modify this
and show you what happens so in here I'm
going to go ahead and add an attribute
and this is going to be value and I'm
just going to add say mr. so if this
field has been filled out by looking at
the source our bot by BOTS looking at
the source when we hit send nothing
happened so what's happened now is bot
has come along
seen these four fields filled out off
all four fields but we as developers
know that that field shouldn't have been
filled out and therefore we can just
kill the page so what we've now done is
and that is it we've implemented a
simple solution to basically kill a page
if a hidden field has been filled out
which obviously we don't require and
that is it as I said I've used this and
it's been extremely effective so you
know if you are suffering with the same
problem go ahead and implement it and
hopefully it will be as effective</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
