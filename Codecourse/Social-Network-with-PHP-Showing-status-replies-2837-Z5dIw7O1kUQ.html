want to show the replies under here we
already have the mark-up for that which
we commented out remember so if we just
bring that back quickly we can see what
that looks like and it will be one for
every status now so we've got Billy yes
it's lovely but obviously this we need
to tidy up a little bit we need to loop
through the actual replies because they
remember can be more than one reply we
can insert all the users data to that as
well so with this then around this we
need to do a loop so we need to say for
each status replies as reply to remember
on our status model we have a replies
relationship which we have already seen
and we can just end the for each there
and we'll indent that so now if a user
if a user status doesn't have a reply we
won't see it but if it does we will see
that reply there so let's go ahead and
tidy this up and make it relevant
information so again we have the media
object for the user profile you can
reuse these templates if you want chop
it up make sure make sense this is
pretty verbose and we're repeating a lot
of the mark-up but you can go and just
style it how you want and it will make
it a lot easier for you to break it up
yourself so the reply because this reply
is now a status object as well because
remember it's the same model and the
same table we now have a user on reply
so all we need to do for example for the
username you just say reply user get
name or user name like we would do for a
normal status that gives us the fact
that I replied saying yes it's lovely
actually I didn't say that this is just
some some text so don't freak out that
the relationship isn't right here we
should be seeing what's so funny so what
we can actually do here is we can say
reply body simple as that and we see
what's so funny we need to update the
time as well so it's exactly the same
thing we use in carbon on the created so
we can just say reply
created create to that rather diff for
humans and we have our like stuff here
but we've not reached that point yet so
we'll leave that let's implement the alt
text for the profile image so that is
reply user get name or user name and the
avatar URL which is reply user get
avatar URL that's that method and let's
just check how we're doing okay so it's
already looking pretty good and of
course we want to link off to the users
profile this particular users profile
and we have our root helper function for
that and it's profile index and
obviously we passed in that username
which is reply user username and we can
just copy this and paste it down to here
for that users text link when we refresh
we can click through to Alex's profile
obviously click through to Billy's
profile and there we go so we've got all
that information there and everything is
set up so we're now looping through the
replies and we're outputting them we can
reply again so I can write a question
mark in then that goes ahead and adds
another reply if we head over to Firefox
just sign out as Dale I'm gonna go ahead
and sign in as Billy and we're gonna
reply again to this so let's say nothing
reply there we go - Billy is now replied
to that head over there and we see that
change as well there we go so there we
go that's how we loop through the
replies that we created in the last part
and show them on the timeline</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
