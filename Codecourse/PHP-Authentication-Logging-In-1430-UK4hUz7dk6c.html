but we can't actually log in so it's
pretty pointless at the moment but in
this part we're going to look at
creating our login routes much like we
did with the register routes so we
should be pretty comfortable with that
now but we're also gonna look at a few
other things and we're gonna look at
middleware we're going to look at before
middleware so what happens before a
request to our application and this is
the point where we're going to check if
a session is set and then we're going to
create a slim container object that's
going to represent our user so we can
check if a user is signed in so let's
start with the basics and create our
view for our login and our route so we
can actually see the page and we'll go
ahead and add it to our navigation and
then we will start to lock the user in
and we'll create all these other things
along the way so let's close everything
off and just start fresh we are going to
create a new route under earth remember
that's where our register route is this
is going to be our login route so let's
save this here there's login dot PHP and
of course this is going to be ah yep
login and then we're going to render a
view from here so let's also name this
as well so we don't forget and we don't
see any errors so we're going to call
that login so we can reference that
within our navigation easily
okay so let's create our view now so
remember under earth we have register
will put login next to this so login dot
PHP and we'll just say login page and
let's render that for you from here so
remember we do app render auth and then
the name of the views how to login dot
PHP so now when we visit log in out of
course we need to add it to our routes
file just here so let's add that in
there and we have another error so we
see undefined variable app so let's go
back to our login root and just see
that's because we didn't allow app to be
in that global in
under this scope so that work now so
we've got our login page so let's build
up our login form then again what we're
gonna doing going to be doing is just
stealing the template from here
remember this extends the default
template so we'll just paste this in we
will have login as the title and we'll
have login here and then we just see the
following so we get our title up here we
get our navigation as normal
and while we're at it let's add to our
navigation so let's add login and we'll
say URL for login remember we name that
root their login so there we go so we
can now start to switch between these
pages so let's build the form so under
here let's create a form the action is
going to be to URL for login dot post
and we're gonna have a method here of
post I'm going to turn autocomplete off
so we're gonna do a similar thing to
what we did in the register view we're
gonna have a label here for our email or
our username now we're gonna call this
identifier because what we're gonna
allow the user to do is either sign in
with their username or their email it
doesn't matter what they provide it will
be looked up regardless so I'm gonna
call this identifier so in here we'll
say username slash email and then we'll
create our input here type of text this
name is going to be identifier and the
ID will be identifier as well so we have
that now we need to ask these if their
password so we can copy this paste it in
there and we'll change this to password
change the label text to password and
change the type here to password and
these two as well so the name and the ID
ok so then finally we have our submit
button which is just going to be an
input type of submit and the value is
going to be login that's what the user
is going to see so we have a following
and the reason we get this error now
obviously is because we don't have a
login post root so under our root file
here let's say app post login have our
function put app in this scope and we'll
name this login post and we'll say forum
posted there we go
so we've got our roots complete so let's
now focus on actually posting the forum
and what we do within here which is
obviously just signing the user in so
what we want to do them is the same as
we did with register we want to pull in
the app request object which is going to
give us the ability to pull in the
identifier and the password so let's
call this identity fire also request
post identifier and we have the password
so the identifier that can either be the
username or the email and we have these
as password so we want to validate this
as well so let's start validating now so
we're going to say V equals app
validation we'll say V validate we'll
pass in our validation rules here so we
have the identifier this needs to be or
rather we passed in the data and then
this new just needs to be required we
don't need to do any checking here
because we're not inserting anything and
we have the password which is also
required so if the validation passes we
can log the user in we obviously need to
check their password and things like
that otherwise down here we want to
render or login we want to pass in our
errors again so we pass errors through
manually
and we want to pass in the request
objects as well so we can grab the data
that they've previously submitted we
don't have to add this to the form but
we can if we want as long as we have
requests past our view so now then if we
hit login this is actually an error so
it's not doing anything it's just
passing us back without errors so now
let's update our view to actually give
us then errors so we do exactly the same
thing as we did for registration we say
if errors first identifier and we end
that if there and then we output errors
first identifier so let's check this
there we go identifier is required and
we can do the same thing for the
password as well like so then if we
submit with nothing we get that so let's
not output the previous data for the
identifier or certainly not the password
we'll just leave this as it is but you
can feel free to add this in if you want
to let's now focus on what happens if
the validation does actually pass so the
first thing we want to is look up the
user where the identifier which
remembers the email or the username is
equal to the one that's been given so
we're gonna say user equals app user
where username equals the identifier or
where and this is getting a little bit
long so what I'm gonna do is just pull
this down to the onto the next line just
it's a little bit more readable and say
where or email equals the identifier so
if I was to submit through to the form
Alex it would pick up this record
because the username equals the
identifier and if I passed in tabi at
Koko's com it would pull back this
record because the email equals the
identifier so what we want to do from
that is pull back the first record and
now what we can do is check first of all
if a record has been found if it hasn't
been found
then we
you can't you lock the earrings we can't
find the users account and we also want
to check if the password matches as well
so the if statement here is going to be
if user so essentially if this record
can't be found user will be null so we
need to make sure the user actually does
exist and app hash password check
remember that's the method that we
implement implemented in our hash helper
here to verify a password so if they are
both true we obviously need to pass in
the data here first of all so we pass in
the password that the user submitted up
here and we passed through the users
password and we access that from this
object by just passing in the password
like that so that will pull in this
password hash and it will compare it to
the password that the user gave if
that's the case we'll just say fine and
otherwise we'll kill the page down here
and say error so let's check this out if
I hit login we obviously get these so we
can say Alex at Koko's home which
doesn't exist error tabi at code course
comm which does exist I'm typing in the
actual real password here it's just the
string password we get fine if I type in
Alex which is the username of this
account and I type in the correct
password we get fine if I type in Alex
and a rubbish password we get error so
we know that this works now we just need
to you know tidy this up and do
something okay so if the username or the
email and password were not accepted we
can flash a message and redirect the
user so we're gonna say else app Flash
global we already know how the session
flashing works could not log you in and
then we want to redirect the user so we
say app responds redirects app URL for
home so we're just redirecting the user
to the URL for the home root so now if
we just type in a letter
I could not lock you in so that's fine
ah if the user can be logged in so if
they if their password matches and that
account exists we want to set a session
so I'm going to say session now where do
we get the session name from well cast
your mind back to the start of the
series when we looked at configuration
we actually have in here or sessions
that's the name of the session and all
this allows us to do is easily change
this if we want to if we're using it
elsewhere which we probably will be
doing so we're gonna say app config get
both sessions that's the session name
and we're gonna assign that the value
user ID so that we're storing the user
ID in that session so obviously secure
because sessions are stored on our
server or as secure as it can be because
sessions are being stored on our server
so this can't be accessed or modified by
anyone so once we've done that we want
to flush a message and redirect the user
so we're gonna flash global you are now
signed in and we will redirect as well
so app responds redirect where do we
want to redirect to where we want to go
to the URL for home again
so either way okay so what we could do
just to tidy this up is we could take
this out pull this in get rid of this
and paste that down there so all this is
doing is flashing a certain message but
then after this if statement we're just
redirecting the user off so that's all
nice and tidied up so now when I hit
login
you see nothing so I can load of rubbish
could not lock you in we can type in a
real username and password and analysis
you are now signed in however just
notice we're redirecting back to the
home page when what we should really be
doing is redirecting back to the login
page so let's just change that in there
there we go looks a lot nicer perfect
okay so now that we've done that then we
are actually setting a session so let's
just pull up our developer tools and go
over to resources and over to cookies
localhost we have PHP session IDs this
is the session ID for the current
session we're using this will be
initiated when we do session start in
start PHP which we've already done but
we know that we are setting a session
anyway so we now I'll actually
technically logged in but we're not
doing anything about being logged in so
this is where things get a little bit
more difficult in terms to understand if
you're not familiar with middleware so
the middleware that we're gonna be
creating is going to be executed for
every request to the application and
what that'll allow us to do is modify
the state of the application based on
what happens in that middleware so what
we're going to do is under code course
and let's just tidy this up so it's a
little bit easier to read so under code
course we're going to create a new
folder called middle where and what we
do is we attach this to slim and like I
said this this is run at any point in
your application either before or after
the request your application and it
modifies the current request and all
that means in the case for logging in is
if the session is set here so if we do
have a session set we want to turn the
application into a state of being logged
in so let's create a before middleware
and we will be adding to this later on
in the series so it's a really useful
thing to have here so we're gonna call
this before middle ware dot PHP I'm
going to namespace this under code
course middleware and if this has make
sense at all it will do at some point so
we're gonna say plus before middle where
and we need to extend middleware now
what is middleware well this doesn't
exist at the moment what we do need to
do is import slim middleware like that
so this now extends it
so we have a method in here called coal
which is run when this middleware is
used so we're going to say call we can
test this out just by echoing hello and
then all we do is we run the next
request or for this on to the next
request so we say this next call so all
this will do now is when we attach it to
our app it'll echo hello before every
request which obviously isn't what we
want it's that silly so how do we attach
this middleware to our app well and the
start what we can do is after we define
slim we can say app add and then we say
new code course middle where before
middleware now I don't like this so what
I'm gonna do is just gonna get rid of
this I'm gonna say knew before
middleware and up here I'm gonna say use
code course middleware before middleware
like that so we've added that middleware
to our application let's see what
happens so when I hit until we see hello
when I go on to the next page so this is
really pointless at the moment but what
our middleware is actually intended to
do is before every request we want to
check if that session is set and then
like I said set authentication on so we
want to say that the user is
authenticated but we need to start out
with the state of the user not being
authenticated and we're gonna add this
as or basically to our container so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna say app
off equals false that's all we're gonna
do so this is adding this off to the
container which is currently false and
that means what we can do is elsewhere
in our application say something like if
app or just a really easy way to check
now if app is true or not false then we
have a user object attached to this off
which means that we can grab information
then about the currently signed in user
and again if this doesn't make too much
sense don't worry we'll be demonstrating
this in just a minute when we update our
navigation to welcome the user so we'll
see this in action so over to our before
middleware then what we need to do is
hook on a method to run within this
class
to be run before every request for
application you don't need to do this
but it just makes things a little bit
tidier so I'm gonna say this app hook
not app app hook so this app hook
slimmed up the fork so before the
request to every application we want to
run a method on this class and that
method is going to be run so we can
create a new method here called run and
that's gonna run request before
everything to our applications so hello
and then it does exactly the same thing
so we can now put the functionality in
here to check if a user is authenticated
so this might seem like a really long
way winded way of doing things but it
just means that you're separating the
parts of your application that do
certain things into smaller chunks which
make life a lot easier when you need to
go and update them you don't have to go
through lots of lots of code so the
check then to see if the user is
authenticated to checking if that
session is set so we just say if is set
dollar underscore session you need to
provide the session name which remember
comes from our configuration so this app
config yet warth session so if that is
set user is authenticated so how do we
override this authenticated State
remember in start dot PHP oath is false
so all we need to do is set this or
equal to getting that user record so we
need to pull that user in this will
store all of the information about them
in this auth then we can use that
anywhere so we just say this app user
that's how user model we use the query
builder to build up this and we're gonna
say where the ID is equal to and then
the session name again which we can just
still straight from here again so let's
pull this paste that in there and there
we go so this will return the user
record where the ID equals the ID from
the session it was store in or
or here will no longer be false and we
now have something attached to our
container that we can use so let's take
a look at how this works so I've
refreshed the page or will now be my
user account so to test this out you can
do down here of our dump on App earth so
I guess we can try and fire dump this
inside of here to see what's going on
okay so that seems to be working there
we're getting that out oh of course
so the reason this isn't working is
inside of start we're doing this just
here and this is before the app is run
now the app is run at the point when we
hit in next stop here to be here so the
only option we have just to test this
out very quickly is to say app or here
because run will run that middleware in
the order that we need so now we see the
following so we've got this at the
bottom the page we've got our user out
there so what we could do is we could
say app author user name and this isn't
going to work and we'll see why so
undefined property and in the for
middleware what we're doing is we're
pulling in this record but we're not
grabbing the first record so if we just
add that in that will pull back the
first record so we now see string Alex
we're signed in as Alex so after all
that then hopefully that will make sense
now it's always a little tricky to try
and understand these things let alone to
bug them but we're now good to go what
we can do now is start to update things
and we're going to start with the
navigation so under views partials
navigation if the user is signed in we
do not want to show register and login
because they don't need to login and
they don't need to register so how do we
know if the user is signed in or not
well ideally what we want to do is
something like the following
if Earth
show something or else hide something ah
we don't have or fail abou in our views
so what we need to look at is sharing
data or appending data to views and we
can do this now before middleware so
down here what we can do is say this app
view append data and we can pass in an
array of data that we want to share with
views this is going to be off this app
or like we just output a minute ago so
now we have this off value from our
container which is either false if the
user isn't signed in or an object if the
user is signed in in our all of our
views this will share with all of our
views so now that we've got that under
navigation we can say something like if
or else and we can wrap these in that
else and if so in here we'll just say
logged in or something and there we go
so we get logged in like that there we
go
we're signed in we can't register or
login we technically can go to register
but we're going to be preventing that a
bit later so what we're gonna focus on
then is if off we're not gonna do
anything but what we are going to do at
the top of here is we're gonna output to
the user their name so we need to
opt-out our user model to provide us
with an easy way to get the users full
name or if they don't have a full name
just get their username so to start with
let's say if off hello
user name and let's just put this in a
paragraph so so there we go - hello
username now we could obviously just say
something like auth dot username so that
would work like so because remember we
are pulling that author is now our user
object or a user model so we can just
pull the values from it but we want to
update our model to output our first and
last name or if that doesn't exist or
either or don't exist will output our
username so let's update this then and
we are going to implement a method to
get the full name first of all so I'm
gonna call this get full name and all
this does is checks if this referring to
the current state of the model when we
use it first name so if no first name or
no last name return null to return
nothing or we could return false
otherwise we want to return this first
name a space and then this last name
that's it
so get full name will now get the users
full name so we can add this just
quickly to test here we can say get full
name we get null because we don't have a
name it's just very quickly update this
and there we see the full name ah what
we want to do implement now is a method
to get the full name or the user name if
the full name isn't available so get
full name or user name so that's
obviously a method and all we're gonna
do is return this get full name now if
the full name doesn't exist or well we
return null which is what we're doing if
it doesn't exist then we're going to
output this username all this means is
output this value if it's there
otherwise output this that's what that
means so what we can now do is test this
get full name or username method on our
navigation so get full name or username
we obviously see our full name but if we
don't have a first name or last name and
that's null B's then we see our username
and we're gonna be using this throughout
the app it's gonna be really useful to
be able to do this because for example
if you're sending an email to a user you
might want to address them by their full
name which is polite or you might want
to address them by the username but you
can switch between them with this method
so although that was a little bit
long-winded we now have the ability to
sign in to our account we've learned
about middleware and why we created it
to check if that session set and then
update the state of our app we've shared
data without view which we can then use
to check within our navigation if the
user is authenticated and we can output
a little message to them and then we've
wrapped this somewhat within our
navigation to output register and login
only if the user isn't authenticated so
we're not gonna be looking at logging
out just yet what we're gonna do in the
next video is go on to setting up email
so we can actually send email so we're
gonna send an email when the user
registers that's just going to drop them
an email say you have created a new
account
I'm gonna do this using PHP mailer but
we're gonna create our own wrapper to be
able to send email so pretty long-winded
but it's just gonna mean that inside of
our app we're gonna be able to send
email in a really nice way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
