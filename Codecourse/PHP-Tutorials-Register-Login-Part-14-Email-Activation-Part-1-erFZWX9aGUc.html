users to register and unfortunately we
are by default not allowing them to
login the reason being is if I go over
to my database table we have this active
column here and if you remember back
when we were creating the login process
we were checking this value and if it
was 0 we weren't allowing the users to
login so let's just take a look at a
quick demonstration so my users tables
empty I've deleted my user account from
before so let's go ahead and register a
new account here and I'm going to call
this Billy I'm going to go ahead and
give a password twice first name and
then I'll just say Billy a PHP academy'
dog click on register we registered ok
so to the end user which I now AM I'm
going to go ahead and just login into my
password and click login ok so we get
this error we try to log you in but you
haven't activated your account and that
is because when we register the user and
we have this let's just have a look oh
sorry now we need to be in the login
file there we go so if user active
username equals false we have this
function in here user active which
checks whether the users account has
been activated so the point of this
video we're going to look at actually
forcing the user to activate their
account by email so for things like spam
automated sign ups things like that we
need a user to physically go to their
inbox click a link be redirected to our
website obviously that will change
depending on where you're hosting your
site and then it will pass through the
email address and it and a special code
that we're going to generate
and and that'll activate the users
account then we'll have a series of
checks now it's not actually a very hard
process at all I'd say probably the
hardest thing here would be to actually
get email working if you're testing
locally so if you're on your computer
right now using Apache and MySQL as part
of a package or in its own so exam or
WAMP or something like that
you may find that you know local mail is
not going to work in straight-up it
almost won't now i've configured my PHP
to ini file on my send mail dot ini file
configured that to PHP academy' dogs
mail servers that allow me to send mail
from my PC now you probably won't have
done this and you can't do this because
you need email username and password
authorization so if you do have an SMTP
server that you can use maybe your your
college or your school or university
whatever then you can go ahead and do
that and they may allow it however if
not then I recommend you upload this
what you're working on now to a public
server so you can use them PHP mail
function and the PHP mail function is
extremely simple to use so the first
thing we're going to do is go ahead and
look at this and if you are following
along go ahead and test this and see if
it works so I'm just going to go ahead
and save this in my root directory and
I'm just going to call it mail test dot
PHP so the mail function looks like this
it takes typically four parameters for
us all we need really the first one is
two so the email address that we are
sending to the second the subject then
the body and then the headers of the
email now we actually need to send an
email and this isn't to send an email
efficiently ie
you know it might may be caught by spam
control or anything like that there are
more advanced methods of you know
sending email but for now we can stick
to this if I wanted to send an email to
say Billy at PHP academy' to org with
the subject hello and the body hello
this is a test
oops test email
now the headers is we can specify who
where the email comes from and this is
all that's really required it's not even
required for most most cases but here we
can add a sort of a user friendly name
so I could say from hello at PHP
academy' to org for example so when I
run this script we're going to send an
email to this address with this subject
this body in this header which will say
from so let's go ahead and check this
out
so mail test dot PHP and everything
seems to have not worked but nothing's
no errors have been returned and when i
refresh the email account here I'm
logged in to my email this is external
email as well I have this email and
that's been sent from my PC and you'll
see there it's from hello a PHP academy'
- org - obviously this email account and
hello this is a test email so women
you're in the position where you can use
email then you'll be able to actually
allow your user to activate by email so
when I mean this has been somewhat of an
introduction but we'll obviously look at
actually you know getting in and doing
this in the next part of the video this
is really just to warn you that you are
going to need to be able to send the
email from your account anyway what
would the process that's going to happen
here is as I said we're going to modify
the register page not not very much we
need to create a new field in our
database which will store this
activation key we'll be emailing the
user a link that they can click on or
copy and paste and paste into their your
browser bar URL bar and what this will
do is it will pick up their email
address in this code it will obviously
make sure that that email address exists
a read-only validating any accounts that
don't exist otherwise we'll return an
error we want to check the email address
and the code provided match on the same
account so for example Billy at PHP
academy' 2 org and the code will be some
long md5 hash of the user name plus the
microtime we'll get into this in a
moment it's not very complicated
and from from there if the two pieces of
information match we'll update the table
and set active to one obviously where
that user account is we won't meet
updating all of them so it seems like a
relatively difficult thing to actually
do but if you logically think about it
there's steps that you need to take in
order to allow users to activate their
account and it's not actually that hard
we'll probably just take up a couple of
parts of video so this has been the
almost introduction so it deserves an
introduction and in the next part we'll
be moving on to actually gain this
working and starting to modify
everything so we're in the next part
we'll start to get this working</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
