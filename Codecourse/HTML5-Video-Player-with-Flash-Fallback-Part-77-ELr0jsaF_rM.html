hopefully be the last part of the
tutorial here on html5 video so we're
just going to be doing a little bit of
testing now just on the content that
we've made now in the last video we did
look at internet explorer and how we've
got this working in an older version
this is the Flash plugin so as you can
see the video is playing we can skip to
different parts of it the skin that we
made is now linked up correctly and it
works so that's great this is it in
chrome we've got the JavaScript's here
so big small normal battle works this is
the HTML play so it's not loading the
plugin it's just loading the HTML and
nothing else again we can play that skip
across this is a volume controls you can
make it full screen whatever so we've
got working in Chrome Opera this is
already loaded in here first I'm just
going to take this file URL again we can
make it big small normal works in Opera
we can place parts of it so I got a bit
loud the volume controls everything
that's all there in IE so this will be
an interesting one if I just paste that
in here this is not an activex control
warning so if you just allow blocked
content here we've got the play here
which is obviously hidden when your
mouse rolls over it like I say the
browsers use different players and
things like that they use their own
obviously Microsoft uses their owns but
again it does play as you can skip and
change everything and even this works
the JavaScript works in it in IE which
is great firefox I don't believe they'll
be a problem with that no you see a
firefox use a different play as well but
it's all the same the javascript works
that's wonderful if i play that exact
same results so so good volume controls
there i can again maximize it if you
want to
and Safari now Safari has a problem you
shouldn't notice it on my screen once it
loads but basically Safari has an issue
with it which in order to in order to
play the video on windows in Safari you
need quicktime what's finally loaded so
this works for me but if it doesn't work
for you in Safari the reason for it is
that if you're using Windows and
possibly Linux I don't know about that
you will need to install quicktime i
don't think this is the same for Mac
users but Mac users will probably
already have quicktime anyway but again
it does work the javascript works and of
course we've got this placing here so
that might be an error you encounter and
the way that you fix and text test that
is if you just simply download and
install quicktime it might require a
restart but other than that as you can
see we have got it working and we can
skip through it and everything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
