that I have a sequence of numbers going
from 1 to 0 now how would we match this
in our regular expression well of course
we could just do that and we have a
match but what if we wanted to match
that as well well we could make the 4
optional that would work but what if I
wanted to make that match as well we'd
have to make everything optional and
obviously that isn't very practical so
what we can do instead is we can use a
character class so we do this with two
square brackets and inside the fair we
specify the what we call range so if I
just do one to five you'll see that all
numbers between 1 and 5 get highlighted
and I'll just put the fallback in there
if I do 6
sorry 7 to 9 we get 7 8 9 so to
highlight all of these would have to do
0 tonight very simple what if we wanted
to match something like the alphabet
well we do a to Z and it's as simple as
that now it's a little bit different
with capital capitals if we want to
match this as well then we have to pass
in the capital version of A to Z and we
can also match the numbers as well 0
tonight so if we just look inside the
reference go to character classes and
scroll down there we go
this is called a character set and
there's an example we have the vowels
there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
