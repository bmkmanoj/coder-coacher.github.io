make sure that we're tracking tweets so
we're not replying to the same person
again and again each time we run this
script so you're going to want to create
a database create a table called
tracking and you're just going to need
two things you don't even need an auto
incrementing ID but you definitely need
the twitter ID so this needs to be
stored as a big integer and this will
have a length of 20 and over here you
can already see I have a list of things
that I've already been replying with and
I don't want to get rid of these because
it will go and send a hell of a lot of
tweets so once you have this you'll have
an empty database table which is
absolutely fine just down here we're
going to track each of these now the
solution that we're using at the moment
isn't ideal because for each tweet which
is potentially 20 because remember to
twitter's api only will return you the
most recent 20 tweets we want to execute
a query to just insert this into the
database so we of course need to set our
database up so up the top here I'm just
going to use P vio inside of here for
now so I'm going to create a new PDO
instance this is going to be using MySQL
the host is just localhost and the
database name is let's just check center
bot and we just have a username and a
password in here pretty straightforward
so now what we can do is inside of here
we can create a prepared statement so
let's just call this track and we will
se debe prepare and we will say insert
into tracking we want to insert the
twitter ID and the values that we want
to insert is twitter ID like so and then
we just execute this query passing in
that twitter ID
and that of course is coming from each
of our tweets this contains an ID so we
have tweet ID like so so now if I go and
run this assuming we don't have any
problems we will see these insert into
the database at the moment I've got
forty six rows and there's now 66 so if
I just go and send a tweet we should see
this update so let's go and send this
over to coke course but and just say I
am happy go ahead and tweet this you
should now see this change to 67 because
we would have technically replied to
that person so let's go and check this
out and of course this has jumped right
up because what we're not doing is we're
not only bringing back mentions that
have a last ID now what I mean by this
is if we just head over to the twitter
api we have the ability here to pass in
a sense ID now this will return only
results with an ID greater than the
specified ID what this means is in your
database if we just order by twitter ID
so here you will see that this will be
so the latest tweet what we do is we
pass this into the Twitter API and it
will only give us mentions after this so
let's just say you're in the situation
where you run this every 15 minutes it
will get back the latest 20 tweets they
will be then sent so they'll be replied
to when we get to that they'll be stored
and then when it runs again after 15
minutes it will grab only tweets with a
greater than at this so it's essentially
just queuing these up and this will
obviously mean that we're not replying
to the same person as I've already
mentioned so I guess what we need to do
then is just do a very quick query just
up here this is before we send these to
the mentions and we just need to say
something like last ID and we need to
perform a query just here and this is
going to be select let's just do
everything from the tracking table and
we want to order by the twitter ID i
want to order that in descending order
we want to limit this by one this will
just give us back the last ID so in here
then what we can do in fact we can fetch
the result first so let's go and fetch
this as say an object like so and inside
of here we want to first of all check if
we do have a last ID so we can do a
ternary just in here and if this is the
case the way that we pass this in using
code bird is something like since
underscore ID and that equals a value so
we can pull back our ternary again so
we're going to say last ID if that is
the case we want since ID and then we
want to append on the last ID twitter ID
otherwise we want to pass in nothing to
this so now if we do a VAR dump on
mentions and then just kill the page
here what we should see if we just fix
up this tweet of course I did an
underscore here for some reason there we
go so we see no results which is exactly
what we want now if I go and tweet to
code course but and just say hi there
hit tweet when i refresh this we should
see that one tweet now there's a lot of
data here but this is just one tweet so
now we will perform sentiment analysis
on one tweet we will store that in the
database and then of course we won't
ever see this again because it's already
been stored so let's just get rid of
this VAR dump let's go and come down
here and it's at this point we want to
tweet so let's just test this out will
refresh that will have stored and then
we should see now 87 that's incremented
by one this is the latest tweet and now
of course we're back to square one where
if anyone else tweets us we can go ahead
and perform analysis and then go ahead
and tweet them so that's pretty much it
for the tracking side of things this is
really important because we really don't
want to be spamming people let's go on
to the next part where we're going to
look at replying to the user based on
that emoji that we selected earlier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
