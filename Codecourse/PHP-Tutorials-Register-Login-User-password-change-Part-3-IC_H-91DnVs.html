password tutorial we're going to crack
on and we're going to actually change
the password in the database at this
time and we've already connected to our
database up here let me just show you
we've already connected here so there's
no need to reconnect since that command
always always be already been issued and
we're just going to create a new query
called query change and that is going to
be equal to MySQL query function and now
this is a bit new bit of a code I'm just
going to bring this down so you can see
a bit more easily we're going to use the
update I'm going to say update users'
which if you look here is our table here
so update our users table I'm gonna say
set password equal to MU password making
sure you use inverted commas here and
then I'm going to say this is where my
username is equal to the user variable
that i've got on my page currently now
this here equates to what's in this
column here so since we've already
selected our room we've already selected
our or we've already processed our PHP
session there's equal to Alex so
basically what this what this bit of
code here is doing is saying update the
table change the password to the new
password that the user has entered
because we passed all our checks so this
is a the pass what they want and change
this where the user names Alex so as
this is equal to Alex so basically this
password will be changed because this
username here equals Alex so what we can
do is at the moment we can see this
starts from 900 as soon as we change it
we can refresh and check that it has
actually been changed but what I'm going
to do is I'm going to add a few more
things and let's just put this back up a
bit
ok what I'm going to do is I'm going to
say
let's say die so I'll kill the patient's
do anything else and I'm going to say
your password has been changed and then
I'm going to say I'm going to put a link
in saying return and that's going to
return to the main page and that's index
dot PHP and what I'm gonna do is just
before we kill the page i'm going to
destroy the session so session destroy
and the reason being is because once the
users change their password this link
here will take them back to the main
page and this will destroy that session
so then they're gonna need to login
again using the new password so if we
give this test
remember in here my current password
which is ABC starts with 900 the md5
hash starts with 900 and if I go back
here and I took from my old password
abc123 is my new password and I click
Change Password I passed out all the
validations checked our password has
been changed and we get this sum link to
return back to the main page which takes
us back to here now if I try and sneak
back onto the member page you can see
that you must be logged in our session
has been destroyed as we used our
session destroy' function here and and
also we when when I log back in again
let's say login as Alex and I'm going to
try ABC as my password which is my old
password and by logging in now we can
see that we get an incorrect password
message so in fact if I try one two
three you're in and evidence of this is
shown in here
let's just go back home and click browse
and we come down and you can see that my
password has changed from the start
being nine hundred to 202 therefore this
is a completely new hash and a
completely new password
so that's all working everything's fine
you can see that it's quite simple in
one way to do this and communicate in
another way all you really need to do is
learn your SQL queries I'll probably be
doing a tutorial on this soon if not
you'll be up already and you just need
to think logically about how you need to
check your old password check your two
new passwords obviously when we did our
registration we had a limit for how big
the password could be I'll leave that up
to you to enter another check in here to
check if the password say has to be
bigger than 6 characters or no bigger
than 25 characters long so really
there's a lot of checks you can do and
there's a lot of work that can be done
on this but this is the basic skeleton
for changing a password in PHP using a
MySQL database okay so I hope you
enjoyed this if you have any comments or
questions please let me know and make
sure you subscribe for video updates and
I'll see you guys around thanks for
