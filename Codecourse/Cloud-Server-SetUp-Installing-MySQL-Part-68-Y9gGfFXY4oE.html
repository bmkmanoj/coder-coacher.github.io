installing MySQL setting up on the
command line including then using the
MySQL monitor to access databases
perform queries and do the everyday
stuff we need to do so we'll jump right
in with a command to install MySQL and
again we'll use apt-get so we need
sudo apt-get install this time we're
installing MySQL - server and we have
two additional items to include with
this installation
the first is Lib Apache - mod or MySQL
which allows HTTP authentication to your
MySQL server the next is PHP my PHP 5
MySQL which what which is what allows
connections from PHP directly to your
MySQL server which is extremely
important obviously if you're using PHP
and MySQL together let's go ahead and
hit enter here and go ahead and enter
why for that now this time we'll be
asked to start configuring MySQL right
away and the first thing is choosing a
good root password for MySQL so we're
not going to look too much into the
security of MySQL for now but here you
want to go ahead and choose a strong
password now if you need to disable the
root account later we'll get a pop up
for that in just a moment
now we're not quite done yet we need to
go ahead and set up some more things
let's run the mysql install DB command
with sudo this basically activates MySQL
so we now need to run the setup script
so we use sudo user in for binaries and
MySQL secure installation and this is
going to run through a series of
questions and I'm going to go ahead and
type in my current password for root now
it'll ask me if I want to change the
root password in this case I don't it
will now ask me if I want to remove
anonymous users now this is a good move
so let's go ahead and do this and let's
also disallow root log in remotely now
it also asks me if I want to remove the
test database and access to it we'll go
ahead and say yes to this to now it says
reload privileges tables which we need
to do to take all of our options we've
just chosen to effect and then we go
we're all done so we now have MySQL
installed successfully let's take a look
at actually managing our server so we
want to go ahead and use the MySQL
command with the user option and we want
to go ahead and tell MySQL who we want
to login with in this case it's going to
be root now we see we get an access
denied here and that's because we do
have a root password set remember so
let's go ahead now and provide the P
option to tell MySQL be launched to
supply password once we hit enter here
will be asked to give the password that
we set earlier so we're now in we can
show databases use databases create
tables insert data we won't cover this
now as it's a whole other topic you can
manage your MySQL server from now using
the MySQL monitor or if you prefer you
can use something like PHP my admin
which is a
php-based graphical user interface for
MySQL servers you could just place this
in your application your a patchy
application public directory if you're
just messing around and want to you know
create databases create tables and
things like that but please be aware of
security considerations since anyone
would then be able to access PHP myadmin
regardless of the fact that you've got a
root account and password
vulnerabilities any vulnerabilities
found in phpMyAdmin could then be taken
advantage of since you have PHP myadmin
and a public-facing directory so what
we're now gonna next do is look at
setting up SFTP or using SFTP rather to
securely or a more secure way of
connecting to our server to transfer
files quickly and easily</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
