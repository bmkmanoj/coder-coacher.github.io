commenting code and why we should
comment code and then we'll look at a
couple of ways that we can actually
comment code in PHP no commenting code
is extremely important particularly if
you're writing something even for
yourself just noting along the way what
you're doing what certain functions
classes methods do makes all the
difference when you refer back to your
code in the future and also if you're
passing it to someone else to have a
look at it makes it a lot easier for
them to understand your code as well or
it makes it quicker for them to
understand your code so let's take a
look at how we might comment code in PHP
the two main ways that we can comment
code and then a couple of other things
that you you might not realize initially
about commenting so let's go ahead and
just start without PHP declaration at
the top and let's go ahead and just
create a single line comment and this is
two forward slashes so you'll see this
the force of shorter quick commenting
some people do multi-line comment with
single lines so I could say this is a
function that takes a string and convert
it to upper case now despite the fact
that we already have a function in PHP
that converts a string to not the case
that doesn't matter but you know I've
seen commenting like this before and
this this can be the case sometimes more
preferably at least personally and you
can use multi-line column which is a
forward slash in asterisks come a couple
of lines down another asterisks and an
and a forward slash again and then
anywhere inside of here doesn't matter
where you place anything this will then
not be interpreted by PHP so this will
be completely ignored
so for multi-line comments I like to do
something like this
so it it looks a bit nicer but really
this could be used for larger pieces of
functionality methods things like that
all the tops of pages but really it's
entirely up to you how you make use of
this the main thing is actually
commenting code in the first place and
commenting code doesn't have to be every
line needs to be commented because it
would just look a mess it's only things
that on first glance you might think
we'll that looks a bit complicated I
need to explain what that does now what
we can also do is we can comment in line
so if I was to say echo out a string my
name after this line we can actually use
an inline comment or we could even use a
multi-line comment on one line to
basically comment on a line basis but
after our output so basically this just
saves on saying something like output my
name and instead you can take this and
place this after the line just so as you
read the read-through code it's a little
bit more readable and this comment is
almost like a oh it's a little
afterthought you know this is what this
line does so they're they're the two
ways of we can actually comment our code
and it's like I said before it's
extremely important to comment code as
you go along just helps you when you
refer back to your code and obviously
helps other people take a look at your
code and an understand it a lot better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
