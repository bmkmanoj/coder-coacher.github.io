first two first part of this tutorial
was that the remember me function works
by if it is if the remember me is
selected then a cookie is set with an
expiration of 48 hours in this case you
can set it to whatever amount of time
you want it's in second so however many
seconds you'd like and if it isn't
checked therefore they don't want to be
remembered a session is set now a
session will terminate if you like as
soon as the browser is closed so not
just that window of the browser but all
browser windows that are open and the
session will be terminated and when the
user goes back on they will then be
logged out a cookie will always remain
saved unless the user clears their
cookies inside their browser so you can
go to like like tools options I'm using
Firefox or clear recent history I'm not
sure um how to do it because I don't
have to do it that often but yes you
know the user if they'll remain logged
in so that's basically how that works
but I'm sure most of you already knew
that I just thought I'd clarify it
ok now I'm not going to waste time in
this second part the tutorial setting up
my database all I've done I'll quickly
explain is I have a database called
remember me this is obviously going to
be your websites database or your user
area database of your website and I have
a table could users I've got three
fields one's ID this is an this is auto
increment so for each each row that's
inserted this is going to increment so
the next one will be 2 and then 3 and
then 4 5 and so on and it's also the
primary key which is required when
you're using auto increment it might be
listed as a I if you're using a
different version of PHP myadmin so if
it there's an a I checkbox you need to
check that user name is I actually let
me come into the structure just so you
can see this the user name you see we've
got int here for the type of the ID make
sentence it's a number and integer and
then we've got auto increment and we've
also you can't see here but this is set
primarykey username we've got varchar'
maximum length 25 obviously this is up
to you password now this is important
it's encrypted MD md5 in using md5
encryption so we're using 32 lengths
because they are 32-bit and sorry the
length of the md5 hash will be 32 bits
so where you need to write the 32 for
the length of that varchar okay and then
basically all I did was I clicked insert
and the result of that was if you click
browse you'll see I've put Alex and my
password is in there what I did to gain
this password this is basically 1 2 3
I used a free md5 string encryptor
encrypts a string a plaintext string to
an md5 hash and then basically I just
pasted that in there 32 length of this
32 bits so yeah that's all in there and
we're ready to go ok so inside context
and the first thing we're going to be
creating is the login form ok so and I'm
going to create my PHP tags just up here
quickly just so I know that I'm gonna
add some data in there I'm going to
start creating my form start the form
and end the form and the action is going
to be itself so we're going to have to
log into PHP this is going to be
processed up here and the method is
going to be post because we're using
post data as we're going to be dealing
with private data if you like with the
password ok so now let's just set this
up username breakdown we need a text and
a text field and the name of this is
going to be username obviously you can
choose the you know
names of the thing as long as you match
up when you're validating in PHP and I'm
going to do a paragraph break down I'm
going to have the word password and then
a break down and then I'm going to have
an input type and this time this is
going to be password as we're going to
have it sort of started out if you like
and then we're going to have password
for the name of this too the reason I'm
doing this quickly by the way is just
plainly because it's not important to
what I'm doing if you need to learn HTML
then I always recommend you going to
that first okay so the paragraph down
this time what we going to have is we're
going to have an input type of a
checkbox okay so this is our remember me
checkbox and the name of this is going
to be remember me and then afterwards
we're going to write mitt remember me
just so the checkboxes next to that okay
now what we're going to do is we're
going to break down and we're going to
do the input I'll just come here and
I'll do input type and this is going to
be our submit button the name of this is
going to be login so we can process
whether the button has been pressed and
then the value of this is going to be
logged in okay so if we come into our
browser and we can preview that that's
the login dot PHP page you can see that
we've pretty much got a set up how would
one tip okay so at the moment this is
doing nothing all we're doing is
clicking we can select this box we can
click but it's you know evidently it's
going back to the login dot PHP page
which is where we need to process up
here okay so the first thing I'm going
to write is and we're going to say if
dollar underscore post login oh that
means basically this is this submit
button we've given it the name of login
remember so it matches up here that
basically means has this being pressed
and so does it have a value and the
value of this will ultimately be login
I'm sure you knew that by now
okay now what we're going to do is get
the data and this includes the username
and that is dollar underscore post and
username and we have the password dollar
underscore post password remember using
dollar underscore post because this is
an array of everything that has been
posted from the previous forum obviously
if you're using get then we'll have get
in place but we are definitely using
poster and then we're going to have the
remember me and that's going to be
exactly the same even though it's a
check box we're going to use exactly the
same structure just remember to use the
same name as you've given it inside here
so this is called remember me now just a
word of advice before we begin just so
you know and when this is posted and and
it comes through full validation if the
check box has been checked the value of
this will be sent as on it's just two
letters o n on the word on it basically
means that the button has been pressed
or checked rather if it hasn't been
checked then it doesn't send a value at
all so it will be absolutely nothing and
so it's just a blank you know a blank
submission so we're going to be using
that later determine whether the user
wants to be remembered or doesn't want
to be remembered okay so now we're going
to have a bit of form validation I'm
going to say username password basically
what this is doing is it's checking for
the username and the password
and then we're going to come down with
our curly brackets and we're going to
validate or rather continue the code
inside this block if username and
password has been entered have both been
entered because we need a username and a
password to be able to validate from the
database
and then I'm going to say otherwise and
what we could do is we could we'll just
say die we'll kill the script and then
and please enter a user name and
password
okay and the user will have to hit back
because we've killed the script and none
of this will be executed for security
reasons what we can do is we can also
issue the exit command so the rest of
the script isn't processed because some
browsers are modified to ignore things
like this I think I'm not sure maybe you
can send me a comment or a message and
let me know about that one okay so now
what we've done is in fact I know that
this isn't required that I actually know
that that's not required so we can
ignore our block we've just got one line
of command under our else okay so I'm
sort of running out of time for this
tutorial but in the next part we're
going to be processing our login we're
going to be connecting to the database
we're going to be putting that in
outside our functions PHP and then
inside here we're going to be checking
the username and password against the
database and then logging the user in
depending on whether they've checked
remember me or they haven't checked to
remember me so check out the next part
for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
