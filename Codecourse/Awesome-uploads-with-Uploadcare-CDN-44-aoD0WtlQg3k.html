as long as we don't reduce the quality
on upload or reduce the size on upload
we have basically the image that the
user uploaded so in this case I'm
pulling this particular image that I
uploaded from upload cares content
delivery network so this image is being
delivered to me and I can use this
within an image tag really
straightforward so let's talk a little
bit about how we would store this image
in our database well of course what you
would do is you would take the image
uuid to this part here and you could
store that alongside your user record
that means that what you could then do
is start to build this URL up hitting
this content delivery network and you
will receive this image back but what
happens when for example this would be
some kind of avatar well that's pretty
straightforward what you want to do is
resize it so you've got the uuid you
know how to place that into the URL so
this is the only thing that you need to
store and now we can start applying
options to the end of the URL in order
to actually start to scale this down
perhaps or even just apply some effects
to this so over on the upload care
documentation you can see that we have
an API for their content delivery
network and you can see here that the
schema is pretty much what we've just
spoken about its UK CDN calm and then
the uuid pretty straightforward we have
this here so let's start to look at
things like resizing scaling and the
quality and then we'll take a look at
what we use on code course ok so the
first thing is resizing then let's go
and search for resize here and if we
head down here we have a list of image
operations that are supported on this
content delivery network so heading over
to the resize section all we need to do
here is pass through the dimensions
pretty straightforward so what we do is
we separate each of these options by a
hyphen and then follow that by the
option so for example resize and then we
give something like 200 x 200 we follow
this off by
a trailing slash and we now have a
resized image now you'll notice that
this is kind of skewed a little bit so
if we just modify this even further this
isn't great like this isn't looking good
so if your user uploads a image in a
certain ratio and then you go ahead and
say well I want this to be 100 by 200
pixels it's gonna just you know it's not
going to look great so this isn't always
the best option but we have something
else that we can use and that is scale
cropping so if we again head over to the
documentation and go for scale crop you
can see here that we give two dimensions
so just like before this time we use the
scale underscore crop option so here you
can see that this is achieved a slightly
different effect what it's done is it's
scaled it down but it's also cropped it
which is really useful so this is
particularly useful when you are working
with resizing images to a very small
size so let's say we want the avatar to
be 100 by 100 now this is great because
the image that I've uploaded is in a
good size but if we were to take another
image that wasn't perfectly proportioned
we'd have a little bit of a problem so
let's roll with the example of doing
this a hundred by 200 let's say we did
want an image in this kind of size and
of course that's perfectly feasible well
what we can actually do is pass an
additional option through to hear called
center so what that will do is take the
image it will scale it down but it will
place the center of the image in the
center of that newly scaled size so you
can see how useful this can actually be
okay so now that we've got this done
whew we can move on something like
quality of course this is an issue
because if you are rendering say lots of
avatars you might want to just bump down
the quality just so this is a little bit
faster to load so let's go ahead and
search for quality here and you can see
that we just provide a value and these
are pretty straightforward so it's
normal used by default so at the moment
it will be set to normal we've got
better best lighter and lightest so this
will just
gradually lower in quality so let's say
we want the lightest quality let's go
ahead and append this on to the end of
the URL to remember we separate these by
a hyphen we choose quality so quality
and wheat a lightest and there we go so
we have not much difference to be honest
but of course if you do have a very high
quality larger image this will make all
the difference we can even check this by
just inspecting the page heading over to
the network tab and refreshing we can
see the size of this so we've got three
kilobytes here if we say if we go over
here and refer to this so better and
paste this in you can see that we get a
six kilobyte image of course this is a
relatively small image anyway but you
can see the benefit of this when you
start scaling up into say near to a
megabyte for a file okay so I think
that's just about it I think a lot of
these options are very useful but
depending on your use case they will
obviously very so the best thing to
probably do is review what the code
course website uses for a very small
avatar image and we'll look at the
default and we'll also look at the
settings that we use here so this is my
avatar encode course this is literally
URL that I pull in so let's get rid of
this and see the original image we need
our trailing forward slash on there so
this is a relatively normal sized image
that we've uploaded or I've uploaded my
profile and of course this is too large
to render within a very small area on
the website particularly like a tiny 25
by 25 pixel image so these are the
settings we use four avatars very very
small because they don't need to be a
large at all okay so the first thing
we're doing is scale cropping this now
why are we scale cropping this to 1024 x
1024 centrally well this just allows me
to say well if own image is very large
i'm just going to scale it down of
course this could be smaller but it
really just depends and we're just
centering that the quality is best
progressive which we've not looked at
all this will do is progressively load
an image so you can see here
return progressive imaging and there's
two examples here progressive imaging
one is baseline loading which will load
from the top down progressive will just
start off at a lower quality and
gradually return to its normal quality
so that's quite important not
necessarily for small avatars but if you
have a very large file size you're
loading a large image and then we just
resize it to 25 so without this option
here so let's just get rid of resize you
can see this will literally just scale
crop it to a very large size and then I
likewise if we had say a resize let's
just do this to say 80 just as a little
bit bigger so now if we didn't have
scale crop let's just get rid of this
one well in this case it doesn't make
too much difference because it's a very
square image but if it was a slightly
skewed image then you're going to come
across some problems so what I would
highly recommend you do is just play
around with lots of different image
types lots of different sized images
lots of different ratio images and see
what works best for you but generally
these settings work really well for what
we're doing and for such small image
sizes like 25 size images or 25 pixel
size images this works really well and
with scale cropping it to a kind of very
square image so that makes a lot of
sense so obviously the benefit to doing
this is that if you are for example on
your website rendering out a user's
avatar you might want this to be a
different size in different places on
the website but of course that means all
you really need to do is say well
somewhere else I want this to be 200
pixels somewhere else I want this to be
50 pixels for example maybe on a forum
and you want the image to be slightly
larger well in the navigation bar on
this to be 25 pixels there you go you
have one option you can pass through to
some kind of method and you can resize
the image like that let me switch over
and show you how we actually do this on
the co course website so if I just pull
this up in my text editor and head over
to the user model we have a Abbott our
URL method
now previously we're using gravatar
we're still using that to fall back to a
image if a user hasn't uploaded an image
however in the database if we're storing
an image uuid so we're just literally
storing this part of the image we don't
need anything else because we can define
all of our settings and the URL in the
actual method itself then all we're
doing is we are hitting the CDN we're
passing in the uuid we're passing in all
the other options and when we do call
this method say whether it's a
navigation bar on the forum what we can
do is pass an array of options in and
all we're doing here is grabbing the
size by default is 45 but of course this
can change the size will be placed into
there as we've already seen and it works
exactly the same for gravatar as well if
the user has a gravatar image and hasn't
uploaded an upload care image so this
works really well it's really the
perfect solution because you don't have
to handle any of the uploading yourself
it would take so long for me to set this
up on my own so that is how the CDM
works and it's really just the magic
factor of bringing all this together
actually implementing this is really
straightforward it's pretty easy to
customize really easy to change around
and of course once we've done this we
have an even easier way to access images
