this Java series for beginners in the
last video we looked at how we can do
different bits of code with if and else
if statements based on certain
conditions that numbers were meeting so
in this video we're going to be looking
at how we can do this using a built in
Java statement called the switch
statement what the switch statement does
is it takes it has a series of cases
different cases as such as the if and
else if statements that were in the last
tutorial and depending on each case it
does it will produce a different outcome
so let's look at the syntax for the
switch statement so the first thing we
need with the switch statement is write
the word switch and this takes parameter
which is in the form of it's going to be
a variable and the variable we put in
here is the variable we're going to
compare against different cases which
we're going to put inside of here so
let's just declare an integer herbal
called a we're going to make it equal to
10 and then let's put a as the condition
for this switch statement
so in this switch statement we're going
to be checking the value of this a
variable and then we're going to be
doing different things depending on
different cases so the syntax once we're
inside the switch statement is we're
going to write the word case and then we
can simply put a flat number amount and
we'll put a literal number as what I
should have said we're not going to we
can't use variables when comparing
different cases it has to be a
pre-existent number either in the form
of like so just a literal number like
that or there's different types of
there's some different types of
variables we can use which we'll see
later but for now we're just going to
look at it look at this so we're
comparing the variable a with lots of
different cases that we're going to put
here so when we put the word case we
need to follow it with a number which
we're comparing it to and say if I put
the number one here this is the same as
saying you
if a is equal to one it's literally
comparing if the number we put in the
switch statement is equal to this number
here so it's probably easier to read it
as in the case of it being one do this
and then in the next one it'll be the
case with doing two so on so after we've
written the number for the case we can
put a Coulomb and then push enter you'll
see it tabs it because it knows it's
going to do a different bit of code so
let's just system dot out dot print line
and then we could say number is one now
there's one more important thing we have
to do after we write this and that is we
have to write the word break and then
put a semicolon the reason we need to
put this here is because let me just
show you if we have another case down
here for example case of two I'm just
gonna copy and paste this the way that
the Java compiler works in terms of the
switch statement is if we didn't have
this break here it's gonna say all right
compare variable a with all the cases
we've given out so it's gonna say okay
case of equal one and let's just put
this as ten for is it's gonna say in the
case of it being ten it's gonna say okay
is equal to ten do this case and then
don't bother reading any of the other
cases so it's gonna do this but then
it's actually gonna run this as well and
then any other cases that we have that
aren't followed by the word break
because once one case has been satisfied
it's not going to check for any of the
others it's just going to run all of the
code inside of it so unless you
deliberately want that to happen we're
going to want to put the word break
after we do the code for a specific case
so let's just go ahead and make this
number one and then run this
and you'll see that in the output it
says number is 1 that's because a is
equal to 1 and we say in the case of it
being 1 make the number equal to 1 and
let me just illustrate the point I made
about including the break statement if I
just comment that break statement out
and we run it again you'll see it prints
out number is 1 number is 2 because the
initial case was met and then it won't
bother checking any of the others it
will just print out the entire code so
let's change this to 2 just make sure
we've got the other one working and we
see numbers 2 so that's the very basic
syntax for a switch statement we create
a variable and then we put the variable
into this switch statement here and then
we're literally laying out any number of
cases so in the case of it being X
amount in the case of it being Y amount
do this and this and then there could be
any number of cases and the final bit of
syntax you should know for this is there
is a default case you write the word
default and then you just put a curl on
so after you do the default case in this
instance I've just put just printed out
the phrase default case what the default
case does if it goes through all the
different cases and it can't find one
that matches it's just gonna do this
default one at the end so let's change
this to three so none of the cases match
and you can see we get the default case
okay so now that we've looked at the
basic syntax for switch statements
there's another form a variable you can
use inside the switch statement to make
it more human readable and this is using
something called enumerations and what
enumerations do is you assign well you
don't actually assign you just make up
names for variables and they're
automatically assigned values by Java
and then you can use them inside the
switch statement and it's just to make
your code more easily readable for
example if you're categorizing some
links such as like animals for example
you don't want to have to remember each
individual value you give two for
example 1 equals cat 2 equals dog etc
you could literally just write cat and
then dog inside there and it's it's to
make the code more easy to read so the
first thing we need to do is initialize
an enumeration and we need to come
outside of our main method here we're
gonna come up into inside the scope of
our main kalasa and I know we haven't
gone over this yet we've only just done
stuff in here but we need to declare the
enumeration up here and we'll get more
into that later on when we do about
object-oriented programming and stuff
but for now just know that we need to
come outside of this method here we'll
just go above it slightly we don't
really need to know why we have to do
that so do declare an enumeration we
need to write a none for sure and then
we give it a give it a name for example
what what are we categorizing in this
thing
do the animals example I said so I'm
gonna make it in the immersion called
animal and then we're gonna open and
close the spike brackets then inside
these spike brackets here we can write
any number of comma separated values for
whatever category we're doing so we can
do cap comma dog pig sheep etc and the
syntax is pretty lenient for inside an
enumeration you could end it on a comma
you don't need to put the semicolons at
the end look so we'll end on a comma
just because in case you want to add
another value it's easier and the naming
convention for enumerations is to keep
just keep all of them uppercase because
these values are what's called final
values these won't be changed ever and
in Java when we're making final values
we put them as all capital letters so
how can we use this down here well
instead of having our integer a will
keep the variable name a we're going to
change the variable type if you remember
the syntax for a variable is to write
the variable type then the name for the
variable and then make it equal to
something so we're gonna go ahead and do
this again except we're not declaring an
integer we're declaring an animal
variable so we could just write animal
like so we'll call it a and we can set
it equal to any one of these values here
the only thing we have to do is first
write the word animal and then put a
full-stop and then you can see it
appears here in our IDE we can see all
the different values we have like we can
just pick any of those and do semicolon
to finish the line so you can read this
as like go to the animal enumeration and
then this full-stop here is basically
grabbing the value of whatever you put
whichever variable you put afterwards so
we're grabbing the value of the cat and
putting it in the variable a here so now
in our switch statement we are checking
this variable a for the different animal
enumerations and the syntax is exactly
the same except instead of fly
numbers like this we could just put cat
and then we can put a dog and then I can
copy this down twice and put Pig and
what was the other one sheep and now you
could see in our switch statement we're
comparing the variable a this of type
animal we're comparing this for whatever
it's equal to so we're first seeing if
it's equal to the cat the dog that pig
the sheep and in each case you do
something different for each of these
then you have your default case at the
bottom so the way this would be
practical in a program obviously it's
not practical in this example because
it's just an example you'd have your
enumeration equal to
however and let's try and so trying to
put this to a real-world example I guess
we've used animals so it's kind of
limited say you're say you have a zoo or
something and you need to pay each of
the animals you need to have a database
entry for each of the animals when
selecting all of them maybe there's like
default properties in the database for
depending on what the animal is so you
can just say if the animals equal to a
cat you can just assign it this variable
easily so we can say the next animal
that comes in we're entering into the
database set it equal to cat and then in
from this switch statement here if it's
equal to cat then it's you can say oh
you can set this variable default or
that variable default and I know that
wasn't explained the best but to
conclude an enumeration is basically an
easy way to categorize something you
need to categorize and then compare it
with in the switch statement to make it
easily human readable and then you'd
usually the code you'd perform inside of
each of these cases is some kind of
default thing you need to do if the
variable that you're working with is
equal to one of these set cases up here
so hopefully that made sense
and in the next tutorial we're going to
be looking at loops</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
