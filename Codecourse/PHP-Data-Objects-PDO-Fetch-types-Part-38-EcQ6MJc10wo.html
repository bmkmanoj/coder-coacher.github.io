data from our database in a you know
sort of associative and numeric array
combined however what happens if we want
to go ahead and only return an
associative array to voids up the size
of this array getting too big or we want
to fetch it as an object perhaps or just
a numeric array and there are others but
we'll we'll look at particularly at one
in the next video which is fetching into
a class with properties being set into a
class but for now what we'll do is we'll
look at just the num so see ative and
the object different ways of fetching
and we'll see how we can do this so at
the moment we're just calling fetch and
by default and the we have a sort of way
of being fetched as fetch both so the
equivalent of doing this says PDO fetch
both so we pass that into the fetch
method and it does exactly the same as
we've already seen here however what we
can do is we can change this to sort of
describe how we want this data to be
returned so for example we just wanted a
numeric away array we could do fetch num
when we refresh now we just get a
numeric array 0 1 2 3 4 4 fields and the
data that relates to them fields if we
just wanted an associative array we just
use fetch a sock for associative and
that just gives us an associative array
now more interestingly and keeping in
line with the fact that this PDO
extension is object oriented we might
want to fetch as an object and that's
usually a preference so we'll change
this to fetch objects at obj for object
and we'll go ahead and print our on it
just to see what this looks like so that
looks like this now what's happened here
is not much has changed because we've
got the same sort of field names here
the same field names here but this is
now an anonymous object and what that
will actually allow us to do is rather
than access the properties by and in an
array way we do it by an object way so
we use the hyphen here and the greater
than sign to access the properties so
now what I would do is I'd go ahead and
cry
the wire loop has we did in the last
video and I'd say while and then placed
this into my while loop so while our
equals this result here then what we
want to do is go ahead and echo our
message and we go ahead and append the
line break on to that so now what we've
got is the ability to output this data
but we've returned it as an object
rather than an array so we don't need to
mess around with saying things like our
message like this we can just directly
access this message property of the
anonymous object as returned when we use
PDO fetch
object now as I mentioned there are
other ways to do this it's entirely
preference of how you need to deal with
this data it might be easier to return
it as an array if you need to do
something with it in this case we've
looked at fetch object and in the next
video we'll be looking at how we can
fetch into a class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
