protection is so important to implement
in anything that you build we want to
make this as quick and easy and as
beautiful as possible and that's exactly
what we're going to be doing today with
the slim framework now if you've worked
with the cross-site request forgery
package with slim before you'll know
that it works something like this we
attach it to our container and then we
go ahead and either add it globally or
we can add it to any of the routes that
we want to protect so we may wish to not
protect some routes which is fine like
web hooks and all that and then what we
have to do quite strangely is extract
all of these items directly out of the
container using that cross-site request
forgery container item and then go ahead
pass it down to our view and then output
them now this is absolutely fine if you
are just very quickly creating maybe one
or two routes but going forward this
actually gets really really annoying now
what we're going to be doing is creating
a really simple form this is just an
upgrade button so just imagine that it's
to upgrade a subscription when I click
on this I expect to have cross-site
request forgery protection so I'm not
vulnerable to this being submitted not
on my behalf or rather on my behalf by
someone else now the way that we're
gonna be doing this if we just take a
look at the source of this page is
exactly how we're supposed to so we
still have the cross-site request
forgery name and value fields in here
but the difference is if we just head
over to our text area and look at this
view you can see here that we're just
using a helper function and this is as
simple as it gets so this is all you
need to include once you've set up what
we're about to learn and you are done
that's all you need to do so if I get
rid of this just to demonstrate you can
see that we get a failed cross-site
request forgery check so with that out
the way and done with and looked at
let's go and start to set up a simple
slim app if you are new to stim and then
we'll go ahead and get this working</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
