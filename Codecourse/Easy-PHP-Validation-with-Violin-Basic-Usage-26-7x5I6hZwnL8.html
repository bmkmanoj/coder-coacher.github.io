and you're ready to start with basic
validation so we're going to look at
calling the validate method on our new
violin instance passing in some data and
then seeing what data we get out of this
in terms of errors and how we can use
different methods to check if our
validation passed or failed so the first
thing we want to do is use the validate
method and this except one array and in
here we're going to give the name of
each of our pieces of data so this could
be a username and email a password
anything so let's start out with a basic
example let's say a user was registering
on your website they obviously need to
provide something like a username and
here what we do is we pass another array
so we have this as out a reiki and then
we have this as our array value which is
another array now the first element of
this array is the data that you want to
validate so this could come from your
post or get super global but for now I'm
just going to type this data in just as
it is so we can see how this works so
the second element of this array is the
list of rules that you want to apply to
this value so in this case and the list
of rules are within our rules folder
within the source code you can see them
over on the github page as well we have
a list of rules just listed down here
what we're going to do is just type
these out I'm going to say that I want
the username to be required I want this
to be a minimum of three so no one
registers a user name with less than
three characters and this is inclusive
as well so they'll be able to register
with three characters and I'm going to
say I want this to be a maximum of 30 or
let's say 20 for this so now all you do
is you repeat this for every other field
that you want to include so for example
an email address we want to provide an
email address so i'm going to say Billy
at code course com and for the second
we're going to list our rules and you've
probably already noticed that the rules
are listed by a pipe
symbol so in this case I'm going to say
that I want the email address to be
required and I want it to be an email
that will check that it's a valid email
format next what we're going to do is
we're going to choose a password or
define the password so let's just say
cats for the password and we want this
to be required obviously now we can say
that we want this to be say a minimum of
something but we already know how to use
them rules so for now let's just keep
this as required and let's say we had a
password confirmation this is slightly
different because what you actually want
to do here is detect that if your part
that your password confirmation is the
same as your original password so let's
give the value cats for this and let's
also say we want this to be required but
what we're going to say is use the
matches rule to tell violin that we want
this to match the password here so
basically this has to match password
which exists here so these two need to
match it's as simple as that to get
going with so what we need to do now is
once you've passed through your data in
and you would pass this in obviously in
this first array element we then can
check if the validation passes or fails
so we can use an if statement to do this
and all we do is we so V passes or we
can use V fails so what we'll do is
we'll say if V passes let's go ahead and
just echo out past now otherwise we'll
do a VAR dump on the errors so we have
this errors method which will return us
a message bag with all of the errors and
we have helpers here so we can say
things like all first on a specific
field but we'll be looking at those in
detail a bit later in the series so here
then let's just recap we are validating
a username email password and password
confirm we've looked at some rules
already you can go ahead and reference
them in yourself this should pass
because everything seems to be in order
we've got all we've required everything
this is the valid email this does match
this part
so let's go ahead and run this in the
browser and see what happens and we see
we get passed so if we start to just you
know change around some of this data I'm
going to get rid of the username I'm
going to go ahead and invalidate this
email address and I'm going to set the
password confirm two cats one two three
and we'll see what errors we get out
here so you can see that we have
username is required we obviously got
rid of the username value using they
must be a minimum three so we have a
argument replacement in here remember we
said that we want this to be a minimum
of three and you can provide anything
within the parentheses email must be a
valid email address we obviously remove
the domain there so it's not valid
anymore and password confirm must match
password which obviously they don't
anymore so the one thing you might be
thinking is these don't look like very
user friendly error messages so for
example this password underscore confirm
must match password you would more
likely say something like your passwords
do not match or something like that so
in the next video what we're going to do
is look at adding custom error messages
so you can change these four fields or
rules specifically just to give you the
flexibility you need to output errors so
let's jump over to the next video and
tidy these up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
