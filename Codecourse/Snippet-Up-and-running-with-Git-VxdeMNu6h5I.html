you through some of the basics of gear
basically things that you need to know
just to get started working with it so
if you are very new to get and you want
to start pushing your work up to a
repository then hopefully this will help
you out we're going to be covering
things like actually pushing our code up
to a repository we're then going to be
looking at things like branching and
making changes merging them changes in
and then dealing with things like
conflicts and also stashing as well so
these are things that I pretty much for
smaller projects just use every day and
really they're just the kind of
foundations of git so we're gonna roll
through these and then hopefully by the
end of this you'll be able to start
pushing your work up and this will
really benefit your workflow so first of
all I just have a very small project
here doesn't matter even if you don't
use PHP but we're going to be working
with this example making changes pushing
it up and we'll be good to go so we're
actually gonna be using github here I've
chosen github just because I use it
myself
and it's pretty straightforward to work
with it's very very popular so if you
don't have a github account you're gonna
want to go ahead and create one move
over to your repository area and start
to creating your repository so our goal
first of all then is to push up our
project just here to github in the best
way possible and that involves also
ignoring some files as well so we'll
deal with that in just a minute
so let's go ahead and create a new
project in here I'm just going to call
this project and I'm gonna set this to
private it can be public or private
it'll work in the same way so let's
create this out and here we go
so before we start to discuss any of
this the first thing that we're gonna do
is come over to the command line so I'm
currently within the directory that I
have open in my text area and the first
thing is assuming you have get installed
if you don't that's a good idea you're
gonna need to go ahead and do that we're
gonna go ahead and run git init that
stands for initialize and that will
initialize an empty git repository
inside of that directory really
importantly you'll want to be in the
root of your project
so the next thing is if we go ahead and
run git status we're going to be running
this a lot it'll kind of give us an
overview of depending on which branch
we're on the kind of status of our files
you can see here that we have some
untracked files these are ready to be
added and then
mitad and then pushed up to the
repository that we've just created so
really if you are very new to get just
think about it as kind of uploading
files it doesn't quite work that way but
that's pretty much what we're doing here
now the only thing is you may wish to
exclude some files now in this case we
don't want to push up our vendor folder
now I'm working with PHP so I'm working
with composer this just contains all of
my dependencies of my project we do not
want to include this and you may have
other files that you want to exclude as
well so we're going to look at doing
that now so depending on the operating
system you're using you can either say
touch and then create a file called dot
git ignore or you can just create that
within your project so it works the same
way all I've done is just created this
file so now what we want to do is
specify the files that we want to ignore
so in this case or folders or whatever
pattern in this case it's just vendor
and maybe if I had a DS store file which
is created on Mac operating system I may
wish to exclude that as well
either way the most important thing is
if we run get status again notice that
the vendor folder is no longer in here
and we have out.get ignore so it's fine
to obviously commit this up but that's
pretty much it okay so what we now need
to do is because we have untracked files
we want to go ahead and add them now you
can either add these individually by
just specifying the file name here or
most of the time you'll probably just
want to use a dot which we'll go ahead
and add all of them files so we're going
to be doing this a lot it sometimes gets
a little bit complicated if you're not
used to this kind of git workflow but
that's pretty much what we do now if we
run git status again notice that we now
have these files tracked and we can
commit them and then push them up so a
commit is basically a message with all
of your changes saying what you have
done now in this case it's just the kind
of initial commit so we can go ahead and
say git commit we use the EM flag just
here to specify a message and I'm just
going to say initial commit if for
example I was doing something very
specific I would go ahead and include
that message go ahead and run this and
they have been committed now if we run
get status again no
we have nothing to MIT to commit working
tree clean so before we start to push
this up we need to add a remote now this
will go ahead and reference the
repository just here and then when we go
ahead and push up to a specific branch
and we'll talk about this in a minute
that will go ahead and push up our
changes so from github we can just copy
and paste this in and that is our remote
add it now when we say git push origin
master so let's just go ahead and type
this in now so get push origin master
origin is what we're pushing to so our
origin is this whole repository here
which is this and master is the branch
that we want to push to now at the
moment on this project we only have one
branch which is master so we're going to
look at branching out from master in a
bit but that is pretty much what we're
doing so we're pushing up to our origin
and we're pushing to the master branch
as soon as we go ahead and run this
that's going to push everything up and
now that's finished if we had over here
and give this a refresh notice that all
of our changes are in here or at least
the changes that we committed so that is
in this case pretty much everything
excluding that vendor folder that we
ignored from in here okay so now that
we've done that that is pretty much
pushing our project up initially so if
you have an existing project it might be
a good idea at this stage to go ahead
and determine what you don't want to
push up add it to your git ignore file
and push it up to the repository okay so
now that we've done this let's go ahead
and just clear the terminal out what we
want to do now is make a change now what
we could do is just stay on the master
branch go ahead and modify say over here
maybe create a new root or changing hang
around really depends on your project
and then push it up to master now the
reason that this is not necessarily a
good idea is when you create a branch
you come away from master you create all
of your changes within your branch and
then you when you're ready merge that
branch in so this is a kind of good
workflow to get into the habit of doing
now in terms of branches if we just run
git branch you can see that at the
moment we only have one branch and this
is highlighted in green that means we
have or we're on that current branch now
to create a new branch there's a couple
of ways that we can do this so we can
either say get to branch and
we can give the name of our new branch
now let's just say that we are building
a contact form on this very plain site
that we have just here well in this case
what we would do is we would create a
branch called contact or whatever we
wanted to say so let's go ahead and do
that now that's creating a new branch
but what it hasn't done is switched us
over to that new branch so we're still
on the master branch and we can see that
by running git branch again again that's
highlighted in green so to switch over
to this branch to start working on our
contact feature we can use git checkout
and the name of the branch it might seem
a little bit odd is a little bit of an
odd command but there we go we're
switched over to the contact branch now
if we run git branch again of course we
will see that we're now on that branch
now there's a much easier way to do this
if you're creating lots of branches and
you just want to save yourself a little
bit of time let me just go ahead and
switch back to master so to switch back
to the master branch we just do a git
checkout again on master and I'm just
going to go ahead and run git branch
with the D flag and I'm gonna give the
name of the branch I want to delete so
be really careful with that but now if
we run git branch again you'll notice
that we only have one so the quicker way
to do this is to use checkout and then
pass in B to actually create a branch
and then go ahead and give the name of
your branch and what that will do is it
will switch to a new branch or at least
create it first and then it'll switch
over so if we run git branch again
you'll see that we're on that so that's
just a little bit of an easier way I
always use git checkout with the B flag
and then the branch name okay so with
that out the way and done with what we
can now do is safely start working on
our new feature push this up and then
when we're happy we can merge it into
our master branch so let's just go ahead
and do anything here it really doesn't
matter what we're doing and let's just
say contact and we will change this text
over to contact so let's say we've done
all of our work we've maybe committed
along the way so you can add more
commits so let's say you created your
contact design you may wish to go ahead
and just run git status go ahead and say
git add dot git commit and then go ahead
and give your message so in this case
would be contact design just imagine
that I've created the design for that
and then you might say well actually now
I want a post route so you would go
ahead
and create a post route to actually
submit that through like so and now
you've got unstaged changes so
committing along the way is a really
good way to kind of keep a nice history
of all of the small changes that you've
made just in case you need to go back to
anything you did before if you do all
your work and then do one huge commit it
can be really difficult to find what
you've done
so just commit along the way as you kind
of implement a new feature or you build
something inside of your branch so it
really depends on preference and who
you're working with the team you're
working with but if you're on your own
it doesn't matter as much but you kind
of get the idea so let's go ahead and
add this new change
so the first commit was adding the
design the second commit was adding the
actual contact functionality so let's go
ahead and commit again and say added
contact functionality or whatever you
want to say and now all we need to do if
we run get status again nothing to
commit working tree clean we can go
ahead and push it up now what we don't
want to do is say git push origin master
because we're not pushing to the master
branch what we want to do is push to our
contact branch and if you have forget
the name of the branch you're working on
you can see that just here so let's go
ahead and push to origin contact and
wait for that to finish and there we go
so if we go ahead and check this out
here you can see that already github has
said that we have a recently pushed
branch of course in master we don't have
them changes because we are on a
separate branch but what we can do is
now submit a pull request so if we say
compare and pull request this will allow
us to review any changes that we've
already made and then we can just go
ahead and want to be happy with it maybe
able to comment in change the name of
the pull request we can create that pull
request and that will go ahead and
create that for us so anyone can now
review this you can review it you can
see your two commits here so nicely
separated out contact design involved
adding this and then if we go back
adding contact functionality involved
adding that post so that's pretty much
how that works so once we're happy with
it maybe our team has reviewed it or
we've just had a really good look
through all of our commits just to see
what has happened all of our file
changes just to know that we're happy we
can
go ahead and merge this in so once we do
hit merge pull request and then confirm
the merge what this will do is it'll
merge all of our changes into our master
branch what we can then do is safely
delete the branch now this won't delete
the branch locally it will delete it on
your remote so in this case it will
delete it on github we'll look at how we
delete this branch in just a minute
if we go over to our project though now
we see that we merged in this request
from the contact branch and over on
index we now have them changes moved
over into master so the reason that this
is helpful over pushing everything up to
master I know you will have your commit
history but it means that you get that
extra stage in between where you can
review your changes other people can
review it and then everything can be
safely merged in now there are some
problems with this you will get
conflicts at some point or another but
we're going to deal with them in just a
bit
okay so now that we are all merged in
what happens on our kind of local
machine well if we go ahead and run git
status we're still on that contact
branch even though it's been deleted on
our remote now what we'd want to do at
this point once we have merged a branch
in is go ahead and check out the master
branch so let's go back over to master
now at the moment if we switch over to
our text editor notice that the state of
this is as it was before we started
working on our contact branch that's
because all of the changes are on the
remote repository so how do we pull
these in well we run git pull that we'll
go ahead and pull down all of the
changes from our master branch
now you notice at this stage it doesn't
know where we want to pull from because
we didn't set an upstream so if we go
ahead and run this command here like so
we want to go ahead and set the upstream
to origin master and that means that
when we're on the master branch when we
run git pull this will pull from master
so originally what we saw over on github
was when we originally pushed our
changes up git push you origin master
that will go ahead and automatically do
that for you so if you are starting a
new project you might wish to do that as
well okay so now that we've done this
let's run git pull again and notice that
that will actually now pull down our
changes and you can see the changes just
here so now over on our local machine we
have them changes pulled
after we have made that merge now the
other thing to know is if we run git
branch again to list all of our branches
out notice that we still have our local
contact branch so sometimes this could
get a bit overwhelming you may wish to
just go ahead and tidy these up so what
we can do is run git branch D as we've
already seen earlier and then just give
the name of the branch so now if we
won't get branch again we're nice and
clean everything's been merged in and
we're pretty much done okay so now that
we've done this we're going to look at a
problem that you might come across
already what we've covered is enough
just to on your own just start working
on projects pushing things up committing
changes and if we just head over to our
project here and come over to our
commits you get a nice history of
everything you've done so if you wanted
to maybe revert back to something and
manually do that you can go through and
do that you can manually revert things
or you can actually specify that you
want to revert things but that's a
little bit out of the scope of this okay
so now that we've done this let's look
at what happens when we get a conflict
so just imagine that you're working on
your project with another person or even
yourself and you have maybe a few
branches that touch the same file so to
kind of simulate this we're going to go
ahead and create a new branch so let's
say git checkout B and I'm going to say
something like contact update
so that's create a new branch for that
and let's go ahead and just change
something so let's say that we want to
add an exclamation mark just inside of
here well let's go ahead and run git
status so we know that we have made a
change to index dot PHP but it's not
staged go ahead and add that go ahead
and commit this and we'll just say
changed contact design and we'll go
ahead and push this up to that branch so
we know that the branch is contact
update so we go ahead and push that off
now of course that's going to be pushed
up it's not merged in yet but we now
have a branch with that change ready to
go and waiting now let's say either you
or another developer wants to create
another branch
now you'd create another branch of a
master typically so let's go ahead and
check out master and go over to the
master branch and let's create a new
branch off for that notice that while
we're doing this all of your changes
will be kind of reverted to the state of
that branch
so you can see that that exclamation
mark has gone now we've switched over to
master so if we go ahead and check out
create a new branch and let's call this
contact fix and we will go and make
another change so let's say we want to
change the text of this to contact form
and that's kind of our fix so it's just
kind of pseudo fix okay so the problem
is now that if we go ahead and run git
status add this change and remember
we're on a completely new branch now and
we go ahead and commit this and we say
fix contact page and we push this up to
that new branch so contact fix what we
now have if we head over to github and
over to our main project is two new
changes so the problem here is that we
have created two changes that touch the
same part of this file so what we need
to do is merge one of these first we
can't merge both of these at the same
time have it all and nicely merged in so
let's say that we wanted to go ahead and
make a pull request on contact update
remember that's just adding the
exclamation mark so let's create a pull
request for this and we'll go ahead and
merge this in this is all fine we can
merge this in like so and delete the
branch on the remote if we want to now
the only problem here is when we go
ahead and try and merge in our contact
fix if we create a pull request here we
see that the branch has conflicts that
must be resolved so of course the
problem is now we're trying to merge in
the following change but we have an
already changed line here on master so
we can't merge this in it's not going to
be magic and decide that all we can add
an exclamation mark after here so we
need to kind of deal with this and this
will rarely happen unless you're working
on a team of people or you're working
with another person but it's still worth
noting so what we're going to do is just
come over to here we're going to just
run git branch just to see the state of
our branches we're on contact fix and of
course this is the one that we want to
merge on now what we want to do is merge
in the changes our master because
remember contact update was merged into
master and we want to merge them changes
into contact fix that will create a
conflict which we need to go ahead and
manually
resolve so let's go ahead and check out
master and then what we want to do is
pull down the latest changes so that's a
git pull that will pull down the already
merged branch and now what we want to do
is go ahead and over to our branch that
has the conflict so contact fix which is
the one we're trying to pick up so let's
go over to contact fix and now we want
to say git merge master now there are
loads of ways that you can kind of merge
in changes and there are better ways but
generally for very small things this is
absolutely fine so let's go ahead and
merge in master and what we see now is
auto merging index dot PHP or any other
files that had a conflict and we see a
conflict here merge conflicts automatic
merge failed fix conflicts and then
commit the result so let's go ahead and
just clear this out and run git status
you can see that we have a far in here
untracked unmerge ready to go and now
notice that we get this just here so
this here is the current state of our
branch then this is what's currently
being merged in from master so if we
come over to the branch that we can't
merge in this is contact form like so
and then we have what some master which
is the fix that we applied earlier so it
depends on the project you're working on
what how many changes have been made
what's being changed sometimes you can
get into a huge mess with this but of
course this is a very simple change but
the main thing is we want to sort this
out so in this case maybe we just want
to say well I was trying to add form
inside of this but the fix was actually
adding an exclamation mark so in this
case a really simple and silly example
would probably just want to fix it by
kind of merging that in again this is
really really simple but usually you
won't get into too much trouble
depending on how many people you're
working with so that's pretty much that
done we're ready to go ahead and add
this in commit it and push it up so
let's go ahead and say git add dot go
ahead and commit this change so we're
just going to say something like merged
in changes or something a little bit
more descriptive and then we want to go
ahead and push this up so git push
origin and we want to push it up to
contact fix so it's all fixed up and
ready to be merged so let's go over to
our branch again over to here give that
a refresh and now of course there are no
conflicts with the base branch because
we've effectively merged in the changes
that we need now we can go ahead and
submit a pull request go ahead and
review it and delete the branch already
submit it review it submit it and then
delete the branch so if we come over to
project over to index we have the best
of both worlds and everything is merged
in and like I said this is a really
simple example it can get a little bit
more complicated than this depending on
how many changes are being made but
that's pretty much how we merge things
in and there are a couple of other ways
to do this we can do interactive for
rebasing so if you do get into a little
bit of trouble and you find this doesn't
work for you go ahead and check that
okay so now that we've done this we want
to talk about stashing changes first
thing I'm going to do is just come over
and let's just rego over deleting these
local branches if you need to delete
your branches on your remote in this
case it's github if we come over to the
project and then come over to branches
you can see that we've only got one
branch we don't have any cuz we deleted
them after we merged now changes and
merged in them pull requests but still
on our local machine we have these two
branches now first of all because we've
merged in a pull request we want to go
ahead and check out the master branch
and we want to go ahead and pull down
all of the changes that's the branch
that we just merged in there now we want
to go ahead and say git branch D go
ahead and say contact fix and do the
same thing for the contact update go
ahead and run git branch and we are nice
and clean and we have a master branch
that we can start working on
okay so let's review stashing changes
because I think this is really really
important let's say that we were just
about to create a new feature let's say
that this was the sign up feature we
create a new branch called sign up of
course if we run git branch we know that
we're now on that branch and we can
start to make any changes that we need
so let's go and just create a new root
in here it doesn't really matter in this
case what we do and let's just say sign
up and say sign up okay so we have
created something we've created the new
feature but an emergency comes up and we
need to very quickly go over to our
master branch or any other branch and
quickly apply a fix and in this case
let's just say we want to do directly
push to the master branch well we have
unstaged
Changez if I go ahead and check out
master have a look what happens so we've
switched over to master
let's run git status and essentially
this change that we made over here
adding this has kind of followed us now
we might not want that we might want to
move over to master in the state that
it's currently in apply a fix and then
move back over to our signup branch and
just carry on working on the new feature
that we're implementing so this is where
stashing comes in handy so first of all
let's go and move back over to our
signup branch let's go ahead and clear
this out and let's run and get status so
we can see how we are so essentially
what we want to do is stash the changes
that we have on our signup branch move
over to master a clean version of master
and go ahead and make changes and then
kind of apply the stash changes back to
our signup bonus this sounds really
complicated but just kind of think of it
as moving away your changes while you do
something else and then just pulling
them back again so in this case what we
would do is we would say on the branch
that we're currently on get stash that
will stash away our changes and if we go
ahead and run git status you can see
that pretty much all the changes you've
made look like they've gone now they've
not gone they're just kind of stashed
away but the key thing here is what we
can now do is check out master run git
status everything is nice and clean
we can go ahead and make a fix so let's
say that the fix was adding an
exclamation mark to home going ahead and
adding our changes in committing the
changes so let's just say fix homepage
let's say that was an emergency go ahead
and run git push origin master in this
case we're just kind of hot fixing the
master branch and that will go ahead and
push up our changes so if we just come
over to our projects again over to index
you can see that that change has been
applied okay so now what about getting
our changes back well if we go and check
out the sign-up branch again run git
status our changes are still gone now
what we can do is run git stash enlist
this will list out all of the stashed
files or changes if you like that we've
gone ahead and stashed away now in this
case there's a couple of ways to do this
if you have multiple things stashed away
you can either say git stash apply and
then give this kind of identify just
here so you could do
that or if you just want to pull back
the latest stash changes you would just
run git stash apply on its own so
typically what I would always do is do a
git stash list and then choose the stash
that I want to pull it just feels a
little bit safer to me but again
entirely up to you what you do so let's
go ahead and run this remember
potentially there could be lots in this
list so depending on how many changes on
different branches you've stashed away
of course what it will do is it will
tell you the branch that you've stashed
this away on so you can kind of identify
it from this and as you can see here our
changes are now back so what we can now
do is if we head over to our text area
we see the changes reverted that we
stashed earlier and we can continue
working on this feature so we can go
ahead and add these changes assuming
that we're done going ahead and
committing this up so let's just say
sign up page go ahead and push these up
so in this case it would be git push
origin and then using the branch sign up
and that will go ahead and push these up
for us if we come back over to our
projects here there it is go ahead and
either continue working on it and
continue adding files committing and
then going ahead and pushing up either
way we can now go ahead and merge this
in like so and we are done we can go
ahead and delete this if we're finished
with it of course we can go ahead and
check out master again making sure that
we pull down the changes because we've
merged them into master on our origin
and or our remote and we can go ahead
and continue so in this case what I
would always like to do once I finished
is run git branch D on sign up assuming
I've finished on that and we're done so
that is pretty much it although this
isn't a complete guide using git these
are the features that I pretty much use
every day and as long as you understand
these few concepts that we've discussed
then moving on to more advanced things
when you need them will be a lot easier
so hopefully this has helped you if you
are new to get and you want to start
working with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
