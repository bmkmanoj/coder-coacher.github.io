mailer is that we can really easily add
attachments to files this is something
that is a struggle if you're trying to
do this away from a library like PHP
mailer and with one line we can actually
attach a file to an email and have that
successfully send so to start with I
have a files folder within my working
directory and I have a picture of a
drunk octopus so what we're going to do
is we are going to send this file by
adding a line just down here and then
we'll check that this sends successfully
so we obviously use the M object the PHP
mailer object and we use the add
attachment method now the add attachment
method takes two parameters the first
one is the location of the file and the
second is the name of the file as you
want it to appear so this can be
absolutely anything so this in my case
is within the files directory here so we
are going to save files ford slash drunk
octopus dot jpg and we'll call this
drunk octopus dot jpg as well now bear
in mind that if these files are not
found it will sign in the error won't it
will not send this file unless you have
some kind of debugging going on now also
bear in mind that the size of the files
you're sending will actually cause a
delay on your page load this is already
slow as enough as it is and would
probably be best passed over to some
kind of handler that would send email at
on another server or something like that
we won't go into that but please bear in
mind if you're using this directly here
where you're going to where your sort of
visitors are going to be accessing air
in mind that large files will take
significantly longer to send so by doing
this we've actually achieved what we
want the picture is now going to be sent
through to my email client with the
email so let's refresh and check this
out
you can already see that the script load
time is significantly slow which is why
I mentioned my
ago we've received the email and sure
enough we have the image attached now if
we want to send multiple files this is
just as easy as it is to send multiple
to multiple recipients all we do is we
take this line and we duplicate it we
add a new file here a new file name here
and that will send that other file along
with it so that's how easy it is to send
attachments and multiple attachments
with PHP mailer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
