callbacks in PHP and we're going to
specifically build a small application
or a small function rather that allows
us to define a string have a callback
and then do something with that string
so echo out a lowercase or uppercase
version of it so we'll be building a
function that I guess isn't too useful
because we already have built-in
functions but it demonstrates callbacks
and also we look at functions like is
callable and call user func so let's go
ahead and start to define this or how we
want to use this so I'm going to say
string this is going to be the name of
my function and I want to be able to
pass through a string to this Y then
want to do is I want to use a closure or
an anonymous function to grab back the
details of this name then what I want to
do is echo out either a lower or an
uppercase version of a name so this just
means that we can quickly quickly use
this to grab and do something with a
string that we pass through to this so
this is the functionality that we want
to build let's go ahead and just comment
this out for now we'll start to build
this so let's define the function name
now usually we might say well I want to
be able to pass in a name and grab back
the uppercase and the lowercase version
so how would we actually do this well we
might be able to say oh yeah we can take
a string in here and we can say results
equals array so we have a result set
that we want to return so we want to
return these results and inside here we
want to create an associative array of
values so STR to upper which is a
function in PHP which will convert a
string to uppercase
then we want to say we want to do the
same thing but for lower so lower so
what this is going to do is return the
results that we've just created in the
array so let's go ahead and do print our
on this name function and we want to
pass in something like Alex with a
capital A and
lowercase le X so ignore this some in
fact let's have a look at where that's
going wrong up and lower ah sorry string
okay so we now get an array with the
uppercase version and the sorry I
changed the wrong path for code there so
we get an uppercase and lowercase
version of this string that we pass in
but to be able to make use of this what
we need to do is we need to say
something like name equals name Alex
echo name lower and we might want not
want to do that this will work it will
it will use the functionality that we've
built but would it be easier to be able
to just say write I have a string Alex
and I want to go ahead and get the upper
of this and just echo it out or do
something with it or you know whatever
it may be so what we do now is we want
to modify this function to be able to
behave in this fashion it's a lot easier
to write it just makes a lot more sense
so what we're going to do is we're going
to allow for an additional parameter to
be passed through to this function and
we're going to call this string so we
have a string that we pass in but we
also have a callback function that we
want to pass as well which is basically
an anonymous function or closure so this
will be passed through let's just go
ahead and get rid of the commenting on
here so this whole function here is this
parameter here so when this callback is
in here we complete our results we'd
normally do now what we want to do is we
don't want to return the results we want
to create an if statement to check if
this callback is called ball so for
example if I was to provide something
like that this one is not callable and
therefore this would fail so let's just
take a look at that so if is callable
call back then we want to we'll just say
echo call herbal okay so now let's take
a look at what happens here
nothing is output because the integer
one is not callable however if this was
a function and we've created an
anonymous function then we see callable
because a function is called herbal so
we're checking that a function that we
passed through or call back that we
pastor is callable then instead of
echoing callable which is useless in
this case we want to use the call user
func function so call user func function
and we want to provide the callback and
the promise at the sent back with this
so in this case its results now we do
have cool user func array which allows
us to define multiple parameters but
we'll just we'll just use one for now
this everything listed is in the PHP
manual so it's easy to look up and see
what you can and can't do with this so
what we're now going to do is we're
going to echo but what do we need to
actually echo ball within this function
here we return this result set so we can
say name this can be called anything
because this is passed to it but we
didn't define the name here so this
could be called XYZ if we wanted so
we're going to echo name in fact let's
print our own name to see what we get
back but we know that we're going to get
back the result set which we've defined
here so we know that printing our own
this will just reveal the array that
we've already seen so now what we can do
is we can go ahead and just say echo
name
upper and that will echo out the value
of the key upper in the array that's
passed through so there are hundreds of
uses for an on-air for anonymous
functions using callbacks it makes
development a lot easier in lots of
sense this is a very very basic example
and perhaps useless example but you can
still see that it makes it easy to sort
of say you know I want to string this
value and I want to get all this data
back so I want to do something with it
and this could contain lots of other
different variations so we've now looked
at callbacks in PHP we've used an
anonymous function or a closure to
actually provide a callback with a
result set that we've then gone ahead
and output</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
