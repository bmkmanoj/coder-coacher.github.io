at solid which is a set of principles
created by Uncle Bob also known as
Robert Martin its principles that we're
going to learn in the next few lessons
apply to all object-oriented programming
not just PHP so these principles also
applied to jab with Python all these
languages I don't expect you to
understand what's on the screen here
that's why we have this series we're
going to go through each of these
principles in the next five lessons in
this lesson we're going to go into the
first the first principle which is s
which is called the single
responsibility principle now single
responsibility principle is basically
what says it's self-explanatory ring
Uncle Bob describes it as a class should
have one and only one reason to change
so I have my index file here and
basically what I'm doing is I'm
instantiating user and I'm creating a
user so if we go to this class we can
see here that we have that create method
and inside here we're trying to save a
user to the database and if we if
something goes wrong we're going to log
an arrow to the file and this method is
found here now this class breaks the
single responsibility principle because
this class a has more than one
responsibility it's creating a user and
it's logging in the rated file so the
way that we're going to fix this is
we're going to create a new class we're
going to call it log of PHP class logger
and we're going to say public function
right to file message and inside he
would just write to file so we can close
this now and back in our index page
we're going to create a new little
instance and then what we're going to do
is we're going to use dependency
injection to inject this instance into
our user class so just say logger just
like that
and now we need to
that's into our constructor so type int
it to logger and we'll say this blogger
equals loader and also add that variable
up here so now what we can do is we can
get rid of this inside here what we want
to say instead is this logger right to
file II get message so now this code is
the single responsibility principle
because it only has one responsibility
which is create a class we moved the
functionality of writing an error to a
file to a new class which has its own
responsibility</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
