because these are incredibly important
but just here we'll cover what they are
just so we can get a brief introduction
to them so an array is like I said a
little bit earlier a data type that
allows for multiple values to be stored
within one value so that might sound a
little bit complicated but actually
these are pretty easy to get going with
now these different values can be mixed
data types as well so you can store a
string and integer and a float and a
boolean if you like inside of an array
now the purpose of an array is being
able to store multiple values so you
don't have to create variables for each
value it just kind of tie these things
up and later on it allows you to iterate
over these values which is very very
powerful and allows you to count them
add them whatever you want to do so
let's take a look at a basic array so
let's say a list of different names now
in this case what we would might do is
say names 1 and then go ahead and give a
name we might then say names 2 and then
go ahead and give another name but of
course you don't want to be doing this
you want it to be conveniently stored in
one value so we're gonna create one
variable called names and here we can do
a couple of things we can either use the
array keyword or we can go ahead and use
two square brackets now this is the
preferred way it's much nicer much
cleaner easier to type so we would
always recommend you do this and I'm
gonna be doing this throughout the
series so inside of here then what we
would do is just to find out the value
as we've already seen any kind of data
type so we can have numbers in here as
well we could have variables like
different variable types or different
data types like billions but in this
case we know that a name is just a
string so here are three names separated
by commas inside of an array okay so
let's just take a look at how we echo
this out now this isn't gonna work so
let's take a look at what we get over in
the browser so we have array
more importantly down here this is kind
of array trying to be echoed out which
hasn't worked it's just giving us that
array keyword and here we have a noticed
array two string conversion we can't at
least very easily just say output all of
these values it's a kind of different
data type it's not a string it's not a
number so we're not seeing that just
output to the screen so the question is
then how do we access the values in an
array well earlier we saw a var dump now
this isn't how we access values in an
array but this is how we can see the
values inside of an array so we know how
to work with them so let's go ahead and
do a var dump on names come over to the
browser and give that a refresh so this
might look a little bit more complicated
but essentially all we're saying here or
PHP is saying is that we have an array
with three items in it let me make that
a little bigger then the first item
which we denote with a zero because this
is called a zero indexed array so
basically any array that we use will
always start with a zero so the first
value is a string of four characters
that's what this value here means and
that's of course Alex the next one which
is one because it's one offer of zero
it's a string with five characters and
the third one which is denoted by two is
a string with four characters and that
is pretty much it so we've seen how we
go ahead and inspect the contents of an
array we know that there are strings in
there if for example we did have an
integer in there
you can see that we have an int of seven
so this is just the value okay so now
that we have violent this out and seen
exactly what's inside of here how do we
drill down into this and pick out a
particular item now let's say just very
simply you wanted to output the first
name in this list well let's go ahead
and echo names now we've already done
this we know that it doesn't work but
what we can now do is using square
brackets again directly after the
variable names that the array is stored
in we can give that index now remember
the index is zero then it's 1 then it's
2 so this is 0 this is 1 and the
- so we're if we echo out names at
position zero we get the value Alex if
we do the same thing at one you probably
guessed we get Billy and again if you do
- which is the third one you get Dale
now if you were to try and access one
that didn't exist you see we get an
undefined offset so this is the offset
of the index that we're trying to access
and it's undefined because there is no
value at position three we only have
them at zero one and two so we can do
loads of other things for the Rays we
can loop through them to access each
value within a loop but we'll be looking
at that later when we look at loops now
what happens if I wanted to add an item
to this array somewhere else in my code
so for example we may have an if
statement where if something evaluates
to true we want to add a new name to
this list well let's just take a look at
how we would do that so we're gonna say
names we're not gonna provide anything
within these square brackets here but
what we are going to do is assign a new
value to this now it's really important
that we use these because this means
that what we're doing is we're adding a
new value onto this so for example let's
go ahead and add on Josh to this array
now again we can do a var dump very
quickly just to see the contents of this
array and of course now we see that we
have an additional value stored in here
at index 3 so now if we wanted to we
could echo names at index 3 and we see
that value in there okay so I think
that's pretty much it for arrays this
has been the very basics of arrays but
like I said we're going to cover these
in a lot more date detail soon so now
that we've finished this section on
datatypes these are the main ones that
you're gonna be using a lot we will dive
into the other data types that we spoke
about but for now this is pretty much
all you need to start working with the
most basic PHP data types and how you're
going to build up most of your
applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
