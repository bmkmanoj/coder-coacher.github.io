different data types that is a string
and an integer so we used a string when
we wanted to store some kind of text and
we use that integer in the last part
when we looked at that days of the week
example or days in a week now what we're
going to do is talk about all of the
different data types and then for the
more complex data types we're going to
drill down into different parts because
some of them require a little bit more
explaining so let's take a look at the
list of different data types that you
will find in PHP now what I'm doing here
by the way is creating a comment we are
also going to be going into them as well
so just ignore this for now okay so the
first one then is a boolean this is
something we haven't looked at but
essentially all this is is a true or a
false value so something can be true and
something can be false
on or off yes or no it's pretty much the
same thing so that is a boolean so
whenever you hear the word boolean or
see the word bull it basically just
means a true or a false value there are
some complexities around this for
example one is true in PHP and zero is
false but we will dive into that later
so the next one is very simple it's a
string we've already seen these it just
looks something like that and we've also
taken a look an integer which is a
number whole number so 1 up to 1 million
whatever ok so the next one then is a
floating-point number
so floating-point number and you'll
often see this referred to as a float
more than likely we'll call it a float
and this is essentially just a number
that's something there's not a whole
number so one point five fifty point two
five fifty point two five 25 whatever
it's a floating-point number with a
decimal point so the next one then is an
array now this is slightly more
complicated and we're going to be going
into arrays later on but essentially
this is just kind of a collection of
different variables so we'll place items
within square brackets and we'll have
multiple values like this but we're
going to be diving into that at the end
of this part and we're going to go in
to more detail than a bit later on so
the next one then is an object which is
what you'll find when you start to get
into more object-oriented programming
we're not going to be covering this
because it's a little bit more
complicated but that's something that
you kind of should go into after this
series the next one then is a resource
which is basically something that's
returned when you for example open up a
file with PHP and we are going to be
looking at this in the practical part of
this series the next one we definitely
are going to be covering because there's
a lot of mystery surrounding this is a
null value so this is a bit of an odd
one
what is null what does it mean it's not
0 it's null but we will be talking about
that later and the last one is a
callback or a callable
so call back or callable so you'll often
hear something called a callback
function but again that's a little bit
more complicated so let's leave this one
for now ok so now that we've gone over
the kind of main data types that we can
work with let's start with strings
because there's a couple of more things
that I want to talk about here now up
until now I've kind of been referring to
this as text but the correct term
obviously is string so we will be using
that from now on so string is text so as
we know a string is defined by putting
text inside of single quotes but what we
also haven't looked at is the fact that
we can also put this into double quotes
now it work in exactly the same way but
there are some slight differences in
when you might want to use single quotes
and when you might want to use double
quotes now once again a really important
note is that if you are using single
quotes for just variables like this that
you're not concatenate in or doing
anything special with try and stick to a
standard much like when we spoke about
the naming convention of a variable name
make sure you either stick with single
quotes or you either stick with double
quotes there isn't much difference at
all there's not really much speed
difference unless you want to micro
optimize which is never a good idea
either way the key thing to know is pick
what you want and go ahead and use that
consistently ok so
you know that we can store a string
value like text so you could write hello
inside of a string but what you can also
do is store numbers so you could store
an integer you could store a float
inside of a string now this isn't
necessarily bad as we've already seen
but it makes it trickier to perform
arithmetic so we couldn't very easily
add this up and it just really doesn't
make sense so if you are defining them
out always do them without single quotes
okay so let's take a look at some of the
problems that we'll find when we work
with strings and then we'll go on to the
rest so if you use single quotes within
a string so for example let's create a
message just here then you'll find a
problem when you want to use single
quotes within that string now when would
you use single quotes well when you have
abbreviation so for example it's so we
have now a single quote within here a
lovely day today so you'll notice that
my text editor is showing this as green
that essentially means something's gone
wrong somewhere and this is probably not
going to work so let's go an echo out
message and we'll have a look at the
error that we get so we go ahead and
refresh you can see here we get a syntax
error unexpected s which is a string on
line three so let's go ahead and take a
look at this on line three we have an
unexpected s just here now the reason
for this is that PHP is saying where
you've started a string here with a
single quote and you've ended a string
here with a single quote I expect to see
is a semicolon now of course what's
happening is this isn't an end of a
string it's a string within a string
it's an apostrophe that we use for an
abbreviated word so how we get away with
this if you're using single quotes is we
escape it using a backslash basically
all this means is that when PHP
interprets this string it will say oh I
found a backslash that means that the
next string shouldn't be taken as a
literal string that we're using a
literal character that we're using as
part of PHP so now that I've done that
notice that it works so if you are using
single quotes then of course go ahead
and escape any single quotes within that
if we were to switch this over to double
quotes we don't actually need the escape
character if I go ahead and refresh that
now you can see here that we actually
see the escape character because it's
not required so PHP has just left it in
there for us so if I get rid of this go
ahead and refresh notice that it works
and we now have the result that we were
after now you might be thinking well why
don't you just always use double quotes
surely then there's never gonna be a
problem
well of course sometimes you may wish to
use double quotes within a string so
again you've arrived at the same problem
so for example if I were to get rid of
this and say she said learning PHP is
fun then what we've actually done is
created two double quotes here within
double quotes so again we're gonna see a
similar error so unexpected learning
because this to PHP seems like it would
be the end of the string so again we
just go ahead and we escape each of them
we need to escape the last one because
it's kind of kind of looks weird but
it's the end of a sentence here and we
may have something like a dot so if we
refresh now you see we get the result
that we need now again if we were to use
single quotes we know that we don't need
to escape this because we're placing
double quotes within single quotes and
we get the correct result
now I said earlier that you should keep
consistency when you're working with
string so you should maybe always use
single quotes or always use double
quotes but let's say for example at some
point in our code we were creating a
name so let's say Sally here and we
wanted to build up a message to say
Sally said learning PHP is fun well in
this case it's perfectly acceptable if
we were say using double quotes
elsewhere to then go ahead and use
single quotes if it makes life easier
there's nothing necessarily wrong with
doing that so in this case we know about
concatenation so we can say name we can
concatenate on get rid of that X because
we don't need that Sally said learning
PHP is fun we've used single quotes here
because it's easier to use these double
quote
inside but we've used double quotes here
so say we were always using double
quotes then we would use single quotes
just for this particular case because
it's easier and there we go we see that
result just there brilliant now the way
that this is sometimes useful is if
you're working with outputting or using
HTML within variables now if you're not
too sure about HTML that's absolutely
fine but in HTML we define out a link
that we can click using an a tag or an
anchor tag so for example if I were to
go ahead and echo out in double quotes a
href equals and then two double quotes
and then end that tag there this is the
link that we click and then the href
here is where we go to so we don't have
to put anything in there now what's
happened here is because we're using two
double quotes inside of here it kind of
gets a little bit messy to go and escape
things see how that's not as readable
now and of course in here would be a
link to say google.com or something like
that so again it just looks a little bit
messy it works now we can go ahead and
click on this and go through to Google
however it's probably a good idea when
we're working with HTML and we have a
lot of double quotes we just use single
quotes to output this and it's a lot
more readable like this okay so that
just about wraps up strings we'll come
across some other things that we can do
with strings a little bit later on but
for now you should be comfortable with
working with strings and like I said go
ahead and pick either single or double
quotes use them consistently unless it
makes sense to switch them out
okay so let's jump onto the next video
we're going to look at integers and then
we're going to look at floats</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
