example of updating our PHP
configuration file saving that and then
going ahead and restarting our server
for them changes to take effect and
we're going to look at the very basic
example of turning displaying errors on
I wouldn't recommend you do this because
then in production if there are any
errors you're going to reveal
potentially information about your
server and files that you're not going
to want other people to see but we'll
take this as an example just so you know
how to do it and then you can go ahead
and update it as you need so the first
thing I'm going to do then is head over
to FileZilla and inside of my HTML
directory we have my index dot PHP file
which we can see just here and I'm going
to go ahead and edit this so let's go
ahead and open this up and what we're
going to do then is just get rid of say
the laughs that the trailing semicolon
and that's going to cause an error so
let's re upload this file will go ahead
and refresh this and you can see that we
see nothing now we should be seeing an
error here so we can go ahead and fix
that out in our PHP dot ini file again I
want to stress the importance of not
turning display errors on when you are
hosting a site because again that could
lead to some security issues so let's
take a look at how we can update this
then over in filezilla what we can do is
we can head over to our root directory
just up here we can go into etsy php5
apache2 and we saw earlier in the series
this is where our PHP dot ini
configuration is so let's go ahead and
edit this file so let's open this up and
here it is so happened to be on the line
where display errors is but obviously
you can update any settings in this file
at all and you can go ahead and pretty
much do what you want so display errors
is currently off so I'm going to turn
this on so I'm going to save this file
and that's prompted me to reupload this
to my server so I'm going to hit yes
so that's uploaded when I go ahead and
refresh nothing happens that's because
our new settings haven't taken effect
here what we need to do is restart
apache so that reloads in the PHP dot
ini configuration file and we'll see the
updated settings so I'm going to open my
terminal I'm currently logged in i'm ssh
doverton to my server and i'm going to
say service apache2 restart i'm going to
hit enter that's going to restart the
web server when we go back and hit
refresh we get the error out so that is
how we update our PHP dot ini file
restart our server so I new
configuration settings take effect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
