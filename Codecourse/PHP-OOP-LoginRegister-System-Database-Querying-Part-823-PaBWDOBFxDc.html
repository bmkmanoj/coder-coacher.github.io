database class we're going to move on to
being able to query fetch results and
things like that
so now we know that we've established a
connection we can go ahead and just
create a generic query method and
basically what this is going to allow us
to do is either publicly query it so
from our index dot PHP we could do
something like query and then enter a
query in here say select username from
users so we can either do this or we can
call it from within side of our class
from other methods so to define our
method we're just going to say public
function query and this is going to take
two arguments the first one is going to
be the query string the second is going
to be an array of parameters that we
might want to include as sort of binded
values in PDO
now what this allows us to do is firstly
prepare the SQL so put prepare the the
string that we pass through instead of
saying things like select username from
users where username equals Alex for
example no sorry that will be just put
some double quotes here so instead of
doing something like that what we can do
is we can say question mark and then we
can create an array here and basically
just say sorry we can say Alex so what
this will do is it will replace each one
of these items in the array so Billy for
example and then we could say or use the
name equals like this so this would
basically translate to Alex here and
Billy here so this is the kind of thing
we want to do because we want to provide
the ability to you know give more
security to these queries and what we do
you know
whether we want to do a raw query like
this or whether we include
the functionality inside of our class
then we want this functionality so
params is going to be an empty array
which we can use to check if whether
anything has actually been defined so
the first thing to do here is reset the
error back to false because remember we
can we can perform multiple queries one
after another and it's likely that we're
going to want to do that for example you
might want to get a list of queries and
then on the same page retrieve a query
just for a specific user so we want to
always set the reset the error back to
false so that we know we're not
returning an error for a previous query
so the next thing to do is basically
just check if the query has been
prepared properly so we're sort of now
Sancta PDO prepare this query if this
query does you know is all sort of
prepared successfully then we're going
to bind out parameters if they exist
otherwise we're just going to go ahead
and execute the query return the results
as an object and then update the row
count in our query and in our class up
here so the count of results and then
set the results so in here we say if
this underscore query now what we're
doing is we're performing an assignment
to a variable and also checking this
within an if statement anyway so this
PDO prepare SQL so if that's successful
I'm just going to echo out success so
let's go ahead and just take a look at
this let's refresh it says success let's
actually get rid of the connected
message that we included in the last
part and let's go ahead and just refresh
so we've got a success here now what
happens if we change the code to
something completely different so for
example the users table doesn't exist
with a Z so in this case we own it sorry
we still get a successful prepare
because we've prepared this we basically
prepared this successfully I think if we
were to add something like just a in
here this probably won't prepare
successfully and in fact it will never
mind so when we come to X
Tooting will will perform a similar
check as well so we'll check if this is
actually executed properly and in that
case it it wouldn't off because it is
not a successful query so if if the
prepare method is off the PDO object has
gone to plan what we then want to do is
we want to check if the parameters exist
so we want to check we actually need to
bind anything so it's create an if
statement here and say if count params
just checking if anything has been added
to this array we then want to loot list
through them so for each params as Gramm
now what do we want to do well we want
to say this query remember we've stored
the query and we want to bind the value
of of the position to this value now
this here is a position and this is the
parameter we want to bind how do we
determine the position that we're
currently in well we can either use an
index here or we can just set a counter
so just for the sake of simplicity I'm
making this look a little bit easier I'm
just going to set X to 1 up here and
then I'm going to increment X for each
loop and this is then going to represent
X so the first loop this will be 1 so we
say we want to bind the value at 1 so
for example
so this is a value one we want to bind
the value at one to the parameter that
we've defined in that case that would be
Alex if we had a second one we can do
something like Billy
so we're assigning the value Alex to the
first question mark basically so now
that we've done that we want to go ahead
and execute the query anyway regardless
of whether there's a count of parameters
or knocks if there aren't any parameters
we still want to execute the query so
we're going to say if this query
executes so remember we've stored the
query and then we're executing it if
that's the case then we have a success
or not so this is the actual success of
whether the query has been successfully
executed rather than prepared so in this
case it is a success if we then go ahead
and change this like I showed in the
last example to users with a Z the
success message doesn't appear because
the users table with a Z obviously
doesn't exist so now that we've done
that we've basically built the
functionality to query a database
securely by binding parameters and
removing the possibility for SQL
injections this is functionality native
to PDO we've just abstracted it to make
it a bit easier for us to work with so
in this case if the query has executed
successfully what do we want to do well
we want to store the result set so we
just say this results equals this query
remember we've stored the query here
fetch all that's a method of PDO and we
want to define or say that we want to
fetch the object of results this is
important because we're working with
with object-oriented program it doesn't
make sense to return an array we want to
work with an object we want the the the
values on in the columns of our table to
represent as an object we also want to
update the count of results that we get
back and that's basically just as simple
as saying this
query rowcount NASA method on PDO as
well
so otherwise we want to go ahead and set
the fact that there's been an error so
this error equals true now we've not
actually got a way to define whether
this query has successfully executed or
not so we're going to go ahead and
create a public function called error
and all we're going to basically do here
is just return this error so that will
by default return false if there has
been an error though this method will
return true so what we can now do is
start to get into a bit more useful
functionality and say user equals and
then we want to say if user error echo
no user otherwise echo okay okay so
let's go ahead and test this out we
should then get and oh okay let's just
take a look here out of course um so
we've chained on this error method but
we haven't actually returned the the
object within the query method to allow
the chain to happen so we want to say
return this now basically all that's
going to do is return the current object
we're working with and therefore allow
us to chain on this error method here so
when we refresh now it says okay if we
were to go and modify the query as we
have done before to say users with the
Zed we then get the no user error
so we now basically have the ability to
query check whether there's an error or
not and and well that's it really that's
you know that's brilliant what we need
so what we're now going to do is start
to look at how we can define this is
sort of not strictly required but it
makes it a lot easier to delete things
quicker get things quicker and all that
sort of stuff so we're going to create a
method called action
and this is going to allow us to perform
a specific action so it'll be something
like select or delete and we're going to
define a table and then we're going to
define a specific field with a specific
value so this can be does it equal is it
greater than so what we can then do is
start to change this functionality and
we could say something like the database
we want to get and we've already looked
at this already we know we've already
looked at how this might work so we want
to get from the users table where
username is equal to Alex so we want to
define functionality like this and the
reason being is that you can clearly see
it makes it a lot easier than performing
a raw query on the database passing in
the values that you want to bind so this
just abstract things even more so we
don't even have to bother writing
queries and this speeds up workflow
massively it just allows you to you know
define a lot a lot to find what you want
quicker basically let's go ahead and
start writing this function we're going
to call it action suits of action that
we're performing on a database and what
we want to define is the action the
table and the array which is basically
going to be the where clause in the
query now what we're also going to do is
we're going to set a public function get
I'm also going to set a public function
delete so we're going to basically build
in the ability to get undelete data
we'll look at updating data a bit later
and that that will be a slightly
slightly different so in terms of
getting we want to get from a table and
we want to say where we want to do
things or how we want to get things in
based on field names and the same for
delete as well we want to delete from a
table where something equals something
so if we want to delete the user Alex we
would say instead of get we'd say delete
from users where username is that is
equal to Alex so for the action then we
want to check if the count
of where that's passed in is equal to
three because we need a field an
operator turn off like equals greater
than and we need the value as well so
field operator value so here we want to
say operators equals and we're going to
define a list of operators that we're
going to allow and because we don't just
things willy-nilly being passed in so
we're going to say equals greater than
less than greater than or equal to less
than or equal to and yeah that's it so
this can obviously be extended you can
update this for your own use but for now
we're going to do that
now we want to set three variables I'm
just going to put them to an empty
string for now so we can duplicate these
down so we're going to have a field an
operator and a value all we need to do
now is just extract this data from our
our where array we know that it equals
three so we know that we've got three
different elements to this array so
we're going to say where zero where one
and where two and that's it so we now
know the field the operator and the
value now we want to check whether the
operator is inside of the array that
we've defined up here this operators
array so we're just going to use the in
array function the PHP gives to us
kindly and we want to say if the
operator is inside the operators array
if it is then we can go ahead and
construct our construct our query and
then we can make use of the query method
that we've already built so let's go
ahead and do that so SQL equals and
we're going to put we're going to create
a string so we want to basically let's
just fill this up as we would perhaps
normally so we're going to say select
field
oh no sorry select
from so probably be some that select
star from users where username equals
Alex now of course we're not going to
keep this in here that it would be
pointless because we'd only ever be able
to select that this this however is
going to be the actual operators actual
the action that we've defined here so
this action here will just say
action from we already know that we have
to find a field where old oh sorry
from table where field operator and then
value well in this case we're going to
put a question mark and the reason I'm
going to put a question mark is because
when we do our query we can just bind
that value on so hopefully that makes
sense er let's just see how this might
work if action is select star table is
users and we're has three elements user
name equals Alex then we'll say select
star from users where username equals
question mark what we then want to do is
use our query to perform a query a query
method to pull perform a query sorry so
we want to say if SQL and then we want
to bind on the value so the value here
will be bound to this the query will be
run here and this question mark will be
replaced with the value that we passed
in here so we're basically making use of
everything in tangent so everything is
everything is sort of you know separate
but we can use it in harmony together so
what we're going to do is we're going to
say instead of messing around we're
going to say if not this query error so
we're going to say if there's not an
error return this now otherwise outside
of every
thing we just want to return folks by
that that's all we need to do so once
the query has successfully run we want
to return the current object we're in
because later on we're going to create a
method that allows us to return the
result set so in this case we're not
returning any results or anything like
that what we're doing it's just it's
just saying no user okay
for example so now that what we want to
do is we'll go ahead and build out get
and delete methods now these are
extremely easy because all these are
going to do is to make use of this of
this action here in our actual fact this
could probably be private because
there's no real need to use this outside
of our database if you want to that's
fine so forget what do we need to do
well if you're a little confused this
might clear things up for you we're
using the get here as an example and
we're passing in a table and we're
passing an array of things that we want
to search or get for in a certain
pattern so where the username equals
Alex in this case we're going to do is
return now we're returning because this
returns this therefore when we return
this action now we need to define the
action in this case it's going to select
star we always want to just grab every
field that we require because we're
going to assume here that we just want
everything from that that uses table
just to basically save time and so we
don't have to specifically define which
fields we want some people will say oh
you know you shouldn't select everything
if you don't need it but in this case
it's just going to make it a lot easier
because we won't have to constantly
define what we need to return so in that
case we're going to say select star we
want to select it from the table that
we've defined here so we're going to
select star from users which will be
this and then we want to just pass in
this array so what's going to happen
let's just run through this and sort of
order in case it's got a little bit
confusing we're using the get method and
saying we want to get from users where
username equals Alex we call the get
method we say table and where so we say
select star table where we're calling
action so this will pass select star
so here this will pass table 2 here and
this wear array 2 here and then inside
of here we can start to use that data as
we've already explained so essentially
this is just really a shortcut to making
this a little bit easier to use rather
than saying action each time so in that
case we're just in fact let's set this
to public anyway we we might want to use
outside so we're saying public function
get now you'll probably already guess
the same it'll be the same for delete
but we're just here saying delete and
that's it so now when we run get here
let's well let's go ahead and have a
look
refresh ok so we now know that we've we
have a set of results from this get
method because that's called action
which is called query which is then set
the results up here to whatever the
result set is so if we were to go ahead
and change this to Billy there is no
user called Billy in the table at the
moment so this is going to return that
was returned ok let's just have a look
here ok of course this basically means
that our query has been a success it
doesn't mean that we actually have this
set of results back so once we start to
use our count method we'll be able to
check if if this has actually returned
anything or not so let's go ahead and
just build our count method very quickly
this is extremely easy so public
function count and in this case this is
just going to be we're going to use this
here instead so count
I will just say if no count and all this
is going to do is very very similar to
error is return this count and that's it
so now when we refresh we get no user
because we're looking for a user called
Billy that doesn't exist in our database
but if we were to say Alex then we will
get an OK message oh oh sorry BJ we
haven't even created anything in our
lives so let's go ahead and quickly do
that now we'll just we'll just put some
sort of dummy value in this is a
plaintext password but eventually of
course be
hash password and we won't include a
salt yet but will will be generating
that at some point later on very
exciting so we'll just say I joined
today and I'm group one for example so
now we get the ok message back
whereas let's flip that back over to it
being Billy and that should return us
with no user so we now have the ability
to quickly get things for our database
and we could also of course pass in
dates here so we could say joined is
greater than a certain date you know the
flexibility of this now is brilliant
because we have the ability to get
things where we need them and everything
like that it it just makes things a hell
of a lot easier to work with so that's
it for grabbing data from our database
you know we've incorporated these two
methods we could add more if we wanted
to we're of course only going to be
including the functionality that we need
in our actual login and register
application but by doing this and
keeping things in very small well
relatively small methods we can actually
make use of things make shortcuts to
things and it makes actually developing
like this a lot nicer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
