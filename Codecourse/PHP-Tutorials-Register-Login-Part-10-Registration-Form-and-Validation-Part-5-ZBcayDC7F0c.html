we can actually list the errors to the
user so we're going to go ahead and do
that now let's jump back to our code
we've created all about if statements
here to check certain things we've
appended all the errors to this errors
array and we don't want to output the
errors like we're doing here we're
printing our the array just to get that
visual representation of it up here I'm
going to go ahead and just refresh this
page get rid of everything click
register obviously nothing happens but
we should be showing some errors so how
do we do this well I'm going to come
down here and actually output stuff down
here rather than output stuff in the
header to remember all my logics up here
and then just under just under the
header but before the form I want to go
ahead and open up some PHP tags and I
want to check whether this empty are
this errors array is empty or not now
if the errors array is empty and the
user has submitted the form that's
important as well because obviously the
errors array by default is going to be
empty then we want to if it's empty and
everything's fine we're going to create
the user redirect the user and that's it
otherwise we want to output the errors
so we need an if statement and we're
going to say if empty oops if empty
dollar underscore post is equal to true
and empty errors errors is equal to true
register user else
output errors so if the form has been
submitted remember this is exactly the
same as we did up here sorry up here and
the empty end the errors array is empty
that means we've got no errors therefore
register the user otherwise we've got to
go ahead and output these errors so how
do we output the errors well we use our
output errors function that we created
remember inside of core functions
general we have this output errors that
takes an array implodes it and puts it
in within an unordered list so we want
to go ahead and echo output errors oops
errors and then we want to pass through
our errors so let's go ahead and land on
this page nothing's happened obviously
we don't have any errors let's just go
ahead and Specht around here we've got
register in our form so we've got no
output of any unordered lists or
anything like that let's go ahead and
click register Fields marked with an
asterisk are required and we now have
this unordered list with this list item
let's go ahead and literally just type
you know absolute rubbish into the form
and see what output we get back register
we've got three errors your password
must be at least six characters your
passwords do not match and a valid email
address is required again if I type in a
you know password longer than six
characters a first name last name and an
email address or let's just say a valid
email address that's in use this is now
in use register the username alex is
already taken passwords do not match
email address Alex Alex up PHP academy'
is already in use so all these errors
are generated and outputted or output
sorry one after another to let the user
know you know these are the things that
are wrong go ahead and create correct it
obviously we're just safeguarding
against people that are filling out
forms with gobbledygook we're not you
know we're not going to trust the
users to enter the right input and there
might be more you want to add this this
these checks to make everything a bit
more robust so that's up to you now to
go ahead and do that
okay so we have completed the form we've
completed the validation without paying
any errors the only thing we've got left
to do now is actually go ahead and
register the user and that's not too
hard is certainly a lot quicker than
what we've done here and a lot less
hassle than what we've done here so
following on from this part of the
tutorial we are in the next part going
to look at actually creating the
function to register the user and that's
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
