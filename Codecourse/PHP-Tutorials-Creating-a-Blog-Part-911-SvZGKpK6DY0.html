2.php file which displays all the posts
so where we are going to create a
paragraph and it says posted on and here
comes a Crip Singh crib Pooh a cryptic
looking piece of code sorry about that
we say echo date and we need to give it
a format and there will be day month
year hours minutes seconds this is
exactly the same format that the now
function in my sequel returns and for
the second parameter we use string to
time post date posted remember this is a
my sequel tutorial I'm not going to
bother explaining how this works exactly
if you want to know just go to bhp dope
net / string to time or something like
that and read what it says and you'll
understand and now on the next line i'm
going to say in and we'll put a link
here to the category which we stored in
post name and it links to category dot
PHP with an ID of post category ID oops
let's see where I messed up I messed up
right here Wow don't really know what I
did there that's what it's supposed to
be now when we view this we see posters
on the particular date in the specific
category when we try to add one to say
PHP PHP tutorial will we see it also
gets added to PHP last thing we need to
do is display the contents for that we
use a function called nl2br which simply
converts new lines so returns to valid
HTML line breaks which are those things
and of course we use post contents and
with that's done we have a very ugly
looking but fully functional blog
however let's expand on it a bit what if
we want to view this specific post the
third one well that is what the ID
parameter is for so what we're going to
do is we're going to take this out and
here we say query dot equals which
essentially means add to the string this
order by posts ID descending and here we
say if is set ID so if the ID parameter
was
past then we add something more to the
query of course we need to cast it to an
integer and then we say query totally
equals where posts dots ID equals ID of
course we need to change that here so
what we can do is we're going to say
posts equals get if is set sorry gets ID
then it's equal to get boasts get ID
otherwise it's simply equal to get
boasts so if we specify a specific post
then we display that one otherwise we
display all of them so here we are on ID
equals 3 and there we just get the third
post and here the fourth one the first
one so this works perfectly fine now if
we do something like ID equals seven
which doesn't exist we get nothing but
I'm sure you will be able to figure out
a way around this yourself all right now
another way to do this which was pointed
out to me is not necessarily better but
you might like this the ternary operator
can be used ternary operator is this by
the way the ? and the golem and it can
be used in functions so we could also do
this both equals pet posts is set get ID
so if it is set its equal to get ID
otherwise know this works exactly the
same as this so if I comment this out
you see that it works perfectly fine it
really does not matter at all which
version you use this one is slightly
shorter but I suppose it's easier to
mess up as well i'm just going to like
you decide for yourself i'm going to go
with brevity a bit so i'll use this one
and there really is not much more to it
so what i am going to do now is I'm
going to add some links for each post
I'm going to use a menu element which is
an html5 element but feel free to just
use a div in it we have an unordered
list which links to delete post to PHP
ID equals boast boast ID delete this
post close it off and we do the same
thing for edits post or PHP post ID and
edits this post so now for every post we
get a link to delete it and to edit it
and of course we have not yet created
these two files
we're going to look at deleting it in
the next part and probably also start
the edit post file just to show you the
index here we have it for every single
post oh by the way i just said i would
start editing posts in the next part as
well that's not going to happen what
we're going to do instead is add the
functionality for the category ID so
that we can display categories with the
posts they have so all of that in the
next part stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
