variables and down here I'm just echoing
name is eight years old so we're going
to get John is twenty years old just
like so will probably be an overkill to
use our P here but for demonstration
purposes we're going to do it anyway so
the first thing that we need to do is
create a new file and we're going to
call this person dot PHP and inside here
we're going to declare a class and we do
that with the class keyword so class
person and then below here we're going
to set some properties now as I
mentioned in the last video a property
is essentially just a variable and we
can predefined them in in a class so if
we just say public name and we duplicate
this for age and for now just understand
that this is a variable you don't need
to worry about this this public keyword
we're going to be covering visibility in
a later video for now just realize that
here we're creating a property so what
we can do now is we can include this
file into the into the index file we can
instantiate it which will create a new
object in person in this variable here
and then we can say person name equals
John and person age equals 20 and now we
can delete this and just say here person
name and person age so now if we go back
to our browser we should hopefully get
the same result
John is 20 years old so now what we can
also do is actually create a method
which is essentially just a function and
although we probably wouldn't do this in
the real world I'm going to export this
to a to a method or extract it to a
method so I'm going to say public
function again don't worry about this
this keyword here public function
sentence and I'm just going to return
this and then we can just say echo pass
sentence and hopefully okay here we need
to change this this person variable to
this and basically what this means is
this current instance so it's going to
return this property here here we're
going to return this property here which
we actually set in here and the same
with age so now for your first we'll get
John is 20 years old just like before so
that is the absolute fundamentals of olp
obviously that's not all there is to it
but now we have a foundation we can work
up on that and gradually get better as
