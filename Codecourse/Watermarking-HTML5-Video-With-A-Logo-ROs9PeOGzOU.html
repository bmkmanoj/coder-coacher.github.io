html5 video we can really easily do this
with CSS just by creating a wrapper
around our video a little bit of CSS and
we get the following down here so this
is just a logo that I've placed in the
bottom right hand corner you can place
this anywhere on the video you can even
use this to overlay any other content
you need on top of a video so it works
as normal the video can play html5 video
happens to just be naturally responsive
and you can see the logo just down here
and you can do what you want with this
you can like I said position it where
you want style it how you want this
actually has a little bit of a pass
''tis so it's not fully opaque but we're
gonna go ahead and do this really really
easily and you'll see how simple it is
so let's get started and we'll build
this up kind of from scratch we'll have
the video here in the first place but
we'll definitely write all of the CSS
that lets us do this video watermark so
just starting out then all I've done is
I've placed an html5 video element on
the page I've given this a class of
video so we can target it if we need to
I guess in this case we'll just give it
a width of a hundred percent or
something and here for the source we've
just got an mp4 file here called Katz
mp4 and that's within this video folder
here so let's take a look at the
directory structure that we're working
with all we have is the index file which
you can currently see in my text editor
we've got the video so we've got the
video in there make sure you have some
kind of video you can play around with
we've got our image folder which just
contains the logo with a transparent
background that I'm going to be placing
onto the video and then we have a CSS
directory that contains the file the CSS
father we're going to be basically
writing our Styles in so that's already
linked into the document so we're pretty
much ready to go here as long as you
have the following you'll be good to go
so let's first of all just tidy up this
video so it's a width of a hundred
percent so we're going to target that
video and say width of 100% and let's go
ahead and have a look at this so there
we go
nicely fit into the page now so we can
work with it so the goal here then is
obviously to have our watermark placed
just down here and then you can position
it where you need to so to do this what
we're gonna do is we're gonna place a
video wrapper around this it's a little
bit of extra markup but if you are
working with say some kind of additional
content that you need to add on to this
then I guess it's worth it so let's
create that video wrapper div here and
let's put our video inside of this
wrapper like so let's just indent this
properly there we are so nothing will
have changed now we just have a wrapper
around our video and we can target this
obviously within our CSS file so let's
start with this so we're gonna say video
wrapper now because we're going to be
absolutely positioning a pseudo element
and if you're not quite sure that is
we'll explain in a moment inside of this
video wrapper we need to give a position
of relative that's all we need to do for
our video wrapper rather than inject
some additional content into here for
example an image element what we're
going to be doing is using a pseudo
element which is technically an element
that's within your page but it doesn't
actually exist in your markup so we're
going to create that by saying video
wrapper before like so and then we can
put whatever we need in here and that's
going to generate that that content for
us so we set the content to nothing
because we don't actually have any text
you can write hello in here or whatever
you want but it's a bit pointless we're
going to be adding a width and a height
to this element we're going to be adding
a background to this but first of all
let's just set this up so we can at
least see it on the page working so
let's give this a width of 20 pixels and
let's give this a high of 20 pixels as
well let's give this a background color
of red just so we can see it basically
and also obviously which is really
important is giving this a position of
absolute and that allows us to control
the position of this within that video
wrapper and remember that's why we're
given this a position of relative so
that
doesn't float off somewhere and it stays
within that video wrapper so let's say
we want this to be 20 pixels from the
right and we want this to be 20 pixels
from the bottom and I think that's about
it for now let's just check this out
let's just refresh and there you can see
that little red square that we've just
created so that at least gives us an
indication that we've correctly
positioned that element and we can
replace this now with that logo so how
do we how do we sort of replace this
without using some kind of image element
well in this case what we're going to do
is we're going to use the background
attribute to actually place a background
here rather than an actual image element
so let's go ahead and set up our
background this is going to be a URL so
instead of this background color of red
we're gonna set a URL here so it was
just spelled background quickly so we're
gonna go back a directory into our image
directory and then we're gonna pull in
logo dot PNG now the actual width and
height of this logo is 44 pixels by 65
pixels we can look at how we can scale
this down in a moment as well using the
background size attribute so let's
refresh this and you can see that that
logo has now been hurt in its right
place so we've pretty much finished this
already if you're happy with this at
this point you can finish and you're
done
but what we're gonna do now is look at
resizing this ideally you'd want to pull
in your logo at the size you wanted it
on your video but if for some reason you
can't do that we'll look at now resizing
it so in fact to start with let's give
this an opacity just so we can see that
a little bit fainter this just probably
ensures that it doesn't interfere with
the content you know that you're playing
in the video just so it's a little bit
less intrusive when the users watching
the video so now to resize this what
we're gonna be doing is we're going to
be using the background size property
and we're going to say that we want this
to cover the area of our element this
before pseudo-element and by the way
what we can actually do is inspect
the element here if we just go into the
body the wrapper you can see that
pseudo-element they have been put into
the markup it doesn't actually exist on
the page but it is being rendered so
that's where that is let's go ahead and
start resizing this now so let's say I
want the width of the video to change in
the height of the video to change I need
to calculate the proportions that the
correct proportions for this so I'm
going to type in the original width and
the height on this handy tool just head
over to this page - to do this yourself
if you need to and we're gonna give it a
new width so the width I want to give it
as say 25 pixels and I'm gonna hit
resize that gives me the new height and
that keeps that image in proportion this
is thirty six point nine three so we'll
go for 37 pixels so the new width in is
25 and that the new height is thirty
seven so let's add that in and now
because we've given this background size
of cover if we just get rid of this
temporarily you'll see that it's not
going to quite work out it's sort of
being cut off here because it's not
fitting into that element so if we give
a background size of color and we
refresh you can see that nicely now fit
into that element so with all that done
that is pretty much how we add a
watermark to html5 video without
actually modifying the original video
