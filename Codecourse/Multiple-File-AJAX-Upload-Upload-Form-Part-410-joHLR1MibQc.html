build the markup for our form and go
ahead and talk about how this might work
let's go ahead and create a form element
and end that down here let's go ahead
and add a couple of attributes to this
now I'm going to set the action to
upload dot PHP which have already
created
now when what we're not going to be
doing is actually refreshing the page at
all this is all going to be done via an
ajax request however if for any reason
there is a JavaScript error on our page
and you know our JavaScript
functionality stops working or the user
has JavaScript turned off we want this
to still work so but it's still going to
set the form action to upload dot PHP
we're still going to give this a method
as we usually would that's going to be
post and we're also going to give this
an Inc type as well which is multi-part
form data so we're also going to
identify this so we can target it with
JavaScript and I'm just going to ID this
as upload and I'm also going to go ahead
and give this a class of upload we can
go ahead and style it with this class so
what we're now going to do is look at
creating a field set and a legend for
the title so a field set here and we go
ahead and end that down there
let's go ahead and add a legend okay so
this legend is going to go ahead and
contain what we want to show at the top
in this case it's just going to be
upload files and then underneath this we
go ahead and create our file input and
our submit button let's go ahead and do
that now so we have an input type of
file we give this an ID of file so we
can go ahead and target this we also
give this a name and because we're
allowing multiple file uploads we need
to include these brackets that just
specifies that we can have an array of
files we can pick this up with PHP later
and we want this to be required so it'll
shelter the user if they don't actually
select anything when they hit upload and
also we're going to say we want this to
allow multiple so now what we want to do
is include the submit button
so let's go ahead and say input type of
submit we want to go ahead and give this
an ID of submit
again so we can target it I'm also going
to give this a name of submit we don't
really need to do this so a value now of
submit will basically just show to the
user we could even just call this
something like upload let's go ahead and
look at how this looks so refresh here
there we go so we've got our uploads
file title our choose files and upload
button we'll go ahead and make this look
pretty in the next part so let's go
ahead and actually look at styling this
properly now so we're going to go ahead
and apply some styles to our overall
page and actually style up our form here
so we need to go over to global CSS
which remember we already have included
it in we're going to go ahead and star
the body and choose a font family here
just so we have a nicer font to work
with and I'm going to pick Georgia and
then provide the serif a fallback here
so what we now want to do is go ahead
and target the form that we created here
which remember has a class of upload so
we can go ahead and target that like
this I'm going to give this a width of
500 pixels I'm going to go ahead and
give this a background as well just to
distinguish it from the rest of the page
and that's going to be F 0 F 0 F 0 I'm
going to go ahead and give this a border
of one pixel that's going to be solid
and it's going to be DVD and I'm also
going to give it a padding of 20 pixels
so before we go on to the rest of the
stars let's just take a look how this
looks okay so it's starting to look a
little bit better now let's go ahead and
style the field set that we created here
so let's go ahead and give this a border
of zero that will just basically get rid
of the default border like this and we
can go ahead and start to reduce the
padding on this and also give this a
margin bottom just so we separate this
from the content we're going to create
underneath so I'm going to go ahead and
target now the legend within the field
set and we can go ahead and specifically
set the font size of this I'm going to
do that to one point two M's and I'm
going to go ahead and set the margin
bottom again just to separate that from
the rest of the content and that looks
like this so it's starting to look a
little bit better or we're gonna do in
the next video is start going ahead and
creating the actual progress bar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
