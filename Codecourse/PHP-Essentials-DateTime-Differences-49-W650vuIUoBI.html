application that took one date and
worked out the difference between that
date and another date let's say it was
your birthday well normally this would
be really complicated to do you could do
without date time but it would be very
very complicated there would be a lot of
code luckily with the date time this
gives us a really easy way to look at
differences between two date time object
so I'm starting out with a date time
object which represents the current date
and time as we know and now I want to do
is I want to create a variable called my
birthday which is a new date time and I
want to go ahead and set the date and
time here so to do this very simply on
one line I can just say new date time
let's imagine this is coming from a form
so we're going to go ahead and set the
date like this so it's 1989 November and
it's the 16th and then I'm gonna set the
time which we don't have to do but since
the default date time defaults to the
current time I'm just gonna say well I
was born at 10 o'clock which in fact I
was so now that we have this we can just
do a quick var dump just to make sure
that we're working with the correct date
and time here so let's go over to the
browser and you can see we've got 1989
November the 16th at 10 o'clock in the
morning great okay so now we need to
find the difference between this and
this how on earth do we do this well
let's say time until birthday so I once
know how long it is until my birthday
I'm gonna say date diff which makes
sense difference and then I'm just gonna
pass in the other date time instance my
birthday so let's do a var dump now on
time until birthday and see what we get
here so let's go over and this looks a
bit odd we've got another object back
this is a date interval which makes
sense and you can see here that we've
got lots of different properties here
that we can actually access so you can
see here we've got things like days
which is the exact amount of days until
my birthday so nine thousand seven
hundred and sixty nine days which of
course doesn't make sense at the moment
because what I really should be doing
here is
my birthday is coming up this year so I
can either go ahead and say 2016 and
that will give me 92 days is actually 92
days into my birthday or what I can go
ahead and do is set this in another way
that we've learned about really depends
so I could even say something like this
so I could get rid of this I could say
new date time and into here past 16 of
November like so and there we go so that
works in exactly the same way the reason
this works is this a is our human
readable type date we can pass this in
and then we just go ahead and set the
time from that so it works in exactly
the same way again like I said this is
really flexible so we know that I've got
92 days until my birthday we've also got
the amount of years here the amount of
months days hours etc now what these are
are the kind of steps it takes to get to
my birthday so it's three months no days
23 hours I is minutes 47 minutes and 24
seconds so we can just mess around with
this let's just say that my birthday was
on the 18th we would expect the amount
of days to jump to 2 because today is
the 15th so we would go 15 16 17 18 and
then it would give you the amount of
hours as well so this is how we access
these to obviously get these we just say
something like D so this will be the
current date like that - or we can just
say something like days this will give
us the amount of days but how would we
actually go and put this into some kind
of useful format well to do that we can
use the format method that we've already
learned about so we're gonna say echo
time until birthday format and now what
we can do is something slightly
different so we can say percentage M
which is the amount of months months
then D days and then H hours so what
this will do is it will automatically
pick up on the properties that we saw
just a minute ago and it will go ahead
and it will give me something like the
following so if I was truly counting
down to my birthday I know that it's
three months two days and 23
was away obviously if my birthday was
correct in this case it's three months
zero days and 23 hours so pretty cool
stuff with this again it's very flexible
you can either format this or you can go
ahead and grab any of the properties
that we've seen from that object that we
get returned when we use the diff method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
