use when we're sort of developing on our
project and we're specifically going to
talk about laravel kind of use as well
so you may have noticed that within your
site's obviously on your local machine
you have your code course directory or
whatever you've called your project with
all your files in they're being synced
to your virtual machine remember we
created that project within our virtual
machine but obviously it's been synced
back to local now inside of a terminal
again within my home stead directory and
I'm going to first of all SSH into my
machine so we can run some laravel
commands now obviously within this
directory we have sites within the
site's directory we have code course and
we already see saw earlier that this
contains kind of all of the files
associated with allow of our
installation which is just a laravel
installation so we're now going to look
at running an artist in command and
remember we're within our virtual
machine so we can just run commands as
you would normally do so I'm going to
open up my project to my text editor and
if we just head over to something like
our app HTTP controllers section under
author for example you'll see here that
we have a namespace of app now what
happens if we want to change our
namespace of our application this is
pretty straightforward we have an
artisan command to name our projects
specifically within our files so the
root namespace or the vendor namespace
reflects this so we need to do is run
PHP which is obviously obviously
installed artisan app name and then we
give it a name or we start with a
capital letter that's going to go ahead
and set our application namespace and
you can see when we head back here
that's been changed and that will be
reflected across all of the files in our
project as well so that's just a starter
we've SSH into our machine we've run an
artisan command which we'll be doing
very often if you're developing a
laravel project so because we've already
looked at managing a lot of our
your machine we already know how to add
sites we already know how to repay you
know how to SSH in we're just going to
finish off this part of the video series
by looking at database access so we need
to access MySQL on our virtual machine
remember earlier this mapped to port
3306 with a 0 on the end so an extra 0
now I'm using sequel pro but you can use
any software you want and we need to set
up some kind of favorite here so we can
just connect to our virtual machine and
manage our database or just have a look
inside whatever we need to do here so
I'm gonna create a new favorite down
here and I'm gonna call this code course
dot app and I can go ahead and set my
settings just here so the IP address
were connecting to here is localhost
this might seem a little bit strange but
obviously your virtual machine is still
on your local computer it's just a
machine within your local computer or
running on your local computer so here
we have a username and a password now
these are with homestead asset to
homestead and secret the word secret so
just write that on your password you can
obviously change these but to me there's
not much point like if you're working
locally it doesn't really matter too
much it's the same as root root when you
install MySQL on its own and we can
choose the database to head straight
over to but we won't do that now this is
going to fail if we just test the
connection because if we don't get a
connection that's because we need to
specifically define 3 3 0 6 0 if we test
that we see connection succeeded so I'm
going to go ahead and save them changes
and connect in and you can see here now
that we're in we have a homestead
database here which is where our sort of
database table is obviously gonna live
now obviously within your app you'll
have an EM file just here this is how
laravel now manages configuration
environment configuration so you have
things like DB host DB database username
and password you can see this is already
kind
have setup to hint to the fact use
homestead we've got the database name is
home homestead the username in the
password here of course what you can do
is within your homestead Yama file we
can add more databases if we want we can
change the name of this one and that
really helps if you're running multiple
applications so that is pretty much it
we have covered pretty much how to
install everything we need how to
install just a any old site so test our
app just a very basic test app here and
then we've looked at installing our
around of this code cost or app domain
so you're now ready to start building an
amazing application with laravel or of
course any other application but using
this to help you along the way it was
quite a bit of setup but trust me you'll
thank yourself in the future for using a
virtual machine instead of locally
installing everything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
