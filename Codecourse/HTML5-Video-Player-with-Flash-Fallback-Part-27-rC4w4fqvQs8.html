tutorial what we're going to be doing is
just taking a brief look at the
directory structure which is going to be
using to achieve out to more five video
and we're going to be doing a little bit
of resource gathering as I said in the
previous video now in the root folder we
have the index page which is just the
HTML document we have a folder called
videos and inside this we have a video
called video and I'm going to be showing
you where to download this from I've
already got this but as I said I'll show
you that by the way is in an avi format
but we will be having to change that
we've got a folder called style sheets
and in here we have our style sheets
document which is the CSS file literally
cool style she a folder called J esta
standing for JavaScript and in here we
have a javascript file called JavaScript
ojs and we have this images folder and
in that we have an image which if you
noticed on the last videos we had this
sort of poster image that appeared
before we played the video this is just
a little PHP academy' logo that I've got
so with that all said let's take a
little look at some of the stuff we need
to download so here I'm at a website
called big book bunny the address is Big
Buck Bunny org and this is the video
that were going to be using now it's a
real movie it's what I used when I was
looking at html5 at University
specifically with html5 video it's nine
minutes long it's a real video and to
get this you just need to go to WWE org
click the download button here and then
we have a lot of different options
available to us for example here we've
got an HD version very high definition
the one that I used was this 854 x 480
pure because when we're converting the
videos the bigger the video is in terms
of its width and height the longer it
takes to convert an for the
as of this video demonstration it wasn't
necessary to do that I'd recommend using
this this form on here this mp4 format
it does come out an avi file but I don't
quite know why but you can download it
from the Netherlands of the lithuania in
this example here doesn't mean that for
example the video is going to be in
Dutch it just means it that's a server
that you're downloading from and so once
you download that you can put it into
your videos directory and it will appear
here as you can see here we've got the
frame width width at 854 pixels by 480
that's the video that we've downloaded
but as I said this is redundant because
we're going to be converting this into
formats that do work so what are we
going to be using to us you convert the
video well if I go to this tab here and
the address is www Miro video converter
com this is the website which post the
tool which we're going to be using
ticking of other videos and it's
completely free and it's going to
convert as it says here almost any video
to mp4 which will need web M which will
need an OGG Theora which is great
because well that's a formats that we
need so you just literally click
download here you'd install that like
you would any of a program and what
you'll get is this little thing here to
use this just simply drag videos into it
or choose the files will choose the
format and convert in fact we can do
that now I'll give you a demonstration
I'm not going to go through the entire
process of watching it convert that will
take far too long but I will show you
how to convert the file so if you click
on choose files and navigate to the
directory which you are hosting this
website if you like so for me it's in
here and it's in my videos folder and
it's video dot avi so that's one that
I've selecting so you're just finding
the video that you've downloaded press
open and in its own time it will display
so we've got this video cued up here
sort of video evi
and we want to choose a format now the
format is under here you've got
obviously a lot of options here but you
want to click the format button hover
over video to expand that tab and then
you have the sort of four files here you
got HD for high definition SD for
standard definition mp4 Theora for the
purposes of this tutorial you'll only
need the web M SD mp4 and avi aura so
i'll start with uggs the aura press
convert video and as you can see the
video starts converting so what I'm
going to do now is skip ahead as you can
see it is quite slow and once it's
converted it will get this OGG file into
our video for videos it doesn't put in
the directory where we've converted it
from it puts it in a separate directory
but that's pretty simple to do so I will
be with you in a moment okay so welcome
back what we've done now is we finally
converted the video and the conversion
times really do depend on sort of the
power of your PC the definition of the
video the length of the video for me
this took about five minutes so it's a
lengthy process but the leg work is
necessary so what's its converted you're
going to get two options here clear and
she'll file if you just click show file
its going to open the directory in which
the video is stored so literally copy
this or cut it and then you want to
place it in the directive which gonna be
using the videos which in my case and
here's an example of the root directory
I want to go on the videos folder and
paste this in here now for some reason
the converter likes to put on these
weird extensions it's an OG v file on
this or the dot behind it this is dodgy
hora it's not necessary so you can just
delete that and leave the OG v at the
end so effectively we've got a video
called video no GV which is what we want
now the sub part about this is that you
need to do this two more times so you
would choose files there's a recently
used place here so you can just select
the video again open it it will load up
again in a second he says clear that
choose file video dot avi open there we
go and we're going to want to convert it
to a different format so click on format
down here video and then we've already
done like the aura so we want to do mp4
and then web am and you would just start
the conversion process over again you're
going to want to do this until you get
in effect for video files in your
directory one's going to be the original
video file that we don't need and then
you're going to get two more which is
the mp4 file and the web M file and bear
in mind it's going to have some of the
weird extensions that come over it for
the sake of argument I just delete the
sort of Howard said before video
biography or LGV it's just fitted up LGV
that will work for me so whilst you do
this it's going to take a little bit of
time I know but its necessary to get the
eggs or five video up and running in the
next part of this series we're going to
be doing a little bit of HTML work at
last and a tad bit of CSF</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
