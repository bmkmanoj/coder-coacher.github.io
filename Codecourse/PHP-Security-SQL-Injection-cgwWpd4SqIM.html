could possibly cause you irreversible
loss of any of your data as well as
exposing any data that you have stored
in your database so we know that when we
process any kind of data for a user
sometimes we have to put that within an
SQL query that's natural but if we don't
protect against SQL injection and we'll
talk about what that is in a moment then
what we're doing is we're allowing the
queries that we actually write to be
transformed in some way so what we're
going to be doing is looking at a very
basic example of resetting a password we
enter an email address we hit recover
that looks the user up in the database
obviously we need to pass that data into
the database query to actually retrieve
any information and then we just go and
reset the user's password we're not
going to be doing that but we're going
to be looking at how we can delete this
other table in our database so let's
take a look at the database structure
first of all our users table here that
has an email password and user name
we've got two records in here just at
the moment and what we're going to be
doing is entering an email address
checking that exists we have a forum
topics table which doesn't contain
anything we're actually going to be
deleting this via this form so we're not
going to be touching the database at all
we'll pretend that we're an attacker and
we'll construct a query that will delete
this table which is pretty serious so
SQL injection then is the ability to
inject something into a query to modify
how that query runs either by adding
additional data or modifying it in such
a way that actually perhaps when you log
in this will allow a user to log in even
if they don't have an account or sign in
as a an administrator so this is just
one example but the overall concept is
the same it's protecting yourself
against this kind of attack so let's
jump straight over to the code we're
going to be writing out the code that
actually takes this email address puts
into the database and then we'll go
ahead and look at how we can protect
ourselves so the first thing to do then
is
start out with a form where we can
actually submit some data through you
can download this file as part of the
course downloads so up here we have a
database connection all that's doing is
just allowing me to read my data to this
database we've selected the database
name which is website so make sure this
is up and running
change your details here or just write
out this code from scratch so what would
be the first thing we'd normally do well
we were check if this email field exists
and then would maybe take that and pop
it into a variable like so so we now
have the value of email so with then
maybe constructs a query it really
doesn't matter which database solution
you are using I'm using PDO just because
we can change the drivers and connect to
different database types you may be
using MySQL I or something else so the
query then would be something like
select everything from users where the
email address equals that email that we
just grabbed in that form so we have two
single quotes this is really important
to note and then all we do is just put
that value in there so that's email so
this will give us back either no record
at all or a record if an email is found
so what we can do is a quick check and
we can just say if user row count and
then we can just kill the page there and
say send the email this is where we'd
send an email to the user to reset their
password we're not going to be doing
anything else but this so let's actually
test this out then you can see we have
Alex at Coco's calm and Billy at code
course calm so let me just enter a valid
email and hit recover and you can see
send email if I type something that
doesn't exist we don't see anything
we're just taking straight routes this
form obviously is are on the same page
so we've got the basic concept working
now let's inject something into that
query and delete this table and you can
play around with this after you're done
with this example you can try and modify
data you can try and extract data if you
want it entirely up to you how you play
around with this but
said the concepts the same so let's just
kill the value of email now normally
that would just be an email address so
just enter our email address hit recover
and we're done we can see that but what
happens if we change this to look like a
query so what I mean by that is the
value of email here is put straight in
so let's build up this value that's
going to cause the SQL injection so it's
a single quote and then it's a semicolon
so let me just zoom in here so you can
see and then what we're doing is we're
going to say drop table forum topics
we're going to do a semicolon and then a
- - to say that we've ended the query so
let's copy this value and I'm going to
hit well I'm not going to hit recover
just share I'm going to explain why this
will work so this is the value that well
actually we can sum integral killing the
page so this is the value now that's
being sent through we have everything
here now I'm going to just copy and
paste this into here where we would
actually inject the value so I'm going
to paste that in so what's actually
happened here is we're now running two
different queries the first query is
select everything from users where email
equals empty string now this query won't
return anything
however because our secondary query is
just plain a site it's just drop table
forum topics what's going to happen is
my SQL will say well this didn't return
anything I'm going to run this anyway
and then we end everything there they're
just there and we're actually just
dropping the table so you can see how
that value being passed in is changing
the way the query looks so let's get rid
of that and put the email value back in
and let's go and run this query this is
the fun part where we actually get to
run it so I'm going to go back I'm going
to paste this back in and hit recover so
it looks like nothing happened obviously
we didn't find any users but now if I go
and refresh my database you can see that
the forum topics table has been deleted
so this is pretty serious stuff and we
need to know how we can actually put
TEKT against this because it's one of
the most common forms of attack and it's
funny enough the most easy to prevent
against so with PDO we have the ability
to use something called prepared
statements so instead of running a raw
query with just placing the value in
we're going to create a prepared
statement there are other ways we can
actually do this but prepared statement
generally the best thing to do rather
than using the escape function as part
of PDO because then you're going to end
up with a lot of messy code so we're not
going to look at that you can go ahead
and look at it if it's appropriate to
you but let's create now a prepared
statement I'm going to delete this this
is no good
and what we're going to do here is we're
going to say user equals DB this time
we're going to say prepare now we're
going to enter a query into here so
we're going to say select everything
from users where email equals this time
up what we're not going to do is place
the value directly into this query we're
going to put a question mark or a
placeholder so I could say email now
this isn't actually going to run the
query this line here won't execute the
query
it's just preparing it ready for us to
execute now what we can do is we can say
user execute and in here we can pass an
array of the placeholders and their
values now what this will do is video
will automatically escape these values
for us so we don't have to worry about
SQL injection so the key name is the
name of the placeholder so whichever
value use here we're going to use just
inside of here and then we're going to
pass in that value there done so now
what's happened is the query has been
executed and we can carry on as normal
and check if there's an a row count so
let's do this
just normally let's enter an email
address and see if we get that killing
the page and we do so would send an
email there but now let's paste in that
value that we saw earlier so we need to
recreate our forum topics table again so
I'm going to add there that's created
that table hit recover nothing happens
because obviously something
but when i refresh now you can see that
table is still there so there we have
SQL injection it's one of the most
commonly found problems with security
however it is the easiest to actually
protect against as we've seen here using
prepared statements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
