completely empty directory here and the
first thing that we're going to do is
get silence installed get a basic
structure set up that will not only
serve us now but into the future if we
need to add anything and then of course
we'll move on so the first thing to do
is go ahead and install cylex I'll leave
a link to the documentation in the
course links section if you need to come
over here but we very easily can just
pull this in using composer so let's
come over and inside the directory
working into a composer require on cylex
/ silex and go ahead and wait for this
to finish okay so that's done now for a
fairly small project like this I still
kind of break this up just in case like
I said I need to add anything to it so
you usually create a public folder in
here just for any public assets will be
moving all of our cap images over to
this folder as well later but the first
thing I do inside of here is just create
an index dot PHP file this will just be
the kind of landing point of our
application so what we need to do now is
just come over and create some kind of
bootstrap folder with it we need to
bootstrap anything up that our app needs
and in our case we're just going to have
a very simple app dot PHP file now this
will be responsible for just pulling in
our fender autoload file so let's go
ahead and require in dir and let's go
back into the vendor folder and then go
ahead and pull in or todo PHP so we'll
go ahead and set our upper up in here in
a minute but for now over on index we
want to require this bootstrap file in
and then from within here we can go
ahead and run our app so very very
simple structure but it's pretty
effective to work with a small project
so we want to go into the bootstrap
directory requiring a PHP and we're
pretty much done down here will runner
up in just a moment of course we need to
get everything ourselves in here as well
okay so let's create an app variable
just here and to pull in silence or at
least boots IDEX up we just go ahead and
new our application class as part of
cylex and what I'm also going to do for
the purpose of this is just turn
debugging on just so if we come across
errors we get that output we can fix
anything up so now that we've done this
we over our index dot PHP far because
we've required at this bootstrap file in
very simply we can just run our app now
in between this we need to include our
roots so again I usually create a folder
for this and depending on what I'm doing
I just break these up so in this case
I'm going to create a web PHP file if I
have any API root side maybe create an
aepi file again you can structure this
really however you want so now that we
have that over an hour bootstrap file we
can very easily require this since let's
go ahead and pull this file into it's in
there so again we go back a directory we
go into root summary would require web
PHP in and we can set up a very simple
root in just a moment for now what I
want to do is just create an htaccess
file in here just so if we do create our
roots we don't run into any problems now
I already have this created so I'm going
to go ahead and pull it over it's pretty
much from the silac documentation and
i'm working with apache if you're
working with engine X this will be
slightly different but shouldn't be too
bad so now that we have this done let's
get rid of that and we should be good to
go so we can come over to here we
obviously know that the entry point is
public and looks like we've got an error
here in our bootstrap file on line three
so let's just head over to this and of
course I didn't concatenate this
properly perfect so give that a refresh
and there we go so we obviously see this
error because we don't have a root for
the home page that's absolutely fine we
don't need to worry about that just yet
so let's look at just also loading
everything in then we'll go ahead and
create a very simple route just to test
this out and then of course we'll move
on to making this will work so we're
going to have an app folder because
we're going to be registering a silac
service provider which we're going to
need to autoload from somewhere from
some kind of class so i'm going to
create an app directory in here and then
i'm going to update my composure json
file to also load files from here using
the PSR for standard so all we do is
give our appt a root namespace in this
case I'm just going to
app but of course what you could do is
give it a name of whatever project is in
this case it'd probably be placed cat
and then we tell composer where we're
loading them files from and in this case
it's app so now that we've done that we
just need to do a composer dump also
load so that's all registered in there
and we are pretty much good to go so
that's just very very simple okay so
let's create a really simple route just
to test this out it's very very simple
because we have a pin scope here we can
just say get forward slash we can go
ahead and create a closure in here we
can use controllers but for this is
going to be very simple so we're only
going to define out one route and in
here we can just return the response
maybe so what I'm going to do is pull in
at the response object so we can
actually return that we are going to be
using that later so it's worth putting
it in now anyway so let's go ahead and
use Symphony and this is under component
and it's under HTTP foundation and we
also have a request so I'm going to pull
that in as well and why don't we go
ahead and pull in our response to so I'm
going to use the PHP 7 update to pulling
in things like so just so we don't have
to do played this down onto a new line
so I really like this so let's just
returned a response in here let's go
ahead and give null 200 status code and
we should see something in the browser
so what we could do fact if we just fix
that up is just returned home just to
kind of see something on the page at
least give that a refresh and we see
home so that is our basic application
set up and ready to go the source code
for this all of this as it's playing
form will be in the course downloads if
you don't want to go ahead and get the
setup or you already know how to get a
silent application setup so you can go
ahead and grab that if you have any
problems setting up this base
application the only thing I want to
kind of do is just put in my request
here so we have anything from the
request that we can use and we also have
things like our silex app as well so
what we can do is just go ahead and say
silex application this will give us an
appt instance that we can use to access
anything out of the container
that is pretty much it so if we just go
ahead and make sure we didn't break
anything looks good and we can kind of
use this when we set up our route for
our wits and our height which will again
later returned an image either way that
is pretty much basic silex app setup and
we're ready to move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
