the for loop which we had a little sneak
preview of in the last part ok so let's
get started with this and we'll give a
good idea of what loops can do so a
valid for loop a completely valid for
loop is the following now this looks
really really strange but this will
actually run what we haven't done is we
haven't applied in here an initiator a
condition and an increment so the basic
structure of a for loop inside the
parentheses are the initiator condition
and increment so let's go ahead and do
this and we'll do this with just a
simple variable called X or I whatever
we want to do it really depends on what
you're looping over and how you want
this to read but what we're doing is
we're saying well as soon as this for
loop starts we want X to equal 1 that is
our initiator and we're going to use
that to count how many times that we
want to loop based on the condition
whether it's met now we know that in PHP
we have our operators that we can use
with an if statements like greater than
equal to and what this will allow us to
do is basically keep check on this
variable here this X variable and say
well while this condition is true I want
to carry on looping so I want to say
well while X is less than or equal to 10
I want to carry on looping but more
importantly we have the last part of our
for loop which is our increment so in
this case we would want to increment X
by 1 now of course if you want to you
can say x equals x plus 1 it's really
personal preference there's nothing
wrong with doing this at all but really
generally it's easier to write x plus
plus which we know as we've already
looked goes ahead and increments a value
by 1 so now what happens if we echo out
X here well we'll see X the first time
equal to 1 the next loop it will be 2
because we're incrementing it and the
condition here will stop the loop after
this condition returns true now on the
first loop X is 1 X is less than or
equal to 10 so this means that it will
run again as soon as this hits false
because it's a condition in here then
the loop will stop
running if we have a condition in here
that doesn't stop we will create
something called an infinite loop and
it's highly likely that your server will
crash so let's go ahead an echo out X
what I'm also going to do is I'm going
to append on BR which is an HTML break
just so we can see these down the page
so there we go we see one two ten now
this is obviously a useless example
unless you are counting from a specific
number up to another specific number but
you're probably not going to do that
what you're likely gonna need a loop
like this for is when you know the
specific count of something and when
it's useful to actually go and repeat
something a certain amount of times
now think about pagination on websites
when you see a list of articles or a
list of forum topics you have numbers at
the bottom showing how many pages there
are and you can click through onto them
pages to see the next page now let's
take a look at an example of this and
we'll recreate it here so let's say that
we have a total items here of let's say
210 so say there are 210 articles now
let's define how many items we want to
see per page so we're gonna say items
per page let's say we want 25 items per
page now from this we need to work out
how many pages there are based on the
division here so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna say page count so it's
always good to create a new variable for
this rather than putting it directly
into a loop and we're gonna say total
items divided by items per page pretty
simple let's echo out the page count
just to make sure it looks good and
we'll find that it's actually 8.4 which
doesn't quite make sense now if you
think about fitting this amount of items
into this number what we actually need
to do is round this value up because if
if there are technically 8.4 pages that
means that there are nine pages we
always need to round up in this case so
to do this we use a PHP function called
seal which is short for sealing if
you're interested the opposite to this
is floor so it's floor and ceiling or
seal that will go ahead and round a
number up and you can
here we get nine so we know that there
are nine pages bar of course what we
want to do is place this into a for loop
to generate the links that will the user
will be able to click so let's do a for
loop just here and typically you'll find
I as a variable inside of a for loop
this just stands for increment just it's
a kind of a convention you don't have to
do this so now we're gonna say well
while I is less than or equal to the
page count because now we know how many
pages we're looping on and we just want
to say I plus plus or I equals I plus 1
so either way okay so now in here we can
go and echo out some HTML if you're not
familiar with HTML this is basically an
anchor and in here we have where the
user will go to and in here we have what
the user will see so in this case we can
append on or concatenate on I because in
this case it's the actual number so one
up to nine and then in here we could do
something like page equals and then go
ahead and again concatenate on that I
and we'll see what this looks like in
the browser this is basically the part
of the query string that we can pick up
on the server side and we'll be learning
about query strings later on in the
course okay so let's go over give this a
refresh and you can see here we've got 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 of course what we can do
to make this a little bit nicer is add a
space on there and there we go okay so
if I click one you can see this goes
through to page 1 if I click 7 that goes
through to page 7 and so on and so forth
so if you were ever wondering how
pagination worked this is generally how
you would calculate how many pages to
show and what's great about this as well
is that if we had say 500 items or 510
items we know that this will
automatically increase if we had 25
items we only have one page and in this
case what we could do is check and not
show the page count if we only had one
page so for example we could say if and
wrap this whole for loop inside of an if
statement just here in Denver and we
could say if the page count is equal to
1 then there's no need to go
and display them or rather is it greater
than one then we display it so there we
go we don't see that and when we change
it to something like 250 we see them
links back again okay so hopefully that
makes sense a little practical example
for you to kind of understand why we
might use a for-loop but we can also use
a for loop to loop through an array now
we know what an array is because we've
already learnt about them we are going
to cover a better way to loop through an
array later on but sometimes there is a
case for using a for loop on an array so
let's say we have an array of names so
let's say Alex Billy and Dale so I want
to loop through all of the items in this
array and I want to echo out the name so
let's start our for loop and let's start
to think about how we might do this well
in this case when we have our increment
value we don't need to be one now why is
that well we know that when we count
within an array this is called zero
indexed arrays so we have 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 so we
want to start at 0 because this is what
we're going to be using throughout the
loop to pluck the values out of the
array now how many times do we loop here
well of course what we could do is say
why I is less than 3 because we know
there are 3 items in the array or rather
2 because we're going to be saying 0 1
and then 2 which is 3 loops but this is
a bit confusing what we really want to
do is actually count the amount of items
in the array because we know that an
array might change so here we say count
names and that's it so now all we need
to do is go ahead and add I plus plus
and now we can echo out a value now
let's just take them out I just so we
can see exactly what we're working with
and I'm gonna go ahead and pop a break
in there let's give that a refresh and
you see 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 we're looping 3 times
starting at 0 and obviously ending at 2
now all we need to do is pluck out the
item from this array at that key now we
already know that we can do something
like echo names 0 echo names 1
or two or how many items in your in
their so we can use that I variable to
do that so all we do is say names and
now instead of putting a number in there
we put I we can do this as well
so now let's just add on a break so we
can see these on a new line and there we
go we've got Alex billion dial output
from that array and of course now if we
go ahead and add a new item onto here we
know that this is going to automatically
do it because we're counting the amount
of items in here we're not using a fixed
number okay so there are a few more
things surrounding for loops but we've
mostly covered everything here you might
see some slight variations but really
all does the same thing and now when you
see a for loop you will know exactly
what it's doing so as long as you've
understood everything here we've looked
at coming across these different
variations won't be a massive problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
