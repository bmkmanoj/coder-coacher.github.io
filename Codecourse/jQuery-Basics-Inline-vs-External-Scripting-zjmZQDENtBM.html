the last video we looked at clicking on
a paragraph which had some text inside
to actually hide an element using the
onclick event and we used this to
reference the the paragraph so let's
just have a look at how that works so
we've hidden it with a value of a
thousand as a parameter in this hide
function here however we have a problem
using this method now we're doing
something called
it while we're using something called
inline scripting so we are using this
function inline to our HTML now the goal
is to keep the HTML and the JavaScript
or the jQuery library referencing in
this example as separate as possible so
one going to do is I'm going to get rid
of this here we're still going to use
the on click event because we want
something to happen when we click the
paragraph however we're actually going
to create a separate function in
JavaScript which allows us to hide this
so let's go ahead and create a new file
and inside here we're just going to
create a function and that's going to be
called hide in fact let's call it hide
okay now the same concept is going to
apply we're still going to use the
jQuery code however we're gonna save
this file somewhere where we can use it
now we're going to save it in our J's
folder and I'm just gonna be cool I'm
just gonna call this J func Jas
okay so we've saved that you can see
that my syntax highlighting has been
turned on for JavaScript so that helps
we're going to take a couple of
parameters in here the first one is
going to be the element we want to hide
and the second parameter is going to be
the speed in which we want to do it so
we can just type speed here and we're
going to call this hide element function
from this on-click event so let's go
ahead and say hide
element there now we're going to fill in
the parameters just in here in a moment
but let's go ahead and write out the
code we need inside of our function it's
essentially the same we need a dollar
sign and then in here we need the
element name so that's the reference to
the element and then we're going to say
hired and in here we're gonna write
speed so we're taking element and we're
hiding element that might be this or we
might reference the element using hash
which I'll explain in a moment and then
that hide it at the speed we specify as
well so now we have the benefit of being
able to hide lots of elements on our
page using only one function and we
don't have to duplicate this code and
use it in line so let's go over to index
dot PHP the one thing we need to do is
we're just gonna copy and paste this
down and we're actually just going to
change this here to J funk and that
means that we've now included this file
inside of our page so as well as taking
advantage of jQuery we can also take
advantage of our separate function
library
okay so hide element what what here we
need to say what we want to hide and in
this case it will be this and then we
can give a speed one thousand not ten
thousand okay so now what's going to
happen is it's going to pick up on this
element it's going to pass that to this
hide element function and it's gonna
hide that element and it's gonna hide it
at the speed that we've specified so
this is a much better way to do things
and as well if we had lots of other
different paragraphs down the page we
just need to need to call the same
function and therefore if we want to
change something like what happens we
might want to add a few more functions
in here we can take advantage of that
because we don't need to change it for
each paragraph so let's go ahead and
first of all see if this works let's go
and click on it and you can see we have
the exact same result happen but we're
using a function and we're not writing
our code in line we're just calling a
function so bear in mind that when
you're writing code this is the best way
to do things and it's always best to
include it in a separate library to
ensure that you have a list of functions
and you're not including them in the
head of your
Paige you could in fact come down here
and type script type equals sorry script
type equals text JavaScript script and
you could write your functions in here
however it's a lot better to include
them in a separate file that's kept
elsewhere
okay so fair enough we are using the
this reference to reference the current
paragraph however what happens if we
want to include something like a button
we may want to have a button that
actually allows us to press the button
and then hide a specific element so
let's get Rick get rid of this unclick
event but now what we want to do is give
an ID to this paragraph so the ID could
be called paragraph okay now down here
we could create a button it could be a
hyperlink and HTML hyperlink it doesn't
matter at all what it is we anyway you
can use the on click event this will
work so input type equals button value
equals Hyde now what we have is we have
a button underneath which we're going to
click and this is going to hide so let's
go and create an on click event and when
we click this we can call the same
function but this time instead of
referencing this we can reference this
paragraph by using the ID of paragraph
so let's go ahead and create a reference
our function or call our function so
hide element and in here we type the
name now usually we type this and then a
thousand a thousand fine we can keep
this but this is actually going to then
hide this button so you can see that by
using this we've hidden the button so
it's not work properly well it has
worked but we haven't hidden what we
want to hide
instead inside speech marks or single
quotation marks we can actually use a
hash and then we can use the name of the
element we want
so that in that case it's paragraph okay
so we couldn't this we've given this the
ID paragraph so now when we go back to
our page and we click hired you can see
that that element we've specified is
actually hidden so this is a typical
example of how we don't use inline
scripting which is a often regarded a
bad practice and we can actually use a
function instead but we can actually
change our function to suit our needs so
we can now call any element in the page
and hide it using a specific speed and
then also if you were to look up the
parameters that the hide function takes
you can actually then include more
parameters in here as long as you
specify them in here so we've now
learned how to do that but what happens
now if we want to use toggle now toggle
is another function which allows us to
toggle a specific element and
essentially toggle is neither hide or
show but what toggle does is it checks
the state of the current object or the
current element and it will either hide
or show it depending on its visibility
so in the next tutorial we're going to
be looking at specifically the toggle
function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
