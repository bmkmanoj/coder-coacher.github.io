loop and the cleanest loop for iterating
over arrays now when you start to work
with data back from databases and other
sources you're very likely to get an
array of data back now we'll see an
example of this later on in this part
but for now we're going to go over the
basics of the for each loop now remember
when we looked at four loops well let's
just very quickly look at how we
iterated over an array with a for loop
so we started out with a very basic
array and in this part we're going to be
looking at slightly more advanced arrays
and how we iterate over them as well but
we had just a few values in here now we
know the basics of a for loop is to
initialize a variable and in this case
we're initializing it as 0 because we
have starting at 0 here this is 0
indexed and then we went ahead and said
well why the while the I is less than
the count of that array which in our
case would give us back the value 3 and
then we want to increment I so this
loops when this condition is met we stop
and in that case we went and we echoed
out names placing that I in there and
then we went ahead and appended on a
break so we ended up with the following
like so now there's clearly too much
code here for looping over such a simple
data structure like an array and because
you're going to be looping through a lot
of data on building websites we need to
look at a better way and that is where
the for each loop comes in so again
let's just bring back them names because
we'll use that to take a look at a very
basic example and now let's look at the
structure of a for each loop it's like
this so again very similar to other
loops but of course this time we're
saying for each now inside of here we
don't actually have a condition so
instead of this being a condition to
evaluate this time we choose which array
we want to loop through and then each of
them items we give a name so in this
case we know that we're iterating over
the names array now notice that this is
a plural so in this case we would then
say ah
name now what this will automatically do
for us is it will loop three times
because we have three items in this
array and every time this loops name
will be each of these values on the
first loop it'll be Alex second Billy
and third day and so on and so forth so
now it's just as easy as outputting name
and then maybe appending on a break and
if we go ahead and refresh we get
exactly the same result so much cleaner
much easier to write and of course since
you're gonna be looking through arrays
that much this makes total sense
now there's a bit more just talking
about the basic structure of a for loop
there's more that we can do here
now cast your mind back to when we
looked at arrays we know that arrays
either have a numerical or a string
index so we have a normal array and then
we have an associative array if we have
to find out an index of our own now he
did need to access this all you're going
to do is in here say index or whatever
you want to call it and then an equals
and a greater than sign
now as this stands it will work in
exactly the same way but now what we can
do is access the index at each key in
this array or each value in this array
now in our case index is going to be a
number because we're starting at 0 and
going up to 2 so let's go ahead and
output this and see what we get so let's
go ahead and output index maybe let's
add on a code on here and then add on
that name like so let's give that a
refresh and you see 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 so if you're
working with data where you need to use
the index then this is exactly what you
would do and for each loops do not get
any more complicated than that that is
the basics of how we work with them so
now that we know that let's move on to a
more complex array and this is something
that you may get back from your database
when you start to learn about accessing
database items this is how the data may
look so we're gonna build this up
manually it will take a little bit of
time but of course later on things are
going to be a lot easier so let's say we
have an array here of arrays so we're
now looking at a multi-dimensional array
I'm going to create an array inside of
here and inside of here are going to be
a list of
six so each of these topics will have a
list of posts associated with them much
like you just find in a forum online so
let's create an ID for these because
usually when you pull back data it will
have a unique ID and let's go ahead and
give this a title and let's say the best
way to learn PHP and we'll go ahead and
give this another index here and this
will again be an array so we now have an
array within an array within this main
array so each of these posts will be an
array because we need a key for each one
of them so let's say body and let's give
some advice here so practice a lot and
let's duplicate this one down and now
let's say work on a project which is
always a good idea to learn okay so now
we have a list of posts within a topic
within a topics array now what we can do
is duplicate this one down change it to
something else and we'll start looking
at how we iterate over all of this so
obviously for the second one we'll have
a unique ID let's say this is two and
now here let's say how do I use a for
each loop like so and let's get rid of
one of them posts and for this post
let's say just watch this part brilliant
okay so we now have two topics the first
topic has two posts and the second topic
has one post so we need to find a way to
iterate over these to go ahead and
output them so the first thing that we
do is create our for each loop so again
pretty straightforward inside of here
we're gonna say for each topics as
topics so again we're using plural and
singular here which is really important
when you are doing this it just makes it
much easier to read and see exactly what
you're doing okay so we know that when
we access an item from an array if it's
an associative array and we have a
string here for the key we just do
something like the following so echo
topic and then we say title like so so
let's just take a look at this and then
we'll put it into a kind of more useful
form so it's come over give that a
refresh and looks like we have an error
that's not a problem on line seven let's
come down to here and
looks like here I added a dot by
accident so let's just tidy that up
there okay
so there we go so now we have two items
here under underneath each other because
we now have two items in this array so
what I'm gonna do instead is I'm gonna
echo out an h1 so this is a header
within HTML and then into this I'm going
to concatenate on that topic title so
topic title like so give that a refresh
when we now have a slightly larger title
now underneath this we need to show all
of the posts and remember these posts
might have a user associated with them
there might be a user name the date it
was posted it could be any information
the concept here is exactly the same
regardless of the data that you're
working with so underneath this we need
another for each loop inside of this for
each loop and of course the reason for
that is because we now need another loop
to loop through each of the posts so we
can nest for each loops to basically
extract information out so let's go
ahead and do this and then we'll kind of
explain how this is working so for each
topic posts now remember topic posts is
now an array so this just here and then
we're gonna say as post like so now what
will happen is as well as iterating over
each topic it will also iterate over
each post within that topic so let's now
echo out say a paragraph tag and then in
here we can output the body so let's
concatenate on the post now body and if
you needed to you can access the topic
still within this for each loop it
really just depends on what you need to
do with this but it's really good idea
to play around with some more complex
data structures okay so now that we have
this let's give that a refresh and you
can see here we not only do we have the
title of the topic but we have each of
them posts underneath each one so this
is pretty similar to what you would see
on any website where you have a list of
things that you want to display okay so
there you have it that is pretty much it
for for each loops you now know how to
easily loop through arrays using that
for each loop
and what I recommend you do is build up
a fairly complex array of your own data
so add anything else you like to this
add more arrays with in arrays if you
want and go ahead and play around with
looping through and outputting the data
that you want like I said before you'll
be using this a lot so it's really worth
getting used to how this works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
