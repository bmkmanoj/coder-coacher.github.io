look at variables in PHP we're going to
give a very basic overview of how we
work with variables because it is
actually extremely easy now PHP is a
loosely typed language so we don't need
to declare which type of data we're
working with when we set variables so
it's extremely easy as long as you
understand the syntax syntax you can
almost assign any value you'd like to a
variable and it's extremely easy to pick
up on this so the first thing that we're
going to do is perhaps just create a
variable assign a value or assign a
couple of values and see what we can do
with variables so for example if I was
to say name I use a dollar sign here and
then I give an identifier to a variable
name or as a variable name now there are
a couple of rules around this so for
example I can't start a variable with a
number or in fact an integer I also
can't start a variable with a special
character and as well probably you know
can't include a special character in a
variable as well so of course this does
look a little strange and if we preview
this now browser we get an error
so best to probably stick to string
values depending on your preference you
can use something like a camel cap so
for example first name first name or you
could of course go ahead and use
underscores they're perfectly valid in
in variable names but basically this is
how we would declare and and use a
variable so you saw there I used echo to
just echo out the variable name or
variable value sorry and so in this case
what we can also do is we can do things
like numbers so we can set an integer
value to a number we could also set a a
float value so with a decimal point and
we can also set a boolean so we could
say for example
working equals true or something like
that so this is a boolean value so I
mean a lot of this a lot of these are
very very straightforward if you've
worked with other programming languages
before this makes sense but we can
basically just assign any value we like
to a variable and not have to declare
its type it doesn't we don't need to do
that that's because it is loosely typed
so what we can do is also it might make
sense to go over the fact that we if we
echo out a number what happens because
we're we're outputting this to a page
but if we go ahead and refresh you know
nothing happens we output it and it
effectively is put on the page as a
string value despite the fact it is an
integer now we can also create new
variables in PHP using other variables
as we can in other languages so for
example I could say sentence equals my
name is name and my age is age and then
I can go ahead ahead and echo out this
sentence so that works as well we're
just basically creating a new variable
encompassing other variables and using
them within this string and that goes
the same with numbers as well when we're
performing calculations on numbers we
could create a sum a total from
different variable values we can of
course specifically define how we want a
variable to to behave in terms of its
type so we can actually cast variables
to different types so for example I
might say age but I want this to be a
string this would be perfectly valid so
we don't see any errors here and then
when we go ahead and echo our age it
works in exactly the same way like this
now this is all well and good but what
if you need to delve a little deeper and
see how how different variables are set
and and there there are absolute for all
there there types so for example let's
just put age back to 24 point
five and let's go ahead and just get rid
of all of this for now okay so we can
use a function if you like or a language
construct called
var dump now basically what this will do
is it will tell us the data type and the
value of a variable that we're working
with so in this case you can see it says
float and it says 24.5 which is the
value of the variable if we were to cast
this to a string what we can then do is
we can say refresh string gives us the
length of the string and it gives us the
value of the string as well of course we
can also Kaster things like boolean x'
in this case this would come as true
because twenty-four twenty-four point
five is a true value if i was just say
something like bull zero obviously this
would be false because zero is false so
it's a good idea to play around with
things like this casting you can cast to
any data type but obviously it only
makes sense in some areas but basically
working with variables in PHP is
extremely easy setting variables
creating new variables concatenated
things like that so you know it's
something that just comes naturally you
play around with it and you work out
that you need to store values in
variables and basically that's it so
we've looked at a couple of data types
there are of course more data types that
can be assigned to variables but this is
enough to sort of understand the very
basics of variables in PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
