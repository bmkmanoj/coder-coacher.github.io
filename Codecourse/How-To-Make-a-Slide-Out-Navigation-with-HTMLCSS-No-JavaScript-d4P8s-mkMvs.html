so excited I'm excited because Alex from
PHP academy' has invited me to make a
video on his channel every now and then
and I thought hey why don't I start out
with the best video in the world a
little while ago Alex who normally makes
these videos made a set of tutorials
about this super sexy slide up menus now
you can click this box to take a look at
those or you can check out the links in
the doodlee below so today I wanted to
riff on those videos a little bit and
show you how to do something pretty
similar only this time we're going to be
using exclusively HTML and CSS and no
JavaScript ok so to start I want to show
you the screen here this is a website
that actually you found a nice blog that
I like and here let me show you the blog
it's called
called hacking UI and I found a nice
post with some good imagery on it and I
literally view the source and copy and
paste it into my project so I wanted to
have a nice site it's not just a bunch
of ugliness bunch of gray boxes for you
to look at so here's some nice site for
you to look at what I did though is I
went in behind at this little navigation
that slides out when you click this
button here and that's what where I'm
going to teach you guys today how to
make this slide out navigation
functionality but without using any
JavaScript so I've already done it but
I'm going to go in here and I'm going to
erase all the things I did so that we
can start from a clean slate okay so
basically what you see here is the blog
and then I put it into a div called page
content and it's inside the body very
clean this is exactly what you expect it
to be so if I were going to start from
scratch and add the sidebar the first
thing I would need to do is literally
just to add the market for the sidebar
so I'm going to do that right now in a
div
cleverly named sidebar side bar and then
this Dib is going to be filled with just
a bunch of list items call it home home
projects clients blog and contact let's
see what we got we will see that I put
the sidebar after the page content so if
I scroll all the way down here I'll see
my sidebar home projects clients blog
contact first thing we're gonna do
intercepts actually is import bourbon if
you're not familiar
I use a sass framework called bourbon
and it is super fantabulous it has all
these awesome functions and mix-ins
and a lot of the coolest things or down
here the add-ons like they do a really
cool clear fix my favorite is like just
position like you can write a really
interesting mix in and I'll take care of
all the positioning it so I so I always
include bourbon it doesn't add any
weight to your exported project but it
adds a lot of handy tools and mix ins to
use if you're using SAS or SCSS I prefer
SAS s but that is a different video
altogether so the first thing I need to
do is surface that sidebar and I think
the best way to do that instead of
fighting the z-index of the the page ID
is to just scope it inside of its parent
that I can control one that I put there
called page - content so I'm gonna make
page - content
and I'm going to say it's position Allah
- and make the z-index 0 okay and then
I'm going to go over to the sidebar
composition zx0 awesome now what I would
like to do is have that look is like a
nice slide the Audi sidebar so I'm just
going to do a really quick styling here
um actually opposition to be this is a
bourbon mixin and you can do position
fix and then you name the the top left
right and bottom in that order so when I
say top want to be zero pixels right I
don't care and if I just write zero with
nothing behind it that means nothing is
there zero pixels bottom and zero pixels
in left so when I do sidebar I
misspelled position when I do this
sidebar it shows up there okay so I want
me with me 33 let's see we go oh that's
nice like the color actually this should
be a P instead of doing Y it I'll make
the color a little little transparent
but make it white but just a little
transparent so I can have it like you
know kind of a pleasing rollover effect
when to do that so 255 in red green blue
with a 0.8 and then when I do and hover
RGB a 5 to 55 or that means white and
then make it fully opaque so outside Oh
in the afternoons 3 Connor okay so these
guys will be not quite white in the role
of when they get nice bright okay that's
what I wanted and I also wanted these
guys to be what is this Ubuntu keep it
in family and all of its size like an 18
that's 16 pixels and you margin-bottom
16 pixels exactly that's starting to
look nice don't turn down that alias I
forget how to spell anti-aliasing so I
do this so I do the handicapped way a -
WebKit smoothing - alias that's what I
wanted okay so I add a little bit of
anti-aliasing
on there so it look nice and crisp there
we go look at that oh good and I want it
to have a a pointer cuz up I'm fake it
with I'm going to fake it to look like a
link so I wanted to have a
cursor:pointer
there now it looks like a side bar for
links okay so now I need to do a we need
to have that link to click on and if you
remember Alex's original tutorial
he had that link called toggle and that
would be the hook that you would use for
your JavaScript and say if this link is
clicked then change the class of the
side bar we're gonna do something
similar but a little bit different from
still need that
look that little toggle button out there
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
pop over to copy paste character copy
paste character you don't know this
website this is awesome you know give a
whole bunch of unicode characters like a
snowman and umbrella and then all you
have to do is click on it and it's
copied into your clipboard you can place
wherever you like so I'm going to grab a
cool menu looking button thereö okay
actually let's put these two class page
- rap all right we've got a page content
our sidebar we need to wrap them both in
something we can depend on okay and then
int Boop no one print this and then
inside we can put our button so you
would normally do a dist anchor href and
then nothing class toggle oops and then
have a little anchor button there and
it's up here you can see it make it a
little bit noise that's hide hide this
sidebar display:none okay you see that
little guy up there that's going to be
our anchor so let me do a few quick
styles on him wherever you are and I
called it toggle I think right class
toggle toggle okay position this I tion
absolute actually I want to make it
fixed so that when you scroll down it
will scroll with my sidebar 20 pixels
from the top 0 pixels from the right 0
crystal or not 0 pixels but nope
to undefined pixels from the right
undefined pixels from the bottom and
what is this
I think it's hundred 2430 on your side
right to a 60 70 80 so 180 plus about 20
so that's 200 from
left so this shorthand again means it's
going to be position fixed to any pixels
from the top is undefined pixels from
the right
undefined from the bottom and 200 from
the left now let's take a look where is
it now
toggle fly it around oh now I need to
z-index it because again that body is
indexed on top z index 1 and then I want
to do a few things to make it not look
like it's make it not look like it's a
link so I'll do text decoration and take
away that underline font size 30 pixels
color black looks pretty good oh I like
the highlight but anyway okay so now
again with the JavaScript we would use
this anchor to to say you know when this
and when this link is clicked we toggle
the class on off but what I want to do
and this is kind of where we're
diverging here is I want to take a
minute to talk about something
completely different I want to talk
about check boxes because we're using
check boxes to control the state of this
sidebar is it open or is it not is the
checkbox checked or is it not I'll show
you how that's done so let's learn about
check boxes the first thing to
understand about check boxes is the
relationship that check boxes have to
their labels so here we have a few
examples the first one is right here
input check box and then following is is
a label now normally you check a check
box and it's checked we know that but
oftentimes you've seen it where you can
check a label you can take a label and
the checkbox will actually happen that
is done in one of two ways in this first
example is not that way
this will nothing will happen if you
click this label here it's basically
unrelated there's no way that the
browser can know that this label is
related to this tick bar or this check
box right here so it's it's inert
basically it's just a floating check box
by itself that just happens to be placed
next to a random label so if I want to
if I want to have a relationship between
the label and the check box and it's
what we're looking for in a few minutes
and I'll show you why I'm gonna have to
connect them somehow the first way to do
that is actually to stick the check box
inside of the label you see how it's
nested inside there now when I click the
label itself I don't have to click the
check box I can when I click the label
it's checking and unchecking the check
box so that's a good way to do it and
the last way to do it is you can
separate the label and the check box
completely if you're using a few of the
attributes the label needs a four
attribute and it needs to have the the
content of the ID of the check box so
here I have an example of the label kind
of floating off by its own and I said I
went and took an extra measure and
separated them by a div and then inside
that I have an ID the check box is
called surprise the label has a four
attribute of surprise so that when I
click the label the check box will
receive it you will receive that check
state now here's the key in CSS you can
use you can use a pseudo element of a
checked let me show you how that works
mmm here okay if I have an element and
then a pseudo element of checked it will
apply the Styles only if the element is
a checkbox that is checked so we're
going to we're going to use that as a
way to change the state of that slide up
menu
and here's how it's going to work I'm
going to go out to the the markup and
I'm going to go in front of the page
wrap and I'm going to say input type is
a check box the name and value don't
matter to me right now and I want to put
the ID as a let's call it a sidebar
toddler just because I'm not really good
at naming okay
and that's all it matters to me right
now
sidebar toddler and then I'm going to go
in here and write change this anchor to
label and then that the ref becomes the
four and then I want to reference the
sidebar tag toddler side bar toddler
this can be it's going to be any name
you like it could be surprised be side
bar toddler it doesn't matter the point
is that this four is going to match this
ID and that when I click on the label
it's going to tick and untick the box so
let me get rid of this sidebar so you
can you can see that happening explain
you see that tick box up there watch
what happens when I click the label it's
checked and unchecked now that's
fantastic that is great the first thing
we got to do is go up to our let's throw
down here because it's a it's an ID so
it'd be heavy enough side bar toddler
first thing going to do is get rid of it
we don't want it actually showing up in
our work now the next thing I have to do
is think to myself where is the
relationship of the sidebar toddler to
the the things that I actually need to
toggle if we go back to our markup when
I see that the input that's going to
take the the checked or unchecked states
is a sibling
of the page wrap now the page wrap is
the parent of both the content and the
sidebar and the label so what I need to
do is I need to find a way to navigate
the Dom with my CSS I'm going to use a
pretty complicated selector so I'm going
to say in the case of the sidebar
toddler being checked look at its
sibling and what did I call it a page
wrap and let's go from there so after
page wrap let's take this sidebar and
say it should be left zero pixels
because that's going to be the out state
we're going to look at all of these
things I want to say what's going to be
the state of it being slid and then I
want to change this to what negative 180
negative 190 I think okay so let's take
a look oh right so when I click this
toddler what's happening is it's
traversing the Dom in finding that
sidebar and saying oh you know during
the state of this tick boxes tick this
sidebar should be left zero if it's not
ticked watch I uncheck it the the
sidebar is left negative 190 pixels so
let's make some accommodations here if
the sidebar is checked the toggle needs
to be in its out state which is going to
be left 200 pixels and this needs to be
20 so I'm gonna check it out
yeah so it's going to move with it
that's good and then the last thing I
need to do is kind of mess with the the
state of the page content when it's out
I want to add a little bit of padding so
you see how it's lopsided here this
content is still you know I want it to
be like centered in taking into account
this sidebar something to add some
padding having cooked left and it's
going to be about that 180 pixels
there's okay good so when it's closed
that padding is gone when it's open it's
there good now to make the CSS magic
happen I'm going to add a another
bourbon shortcut of transition where is
it and all of this is doing all this
transition is doing is just adding on
like the vendor prefixes and stuff like
that so here's how that's done
transition that's how it's done
not difficult sidebar I want to
transition that to some of the toggle
and the sidebar to both kind of move in
and out like that so let's take a look
oh yes that is nice and soft but we're
still seeing this body jump so let's go
to the page index and do that
transitional to see if that's smoother
oh yes much much smoother cool now I
want the default state to be unchecked
so I'm going to go to my toggle okay all
right
right okay cool so when I show up I know
able to do this yeah cool cool cool cool
so look this is the magic these ten
lines of code these seven lines cut
wherever there this is the magic we
don't have to do any JavaScript to do
this is just CSS we're being smart about
how we're checking the states and I
really like this this is good cool now
the things that we've discussed here are
not necessarily new per se the selectors
and elements have been around for
actually quite a while but the approach
is very clever and I really like that so
I wanted to share it okay guys that's it
for today I'm very excited that you've
watched the video all the way if you
have any questions or comments leave
them down in the giggity-giggity below
and I'll be monitoring these comments
and responding throughout and I'll also
be posting
new video on this channel every first
Monday of the month think of it as a a
guest column and if you haven't gotten
enough of this guy you can check out my
channel called dev tips I post a new
video every Monday and the link is also
in the description below thanks for
watching thanks for giving me that
little bit of your day I really
appreciate I love to hear what you think
about it below and if you did enjoy it
if you did learn something please please
please share it with your friends or
your mom because I heard she likes to
code
hey that was a lot of fun but I I just
thought of another cool thing that we
could do here maybe add just a little
bit more Flair and I just want to share
that with you the video is officially
over if you have watched up to this
point you have successfully watched the
video I understand if you want to quit
but if you want to stick around for just
a little bit more I'm going to take this
a little cool slide out up to a level 10
it's going to be pretty cool and jazzy
jazzy is a word
okay let's start now I'm noticing here
when I written the mark-up that the
sidebar toggler which is the button and
the page content itself and the sidebar
are all three separate and distinct HTML
notes which is interesting they operate
enter two independent of each other even
though they look you know styled style
together now we can use this to our
advantage I have the the page moving
over and the sidebar moving over but I
don't want the sidebar to move over
anymore I just want it's just kind of
stay still
yes I want to stay still so I'm going to
remove I'm going to take the what I'm
going to do sidebar okay I want to mix
sidebar zero and remove the transition
and remove the toggle here and when this
starts okay I expected that z-index two
two and then page contents indexed with
one there okay so now I've got the page
and the button on top of the sidebar so
when I open the sidebar it's not sliding
in with the page it's kind of just being
there and being revealed and I think
that's kind of fun now I want to do
something cool to the page itself where
it can have a cool transition out so
let's take this page content and
not to the padding loud I want to do
like I want to be really drastic so
transition scale
no not transition transform transform
scale and I want it to scale to 0.7 and
then put this same code at the top so it
has a reference point its page content
scale of 1 and it's going to shrink
hopefully yep whoa check that out okay
so a few things here I don't want that
to shrink that much oh wait no I do okay
but I want to put the transform origin
um to be right center I think that's how
that one goes
okay so it's on the center of the page
the problem the reason I'm getting like
this weird corner shift down is because
it's true it's transitioning the entire
page which is thousands of pixels tall
and shrinking that down 70% and
transitioning or and yeah transitioning
it to the right and the center of the
seventh of the thousand pixels tall
whatever it is so I want to have the
page content be kind of constrained in
size so I'm going to say the height is
going to be 100 pixel or 100 percent and
the overflow will be scroll let's see
now boom okay this is what I wanted
oh wow that's cool and I can scroll
inside it check that out it with just a
few tweaks we can do like really
interesting things that that is cool
we're just sorry with just a few
interesting tweaks we can do some really
interesting things that can have a lot
of stylish Flair so just a little bit
more flair for you I'm going to come
down here and put on a box shadow zero
pixels for pixels zero pixels from the
right left four pixels from the top and
I want to do like what 20 pixel blur and
a and like a 20%
blur or black that's a lot nicer so it
looks like this artifact that's it can
kind of like shoved off to the side
what's cool is you can actually scroll
through it still the main is accessible
and the blog still works I like that it
makes me happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
