slightly off so you're not gonna be able
to see it but if you head over to your
menu hit preferences and then go to
browse packages you'll see this come up
so you can see here that we've got a few
folders but what we're interested in is
why our color schemes are stored so
let's head into this and you can see
here that we have Facebook TM theme so
let's go and pull this into our text
editor you can see here we now just have
an XML file so what we can do is we can
start to update this so for example if I
just set this to black you can see my
background color goes black now all I
need to do is work out the color of this
panel here and it just so happens that
over on the github page for the material
theme it tells me exactly what that is
so it's 2 6 3 2 3 8 so that's going into
this in here 2 6 3 2 3 8 and there we go
so we're now matching that to our
sidebar and you can play around with
this all you want you can go and scroll
through here look at whatever you want
to change go ahead and change it and
you'll see the changes instantly
reflected which is really nice so you
can just kind of play around with this
as you wish so there we go that's our
theme set up we're ready to move on to
look at some other things that we can do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
