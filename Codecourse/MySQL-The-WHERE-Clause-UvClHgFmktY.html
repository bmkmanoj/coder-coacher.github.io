specific terms so using a where clause
now we're going to look at this very
basically but it should give you the
fundamental understanding of how you can
specifically select records where you
need them or which ones you need so
let's go ahead and take a look at the
Select and with the where clause so I'm
going to select star from articles i'm
selecting all columns from the articles
table but now what i'm going to do is
provide the where clause now this is
like an if statement almost in
programming languages what we're going
to do is going to say where something
equals or is greater than or doesn't
equal something so first of all let's
take a look at you know something quite
basic i'm going to say where ID equals 1
so what this is conservatives couldn't
provide me the record where the field or
the column ID is equal to 1 and
obviously it can do the same with ID
equals 2 and this will provide me with
the second result now I can also do is
do things like where the ID is greater
than 1 and obviously that's going to
provide them with two and again if you
had things like you know created or if
you had other integer fields or a
specific user had posted something and
you had the user ID set column which
stored user IDs you could go ahead and
do this as well we can also do things
with the Creator that day as well so for
example let's go ahead and create a
query using the now function that we saw
earlier so i'm going to say select star
from articles where created is greater
than now now what do you suppose is
going to be returned here i'm going to
get used now to get the current time and
date or the comment timestamp and i want
to select all records where created is
greater than now now as it stands when
we created these records that was you
know 5 10 15 minutes ago so if i go
ahead and hit enter now we obviously get
an empty set there's nothing returned
however if we say we won't create it out
where its creator is less than now
obviously you know the current day is
now
and we created these records you know a
while ago so we returned with both
records so we can use the where clause
with all different fields we could you
know we can even say where something
like where name equals and then give a
string value so working with my SQL for
example like this so that will provide
us with the working with MySQL article
as we requested so that's just a simple
way to use the where clause to pick up
specific records from your table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
