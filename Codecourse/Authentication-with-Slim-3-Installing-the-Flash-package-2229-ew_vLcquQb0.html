kind of general flash message on our
page and these can be really useful so
for example when we sign the user up we
might want to say you've created your
account when we go ahead and hit sign in
and we can't be signed in we might want
to show a message at the top as well of
course you can incorporate this into
your form if you wanted to but I find
the easiest way is just to create a
general global message that we can show
at the top so we're gonna take this part
to just look over the package that we're
going to be using we'll install it and
we'll see how it works
and we'll then go ahead and we'll start
to set this up and create our flash
partial and then later on we'll look at
sup dating our sign up and sign in
routes to actually use these okay so
we're going to be using a package again
this is part of the official slim
package set and all we do is we pull
this down with composure and we'll take
a look at how it's used in just a moment
so let's require this into our project
first of all so let's do a composer
require on this wait for that to
download okay so that's done so how does
this work then well it looks like we
have to register it on our container and
the name space is slim flash messages so
let's go and do this first of all it's
close everything else off head over to
our app dot PHP file and we'll go and
just add this up here so container will
call this flash so we can access it
within our controllers or any where else
we want to use it so container and here
we'll just return a new slim flash the
messages instance so essentially we use
this by accessing it on our container
and then we add a message with a key and
then the message we want to show and
here obviously we redirect off now what
this will do and you can go ahead and
look at the actual source code for this
it really helps to kind of understand
how these things work it will add it
into your session and then on the next
time we view a page that will be within
the session and we can of course then
use this
flash get messages or we can grab a
message by a particular key so now that
we've got that out of the way and done
with we want to go and experiment with
this and create our flash partial and
this will be always available at the top
of every single page or every single
page we use that base template on and
therefore we can just go ahead and flash
this anywhere we want so let's move over
and implement this next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
