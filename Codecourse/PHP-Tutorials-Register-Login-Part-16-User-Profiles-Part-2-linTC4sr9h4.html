deal with this so we can reuse this user
ID from user name function so let's go
ahead and say user ID from username
username and we pass through that so I'm
going to echo out user ID and that will
just echo the current user ID here so
that's 15 let's take a look in our
database
Alex has the user ID 15 so what we can
now do is we can use this user ID and
pass this into the user data function so
I'm going to create a new variable
called profile data just move these
along so you can keep everything nice
and tidy and profile data is going to
equal user data so the user data
function we're going to pass in the user
ID I'm also going to pass in the fields
that we want to access here so the
fields I want to access our first-name
and this is just an example this could
be anything first name last name and
email for example okay so now that we've
done this we can go ahead and we can
output whatever information we want
about a user now the only problem we've
got here is that we are not checking
whether a user actually exists or not
we're not doing you know we're you know
we're not doing this kind of check so
what we actually need to do is before we
do any of this here we need to check if
the user name is available because at
the moment we can type in Alex you know
that's fine but what happens if your
user doesn't exist
for example Alex 1 and we get this error
here okay that that's from our users
user underscore data function so we need
to perform a check whether the user
actually exists or not
so I'm going to say if something then
oops if something then do all of this
now how do we check if a user actually
exists well we already have a function
for that we use that with our register
page and our login page so if we scroll
up we've got this user exists' function
here we just pass in a user name and it
returns either true or false so let's go
ahead and use this so user
fists username if this equals true then
we do everything inside of here
otherwise we can just say something like
and just escape that character there
okay
so let's give this a whirl I'm going to
type in Alex nothing comes up because
we're not doing anything typing out each
one sorry that user doesn't exist so
that's fair enough I'm going to leave it
at this because there's probably a
million ways you can make this look a
lot nicer
you could redirect your user somewhere
or or whatever but for now let's go back
and focus on actually outputting some
information so here what I'm going to do
is I'm going to break out of PHP and
back into PHP and this is a little messy
because what we're doing is where we've
got output here in the middle of our
logic so we've got one of our logic down
here and our output it's going to be
stuck in the middle I'm going to leave
it as it is but I'm going to not give
you the challenge but just warn you that
this can be cleared up so go back and
look at how we've done the error
reporting before and that's probably a
good exercise to try and tidy up a file
like this and it's not a very not very
big file at all either way it will work
fine as it is okay so we've done that so
let's go ahead now and set output some
data so I've broken out of PHP so I can
use pure HTML here and in here I'm going
to say X's profile now X is just going
to basically represent the user that
we've passed through and I'm going to
use the first name here so I'm going to
break into PHP and out an echo profile
data
first name perfect so let's go ahead and
refresh and it says Alex's profile now
we also have Billy here as well so I can
go in and I can look at release profile
and I echoes Billy's profile and then
obviously by now you you know probably
understood that here we could say
something like well I could just output
an email address for example so I could
echo profile data email because we've
requested that we want the data from the
email field so now it gives us the email
address and again we can go back to Alex
here and do the same so I'm not going to
take this any further I'm gonna you know
leave it at that because it's then easy
very very easy to go ahead and just
output any data that you are storing
about your user so now we'll just finish
off with going and opening our includes
file opening up our logged in menu
widget and let's go ahead and add a link
in for the user themselves to access
their own profile so I'm going to go
ahead and just copy this I'm going to go
ahead and paste this underneath here and
I'm going to say profile just in here we
what would we do we can say forward
slash and then we want the user name in
here so how do we access the users name
well let's go to init dot PHP you can
see that the user data variable holds
the username we've already dealt with
this so you should be familiar it's a
user name here so what we can do is we
can say and we're doing this here by the
way user data first name but obviously
it's the username that we're passing
through so I'm going to save PHP echo
user data
user name so now I'm going to go ahead
and refresh let's go back to your home
page we've got this profile link here if
you look at the bottom left-hand corner
of my browser you can see localhost
forward slash Alex that's obviously not
what we want we want I think without the
forward slash would be better there we
go so we've got local Howitt bottom
left-hand corner again we've got
localhost /lr /al --ax so I click on
that and it takes me to my profile so
yeah that's about it that is how we
would go ahead and output profile
contents as you can see we've done this
extremely easily because we already have
the majority of functions in place what
all of the functions in this case to
actually grab the data that we need and
the only difference that we've made is
we've created this htaccess file which
has allowed us to rewrite the URL</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
