are going to need a brick image and I've
gone ahead and taken the brick set just
here from open game art org I'll leave a
link to this in the course link so you
can go ahead and grab it but I'll also
leave the cut up version of these we're
not going to be using a sprite for this
although that would be better we're just
gonna take each individual tiny image
and go ahead and replicate it later on
if you want to create a sprite you can
do it just means we're not loading in
three different images because of course
we have the paddle the brick and the
ball okay so let's go ahead and just
copy this over first of all so over in
the root directory over in assets over
in images we're gonna go ahead and copy
this brick image over so that's all
there and ready to go now the first step
that we need to take is to go ahead and
load this in so if we just come over to
boot j/s notice that down here we're
loading in some assets like the loader
background and the loader bar what we
now need to do is do pretty much the
same thing so let's go ahead and say
this load image and we basically give a
unique reference to this and then we
give the path so we know that this is
going to be an assets
images and this is going to be brick dot
PNG so now that we've loaded that break
in we can use this brick wherever we
want inside of our world okay so now
that we've done this what we're gonna do
is outside of the state's directory and
directly within source I'm gonna create
a prefab directory these are
prefabricated elements that we can use
and reuse and we can create our own
logic inside of these now for a brick
this is gonna be pretty straightforward
but let's take a look how this works and
then I'll explain further why we're
doing this font if we get into it so I'm
going to create a brick j/s file inside
of here at the top I'm gonna go ahead
and import phaser from phaser and we're
gonna go ahead and create a brick class
in here and this is gonna extend phaser
dot sprite so let's go ahead and add
that in now this is gonna have a
constructor inside of here which is
going to go ahead and set everything up
we'll get a reference inside of this
constructor to the game and the X&amp;amp;Y
position that we're actually placing
this object which is really important
now we're going to call the parent
constructor passing in the game the X
and the y and
go ahead and pass in brick all this
means is that we're if we want to use
this brick we can pass in where we want
it to be on the X and y axis and that's
going to go ahead and place it in the
correct position for us now also inside
of the constructor we want to go ahead
and set the physics for this particular
item we know that this will react to
things touching it like the ball so
we're going to go ahead and say this
game physics arcade and we're going to
enable the body on this and pass in a
reference to the current thing which of
course is the brick so we're kind of
doing this we could do this outside of
here but I find it quite helpful to do
everything inside of here so we're just
saying enable physics for this
particular item now the other thing that
we want to do really importantly is set
the a moveable property on here to true
because of course a brick can't move it
can be destroyed a ball can mover a
paddle can move but this should never
move now finally we're gonna go ahead
and export this brick and that is pretty
much it we can import this where we need
it we can go ahead and place it in the
correct position we know that we've
enabled physics on this and we have set
it to immovable okay so now what we need
to do is over in our actual game set up
our bricks so once again what I'm going
to do is inside of the create method
which is gonna be called when this
screen is kind of rendered we're gonna
go ahead and say create bricks and of
course extract that out to a create
bricks method in here just to keep
things nice and tidy now let's actually
call this set up bricks that makes a
little bit more sense just to keep in
consistency with what we've done here
and the first thing that we're gonna do
is assign a property to this class
called bricks and we're gonna say this
game add group now all that's going to
do is create a group of a specific item
for us which we can collect together and
apply maybe an event handler on all of
them items so for a brick of course
we're going to have lots of bricks which
all need to do something when a ball
hits it so that's why we add a group so
we can apply that event to all of the
things inside of here
so what we're now going to do is call a
generate bricks method
getting to keep this nice and tidy and
we're gonna pass in what we want to
place them bricks under so this just
keeps it open too if you had several
collections of bricks or different types
of bricks we're just gonna say generate
bricks passing in that group and then
inside of this method we can use some
tricks to go ahead and generate these
out now I like to do this so it can be
easily customized so inside of here I'm
gonna create a Rose variable and I'm
gonna create a columns variable to
denote how many of course rows we want
and how many columns we want what we're
then going to do is we're going to
choose an x offset for each of the
bricks so how far apart they should be
and also a wire off set for the bricks
to say how far apart they should be so
I've just chosen 50 and 45 randomly but
of course you can adjust this if you
want to now what we're going to do is
we're going to iterate through each of
the rows is to rake through each of the
columns and for each of them iterations
we're going to generate a brick and then
we're gonna add it to that bricks group
and then finally that entire group we
can position where we need to on the
screen so the first thing that we want
to do is create a for loop in here let's
go ahead and initialize a Y variable to
0 and then we're gonna say while Y is
less than the amount of rows we have
we're gonna increment Y so as long as
you know a basic for loop then this
should make complete sense now because
we're doing rows and columns we need
another for loop inside of here because
of course we need to generate a cross
and downwards so we create another for
loop the for each loop inside of here
are for loops are inside of here and we
let x equals equals 0 and of course you
can change these variable names around
and instead we compare this to the
amount of columns so we only want to
generate this while it is less than the
amount of columns that we need now what
we can do inside of here is new up a
brick which is that prefab that we
created over here before we do that we
need to go ahead and import this so
let's import brick from going back a
directory into prefabs and pulling in
brick let's go down and what we can do
like I said over in that prefab we can
pass in the game which of course we have
a reference to inside of our main game
the X&amp;amp;Y position so now that we've
created this new brick let's pull this
this is the reference to the game now we
need the X&amp;amp;Y offset all we do is we
multiply X which is the inside loop just
here by the X offset that's going to go
ahead and position them spaced apart by
50 and we do the same for y as well so Y
times the y offset so hopefully that
makes sense but you can fiddle around
with these if this gets a little bit too
tricky now inside of the inner for loop
we want to use that BRICS group that
we're passing through which we haven't
actually done at the moment this is
going to be the BRICS group remember
that we're passing that group into we
want to go ahead and use that BRICS
group to add the BRIC that we've just
created which of course is going to have
a different X&amp;amp;Y position for each of
them okay so now that we've done this
let's just come down here and let's log
out the BRICS group so just before we go
ahead and preview this just to make sure
we don't have any errors let's to find
out the BRIC here which is of course
going to be overwritten for every single
brick that's defined and if we come over
notice that you have the following and
of course we have that locked out as
well and this is our phaser group with
all of our bricks in so you can see that
this is being placed on the screen but
we need to position this in the very
center just underneath lives a offset of
our choice from the top and of course
this needs to be perfectly centered so
that's the tricky part how do we go
ahead and do this let's go ahead and get
rid of the console lock here and let's
go ahead and create a brick group width
variable now we need to work out the
entire width of the brick set now this
is gonna be the X offset that we've
defined at the top just up here and that
is the space between each of the bricks
multiplied by the amount of columns we
have and then we're going to subtract
the X offset minus the brick width like
so so all that's doing if we divide that
by two is giving us the position this
should be in the center and you can go
ahead and do some console logging on
this to see how this works now what we
can do is say bricks group position and
we can use the set to method to go ahead
and place this where we need to so
actually let's first of all go ahead and
log out the brick group with just so we
can see this let's comment this out so
you can see that we get three six six
now this is the width of our brick group
from that based on the width of the
world what we can do is work out where
this should be positioned so this is the
width of the brick group now we want to
say this game world center X - the brick
group width and then for the Y access
axis it doesn't really matter we can
just say this game world and center Y -
250 and that's going to be 250 pixels
from the top so if we give that a
refresh now you can see that that is
working we determine the width of the
brick group from the world size we
placed it in the center and then this is
250 pixels from the top which of course
you can adjust if you want to now if I
open this up so the canvas area is going
to be larger and I give that a refresh
notice that it still works it's not
going to react to the browser size
changing it's just going to cut this off
because we have a kind of static canvas
element what it will do is when the game
first enters regardless of the size of
the screen is going to position these in
the center so that's pretty much our
bricks set up in our brick group again
this stuff can get a little bit
confusing but if you're a mathematician
if you're good at maths then you know
you'll understand this straight away
I'm unfortunately not so it took me a
little bit of time to get this working
but that is pretty much how we go ahead
and it's right through generate our rows
and columns for our bricks and go ahead
and position them in the center of our
world and of course you can customize
this now so if you wanted 10 columns
that's gonna work and it's still gonna
position them in the center because
we've determined this based on how many
columns we have and four rows as well of
course you could bump this up and have
more rows if you wanted to okay so now
that we've done that we can move on to
adding the paddle at the bottom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
