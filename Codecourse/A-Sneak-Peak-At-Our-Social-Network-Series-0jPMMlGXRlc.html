or a teaser for an upcoming social
network series since then we've been
working hard to get to complete and now
we're pleased to announce that the code
is complete and we're ready to start
recording so the purpose of this video
is just to demonstrate some of the
functionality explain what we'll be
learning and maybe talk about how we're
going to go about it so the whole thing
is going to be in plain PHP we're not
using any existing framework like
laravel however we we are going to be
building the application on top of a
custom MVC framework which will also be
learning how to build and that's what
this repository here is for now as well
as that were actually going to be
learning how to build the the actual
application obviously and that's what
this one is for here so let's go and
demonstrate some of the functionality
the first thing that we need to do is
create an account so let's say Terry
will have a password of just password
and i'll put in just a dummy email
address and there you go we see your
account has been created you may now
sign in with your details so before we
do that let's just create another user
will make this for Alex and we'll give
him another email ok so now let's sign
in with our account I will fill in our
username we can also enter our email the
system is smart enough to determine
whether the user is trying to log in
with a username or email and we'll enter
our password and we'll sign in so here
you go we see this welcome back a
message and we presented with this
timeline so let's just get rid of that
and let's update our status so what's up
well just demonstrating the new social
network series
and let's update our status and there we
go we get redirected to our profile
where we can see our avatar which is
fetched from gravatar we can update as
status again and we can view our past
statuses and we can also view our
friends but unfortunately we don't have
any at the minute so let's fix that
let's search for alex's profile and
we'll add him right so if we go back to
my profile you see that we have Alex on
our friends list and we can also view
our friends list on this page here so
back to our timeline the purpose of this
is to display the statuses of all of
your friends as well as yourself so in
another window here in a chrome
incognito window our cookies and saved
which means we can log in as another
user so let's log in using alex's
account and let's update our status will
say just playing with my cut so let's
update the status would get redirected
profile where we can see our status and
if we refresh in our in our other
account because alex is my friend his
status is showing on the feed now we can
also reply to statuses so we could say
how cute what's his name so hit reply
and we get a success message and we see
our reply down here and back in Alex's
account we can actually see this reply
as expected and we can reply to that his
name is Max so hit reply and then our
timeline gets updated so that's just a
quick rundown of some of the features we
haven't we haven't incorporated any
JavaScript or Ajax or anything like that
but we are considering extending the
series in the future so look out for
that too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
