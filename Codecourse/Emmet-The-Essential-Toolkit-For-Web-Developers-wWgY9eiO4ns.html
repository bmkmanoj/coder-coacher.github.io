which is described here as the essential
toolkit for web developers and I'm gonna
show you a couple of bits that Emmet
does that allows you to really speed up
your workflow now just before we start
looking at some of the syntax you're
gonna want to go ahead and download it
if you want to follow along for your
text editor you can see it support a lot
of text editors here the one that you
use is likely going to be here it's also
available from some online services in
this third-party support here as well
now I'm going to be using a sublime text
to demonstrate this quite popular text
editor but obviously go ahead and
download it for your text editor yeah if
you want to go ahead and play around so
this is Emmet now everything I'm gonna
show you is actually in the
documentation so after you finish
watching this video if you need to find
anything more specific just head over to
the documentation there's a really good
cheat sheet as well you can just find
out how to do certain things now I've
installed Emmet for sublime using
package manager so extremely easy to
install and I have certain key bindings
now to expand a shortcut or short or
syntax that then will give you HTML and
if you have no idea what I'm talking
about you will find out in a moment I'm
gonna use the tab key or I can hit ctrl
+ E so for example let's just do let's
just start with a really basic example
let's say if for example I hit tab and
that gives me an opening and a closing
div tag now that might be fairly
straightforward but there are a lot more
complicated examples and throughout this
video we are going to look at some
real-life examples for example quickly
marking up forms and other things as
well so let's take a look at getting a
page started first of all it's likely
that you're going to be using an html5
doctype now what you can do is just use
the HTML : 5 shortcut I'm going to tab
that out and you can see this has
generated me a doc document layout and
the only thing that I tend
change here is I just indent all of that
and that's it we have done we've sort of
created the document layout saves you a
lot of time if you didn't if you wanted
to sort of create this excluding the
actual doctype itself say you wanted to
put something else in there you can just
use the doc shortcut now I'll just give
you that so doc or html5 there are HTML
4 options but I'm not gonna be looking
on that there's no point
so Emmet works with the kind of CSS
selector syntax so if you do know CSS
you'll be able to sort of get started
with this really easily so for example
I'm gonna say nav now within this as a
child element I'm gonna say ul and then
within this again as a child element I'm
gonna say Li and I'm going to tab that
out now you can see that I've created a
nav ul and then an L I'm in there
already so we get to the stage where
probably we obviously can you know I can
hit command shift + D in sublime to
actually duplicate this li but what if I
want to actually utilize Emmet to do
this for me well we can do this we use
the multipliers - the asterisks and then
we give a number of times we want to
multiply this particular element so if I
tap that out we get 5l is really really
straightforward and the cursor is
automatically placed in the first li so
I can start typing whatever I want now
talking of anchors we could actually do
the same thing really we could just say
that a and there we go we have an anchor
within it and we'll look a little bit
more anchors a bit later so with classes
you know there's likely going to be a
point where you perhaps one a nav with a
class of something that's easy we just
use the same kind of syntax we'd use for
CSS so for example and now for the class
of box tab that out and that
automatically creates the class
attribute with the Box class in there
now what let's sort of go back to our
earlier example of list items say we
want fine
of list items and these list items we
want to have a class of item that's it
we just tab that out and we get the
exact same thing or the thing that we
expect now bear in mind that one this is
just a soft side now when you are
expanding these you're gonna want the
cursor to be at the very end of the line
look what happens if I press tab here
that's going to expand all of that then
it's gonna leave the rest of what I've
typed unexpanded so you're gonna need to
make sure that your your the end in
sublime I can just hit command and right
and that puts me to the end of it I can
hit tab and there we go we've created
that markup so you can already see how
easy this is now for multiple classes is
easy just literally chain them on so I
wanna say item and I'm just gonna say
another - class end of the line and we
tab that out and you can see that
created me another class in there really
really really easy now I'm gonna talk
about text within these elements so
let's say we want to let's get rid of
this and let's say we want a navigation
or have a nav element with a ul and Li
we want to give these a class of item
and let's say we want five of them we
know that this works what I can then do
is then I can use the curly brackets to
define within here the text I want
within these this this element basically
I'm gonna need this just here multiply
it should always be on the end so I can
just say item okay let's expand this out
and there we go that text has now been
placed within that list item so more
appropriately
you would probably have a anchor in here
so you would have an anchor now an
anchor will automatically give you an H
ref but in here I'm gonna say link and
then I'm gonna say one that to be sorry
I want the list item to be five and then
within each of them I want there to be
an anchor with the text of link there we
go fairly straightforward
okay so numbering now let's say you want
to
you say item 1 item 2 item 3 you might
say well I'm gonna generate a list item
with the class of item and then I'm
gonna have that multiplied by 5 and then
within that I'm gonna have a anchor with
link and I could say link 1 expand that
out and then I could come over here and
I could say link 2 in 3 link 4 link 5
and maybe I want these to be item 1 2 3
4 and 5 as well already spending too
much time and it has functionality to
allow you to do this automatically and
we use the dollar for that so we just
write a lot on its own we can also
integrate this within classes and ID's
as well so for example item dollar will
give me item 1 2 3 4 and there we go
simple as that so we just use a dollar
in place of where we want to count now
you can count backwards and you can chop
and change the numbers or the ordering
of the numbers go ahead and check out
the documentation to find more out about
that ok so just very briefly we'll touch
on IDs you've probably already guessed
since you maybe know CSS we can actually
use a hash if we want an ID so obviously
in this case we wouldn't multiply IDs in
here so I'm gonna get rid of this and
I'm gonna say well I want a navigation
and I want this to have a ID of Maine
for example then within this I want an
unordered list
I want list item say I want five of them
and within that I want an anchor with
the text of link expand that out and we
get the following so we've added our
idea of Maine up here with the rest of
what we needed to so classes are
obviously a dot notation IDs I hash like
so okay so now talking a little bit
about attributes let's say we want to
generate an anchor and einkorn its own
will look like that it will
automatically give us the href attribute
so we can just start typing away sign in
dot PHP or whatever you want to do what
we can actually do is we can explicitly
define the attributes that we want to
give to particular element
so for example let's say I want to just
write this out and I want to apply an
attribute all I use is similar a CSS
type selector and I'm gonna say H ref
and I'm gonna say say sign in okay and
we're gonna expand that out and we get
the following perfect
and then obviously on to this we can add
sign in and we can even go ahead and
just add a I don't know a sign in to
that like so there we go so from that we
have you know quickly generated this
following markup which would takes a
little bit longer to write so we've
looked now at some of the basics now
sometimes things will get a little bit
tricky now let's take a look at an
example we'll just create an unordered
list and a list item and we'll call
these item so we basically have this and
let's generate five of these so now what
happens if we want to add an anchor at
the end of this unordered list now we
haven't looked at this yet but we can
use the plus to create an element
adjacent to this now the only problem is
what this is going to do is it's gonna
add an anchor adjacent to the last Li
because we are following on from the Li
now there is another way we can remedy
this later but we're going to look at
grouping here in particular so you can
see now that's a problem
I wanted the anchor to appear after the
unordered list so what we do is there is
another way to do this but what I'm
actually going to do is wrap this entire
thing in parentheses and then after that
I'm gonna add the anchor and you can see
there the grouping has now helped to
separate them to items and it really
it's just a case of working out how s
this would work for you I can't give too
many examples because it would just be
silly but you know it just whatever
makes sense it's all I mathematics okay
so let's look at quite a fairly long
example now just so we can sort of get
to grips with what we've looked at so
far so what we're going to do is we're
going to create a head
and that's gonna have a navigation
within it so a header element with a
navigation within that we're gonna give
that navigation a ID of main
we're gonna have an unordered list list
items with item 1 item 2 item 3 for both
the attribute and B text within it and
we're gonna have five of them and then
after that we're going to have an aside
element with a idea of user within that
we're gonna have two anchors one for
signing in and one for account area or
something like that
so let's take a look at how we would do
this so the first thing we want to do is
header this is just a normal HTML
attribute so it just expands to that tag
it could literally be for anything at
all we can expand cat if we wanted to if
that was a valid element we're gonna
have a header and I'm just gonna put
these in brackets just to separate this
out we're gonna have a nav this is going
to have an ID of main within this we're
gonna have an unordered list and we're
gonna have a list we're gonna have a
list of list items with a class of item
with a number and then the text for this
is going to be item and then that
followed by that number and we're gonna
have five of these now after that and
I'm going to group these as well just
for readability we're gonna have an
aside element and that's going to have a
hash of an ID sorry of user now within
that we're gonna have two anchors so we
need a plus a now we can start to set
specific attributes so for example the
first one might be sign out and the
second one might have an href of account
area or something like that and this is
going to have the text of account and
the sign out link is going to have the
text of sign out so let's expand this
and there we go look at all that markup
we've just generated with that one small
line I've got a list of menu items after
that we have an aside element inside
we've got an anchor or two anchors
rather one going through to sign out
with sign out text I'm going through to
account with the count text and that's
got an ID of user and that's got an idea
of main really really quick and simple
switching between these you can see how
much time this is going to save you if
you are writing a lot
and once you get quick it using this as
well this is gonna save you even more
time so now we're gonna look at a plot
implied attributes we've already seen a
few of these what I mean by this is
attributes that pretty much are standard
on elements that you create so we've
already seen it for anchor we know that
an anchor is always really gonna have an
href and so what's gonna go somewhere
and the same with link as well link
isn't much used for that a rel attribute
in this case it's a stylesheet and then
I could just link in a star she
easy-peasy so in my head I could just
say link expand that out and then I can
link through to my star she easy another
one is the image tag which is quite
interesting because an image is gonna
have a source and it always should have
an or an alternate text in case that
image can't be rendered or for
accessibility if it can't be seen now
the same a text area this does give us
some in my opinion unnecessary
attributes like Coles and Rose you might
not necessarily need these it also gives
you an ID as well which is pretty
standard for inputs because you might
always want to give an idea if you have
a label that points to this and this is
a really good point as well actually if
we did actually expand out label you can
see this has a four so for example if
you were creating a text area you'd
expand this out you give this a name so
for example body you'd give this an ID
for example body and what you could then
do is you could create a label and then
you could just say body there we go
we've already created all that markup
then we haven't done it all in one go
we've created that markup pretty
straightforward okay so there employed
attributes and you'll find that they
come with a lot of the elements that are
expanded with image now moving on to
something a little bit more cop not
complicated but something that's a
little bit more boring in terms of
creating these are forms we've got a
couple of form helpers were in fact
quite a few form helpers that help us
build out forms so for example you would
expect form to be expanded something
like this with an action but you would
then have to add the method as well of
course you could do something like
method
post like so and expand that out that's
absolutely fine but there are aliases or
shortcuts for this so for example I
could say form yet like that or I could
say form post like that easy and you can
just fill in the action or you could add
the action in like this like that oops
maybe go to the end and there we go okay
so let's look at input types now we'll
see that we have input we know that
that's right by default this will say
we'll assume a type of text which is
fair enough because most forms will most
inputs will probably be type of text
it's probably the most common but you
can obviously do things like input radio
you could do import text if you wanted
to specifically define that and this
gives you a name and an ID attribute
again which is really useful you could
also do something like password and we
do have aliases for these as well if you
are really that in a hunt you know in so
much of a hurry you can just do input T
input P you could do input R is you know
really or in but see for a checkbox it's
really really that quick so let's look
at a full example of creating a form
that goes through to sign in dot PHP
we're gonna create a couple of elements
like form fields and in these we're
gonna have labels and then we're gonna
have inputs and then at the end we're
gonna have a submit button so we start
off with a form and we want this to be a
post method now we're going to give this
a class of form so we can combine this
with classes as well and we want this to
go through to sign or forward slash sign
in can be anything now within this
that's just group this as well so we're
going into the element now remember if
we do something like that this will be
placed within the element so we're gonna
go into the element I'm gonna create a
div with a form field so we're here
we're basically assuming that this is
going to be a div and so we just do a
form field for the class now inside of
this form field we're gonna have a label
and that label is going to be for the
username so now let's create the
username or actually we need to do the
text
so I'm going to say enter your username
and after this so plus we want an input
type of text and we want the name of
this to be username we want the ID of
this to be username so it matches the
label that we've just created now let's
close this off after this we again gonna
group this we want a form field much
like we had before and inside of this we
want a label and this label is going to
be for the password so now after this we
want to say enter your password for the
text and then we can after this do an
input of e so remember that's just an
alias for input password and here we can
say name password and we can give this
an ID as well
so we say ID password and then after
this I'm gonna come out the brackets I'm
gonna say we want an input type of
submit and we want the value of this to
be sign in great so now let's expand
this out we're missing a bracket just
there there we go so that's it so if we
double check everything's fine we've got
a form we've got a div here we can pull
this down manually or you can use a
plug-in to do this so we've got a div
with a class of form field and label up
here and then we've got an input down
here of text name text ID text and this
is for this and then down here we've got
another form field so we've got a label
within here and then we've got an input
type of password the name of password
idea of password as well looks good and
then we've got a submit so when we go
ahead and have a look at this it looks
like that perfect so there's a quick
form example now let's move on to
something that no one likes creating and
that is tables now we're gonna look at
the benefit of climbing up the selection
chain and we're gonna create a table
with a tea head and tea body now the
problem here if we just start writing
this out a table with a class of tables
easy table dot table with you know
this example it's easy to get pretty
head within this and then we're gonna
create th element within this and in
here we're gonna say head and then the
number and then we're gonna multiply
that by five so here we have a table the
T head and lots of headers within it or
five headers so that's gonna look like
that that's fine now the problem here is
where does the T body sit within our
selector because we want the T body to
be down here there okay but in our
selector if we were to do something like
I'd know T body like so that just
doesn't work obviously we could do T
body with a plus cuz that's some sort of
afterwards but now you'll see the reason
this doesn't work is because the last
selector here is a th so we're saying
that we want the t body after the th and
obviously we don't we want it after the
T head but we can't do plus T or D there
because that's just gonna mess
everything up so this is starting a
little bit confusing now but we have the
ability to climb up now we use whatever
character this is and know what it's
called but what we do is we're basically
saying here skip this I want this to I
want whatever I'm boots
I want whatever I observe I'm doing
after this so T body for example dirt
here here after T head so now that
source kipped one of the selectors in
here so now we're creating our T body
and we can just carry on as normal now
now what happens if we need to skip back
more than one selector so for example we
could have if we just get rid of all of
this we could have a th and then we have
a maybe five of them and there's an
anchor within them saying head and then
whatever the number is so we've got that
now now this isn't going to work if we
want to do dirty body so if we go back
one that's still we've still got a
problem because we are only skipping the
a and that's putting the t body after
the th so we just multiply
simple as that there we go solved so we
can use multiple climbing you can climb
up as many times as you want up the
selector chain and that's it so just to
finish the example off
let's under the tea body create a TR
will create two to sorry five rows and
then within this we have T DS and we're
gonna say item dollar and we obviously
want five of these we do that and then
we go so we've now got we just check it
out in the browser the following very
very straightforward and look at all
that markup that has been generated just
from that that's really really handy so
we've looked at generating probably the
most used elements there is so much more
that you can do with Emmet
so I highly suggest you go and check it
out if you are a front-end developer
this is going to save you a lot of time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
