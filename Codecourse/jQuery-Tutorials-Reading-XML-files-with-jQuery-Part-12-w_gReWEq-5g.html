this video we are going to be reading
XML files using jQuery a JavaScript
library I'm going to choose an XML file
we're going to go ahead and put it into
a local file and start reading through
this data we're going to look at reading
attributes as well so we're going to be
adding some attributes to some of the
nodes that we've got here and just
overall we're going to take a look at
you know the different ways that we can
read XML files and how we sort of
Traverse down and and read different
nodes values so the first thing to do
really is look at how we're organizing
our file structure now this isn't going
to be a complicated tutorial so really
we're only working with a few files so
the directory structure looks a lot like
this we've got an index file which is
the file that we're going to be using to
display the output from the XML I've
created an XML folder which is going to
hold an XML feed obviously the path to
the XML will be different maybe
different in your case and we've got a s
folder which contains just out just a
primary stylesheet and we're going to
link into our index file here so this is
the XML file that we're going to be
reading and this comes from the Twitter
API you can see I've got user timeline
there's also a JSON feed available oops
so that will you know be the case if
you're reading JSON but in this case
we're reading oh sorry it will be here
so don't chase 'em like that but in this
case you would change this to XML if you
are having trouble finding that feed but
obviously you might be working with your
own feed and in that case you can follow
along in that case there's also a count
attribute at the counter parameter at
the end and I've just changed this to
three so we've got three statuses here
from this Twitter API account but we can
go and go ahead and change that to the
PHP academy' Twitter account so what i'm
going to do is i'm going to view the
page source on here so i've got the
absolute XML document here I'm going to
go ahead and close this I'm going to
open up my timeline XML feed file and
paste this in so essentially what I've
just done is stolen an XML feed so I can
start working on this so I've saved that
there
I can go ahead and start working on my
other files now now inside index dot
HTML I've already laid out a document
markup we've got a simple title we're
including jQuery which is extremely
important so go ahead and add this line
to include jQuery to your page if you
haven't already and also then I'm
including my primary j/s javascript file
so all of the logic for this and all of
the reading is going to go ahead in this
file to read from this file and then it
will be displayed here so in terms of
markup we need somewhere to store this
so let's go ahead and create a div and
I'm going to give this a class of
timeline now inside here I'm going to
create an empty unordered list and
basically each of the timeline statuses
is going to go within a list item within
this unordered list so you know
depending on how you structure your
markup this is how I'm going to be doing
it and if the time if the fee isn't
available for some reason we're going to
you know just replace all of this with
an error message
so inside primary j/s now we need to go
ahead and use the Ajax method from
jQuery to go ahead and read this this
timeline file so let's go ahead and do
that now we use dot Ajax
so this is represented representing
jQuery and in here we pass different
settings based on what we want to read
and how we want to read them so in this
case we need to specify a URL which is
important this is in the XML folder and
we're reading timeline XML so that's
relatively straightforward the next one
is type and this is just how it's read
by the server now I'd tend to say get
here but in this case this is by default
so we don't need to include this we also
need a data type well we don't need a
data type but we're going to say to this
method that this data is going to be an
XML format now we also have functions
that perform based on the success or
fail or error now we're just gonna be
using successful area there's a variety
of others but in this case we're going
to say success and then in this function
we're going to run code when this has
been successfully read and we're also
going to have one for error
now we'll do that every one first and
then will cause an error to see what
happens so here I'm going to use a
selector to select timeline and I'm
going to say dot text and I'm just going
to insert plain text so I'll say failed
to get feed now let's take a look at
what happens now in our browser so let
me go ahead and open up my browser and
here if I hit enter nothing happens so
we can assume that this has worked now
what happens if we change this to
perhaps add an extra L on the end maybe
we've misspelled to it maybe the fast
not available or the structure of the
file isn't something that this method
can read then we get this failed to get
feed error here which is good because
for debugging this really helps we can
also do things like console dot log to
log to the the chrome console of the
console
okay so success what we want to do now
this is the actual part where we're
looking at actually reading the data now
we need this parameter in here data
which is going to represent the data
that comes back from this URL so in this
case I'm just going to go ahead and say
consult log data so let's go ahead and
take a look at this you can see I've got
my web developer tools open here I did
that just by inspecting element anywhere
on the page or you can also get it from
the menu so in this case what's going to
happen is in console you can now see
that we've got this document hash here
and basically it's just pulling in the
XML file in the console so we can see
what we're working with so if you're
unsure what anything contains or how you
can start to read anything if you do a
consult log on something it wouldn't
interpret it and give it to you how you
can sort of interpret it yourself so in
this case what we can now do is start to
find what we need and loop through it
now if we look at our XML file we've got
this status node here which contains a
lot of data and then we've got another
one here which again contains a lot of
data so for every status it's the actual
status so we've got text here which
contains a basically a tweet so a status
update so what we're going to do now is
we're going to loop through each of
these status nodes within this overall
status
note so let's go ahead and do that so we
need to use a jQuery each method but
what we're going to be performing that
on is data but the first thing we want
to do is find each of the statuses so
I'm going to say find status status says
status dot each then in here a function
so let me just explain this a bit we are
looking for the status node within
statuses which we've just looked at and
for each one we're going to run this
function here so for example if we were
to alert one for each one you'd probably
guess that that would alert one two and
three so we've got three statuses but in
here we don't want to do that because
that's annoying we want to actually grab
this data so what we're going to do is
we're going to set a few variables that
are going to be accessible within this
function and then we're going to append
them to that ul within our time line
class or time line div so the first one
is status and what we're going to do is
we're going to say this which references
the current status that we have found
and we're going to find something and
what we're finding is text and then
we're grabbing the text from that so let
me just explain this a little bit if we
go over to our XML file we're finding
text within status so that makes sense
status and then his text so if finding
text within status and then we're
grabbing the text from it so now what we
can do is start to apply this to our
page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
