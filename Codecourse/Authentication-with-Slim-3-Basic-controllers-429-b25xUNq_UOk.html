roots but really this gives no structure
to our application so what we're going
to do is set up working with controllers
and this is pretty straightforward so I
guess the first thing to do is just
create the controller that we want to
work with and then we'll hook it up into
slim so over an R I'm going to create a
new folder called controllers and within
here we can create any of the
controllers that we need so let's create
a new file and go over and we'll just
call this home controller dot PHP this
will just be responsible for sharing our
home page now obviously this will need a
namespace so it's under App and
controllers and we just fix that
obviously this is going to be home
controller so now we can have something
like an index method and we want to be
able to accept in our requests and our
response so here let's just return home
controller so when we finally got this
setup will see this output okay so now
that we've done that let's just go and
get rid of our route here and instead
what we want to do is set up a binding
on our container to return this
controller and then we can attach this
to a root so this is really
straightforward we want to do is down
here on our container we want to say
well the home controller is going to
return a new app controllers home
controller instance perfect so we can
even bring in our container here if we
need it later now over in our routes all
we need to do is say app get and then
the name of the route and then in here
we say home controller a colon and the
name of the method and that is it
we now have controllers set
so hopefully if we go back over to our
browser we've not called it home now so
we can go back to our route we see home
controller perfect so this is all set up
and ready to go this is the basics of
working with controllers now that that's
all set up we want to look at a way that
we can start to use other container
items within our controller now at the
moment what we can do is we can say
let's far dump request and we can even
test this out by saying request get pram
nem for example now at the moment that
will be null but if we were to pass say
name equals Billy into here we get Billy
so that's how our request works it work
in exactly the same way and also the
same as the response as well but we want
to be able to access the views now what
we can't do is something like this view
which is our slim View package it
doesn't work we get a null back so we
need a way to access this from within
out controllers let's jump over and look
at a way that we can do this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
