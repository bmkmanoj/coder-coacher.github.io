we need to do is look at how the
database is going to be set up now this
is going to be pretty easy to be honest
we're only going to have a couple of
tables and the first table is going to
be where the users are stored so the
users of your application depending on
how you're signing them in so let's
create this table now so I'm just going
to call this users amusing sequel Pro to
manage my database but you can use PHP
myadmin or in the command line whatever
you prefer so we've got an ID here which
is a type of int it's a primary key and
it has an auto increment on it as well
so it will increment for each record
added and it's obviously an unsigned
integer we're also going to have a
username in here and that's it we're
just going to have this as a VAR char
and set this to maybe 20 characters
depending on how your application works
and I'm going to just insert one record
here that's going to be record one Alex
that's it so now that we've done that we
can create our items table so this is
going to contain all of the to-do list
items so we've got an ID with the same
properties as ur that's the one in the
users table it works the same we can
have name which is basically the name of
the item this is going to be text
because we're going to allow for quite
large items and we're gonna have a user
which is going to be an integer this is
just basically in the point that user
that's currently a little that's added
this item so we can identify which items
to pull in depending which users logged
in we have a done field and we have a
created field so users going to mean in
done is going to be a boolean which will
effectively result in a tiny int which
is with a length of 1 and created will
be a date/time now we'll be storing this
value but we won't actually be
outputting this value however you can do
what you want once you've grasped how
this works you can out you know give
furtive due dates or you know whatever
you want so what we're going to do
initially is we're going to add some
items in here and then we're going to
actually just output them into our
design our list of items just here so
let's do this now
at the moment we've got to test items so
let's just get rid of one of them so
we've got one here and we'll place this
in a loop so over in our database let's
create the first one and this will be
I'm going to go vegan it's hit okay the
user is going to be one done is going to
be zero and created in here I can just
type the now function and that just
gives me the date and time the next one
let's say turn off lights to save energy
and money and that's it okay and for the
user let's say one as well and done
let's just say one and again created
let's just put now so we've got two
items and we've got one user so these
two items belong to this user so what we
can now do is inside of our app let's go
ahead and connect to our database that's
probably the first thing we should
really do because otherwise we can't
access these records so I'm going to
create a folder called
app and in here I'm going to create a
file called in its dot PHP this is just
going to be everything that I need to
initialize my application start sessions
connect to my database and this can be
shared across all files so the first
thing is to say session start this just
allows us to store items or keys or
values inside of the session superglobal
so I want to say user ID and that's
going to be one so that's just faking a
login basically for user with a user ID
of one so here I'm going to create an a
new PDO instance I'm instantiating PDO
this is going to be connecting to our
database so this is PHP data objects
because we're going to be doing things
like prepared statements we need this
functionality available so we're
connecting using MySQL MySQL driver the
DB name is to do and our host here is
localhost or 127.0.0.1
word in my case both are just root so
down here you will want to handle this
in some other way but I'm just going to
create a quick if statement here to say
if not is set dollar underscore session
user ID that just basically means is
this user logged in so is this what or
is this value set I'm just going to say
died you you are not signed in this is
no way a foolproof solution
it's just demonstrating that this is if
this isn't available we can't store a
value inside of here with user because
it doesn't exist so we have to be signed
in to use this anyway we can include
this on index dot PHP up here so we can
make use of the fact that sessions of
started we can make use of database
functionality as well so let's do a
require once on app in it dot PHP and
down here let's create an item's query
to basically give us our items so the
items query is a prepared statement so
we use the prepare method on our DB
object and in here I'm just going to
pull this down to multiple lines we're
going to select the ID the name and done
so zero or one depending on the items
with the items done or not from the
items table where the user equals user
now this is a placeholder and what this
means is that what we do is to prevent
SQL injection we execute this passing in
the placeholders that will prepare or we
prepare the statement here then we
execute the statement and this just
basically means that we don't have to
escape each of these manually so I'm
just going to say items query executes
none that will run the query but we need
to pass in an array this is a user value
so we can say user dollar underscore
session user ID which is the session we
set in here
so what this will now do is give us a
list of items where the user equals the
current logged in user
so we're grabbing ID name and done okay
so now what we can do is we can say
items equals I'm going to turn or
operator here this will basically check
whether there's a sufficient row count
on items otherwise we'll just set this
to an empty array so essentially what
we're going to do is say items query row
count if this is a positive number then
we want to say items query otherwise we
won't say empty array so now what we can
actually do down here to test things out
is do a print our on items and we can
even do an echo and stick some pre tags
around this which will give us a better
representation of how this looks like so
so let's refresh there we go oops sorry
up this should be fine if we do a for
each loop on this which is what we're
going to be doing later so for example I
do a for each on items as item here what
I can do is echo item name and then I
can do a little break here just as an
example that will give me oh sorry this
will be an array there we go so that
will give us an array within these so
for each item this item is going to be
an array we can go print our on item to
see this like so so that will give us an
array here with an ID of one and then
we've got name go vegan blah blah blah
blah blah so obviously if there are no
items we're not going to create this
unordered list markup so I'm going to
create an if statement here to say if
not empty items then we can go ahead and
do this unordered list so we can NDF
here but you might want to do a little
bit of an else down here so you might
want to say else and then in here we can
just create a paragraph and say
something like
you haven't added any items yet so
that's going to look like the following
because we're remember this is static
we've not been actually outputting the
items from the database yet but if we
were to say change the user of both of
these records to two I'm logged in as
user one so it now says you haven't
added any items yet so let me go ahead
and just change these back to one like
so and back in here we're actually going
to loop through now so of the list item
we want to do a for each loop much like
I did just a moment ago up there when I
say for each items as item and down here
we want to end that for each so end for
each like so and we'll go ahead and end
this so this now we need to replace with
the actual item name so in here we can
do a PHP echo item name and let's take a
look at that there we go so we've got go
vegan and turn off lights to save energy
and money and then we need to work out
whether this is done and we need to work
that out for the reason of adding a
class in here and also whether we need
to display this or not so just in here
let's do an echo I'm going to say echo
we're going to do a ternary operator
here as well so I'm going to say item
done so if the item is done we want to
output a space and then done so after
item there will then be a space and then
the additional class of done otherwise
just an empty string so remember we've
got that one done but we don't want to
show this now that it's done so all we
need to do is down here do and if
another if statement so we can say if
item oops
done then down here
and that if and in actual fat we need to
negate this so if not item done then it
stays so here we've got markers done and
here we haven't because this has been
marked as done so now what you can do is
play around with this so we could set
this to one as well and you would see
that they both get checked off so
obviously at the moment we have to
manually do this but we will add a link
in when we do the marking functionality
so now that we've done this basically we
can start to actually add items so I can
type in here pick up shopping I can hit
add that's going to go through to add
dot PHP which we don't currently have
available so we're going to build that
now so let's create a new file and let's
save this as a dhp and in here this is
obviously a PHP file now we need to
bring in our initialization file because
this contains our database connection
and our session as well so we're going
to require once app in it double PHP
much like we did just a moment ago and
inside of here we need to basically
check if the name I this the name of the
item we're adding has been successfully
submitted through to this so is it
available in the post superglobal array
to look at in a moment then we'll store
it and then we'll prepare a statement to
insert it will execute that and then
we'll redirect the user back to
index.php and this will then give us the
ability to add as many items as we want
so you actually see this come to life
now so we do a quick if statement here
to check if that's available so we say
if is set dollar underscore post name if
it is available I want to store that in
a variable here so dot underscore post
name and what we can also do as well is
do a trim on this so we wrap this in our
trim function this will get rid of
whitespace on the left and the right
hand side so just in case someone does
something like a space bass bass bass
will get rid of all of that
okay so now we want to check if this
value is not empty now we're not
redirecting back with an error message
we're just doing this too so we don't
add an empty item to the database you
can of course add in some kind of
message if you want so we're going to
say if not empty name that just means
has something or is something contained
within that variable then we're going to
create an added query and this is going
to be DB prepare so much like we did to
actually grab our records this time
we're inserting it works exactly the
same thing with the prepare exactly the
same way with a prepared statement we do
insert into items we choose the field
that we want to insert on that's named
user done and created we don't need to
insert an ID that's automatically
incremented for us now we insert the
values so named user for done we're just
going to say 0 we don't even have to
include this to be honest we could just
get rid of that all together but let's
just do it for the sake of it being a
little bit clearer and then we have our
now function here which will populate
the date and time now created at a time
field so now that we've done that we
need to execute this query passing in
the placeholder values which is name and
user we know that the name exists here
we know that the user exists here so we
have these this sir available to us so
let's say added query execute and in
here we'll pass in in the own array
these values so name is just name and
user is just other underscore session
user ID and outside of this if statement
regardless of what's been done we're
going to use a header to locate back to
index dot PHP so there's probably better
way better ways of redirecting your
users in terms of maybe flashing a
message or something but because this is
very basic all we're doing is whatever
happens here regardless of any errors
within this query we're redirecting back
so now what we can actually do is as
long as everything's working okay we
could say something like pick up
shopping that values now going to be
submitted through to that and inserted
into the database with our user ID and
there we go it's added in so we've now
got pick up shopping added that's it
it's been added to our list so let's say
do something else and add that one there
we go they're just being added to our
list so to finish things off we need to
do out marking as done functionality so
we need to mark these as done we've
already got the functionality to display
that it's done so all we really need to
do now is have some way of clicking
markers done and actually and actually
marking this and all that involves
remember is changing this done we just
refresh here it's done here does it from
zero to one so let's create a new file
and this file is going to be called mark
PHP now bear in mind we need to take
some precaution here some security
proper precaution because technically
what I could do is if I know the wife I
could guess the ID of a user's to do I
could mark her there to do is done even
though it doesn't belong to me so we
need to take that into account so let's
require in at in it dot PHP and before
we go any further on this file let's
take a look at inside of here what the
actual link is going to look like so
when a user clicks markers done they
obviously want to go through to mark PHP
but we need to send some variables along
with this and we're going to do this in
the query string so what we're going to
do is I'm going to say as equals done
what this basically means is we now have
a variable if you like called as and its
values now set to done what we also want
to say is item equals and then the ID of
the item obviously this is dynamic it
depends on which item that we're
currently looking at so we're going to
create a opening and closing PHP tag
here and echo out item ID so now
basically what this looks like is if we
just refresh let's just
the page and head over to this so we can
now see this has an AZ of done and I'll
explain why we've done that in a moment
an item is three so this this item here
has the ID of three but if we go down to
the next one this has an idea four so
now that we have the IDS in there let's
quickly go and pick these up but as
basically means the action that you want
to do I'm not going to do this in this
video but say you want to mark this as
not done again so you want to change
that back from one to zero you can
implement this in the switch that we're
going to be creating in mark dot PHP so
I've just left it flexible for you to
modify if you need to sit inside of mark
PHP we need to check for two things this
time and they're not in the post
superglobal like we did when we added
because we're not submitting a form with
the method of post we're actually
including these in the query string so
we're going to use is set this time to
check dollar underscore get as and
dollar underscore get item so as is the
action associated with this let's just
store that in a variable there oops
like get as and here it's item and
that's dollar underscore get item let's
just pull these in a bit so they're
aligned so now we're going to do a
switch and the reason I'm doing a switch
is this makes it a little bit easier if
you want to add different actions so
undone or not on or delete or whatever
you want to do you can do this in here
so we're going to switch on as if as
equals done we want to do something in
here like so so what do we want to do if
we're marking it as done well we're
updating the value so we're going to say
done query and this is going to be a
prepared statement
and inside of here what do we want to do
we want to update items sets done equals
to one where the ID of the item equals
the item we're going to have a
placeholder for that now you could just
leave it as this but like I mentioned
you need to make sure it's the same user
marking their own item so we also want
to say and where the user equals a
particular user then we can pass in the
user session to validate that it is
actually then marking their own item is
done that's really really important so
now down here we can say done query
executes and in here execute in here we
can pass in that value so or the both of
these values so item is just going to be
item here and we're also going to pass
in the user which is again straight from
that session at the key user ID and then
again we're just going to be a little
bit lazy and we're just going to
redirect the user back to index dot PHP
whatever happens here so now let's just
recap because this might be a little bit
confusing let's just close these off so
when our user hits mark this is
dynamically adding in the ID so we can
identify which item that we want to mark
as a particular action in this case
we're marking is done so when we go over
to mark top PHP we detect that this is
as done so then we can mark it as done
if it was say undone or not done you
would add a case here for not done and
break that there and in here all you
would do is literally the same thing but
you would set done to zero so you can
actually implement this yourself if you
want to but we're not going to be doing
it see you could have a not done button
anyway that's then going to run that and
it's going to redirect us back to index
dot PHP so as long as everything's
working fine we can hit markers done and
that marks each of them items as done
and that is how we create
a very basic to-do list go ahead and try
and add a little bit more functionality
to this and see what you can do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
