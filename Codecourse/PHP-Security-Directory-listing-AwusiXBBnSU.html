relates directly to Apache web servers
if you're using nginx you can go ahead
and look this up but since Apache is so
popular
I'm gonna focus on creating an HT access
file to prevent viewing a directory on a
web server as you can see it right now
so you might not think this this is a
problem obviously if we have maybe all
PHP files stored no one can actually
access them but what you don't want is
people going through and seeing
everything within a particular directory
if you're working with a framework this
is a lot different because you'll have
your root pointing at say a public
directory which would then not allow
access to anything else because it's
outside of the of the scope of access of
your page however it's important to kind
of get these tips down just in case you
are setting up your own application
structure so let's get going then what
we're going to do is we're going to
disable the viewing of this kind of
directory listing and this is
particularly important let's say we have
an index file in here obviously now this
won't be a problem because what apache
will do is it will see that there's an
index dot PHP file in there and it will
serve that however if we have say other
directories within our server so for
example app then maybe we have a
database dot PHP file really really
whatever it doesn't really matter too
much then anyone can actually see the
directory listing of this so how do we
disable this well it's pretty simple
what we need to do is create an HT
access file now there are ways of
preventing this via patchy configuration
but if you're porting your project
around it's better to have an HT access
file in here which will actually prevent
this regardless of where you're
uploading your project to so this is
really simple it's a one-liner all we
need to do is say options
- indexes so what that's going to do
then is if we just delete this index dot
PHP file you'll see if we head back
the main directory we get a forbidden
here and if we open up our element
inspector and head over some network you
can see that we get when we refresh a
403 forbidden so this is forbidding us
to view this directory
but does this recur stew other
directories in our website well let's
take a look if we go over to app you can
see that we are now also forbidden from
viewing any sub folders and just for
good measure let's go ahead and create a
new fold it inside of an app that's call
it config and let's see if we can access
that as well so we go over to config and
you can see that we can't do that either
so that's a really quick tip then just
for Apache web servers where we want to
disable the directory list view of any
of our directories</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
