class and changing some of the variables
so what I did was I came up with a
different method to make seeding much
simpler so I'm going to create a new
file inside of our seeds directory and
I'm going to call this cedar and this is
going to be an abstract class and
actually we need to rename this to
something else because then the because
the name cedar is actually reserved so
I'm going to set this to I will set this
to Acme cedar so abstract class Acme
cedar and this is going to extend the
illuminate cedar and this is going to
have one method public function run and
we need to make a couple of checks in
here so the first thing that we want to
do is check that in our in our sub class
we defined a table so we're going to say
if not is set this table and then we're
going to throw a new exception no table
specified and you probably want to add
your own custom exception Airport for
now this will work we're also going to
check if the data has been set otherwise
we're going to throw another exception
no data specified and if that all worked
perfectly we're going to say DB table
this table truncate and then we're going
to say DB table this table insert this
data so very simple I'm then going to
add a new file and I'm going to call
this user table sida plus user table see
the extends Acme cedar and we need to
have our table and data property that we
specified here so protect the table and
that is going to be users add them need
protected data
and that's going to be an array a
multi-dimensional already I should have
I should have said that so we're going
to set name - max email - max at
example.com and password - hash make
password and we could have as many users
as we like down here so I'm going to run
PHP artisan DB seed and very quickly I
just remembered that we need to add this
here so PHP ax and DB seed hit enter and
we get an error in user table cedar so
let's have a look okay so this shouldn't
be here we can't call a method inside of
the property try again and there we go
we see did use the table cedar so let's
have a look in that database hit refresh
and there is our user now there's a good
example of a problem that you might face
when using this method so instead of
using a property I'm going to say
protected function now it should be
public so public function get data and
I'm going to return an array inside of
here and it should copy that or is it so
public function get data and we're going
to return an array again and this time
we are able to call hash make so we need
to make some adjustment adjustments
inside of here we're going to say if a
method exists this and our method name
is get data
and then we throw an exception say no
data specified that's fine we need to
replace this with this get data okay so
let's try one more time we've got a
syntax error let's have a look okay yep
whoops so let's fix that and try one
more time oops semicolon and we get no
data specified oh it should be get class
try again and there we go hit refresh
and we get our hashed password</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
