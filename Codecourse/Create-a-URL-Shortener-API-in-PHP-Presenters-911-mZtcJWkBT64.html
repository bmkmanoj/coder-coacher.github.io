gonna introduce presenters into our API
which will allow us to present data out
in us a very consistent format and if we
want to update that across our entire
API if we had lots of other endpoints it
would be really easy to do wouldn't have
to come back here and say oh I want this
to be something else and I want this to
be something else or I want to add
something else here
so let's look at doing that now so
inside of shorty we're gonna create a
new folder called presenters and inside
of here I'm gonna create a new file and
I'm gonna call it base presenter that's
a PHP file and we're gonna namespace
this obviously under shorty presenters
make sense and we'll give this the class
name base presenter so any presenter
that we create are going to extend the
base presenter in case we need any
functionality in here that we might want
to expose to them subclasses but we're
going to include one method in there for
now so I'm creating a new file now and
this is going to be our error presenter
so it's gonna specifically deal with
outputting errors so let's create error
presenter dot PHP let's give this a name
space shorty presenters classes error
presenter and this is going to be
responsible like I said for outputting
errors so let's look at doing that just
now so the two errors that we've got
what do we actually have being returned
well we have an array in here which is
being json encoded so it can be output
here and shown properly in this case
it's not an error but you've proved it
to get rid of this we see an error a URL
is required so let's tackle this one
first and then we can just easily reuse
the functionality down here so inside of
our era of present then what kind of
thing that we want to do we want to be
able to pass in a code and a message and
we want that to spit out a nice
presented error for us so we need a
constructor here because we need to
create a new instance of this presenter
to be able to present to the user and
we're going to take a code and a message
so up here we have two properties code
and message and here we're just gonna
set this to there so message like so so
now we need to look at using the two
string magic method because essentially
all we want to do here is we want to say
app response write new error presenter
passing a code passing a message to
string basically will return a string
when you echo or output somehow your
object that you've already created so we
need to encode our output to a JSON
string so we need to add this
functionality to our base presenter and
then we need to extend our base
presenter from our error of presenter so
let's extend base presenter and inside
of base presenter let's create a new
encode output method so all this is
going to do is just return JSON encode
anything we pass into this might seem a
bit silly but if you ever needed to
update this it would be a lot easier
just to come and update this one method
rather than all of the presenters that
you're currently using so it might seem
a little bit silly to just do the same
thing here but it will make it easier in
future hopefully so inside about error
presenter then we have our two string
magic methods like I said when we output
this object that we're going to be
instantiation this error presenter class
this will just spit us out some text and
this text is going to be a JSON string
so we're going to return this in code
which is that method that we've just
created here and in here we're gonna
pass in the same thing that we passed in
here so this basically let's cut this
I'll copy this and paste it in just here
and that's what we need to do so the
error is going to be a specific code we
pass this in to this when we when we
eventually instantiate it so we just say
this code we did the same with the
message as well so we just say this
message like so that's it and that is
pretty much it we can now actually
update our file our generation file here
to actually use this so we get rid of
all this now
and all we need to do is say new error
presenter 1000 and then we can pass in a
URL is required and that's it I'm going
to pull this down on this line just for
clarity so it looks a little bit neater
so that is a massive improvement over
outputting all that rubbish now we have
this presenter to deal with that but we
need to import this as per anything else
so we need to say use shorty presenters
error presenter like so so let's check
if this works in exactly the same way
when I don't enter a URL and I hit that
we get exactly the same response back
it's just a lot easier now this is
easier to remember so all we need to do
here is go ahead and get rid of this
paste this in here change the error code
and say a valid URL is required and once
again if we were just typing a load of
rubbish in here we get the same output
so that's it for our error presenters we
now have this class that we can use
output wherever we want and it will give
us what we need if we need to change
this at all the structure of this we can
do simple so now we're going to move on
to our linked presenters so anything to
do with the links in our
ocation so we do exactly the same thing
we create a new presenter that's the
link presented PHP and again we
namespace this and shorty presenters we
call this link presenter we extend the
base presenter that we created and again
we have a constructor for when we
instantiate this all this is gonna pass
through though is a link object and we
can type type hint this using link and
we just need to say use shorty models
links the reason we do this is if we
don't have a link passed through to here
we know that it's not a suitable value
to pass into our constructor so this
will throw an error within PHP so we
need to do now say this link equals link
and create a protected property up here
and now we can do exactly the same thing
we can say public function and we can
use our to string magic method and we
really just do the same as we did with
the error error presenter here so we're
encoding the output which is that method
on our base presenter so we just say
this or return rather this code output
and then in here we just pass in what we
want so we can copy and paste this from
here which is just this we do need to
make quite a few changes to this so in
fact let's just grab this part of it so
yeah we do need to make quite a few
changes to this so payload URL is no
longer an option because we are not
passing the payload through to this so
we're just gonna have to settle for
outputting this link URL where the link
we pass through to here is going to be
this link here so we got all them we've
got all the information we need so
outputting the URL now we're outputting
this link code and we'll do the URL in
just a minute so I'm going to comment
that out for now we need to do something
slightly
here than saying that with his app isn't
available in this scope so let's take a
look at how this works so we go back to
generate we can get rid of all of that
we can use our link presenter and we can
say in here new link presenter passing
that link
so just to recap you if you're confused
we're creating a new link presenter
which remember when we echo it out
anywhere or output it anywhere we are
using the to string method to return a
string encode output is returning a
string as it's taking an array and it is
JSON encoding it which takes an array or
objects and outputs it to a string and
then we're grabbing because we passed in
the link we're grabbing the link URL and
the link code so we now should see if we
generate a genuine URL so let's say
Google comm I don't think we've got if I
just click that oh so we've got a syntax
error in generate on line 32 let's just
check this out Wow there we go so we
don't obviously need that trailing
semicolon and the reason this has
happened is because Google comm now
already exists because we just saw that
error so let's get rid of both of these
and let's just generate this again oh of
course
so we're this at this point we're
looking at if the link already does
exist so let me send that through once
more we get a server error so let's
check this out okay so must be okay so
this is an interesting error good for
debugging and learning about why this
has happened so argument 1 passed to
link presenters construct method must be
an instance of shorty presenters link
now that's wrong because we want it to
be an instance of shorty model's link
and all that means is that within the
link presenter I miss imported I didn't
import this link object properly I wrote
links which you probably noticed so if I
return that to link when I hit this it
should work so let's go back to JSON
text view and here we see the presenter
in action giving us that response back
but without the URL so let's deal with
the problem of the URL out because again
an app isn't in the scope of this class
so we need to do something slightly
differently and all we need to do here
is say slim get instance and then access
the config method all this will do is
will it will turn the current instance
of your application so we actually need
to go ahead and port slim now because
obviously this doesn't exist a number
under our presenters namespace so let's
say you slim slim and now we should
update this here to this link code so
remember we're just appending our base
URL and then a forward slash then the
code and this should work properly now
so let's click that again and there we
go so we get the URL back as expected so
all that's left to do now is just update
this response here by getting rid of all
of that to placated
code pasting that in there changing this
to new link and let's start all over
again why not so let's get rid of both
of these and let's go back to our API
our rest client
let's send through google comm it's
created a new record there it is
when we send this again we're returning
the same record so we're not creating a
duplicate and so on and so forth so we
can play around with this all day
so although we'd already created our
generate endpoint it's good to tidy
things up using things like presenters
so we can just easily reuse this
functionality elsewhere in our app or
just within the same file here you can
see it's tidied up a little bit more so
that's it we've managed to generate URLs
via an API endpoint using our rest
client to send that data through</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
