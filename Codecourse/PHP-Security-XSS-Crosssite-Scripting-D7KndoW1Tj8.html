attacks can actually be a massive
problem now at their worst
this will allow an attacker to forward a
user to another page effectively
stealing any kind of information about
their current session so for example
cookies as you may know using a cookie
you can authenticate a user you may have
a remember token which allows a user to
be remembered if anyone gets hold of
that value they're able to log in as
another user effectively now this could
be anything else in this case what we're
going to be doing is we're going to be
focusing on setting a cookie we're
actually going to demonstrate stealing a
cookie via an XSS attack now first of
all we need to understand what an XSS
attack is or rather how we can protect
against it before we actually
demonstrate this so what we're going to
be doing is inside of a database here I
have two users within a user's table and
these have just kind of normal fields
you'd expect so email password username
and what we're going to be doing is
we're going to be inserting manually
some data into this bio column now this
would normally be something like about
the user but what we'll be doing is
we're going to be pasting or putting
JavaScript within here and then we're
going to be seeing that run on the page
unless we protect against it so the
first thing then is to actually connect
to our database I have a PDO
instance here connected to the host that
I'm working with in the database name
and what we're going to be doing is
pulling a specific user through here and
displaying some information about them
so the way I want to do this then is
just simply saying username equals and
then the name of the user here something
that you normally have on some kind of
profile page so if we just check that
that value is set so user name now if
it's not set I just want to kill the
page so I'll check that for a false
value so now we're going to do a quick
query
to grab them these details so we're
going to select everything from the
users table by the username equals and
I'm using a prepared statement here and
I have a placeholder just in here and
I'm going to execute this and I'm going
to pass in that username this is to
prevent against SQL injection so there
we go
so now what we can do is we can grab
those user details so if we just do a
var dump on user you can see here that
we get all of the information here about
that user in the database so what we're
going to do now is close off our PHP tag
and I'm just going to create a basic
document layout give this a title and
inside of here we're going to have an h2
and we're going to echo out the user's
username now already this is not
preventing against an XSS attack so what
we're doing now is probably what you've
done before but is completely unsafe and
insecure so let's take a look at this
page preview it you can see here we've
got Alex and then the bio underneath if
it does exist let's just get rid of this
var dump as well so what I'm going to do
now is demonstrate how a user or an
attacker may be able to execute
JavaScript within your site so under the
bio obviously normally this would be
about me but what I'm going to do here
is I'm just pretending that I'm kind of
updating my profile via reform and
attacker word pop some JavaScript in
there so we're just alerting out the
number one and now because that's being
output to the page you can see that
we're actually getting that allure so
what we're doing here is we're executing
JavaScript or
this profile page when we're really not
supposed to do and you might be thinking
well how is this relevant why does it
matter if a little bit of JavaScript is
run on a page it can be inconvenient but
how is this a security risk what we're
now going to demonstrate is stealing a
cookie logging it to an attackers server
so to start out with in I'm actually
going to set a cookie just up here and
I'm going to create a new date time
objects I need this to generate a time
stamp and I'm going to go and set a
cookie I'm just going to call this
session I'm going to write ABC in here
but you'll imagine that this is some
kind of secure token that either
authenticate or relent agates a user we
just put the timestamp in there and for
the date time I'll just say well I want
to keep the user logged in for one week
so if you open your developer tools head
over to resources and cookies and
localhost if you are following along you
should now see this session in here with
this value this wouldn't only be visible
to the user who's actually visiting your
website this would be a hashed value or
a completely randomly generated value a
long value if it was generated securely
so we have this value we're going to
assume that ABC is a value that if
stolen by an attacker could be used to
authenticate a user so we don't want
this to be shared by anyone so how are
we going to do this with an XSS attack
via JavaScript well it's actually pretty
simple
I'm going to go ahead and just get rid
of this now because we don't need to
generate it again and we now have that
cookie persisting in there so I'm going
to pretend that in this folder I'm going
to call it attacker this is an attackers
server so just imagine that this is a
completely different domain completely
different machine and we're going to be
stealing the data from a user the visits
this profile page so say Dale comes
along visits Alex's page will see this
script and what will then happen is and
we're going to steal dows cook
so inside of an attacker I'm going to
create a new file and this is going to
be the file that will steal a cookie
remember this is going to be on a
completely different server this will be
on an attacker server so what we're
going to do then is inside of here we're
going to say cookie we're going to grab
that from the query string so cookie
we're going to say file put contents
we're going to put that into something
called log txt I'm going to place that
value in there and then what we're going
to do is we're going to redirect back to
the original site to make it look like
nothing ever happened
so I'm going to say location tutorials
security index dot PHP you can really
log in an attacker could put a user
anywhere Google whatever so how are we
actually going to do this then well this
is all written within JavaScript now
essentially what we need to do is we
need to use JavaScript to grab the
current cookie value within this browser
or all of the cookie values we then want
to send it along to that cookie dot PHP
file which is the attackers script and
then we can log that to a file which
we've done so all we need to do in here
is say document dot location equals and
this would be the domain of the attacker
so remember I am an attacker placing
this within my about Me section and then
forwarding anyone that sees this page
that's vulnerable to XSS over to my site
so this is in tutorials security
attacker and cookie PHP so let's just
see how this works first of all so when
I land now on this profile page you can
see that I'm actually taken over to that
page so the user that's vulnerable to
this attack viewing my profile will
sent over to this page so you can see
we've got an error here at the moment
because there are there's nothing in
here called cookie what we eventually
need to do is say cookie equals and then
the value of the cookie so how do we
grab this let's go back to our index
page and we will modify our bio again so
what we're going to do now then is we're
going to say cookie equals then we're
going to append on to this document dot
cookie because if we within our browser
say document cookie this will give us
the actual value of the cookie that no
one else is supposed to see so now
what's going to happen then is we are
going to go over to Alex's profile we're
now redirected to that page and
redirected immediately back and now if
we look inside of our text editor you
can see here that on the attackers
computer they've successfully captured
that session and what they could then do
is go ahead and copy this and then they
could essentially just authenticate as a
user so this is how we steal cookie data
so now that we know how to steal cookie
data we need to know how we can stop
script tags from executing so we now
need to come up with a way that we can
escape all of this data you might be
thinking well why can't I just basically
remove these script tags as they go into
my database table and that's absolutely
fine but it's always good to actually
escape everything to prevent XSS attacks
because really trying to sanitize the
data going in is a lot more difficult
than escaping it coming out so what
we're going to do then is inside of our
security folder I'm just going to create
a file called functions.php
and of course you can put this anywhere
in your application it doesn't really
matter so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a function either called
escape or e whichever you will remember
better
whichever you find easier to use
'is kind of like a general function name
for escaping but of course you can call
it whatever you want and into this we
want to pass a value to escape and we're
going to return that value but an
escaped version and we'll look at how we
can properly do this in a moment so over
on index dot PHP then what I need to do
now is wrap any data I want to output
within this 'if unction and it's pretty
clean because it's just called e we
already know what it is and it doesn't
really look too much different to what
we were doing before
so we obviously need to just temporarily
pull this in so I'm just going to
require in functions.php and at the
moment this isn't doing anything so it's
going to do exactly the same thing when
we head over to this profile again we're
just logging that log dot txt file so
it's not making any effect just yet so
let's update this then and we're going
to use a function called HTML special
chars or characters now what this will
do is it will convert any special
characters and these special characters
are things like quotes double and single
quotes depending on the level that we
set and anything that could potentially
be a problem so there's a couple of
additional options that we want to pass
into this usually what people will do is
just provide a value and that's not as
good so if we head back at our index
page when you do define your document
markup you can see that we're using
character encoding utf-8 now as long as
we have that set on our page what we
want to do is also include that within
this function so before we do that we
are going to make sure we are escaping
single and double quotes there are tons
of different options that you can use
for this and tweak around depending on
your needs but in quotes is usually a
safer option so we're going to go for
that and then we're going to define the
character encoding so in this case it's
utf-8 like so so we
now protected against XSS because we're
using this e
function we are converting characters
into their HTML entities we'll look at
that what what that means exactly in
just a moment so now when I hit that
page you can actually see that rather
than running this script it's just
showing it on the page and there's
absolutely nothing wrong with this at
all
this will never be run and if we view
the page source of this page you can see
why so ampersand LT and then a semicolon
and ampersand GT and the semicolon is a
less than of greater than HTML entity
and what that means is these characters
heal this entity here won't be
interpreted by the browser as a less
than or greater than sign it will be
interpreted as a literal character that
we want to display and that means that
we're not actually running this script
we're just showing the contents of it so
here we can see we now have no threat
against XSS attack because we're
actually escaping them values and that
is pretty much it there are probably a
few other things that you could read
about this HTML special chars function
there's also an HTML entities function
which is similar but go ahead and look
these up in the PHP manual there's
plenty of information about them as well
as the different levels of escaping that
you can do but generally just using this
method you should have enough protection
against XSS attacks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
