we're going to be creating a cookie
banner that's going to help help us
comply with the EU cookie laws basically
by displaying a drop down from the top
of the screen it's going to slide down
we're going to use jQuery to do that and
we're obviously going to style it up as
well to look like it looks at the moment
so I'm not going to the EU cookie law
and tell you what it is and exactly how
you must comply because I don't really
understand myself I don't think anyone
does it's very vague but we're going to
look at the technical side of this so if
you want to go and so read the the
cookie lot of stuff and buy yourself to
death absolutely cool but by all means
everything I'm writing everything I'm
doing doesn't mean you're going to
comply so that's your responsibility
we're looking at this from a styling so
CSS HTML Javascript point of view so
with that out of the way this is what it
does when we refresh the page we have
this lovely drop-down come in we've got
website content on the page I've put
this as a fixed width container so it's
going to it's going to essentially show
over the top of your content just to be
a bit more prominent than if it was
elsewhere on the page and it's also
responsive so you can see that it
responds nicely and we sort of maintain
or or reduce the padding on the
right-hand side so we're using
percentage base width we've got this
nice button as well which we're going to
style up and obviously in the backend
we're looking at setting a cookie with
PHP so when I click okay continue the
cookie manner disappears and when i
refresh the page the cookie ban and
alone on no longer shows so we're
creating the functionality behind the
scenes as well ironically to set a
cookie to say that we've clicked ok on
the cookie banner and then we want to
continue so that's what we're going to
be doing let's go ahead and start coding
this up ok so were over to ow our basic
document markup I have I'm not gonna so
write this and in tutorials it's fairly
self-explanatory we've got a doctype
HTML head and body tags we've got a
paragraph in here we're including the
the Google hosted jQuery version which
is just here
and we are just pop back to the text
editor we're including a global
JavaScript file and a global CSS file
and that is here and here with nothing
in at the moment because obviously we're
going to be writing this up so let's
take a look what the page looks like
as it stands not you know not much to
see nothing really happens we just
literally have a paragraph on the page
so the first thing I'm going to do is
start with building the markup I always
like to start with building the markup
and then styling part in the browser
part in the CSS file so the first thing
is the overall cookie banner class which
is going to help us position this at the
top of the page give it that sort of
dark gray background so I'm just going
to call that cookie banner with a hyphen
in the middle so I'm now going to create
a container in the middle which is going
to help sort of send to the content and
we'll get the sort of responsive feel to
this so we'll create the container
within that also going to create a
paragraph with the text that we want to
display so I'm not going to bore you
with typing this out
I am literally just going to copy and
paste this from what I already have so
we'll pop that in there and what we do
have is we have cookies or we use
cookies on this website by using this
website we'll assume you can send to and
then a link to my cookie page which
doesn't exist and then the text inside
that anchor is the cookies we set so
that's the paragraph next thing down is
the actual button that we're going to
style up and make it look beautiful so
we'll go ahead and write the mark-up for
this it's basically not going to be a
pound sign it's going to be a query
string which we're going to pick up with
PHP and that's going to be just accept -
cookies and the text for that will just
be okay
con tin you and the class is going to be
button because we're going to create a
generic staff for sort of buttons on our
page so now that we've done that let's
go ahead and preview this now browser
hit refresh
lovely so you know doesn't look great
but we'll go ahead and start to sort of
star this up now a few tweaks before we
do that if we head over to our
label dot CSS far I'm going to set a
sort of font for the body and we're
going to star the anchor anchor elements
as well so the font I'm going to set at
0.75 m/s and that's going to be Arial
and the anchors I'm just going to set to
a color of slate gray it's quite a nice
color so here we have you know the Arial
Arial font changed and the color of the
links have changed so it already looks a
bit nicer so let me just add a full stop
because I've seen that that's annoyed me
cool so inside of global Jade global at
CSS we're not going to do too much at
the moment we're going to star within
the browser so let's inspect this
element I'm using chrome and then chrome
chrome dev tools being more than welcome
to something like Firebug if that's so
if you're more comfortable with that
so the cookie batter itself we want a
background of let's say three three
three I think it's nice
I'm going to have a position of fixed
now we now need to set the top and the
left zero to sort of push it up to the
top right hand corner top left hand
corner sorry it's a top zero and left
zero and then we're going to set the
width to 100% so that I literally feel
the the entire top half so sorry full
width top so it's not looking great at
the moment but let's paste these stars
into our stylesheet just so we don't
lose them so this is going to be dot
cookie - Lana
our stars will obviously go in there
just pop an indent in there so we also
want to style up the cookie banner
container now this one's this one's
interesting this is going to make it
make it responsive so if we click on the
container and well at the moment I guess
you could say it's responsive but this
is going to make it look nice and be
responsive so with the container we're
going to set the margin to zero Auto and
the reason we do that as soon as we
apply width that's going to send to the
a container if we apply a percentage
base width for example 70% and when we
saw open and close this that the
percentage obviously takes up the sort
of relative percentage of the the width
of the browser or the width of the page
so we'll also go ahead and apply color
to this we could star the paragraph with
the color technically but I'm just going
to be lazy and apply it to the entire
container so that I'm sort of an
off-white kind of color and I'm also
going to set the padding to 15 pixels
that gives us a padding on the top the
the left and all that all that kind of
jazz cool so let's get these styles into
our stylesheet and inside of container
and now we want to make our button look
nice and pretty but what we're going to
do is we're going to add this class up
here so we can reuse the button and
elsewhere where we can talk duplicate
the style or anything like that so with
regards to the button let's go ahead and
make this look nice so we've got the
class in here let's start off by giving
it a background and I'm going to go for
a sort of light gray color I'm also
going to change the color and remove the
underlying so we don't we don't really
want that so we'll give this a color of
like a dark like like the same color as
we gave the background so the design
nicely blends in and I'm going to set
the text decoration to none and that
will get rid of the underline now will
give us some padding so you might want
to play around with this but I always
start off with a five pixel and a 10
pixel I just find it gives a nice a nice
sort of nice sort of padding so that'll
be five pixels on the leper the top and
the bottom and ten on the left and the
right so the border radius just to make
it look a little more sort of friendly
wittle rounded out the edges a little
bit and I'm going to set the display to
inline-block another reason I'm setting
the display to inline block let me just
get rid of it and let's just pull this
in it's not going to work like that how
can I best show this if I was to have
this within the paragraph okay as we
come in things like this happen and we
don't want that so if we were to have
displayed
inline-block that sort of takes it away
from inline and gives it an inline block
star you might have problems with this
on ie but frankly who cares so let's put
that back outside and continue with our
styling so we want to display of inline
block and also going to give it a
boarder an overall board and then we're
going to restyle the bottom border so
I'm going to give it a border of sort of
a dark gray and then a border bottom of
the same color but two or three pixels
3-mile of nicer note 2 is fine so that's
given it sort of like a nice it's a flat
but 3d look I think so then let's go
ahead and copy these stars into our
stylesheet to paste that in there and
just indent that perfect so we now have
our out sort of drop-down styled so now
what we're going to do is we are going
to actually apply the jQuery to this in
our JavaScript file to actually make
this slide down so fairly
straightforward all we're going to do is
we're going to check if this cookie
banner element exists if the cookie
banner element exists we're going to
just literally slide it down we just
apply the slide down method the jQuery
method so in global j/s we have a quick
if statement and we say grab the
selector which will be dot cookie banner
so if that dot length which is a handy
way of just detecting does this element
exist in that case we want to say cookie
banner dot slide down and then we give
it a millisecond count which I'll just
do about 800 now this isn't actually
going to work and the reason being is
that what we need to do is initially
hide our cookie banner so we'll set a
display of none
we can't slide something down that all
is already there so now when i refresh
we get this slide down effect perfect
so looks good but okay continue doesn't
actually do anything it appends this
query string on to the URL but we're not
actually handling anything with PHP yet
so in the next part of the video we will
be actually doing
PHP side of stuff and and allowing this
cookie banner to be sort of gotten rid
of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
