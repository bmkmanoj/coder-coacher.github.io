template engine you are going to love
this next package so let's first install
it and then check out list else we
already know that we'll see some kind of
syntax highlighting here anyway so it's
just called twig so we're just go ahead
and install this and we're ready to go
so let's create a twig file we need to
name these with a twig extension so for
example index dot twig now in here we
can see we've got a nice little icon
here as well but the great thing about
this is not only do we see some kind of
highlighting so for example if we do
some sort of if statement here you can
see this nicely highlights like so but
this isn't the good thing about this
package the fact that we can actually do
tab completion on here so you can see
here that we've got a tab completion for
a PHP if statement however we have tab
completion for twig if statement now
this makes working with twig really nice
because writing things out like this can
get really tedious so for things like a
for loop this is perfect we just type
for hit tab on our keyboard and that
just completes this for us it works
really nicely so anything that you're
working with in twig just start typing
it hit tab and you are pretty much ready
to go so I really like this it really
speeds up my development and I
definitely recommend using it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
