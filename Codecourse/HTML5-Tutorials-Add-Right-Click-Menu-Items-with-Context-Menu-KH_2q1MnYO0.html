about expires and in this video we'll be
covering a little-known concept or
component of the html5 API index and
what we're going to be covering is
something called context menu you may
have seen this before something like
flush websites where if you right click
it comes up with a menu and you can
select different things and me using a
flash ActionScript you can right-click
them and have that menu have links to so
your your websites or something along
that effect or to hide it so it doesn't
say that it's a Flash Player that sort
of thing well html5 now has this
component built in but where you can
commonly just add elements or menu items
to the right add to menu which comes up
when you right-click so I'll just show
you quickly this is the menu but I mean
and if you hover over this you'll see
here we've got Twitter and other these
are to which I've added earlier and
we're going to show you now how to
create this okay so if we go over to our
HTML page you'll see we've got just a
very basic HTML page we've got the style
which is irrelevant we've got the head
tag and we've got a body tag inside the
body tag we've got a section tag inside
the section tag which is got a line of
code but line not line of code but a
line of content this content is relevant
it makes no difference what this content
is it could be an image it could be an
entire list item it could be anything
this work this method works on any tag
so it works on the body target works on
the section tag it works on a div tag
it'll work on a span tag you'll work on
any tag going so it'll be completely
worth definitely worth doing if this is
the sort thing that you're looking for
and well I'll show you a couple of uses
for it in a few minutes but first of all
let's get it started so the way we do
this is in your tag so you could do this
in a body tag section tag or anything
like typing context menu equals and then
the double quote sign and close the
double quotes and inside there we need
to put an ID of what our menu will be
referenced to and by doing this we will
be able to have multiple menus going on
at the same time
so I'm just going to call this menu and
in our head tag I'm going to do open the
menu and do type this is going to be
equal to context and then we've got to
slide the ID which it was menu and close
up tag and now if we add a menu item
topic one word menu item and we are at a
label to that the label is what will
show up on the actual page so when we've
out clicks we had to wear Twitter that
was the label so this one I'm just going
to do refresh and you can have it so it
does a certain thing when you click it
so that's by done by doing on click and
this will well it's going to be fresh so
it's going to be window dot location dot
reload I think that's right I'm Lobby
good a JavaScript but I believe that's
right if it's one then it's dependable
of a cult anyway and then we'll do it
another one just to show you what they
look like if we were to do multiple and
I'm not going to do an on click for this
one but what you could do is have it so
that you it reloads a different page so
it would load it and take you to say the
social network page where you are to
your profile or something like that and
what you'll notice here is that this one
because as much it hasn't got an on
click area and it means fate is still
clickable but nothing actually happens
when you do click it so if we go over to
Firefox and we click on the normal part
of page this is the body section which I
just clicked on then you'll notice that
it isn't there however if we click in
this part of the page it is here and if
we click on the social network nothing
happens if we click on refresh it
refreshes the page do you see a little
blip up here I'll do it again there you
go quickly reload the page the reason
why you don't take long to reload is
because just one line code on it one
line content rather
it definitely does work it refreshes the
page it does why should do and if we
click on the second one nothing happens
but sometimes you need a nested menu
there isn't actually an example of it
here but I'll show you an example
quickly and the way we can do that is
change this to just be a menu I'll clean
up long so it makes more grammatical
sense and then we'll do a more menu item
label and I'll do Facebook and I'll do
another one
Google+ and if we go back into Firefox
and reload you'll see here we get this
arrow and this will allow us to then
select this one of these two as far as
I'm aware there isn't a limit as to how
many nests you can do but I'd recommend
only doing maybe two maximum three so
this would be the second tier and the
third tier would be the one that comes
up over here the reason for that is but
people don't really like following long
trails and it can often be confusing so
try keep it to two or three tiers what I
would recommend I do recommend that you
do use it but don't use it for anything
which is necessary or if you do do it
for anything that is truly necessary and
make sure that you have a back-up plan
somewhere else on the page so that
people who use something like 5m
Internet Explorer or Google Chrome or
Safari actually have access to the
content which you make and that's all
