this URL shortner it's very very
straightforward we're just gonna be
creating a container a form within this
and just above that header so let's
first of all start with our doctype and
our HTML tags and the head of our page
and obviously our body so inside of the
head we're only going to do a few things
the first thing being setting the charr
set or the character encoding for the
page so we say meta charset utf-8 we're
also gonna give this a title and in this
case we'll just call this URL shortener
and we want to link in our style sheet
because we're gonna be styling at this
page so we all create a style sheet
reference here and this is going to go
to CSS slash global dot CSS i've
actually got this open in my text editor
here and you can see it in my directory
structure on the left I've got CSS and
global dot CSS so we want to wrap
everything that we want to display here
in a container so let's do this now just
in this so the container is going to
have a class of container and we're
going to have a header at the top which
is going to also have a class so we can
target this specifically we could target
each one's but we want to keep this
short to a class so shorten a URL we'll
enter in here and just down below here
we'll create a form so fairly
straightforward with a action and a
method let's close that off so the
action is going to go towards shorten
PHP shortened dot PHP so when we submit
our URL this will go to shorten dot PHP
in use all about back in functionality
the method for this is going to be post
and we need to input types in here we
need an input type of URL remember we're
browser support this this will then
validate on the front end to make sure
that this is a valid URL and the name of
this will give a URL as well we'll also
create a placeholder so if
again if browser support this it will
give a sort of signifier of what should
be entered here so we'll set entry URL
here and we'll also turn also complete
off just so we don't get annoying
suggestions for what we previously type
pop-up and we will also create a submit
button and the value for this can just
be shortened so over to our browser
let's refresh it's looking okay but we
can do better so let's start to bring
some styling into this inside of global
dot CSS we'll create a body selector
here and we want to basically just
within here create a font so I'm gonna
say 0.9 m/s Tahoma and we'll say with
the sans-serif fallback
so we'll star the title quickly because
all we're doing here is we're changing
the font weight to normal rather than
bold so that's the header that we
created up here and that will just go
you know to a normal font body so now
with the container now we want this to
be centered and we want all the contents
of this to be centered we're gonna use
the text align property for that now the
width this will be a hundred but we'll
then define a max width which we'll just
make sure that this is fluid but also
has a maximum width so it doesn't
actually reach out to a hundred percent
of the width of the container and will
as I mentioned use the text align
property to align everything Center and
in this case with the elements that
we're using within this container this
will just send to everything will also
then say margin:0 auto to make sure that
container whole container here sits in
the middle and there we are that's it
now the last thing we've got to do which
is again fairly straightforward it's
just style out form elements now I'm
gonna be targeting these by input we may
also want to just say input here with
the font change the font of the input
I'm just going to be targeting input and
obviously on a normal website your
target Lee specifically maybe with class
names within the form but in this case
I'm just going to give a generic star to
inputs so I'm gonna set the padding to
Tempe 10 pixels which will just pad this
out and it's a bit like that
and I will set the background color to
white I don't really need to do that to
be honest in fact yes I do because
that's going to style the submit button
as well which we want to look similar to
our invert so we'll set the background
color here to a white color so let's
take a look at what that's done there we
asked we've got this white background
there let's sort these borders out now
so we'll set the order of both of these
to one pixel solid and we'll choose a
light gray color for this I also want to
set the margin to zero just so these
sits close together as possible and
there we are so we've now got a
nice-looking form will target the input
type of URL in this case this is pretty
bad because this is then going to set
all inputs with the type of URL to width
300 pixels but go ahead and chop and
change these stars around so they suit
your entire application so that's pretty
much it for the styling we've got this
form which we're then going to go and
submit this URL to this shortened dot
PHP to actually shorten this and just up
here we're not going to do anything yet
but we are going to be outputting some
paragraph or a paragraph element just to
contain any errors and then finally the
generated URL</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
