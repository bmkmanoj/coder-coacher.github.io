looking at some really simple PHP
pagination nothing advanced just
something to get you started if you're
struggling to paginate records from your
database so let's take a really quick
look at how this works it's not very
complicated and then we'll move on to
coding this up so you can see on the
page we've got five records I happen to
be outputting the ID of each record
that's just helps us see if this is
working we'll do that along the process
you can take it out if you want and in
the query string we've got the page that
we're currently on and then we've got a
per page this is limited to 50 so if we
go anything over 50 we default 5 so you
can customize that how you want we've
also got the links down here that relate
to each of the pages and all we do is we
just click on them and we cycle through
the results until for example we get to
the last page and we've only got one
record so we've got 56 records in total
so if you've got data to work with go
ahead and use that if not generate some
fake records maybe using a library like
faker which is a great PHP library for
just generating fake data make sure you
have your database setup we will roughly
go through what the sort of database
structure that we're working with but
otherwise this is pretty much it so
let's go ahead and start coding this up
so we're starting with absolutely zero
code the only thing I have is my opening
PHP tag let's first of all look in the
database just to see what we're working
with
so here I have got 56 rows of data all
we have in the structure is an ID which
you'd expect for a table like articles
and a title which I've randomly
generated this data so that's all we're
working with the database name is
pagination and the table that we have
that data stored in is articles so the
first thing that we want to do is go
ahead and connect to our database so
we're going to be using PDO for this so
we're going to create a new PDO instance
and we're using MySQL as the driver we
need to choose the database name which
is pagination as we've just seen and we
need to choose the host that were
connecting to in my case it's just the
local server
and then we type in our username and
password as the second or third argument
and that gives us our database
connection so the first thing we're
going to focus on is the user input or
rather the input that's going to be in
the URL so remember we saw things like
page equals one page equals two page
equals one per page equals five so we've
got all of that we need to work out how
we grab this so the first thing is we're
going to create a variable called page
this is going to be a ternary operation
to determine what we need to set this
variable to that sounds more complicated
than it is
all we're going to do here is do an is
set check to see if that is set in the
get super global array which is
basically the query string of your of
the URL so if that is set we assign a
value to it and that value is going to
be the same thing here but what we're
going to do is we're going to cast this
to an integer the reason we do this is
because we only expect there to be a
number in there and when we start
putting this value into a database query
we want to make sure that it is just a
number any letters typed in there will
just be cast to a number whether that
makes sense or not now otherwise we want
the value to be 1 so if we just go back
and put an echo in front of this and we
just hit enter we get 1 out because
we've not entered anything in here
however if we do something like page
equals 2 we see that value so we've now
captured the actual page that we want to
be on so now let's take a look at our
per page so you can have a fixed per
page in which case you would just type
something like 5 or 10 15 whatever you
want but in my case I'm going to allow
this to be set in the URL so again we
need to check if this is available so
we're going to check and we're going to
call this / - page and if that is set we
want to go ahead and set that as we did
exactly before otherwise we want to set
this to a sensible number so maybe
something like 5 now what we also want
to do is we want to include a limit
to this we don't want this to go over a
certain amount if you leave this as it
is a user could technically just change
that in the URL and say well I want a
thousand per page that's going to bring
back a thousand results on the page and
that might not be desirable so what
we're going to do is we're going to say
here and a lot underscore yet per page
is less than or equal to fifty and you
can play around with this value
depending on what you want to be what
you want it to be set so now what's
going to happen if we go ahead and echo
this out and we add per page let's say
per page five we're getting five here if
we change that to four we get four etc
now if we change this to 50 that's fine
however if we change this to something
like a thousand it defaults back to five
you could even default it back to the
maximum amount if you wanted to is
entirely up to you so we're now set up
in terms of user input what we now need
to do well we need to construct our
query to pull the results in this is
really straightforward so let's go ahead
and add our query and here we're going
to assign this to a variable called
articles so we're going to use the
database connection that we created up
here and we're just going to we can
either prepare a statement or we can
just execute a raw query it doesn't
really matter because we're not passing
any placeholders into here I'm going to
prepare it in this case just in case you
need to add anything else into this and
then we can just execute it later and
you can pass in whatever you need so
we're going to select the ID and the
title you can obviously choose which
records you want a field you want to
select from and we're going to select
that from the articles table and we're
going to do a limit so I'm going to say
limit zero five now you might have seen
limit on its own before but limit zero
five or five ten whatever you want to do
basically means we want to start at this
value it's zero indexed which means that
zero will be the first record pull back
from here and five is the limit so this
is our limit and this is where we're
starting from these will need to be
dynamic so what
calculate them a little bit later so
we're going to go ahead and execute this
query if you are inserting anything else
into here so for example a where clause
you can go ahead and pass an array into
here with placeholders so for example
I'll give you a silly example where ID
equals 5 you could say what idea you
caused ID and then in here you'd go
ahead and just place an ID and give that
a number but we're not doing that
because we don't have any where Clause
we don't need to take that into account
but it's there just in case you do so
now let's go ahead and actually look at
the data that we get back so we're going
to say articles and we're going to pull
that articles result I'm going to fetch
all records and we want to fetch these
as an associative array so we're going
to say PDO fetch a sock or associative
so now let's do a quick var dump on
articles and we will see our articles so
this is our article list obviously at
the moment we're only showing five
records because what we've done is we've
started from 0 and we're only showing 5
if we bump that up to 20 we would see
more records come through again this
needs to be dynamic and this is where
our pagination is controlled from so now
that we've got our actual articles
through we want to go ahead and output
them but we're going to look at the sort
of dynamic nature of this in a bit so
let's close a PHP tag here and let's
create a basic document you don't really
need to create a doctype or anything if
you're playing around with this just go
ahead and output them as you wish
otherwise in the body of my document I'm
just going to go ahead and loop through
these articles I'm not checking if they
exist it's entirely up to you how you
handle this so I'm going to be using the
PHP shorthand syntax for this but if
you're using a templating language you
can obviously go ahead and do this so
I'm going to say for each articles as
article I'm going to end out for each
down here to end for each and what we
want to do here inside is maybe have
some kind of container for an article so
I'm going to have a div with a class of
article and then inside of here just in
paragraph this probably being a header
or something like that I want to echo
out the article name so I'm going to say
echo article and remember we bought this
back as an associative array so we use
our brackets to access the fields in
this case it's title so now we will see
the following so we've got five out but
they're still we'll get rid of that in a
minute but we've got the first five
records here so let's go ahead and
remove this echo and for the purposes of
the video I'm also going to echo out the
article ID so just so we can see the
positioning of where we're at so that
gives us the following so we know that
we've got one two five here when we do
say page one and page five we should see
these when we do page two we should see
six seven eight nine ten okay so let's
go ahead and reset this back to page one
and let's go ahead and up here work out
the positioning so the positioning is
basically the limit so we're going to
replace certain variables within this
limit within this query so we need to
work out the start position in fact
let's go ahead and do the per page first
because that's really straightforward
all we need to do is do the per page in
here and we can already see that coming
to play if we do per page 10 we get 10
records we do 20 we get 20 records so
that's already a little bit more dynamic
but let's set the start position so
start is going to be this thing here
where we want to start the record or
start the rows from so what we need to
do is work out where the page is greater
than 1 and the reason we want to do this
is because if page is 1 we want to start
at 0 we don't to start a certain record
we don't include that in our
calculations so if the page is greater
than 1 we want to do a little
calculation in here and that's page so
the current page that the user is trying
to access times per page - per page
otherwise we want this to be 0 so if the
page is less than 1 we want that to be 0
or if it is 1 rather
otherwise we want to do this small
calculation here let's take a look at
what we actually get back from that and
why that's important so when we have
page one and regardless of per page that
doesn't matter in this case we're only
looking at the start value page one we
always want this query to start from the
limit of zero so remember it's zero
indexed if we do page two now we see we
get five now what that's done is it's
taken the current page we're on we've
multiplied it by the per page and then
we've taken away the per page from that
there are obviously other ways you can
calculate this but for this case we'll
just try and be as explicit as possible
so now that we've got the start we can
go ahead and just put that in there now
remember this is cast to an integer and
this is cast to an integer so therefore
this is never really going to be
anything that's going to cause you any
harm
in this statement the same with the per
page value up there so these two are as
safe as possible within this query
there's not going to be any malicious
input get past this so now if we go back
to page 1 we get 1 2 3 4 5 on page 2 we
now get 6 7 8 9 10 and so on
so page 3 etc etc if I bumped that up to
10 and we go back to page 1 we get 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 same to that 11 up to 20
so this is now calculating the position
we need to start at is calculating the
limit and we're getting them results out
now the only thing we've not done is
actually grabbed or calculated how many
records there are and therefore worked
out how many pages we need to display
and then what we can do is output the
pagination so this isn't too complicated
but we do need to update our original
query there are different ways you can
actually grab the count of the records
the amount of records in the table but
I'm going to be using SQL calc found
rows this requires two queries so you
might want to do something like account
on on northfield if you want to there's
you know several different ways you can
do this
go ahead and do it this way so SQL calc
found rose we don't have a comma here we
just have a space and then these are the
fields that we want to select so this
hasn't changed anything at all it works
in exactly the same way but what we can
now do is we can query again and this
needs to come straight after this query
we can't do anything in between and we
can work out pages from this total so
let's say total equals DB query so we're
making a second query and this time
we're going to select found rows that's
going to give us the total amount of
rows and then we'll call it total so
we're naming it total so if we do a var
dump on total here in fact we'll do
total let's do a just a normal fetch and
let's have a look at this so here we've
got an array and we've got total here so
that's the total and it gives us 56 we
know that there are 56 records in this
table so now that we've got the total
well we need to sort of make this a
little bit tidier so I'm going to say
fetch and then grab that key so this if
I just echo it gives us 56 so we've now
got the total amount of records in the
table and we can work out how many pages
there are this is a really simple simple
calculation all it is is its total
divided by the per page now this isn't
going to look quite right at the moment
if we go ahead and refresh we see 5.6
which is really weird so let's say we
have yeah we've got 10 per page we know
that that's going to be 5 pages but then
plus a little bit more so we actually
need 6 pages because if we go to the
last page which will be 5 no sorry I'll
be 6 then we've got these sort of
hanging over so this actually needs to
be 6 pages so all we do is we say seal
which means sealing it's basically
rounding up and then we have sick
so we now know that we've got six pages
of records obviously if your data
changes so if you want to say five per
page we've now got 12 if you want to do
one per page we know that we've got 56
pages because that's now going to show
one per page so now we've got our page
count let's get rid of that echo and
down here let's create a little
pagination container and in here we're
going to loop through the pages again
I'm not doing any checking here so
you'll always see a default page one you
can go ahead and update this as you need
so I'm going to do a for loop here I'm
going to set X to one this is going to
be the current page of each loop while X
is less than or equal to the amount of
pages we increment X and let's go ahead
and end that for just there and inside
of here I'm just going to create an
anchor will not do the href for now but
we will output the page number so let's
echo X and that's it so now we have the
following so we've got 56 pages it's
pretty long but say we had 10 per page
we've got 6 pages and let's go back to
page 1 so what we now need to do is
allow user to click on this and actually
display what they want to see we also
need to take into account per page
because that needs to persist we don't
to click on page 2 and that reset back
to say 5 per page so inside of here then
what we want to do is our question mark
to start our query string and we want to
say page equals and we want to echo that
x value so now if we go here when we
click this we go through all of the
pages up to the last page but again like
I said we don't want to be resetting
this value so all we need to do here is
say and per page equals now where do we
get this per page value from well it's
already dynamically updated here in this
per page variable so we can just echo
per page and that will keep us
up-to-date
so let's go and hit enter just to
refresh page 1 / 10 / pages 10 click 2 3
4 5 &amp;amp; 6 and we're at the last page and
that's it the good thing about this is
that because if we sort of come out of
range so page 8 we're not actually
showing anything we're not showing any
data so you could you could show a
message there or whatever
we're not erroring here because we're
putting this directly into the query if
the query doesn't return any results we
just don't see any results so the last
thing I want to do is highlight which
number is currently selected so we're
currently on page 1 so I expect that to
be all old or have a different color
behind it so all we need to do is just
after the href ending value we want to
open and close PHP tag I'm going to do
an if statement in here and all this if
statement is going to do is going to
check if the current page which remember
we stored up here is equal to X so we
can use a triple equals here because
these should both be integers and if
that's the case then we can go ahead and
just echo out a class maybe of selected
like so so if we refresh and I just
inspect this page basically what we'll
see here is down here under our
pagination page one is selected when I
hit page two that changes to selected
here so obviously we don't want this we
want a class of selected or something
like that so we can target it with CSS
so all I'm going to do here then is I'm
basically going to create a class called
selected under this pagination element
and we can apply some styles to it so
let's create a really quick stylesheet
to do that so let's create a new style
sheet called app dot CSS or something
like that and let's go ahead and say
pagination a dot selected and we'll say
font-weight:bold or some kind of number
depending on the font that you're using
and now what we can do is
this in so it's in CSS called app dot
CSS so now whenever that's selected it's
going to take into account which one is
selected and you can see that's gone
slightly bold when we click it so a
couple of warnings about this we are now
done but you can see we're doing a lot
on this page to actually determine
things like positioning in the amount of
pages this could be structured a lot
better within your application so bear
in mind when you are following along
with this use it as a general guide of
how you go ahead and implement very
basic pagination it's not a good idea to
output it all on this page because it
does get very very messy I'm obviously
not using views we're just using this as
our view so that's how we do very basic
PHP pagination and how simple it
actually is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
