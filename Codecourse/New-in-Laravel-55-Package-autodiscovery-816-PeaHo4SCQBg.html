package auto-discovery and this will
allow us to really simply just pull a
dependency down we want to use with
composure and as long as it's configured
for package Auto discovery within
laravel our service providers and
facades will be automatically registered
so this isn't something that's just
going to happen package providers will
need to update their composure JSON file
and we'll take a look at the laravel
debug bar composer dot JSON file in just
a minute so let's go and just pull this
down and I'm working with now 55.5 at
the moment so what we're going to do is
pull this down wait for it to finish and
we literally do not need to do anything
else so once this has gone ahead and
installed there's nothing else to do
it's really as simple as that okay so
now that that's done of course normally
what we would have to do is come over to
config and app we'd have to scroll down
and add in the specific service provider
in here for this and if we wanted to
register the facade we could go ahead
and do that now now what's happened in
this case is this will have been
automatically enabled for us there's
literally nothing we need to do so this
is a very small change and of course
it's not that much trouble to go ahead
and pull in a service provider and put
in a facade but this of course really
helps just speed things up when you want
to very quickly put in a package perhaps
for prototyping so let's go and just
take a look at the composer of JSON file
for laravel debug bar so if we head into
the folder for this here and can you
compose a JSON file and we scroll down
to the extra section you can see that we
have a specific laravel section here
which describes where the providers are
and any aliases so this is essentially
just the same as pulling this over into
config and app but these will be
automatically registered for us now like
I said this is entirely dependent on
whether the package itself has this
configured so this won't be the case for
everything
you'll just need to check the specific
installation instructions for whichever
package you're pulling down now the
question is what happens if we don't
want this to happen what if we don't
want this service provider to be
automatically registered and in this
case for laravel debug bar
I never actually
register the facade for this so in this
case what I'd probably do is go ahead
and disable auto discovery and then I
would manually register the service
provider now to do this if we just come
over to our own composer JSON file we
need to create our own extra section
just in here so we can do that and we
can create a lower valve section much
like we saw over there and then we
create a don't discover section just
here and this will go ahead and list out
all of the packages that we don't want
to discover so in here we can go ahead
and add in the package name for larvae
debug class so let's come down and
quickly grab this full path to this
including the vendor name and if we come
over and remove this package and
reinstall it like so we won't see this
also discovered so let's come over give
that a refresh and of course it has gone
so of course now what we would need to
do is come over to configure nap
register the service provider as usual
and then we're good to go so you know
you have that control there if you need
it now the really good thing I think
about Auto discovery is if you've ever
run into the problem where you remove a
dependency and then things break because
of course you have the service provider
already registered then this can just be
a little bit quicker it's not say that
it's better but it just means that if
you go ahead and remove a package using
composer and you still have that service
provider or facade hanging around then
you won't see as many errors you won't
have to go back and fix stuff up again
this is purely preference and if you
didn't want to enable this you can go
ahead and remove it as we've already
discussed so there we go that is as
simple as it gets that's a packaged auto
discovery in laravel 5.5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
