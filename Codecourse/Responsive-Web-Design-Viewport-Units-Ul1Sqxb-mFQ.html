we're gonna be talking about viewport
units so if you know 100% short on
viewports and their behavior it may help
you to watch the video I made on that
topic before watching this one
so viewport units are a collection of
CSS units vwv hv min and v max that use
a percentage of the current viewport
size to as a unit of length for whatever
they're applied to so we use them just
like any other CSS unit so you're
familiar with pixels and percentages and
we use CSS units all in the same sort of
format so we have a value and then the
unit and the value and then the unit
value and then the unit so in the pixel
case obviously the value refers to the
amount of pixels in the percentage case
the value refers to a percentage of the
parent element and in viewport units it
refers to a percentage of the relevant
viewport dimension so in VW's case this
is viewport width so this here 50 V W
would stand for 50% of the viewport
width this is 50% of the viewport height
and V min is either V viewport width of
ubot hi whichever is smaller so this is
a hundred percent of either the viewport
height or the viewport width depending
which is smaller and this is the
opposite so 100 percent of the people
with or the viewport height whichever is
larger so hopefully that makes sense but
if not let's jump straight into an
example so this say we have this layout
and we have text here in these colored
blob blobs blocks and we want the blocks
to take up the entire height of the
screen taking up the entire width of the
screen is fairly easy because we can
just use the percentage unit we can say
width is 100% and that's fine but height
is poses a bit of an issue and we don't
really have a solution other than
JavaScript until now with viewport units
so let's have a look so this is that
page you just saw and we're linking in
the style dot CSS stylesheet
here's our div selector and you can see
at the moment as I said we have a width
of 100% but a fixed height of 300 pixels
but now we can just say 100 VH which is
a hundred percent of the viewport height
and save that and it really is as simple
as that so now these blocks as we scroll
down we can see that they fill up the
entire browser window so that's pretty
simple you do have to be careful with
this on mobile browsers because it can
be a bit quirky I'm sure you all know
that mobile browsers tend to have a sort
of toolbar at the top that slides in and
out as and when it's needed and this can
pose a bit of a problem for mobile
browsers because it sort of plays with
the viewport height and so the browser
doesn't really know what viewport height
to use and it can jump about a bit of a
bit or a little so yeah be careful about
that on some browsers it handles it fine
but it's something to be aware of
perhaps a more useful application for
viewport units is sizing text relative
to the viewport so down here we have
font size and as I said viewport units
are just like any other CSS units we can
so we can use them in here as well so
I'm going to use 2% excuse me of the
viewport width and let's have a look at
that and that was actually pretty much
the same as what I had before but now
you can see as I resize and refresh you
can see that the font resizes with that
very nice so obviously when you get down
to a smaller widths you're going to want
to choose choose a new size and then
maybe enforce that with a media query
but hopefully you can see the use of
this you can see here in chrome as I'm
resizing the font size is not being
we calculated automatically I'm having
to refresh if we go over to Chrome
Canary the sort of beta version of
Chrome we can see that this is not the
case
so it's sizing very nicely just with
just with the resizing of the window but
this is just to show that the support
for viewpoint units is not that great so
here's the can I use page you can see
there's a lot of red up at the top but
even down here there's quite a bit of
partial support and this is Oprah Mini
here doesn't support it at all okay so
that's that's I mean that's V H and V W
really there's not a whole lot more to
say so let's look at V min and B max so
as I said V min will take either VW or
v8 whichever is smaller and V Max does
the opposite takes whichever is larger
now where is this gonna be useful yeah
that's the thing is it's rarely useful
so here we have this example this is
really the best I can come up with I'm
sorry I can't think of anything else so
we have this square and say for some
reason that you wanted this square to
fit itself inside the browser window so
you want it to be as big as it can be
without overflowing at all so how can we
do that well at the moment we have a
fixed width of 300 pixels on both and
I've given it a background color and
source entity a bit so we can use V min
we can use a hundred V min in fact
and so this is a hundred percent of the
smallest side of the browser window so
now if we look at that that's gonna fit
nicely within our browser window and you
can see that that does work is it useful
I don't know I I can't really imagine
when it's gonna be useful but yeah V min
and V Max they exist so V Max obviously
would do a similar thing but it would
fill the page I can I can't really see
this being that useful but yeah go wow
let your imagination run free in the
field of wonder that is even V Max yeah
see where you can come up with and let
me know if you find anything really
useful to do with it
alright so that was a brief introduction
to viewport units there really isn't a
whole lot more to say I hope you find
them useful and can find use for them in
your designs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
