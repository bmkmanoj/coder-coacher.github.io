our users to have different permissions
and this is going to involve also
creating a route which is protected for
admins only now you can go ahead and
expand this later on to include
different permissions but all I'm going
to do for this video is have the ability
to toggle a user between admin and not
admin so the first thing that we should
probably do is focus on just the
database table that we're going to be
storing these permissions in we're going
to be creating a new table for this and
we're going to be creating a
relationship between our users table and
their users permissions table so before
we get started with this you're going to
want to remove all users from your
application and go ahead and create this
new table so the table name is users
underscore permissions and in here we
obvious going to have an ID it's an
integer unsigned primary key in Auto
increment we're going to have the user
ID that this is attached to that's an
integer as well we're going to have is
admin which is going to be a boolean and
essentially what this means is every
time you want to create a new permission
you just create something with is
underscore moderator that can underscore
host anything like that you'll just be
able to dynamically check this within
your application so for the dates then
because we're going to be using another
eloquent model we need to created that
date which is a timestamp and we also
need an update to that date which is a
timestamp so the user ID we don't want
to allow null and is admin we don't want
to allow null this is either going to be
a 0 or a 1 so we have our users
permissions table what we do need to do
now is establish a link between our user
model so if we just close all of this
off and open up our user model here we
want to establish a link between our
user model and now user permission model
now we don't have a user permission
model created at the moment so let's do
this
I'm going to create a new file just in
here this is going to be called user
permission
notice how I'm using a singular version
of each one so instead of users
permissions I'm using user permission
that's just a standard and in here we're
just going to create the model for this
so we're going to namespace it under
code course user I'm going to create the
class user permission I'm going to
extend eloquent now we need to copy this
namespace here because we're doing
exactly the same thing we're creating an
eloquent model and inside of here we
need to define the table name so much
like we did in the users table here we
had protected table equals users we do
the same thing in here this time it uses
underscore permissions and what we also
want to do is set what's fillable so
protected fillable and we have an array
of fillable fields in here or columns in
this case just is admin is going to be
fillable and we also want to define the
default values for when a user registers
now all this is is a static property
which allows us to say do we want a user
when they register to be an admin well
we can say no do we want them to have
permission to post a topic to a forum we
might create well we might say yes so in
this case we're just going to say public
static defaults and that's going to be
an array of all of the properties we
want to set so is admin is going to be
false that's the only one that we're
creating in this video but you can add
more here depending on the columns that
you have in your database so we have our
user permission model set up we now need
to relate our user model to our users
permissions model so to do this all we
need to do is create a relationship
between the two and this is all within
the Ravel's database component so this
is how this works it's nothing that
we've bit our selves so we're going to
have a function called permissions or
method called permissions and what we
going to do here is return the type of
relationship that this has
so a user has one set of permissions so
what we do is be returned this has one
and then we give the name of the model
that it has one of that this user has
one of so it has one set of permissions
it doesn't have multiple records to one
user it's just one row to one user so we
just give the full namespace to that
class so in here we write code course
user user permission and that is it we
need to I guess also tell which the
foreign key is so in this case it's user
ID so we have a user here the users ID
relates to this user ID and that's it so
we now have permissions so what we now
need to do is update our registration
root to be able to add a permissions
record when an account is created so
let's open up roots or register and down
here after we've created the user we
want to create a permissions record and
we want to fill it with the default
values so to do this what we do is we
say user permissions that's the method
we've just created we want to create a
record and in here we'd normally create
an array with something like is admin
blah blah blah but we're not going to do
that because remember we've conveniently
stored the defaults in this user
permission model so all we need to do
here is say user permission defaults and
because it's a static method we use the
scope resolution operator here or a
static property rather so user
permission is namespaced so we need to
up here say use code course user user
permission and that is it we've now
created a record when we register a user
that contains all of their permissions
so let's register a user and see what
happens
give a username our password is normal
and hit register okay so we've got an
error let's sit oh cool - undefined
method permission so let's just go ahead
and check this out
permissions that should be so let's
start again let's go ahead and delete
this record we'll go ahead and enter
this again we'll register and there we
go so we've been registered so we now
have that user record but we also have a
user permissions record here the user ID
is 24 that matches this user that's
automatically done for us because it's a
relationship so it will automatically
fill that field in for us and we have is
admin set to zero but we're not actually
using the permissions at all yet so what
we're going to do is we're going to
create a has permission method on our
user model which is going to be a
convenient way to check if a user has a
certain permission then what we're going
to do is add a filter and basically
disallow access to a certain route if a
user isn't an admin much like we did
with the authenticated and guest routes
filters so first thing to do then is to
add this has permission method on the
user model so what we do is we say has
permission and inside of this what we
want to do is take the name of the
permission we're checking against so
we're just going to say permission like
that and we're going to return this
permissions and we're going to access
the key permission so all this is doing
is if we say has permission and then we
pass in a string is admin it's going to
look under the users permissions records
in here and it's going to pull out that
permission key what it's going to do
then is it's going to return true or
false so we're going to cast this to a
boolean just to make sure
so that's how we check for permissions
what we can also do is add convenient
helper methods to be able to check
permissions so rather than saying user
has permission is admin every time we're
going to say is admin as a method and
we're going to return this has
permission is admin makes it a lot
easier so now all we need to do is check
if it if it to check for user is an
admin is say user is admin using this
method that will hit user permissions it
will check the users permissions it will
return true or false
cool so now what we're going to do then
is create a route for admins only so
let's open up our views and let's open
up our navigation so if a user is signed
in we're going to have a link here which
is going to be an admin area and here
let's define a URL for admin dot example
for a for an example so let's create the
routes for this so under routes we're
going to create a new folder called
admin I'm going to create a new file
called example dot PHP this can be you
can have many admin routes and you can
protect them all obviously we're not
protecting against them just yet so I'm
going to say app get Ford slash admin
for slash example all the usual stuff
use our app and here we're just going to
render a view but first let's give this
a name so it's admin dot example as we
go from the URL for let's just echo out
admin for now and we need to add this to
our routes file so let's do this now so
routes admin psalm pulled up PHP and now
we log in
let's just go ahead and activate our
account first of all there we go let's
login okay so now signed in we see this
admin area we can click through and see
admin but let's create a view for this
as well so under views create a new
folder called admin and we'll create a
new file called example dot PHP copy
over the base from home base start in
will just say admin example and admin
example and then under our root let's
render out to that view there we go so
easy as that we already know how to
create routes but we now have an admin
example area and the only problem is
that any user can access this route we
need to give the ability to check and to
do that we're going to have an admin
middleware filter so we're going to get
rid of this for now we'll create it
first and then we'll attach it so let's
open up filters and much like we did
with authenticated and guest we're going
to do the same thing but for checking if
your user is an admin so let's create
this down here we're going to say admin
equals a function and you want to use
app and in here we're going to return
function like we did before we're going
to use app within that and this is just
how we define middleware in this case
and what we do here is we're going to
check if not app or or not app off and
then we use that helper method that we
create a non user model is admin so if
the user is not signed in or they're not
an admin we're going to say app
redirect app URL for home so just to
recap we are we've created a some
middleware which can use as a filter we
are checking if the user is not signed
in or not an admin and if they're not
signed in all they're not an admin we're
redirecting them back to home so we have
this we can now apply it if we just
close off some of these examples to here
so admin like so and if I just check my
database table we're not an admin at the
moment so when I access this admin area
we just are returned home however if I
change this from 0 to 1
I can now access that admin area so last
of all what we're going to do is check
that this the user is an admin before we
display this link and then what we're
going to do is in the all users section
we're going to output here whether the
user is an admin or not so to get rid of
this link here it's extremely
straightforward we want to do is wrap
this link in an if statement here so
we're going to say if auth dot is admin
we're going to indent that and that is
it so we need to check if they are an
admin they are an admin at the moment
but if we turn this off then that link
goes so now for all users let's add a
signifier to say if the user is an admin
or not so under the views and user all
we are going to here check if the user
is an admin if user is admin so you can
see the convenience of using models we
can just define whatever we want and
reuse it all over the place it's much
easier than checking you know loads of
code in one place we're going to say
admin and brackets so now we can return
him refresh we know we're not an admin
but if we do make ourselves an admin and
refresh we see admin just next to that
username so that is how permissions work
if you want to create more permissions
all you need to do is update your table
so we for example can host topic that's
going to be a boolean again so you can
use this to output whether you can post
a topic so you could do that anywhere so
for example on your navigation well
we'll just do this down here as an
example we'll say if user has permission
can host topic and if user can post
topic and you can just write sort of
normal PHP code within your routes as
well to check this so you can see here
nothing appears when we change this to
can post topic one it's not it's auth
dot has permission let me see use a
compose topic when we turn that off we
see this and just so we are 100% clear
for example if you wanted to do this
within your routes
so we'll just do this in our admin
example route we could say if app or has
permission can post topic echo user can
post topic so we'll make sure when we're
in admin and we can post a topic we'll
go over to the admin area and use it
compose topics just being out there or
see you wouldn't want to do that you'd
want to do this in your view really but
you can execute a specific set of code
if the user can do something and there
we go
that is pretty much it we have created a
user permissions table where we can
define multiple permissions for now
we've just done is admin we've created a
filter for that so we can protect
against our admin route and you can do
that with any other admin routes as well
and that's pretty much it we can expand
on this and add more permissions if you
want if we want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
