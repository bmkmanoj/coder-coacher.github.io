which obviously are similar to get is
and the way that they set data and
getters get data but this is also
similar to creating dates because by
setting things we're setting dates on
our carbon object and you might be
thinking well why is this useful when
you can just do something like C equals
new carbon and then we can pass in a
date or we could just use the static now
method obviously without new why would
we need to use setters all setters allow
for a lot more flexibility and if you
find yourself needing to access these
properties and set specific year month
day hour minute seconds and so on then
you might find these helpful so it's
good to know that there exists anyway so
let's start by just creating a new
carbon object like so and then we're
going to use some of the setters to set
the year month day hour and so on so
let's do a quick VAR dump on see we
already know from a previous example
that this is going to give us the
current date and time so we know that
that's the case but what if we want to
go ahead and just modify save the year
while we can say see year equals and
then we can give a year so we could say
1989 for example and then when we do a
VAR dump on see again will notice that
instead of being 2015 this now sets to
1989 and we can do this for variety of
different properties or parts of the
date so we can set the month here as
well we can obviously go ahead and set
the day say 21 etc etc so this is just a
more flexible way of doing things and we
also have methods that allow us to do
this too if you want a little bit more
flexibility but you don't have to set
these properties individually so what we
can do is we can say see set date and
this gives us pretty much the same list
of arguments that we had when we did a
new carbon create from day or create
from time so for example set date we can
say
year-month-day or we can say something
like set time and then we can set this
to say twelve o'clock like so and that's
going to work in exactly the same way so
in this case what it's done is it's
created a carbon object with the date as
the current date and then we've just
over it at the time of course what you
can also do is you can say set date time
and then you can go ahead and pass in
the year the month the day and the time
as well that will go ahead and give you
the date and time that you've specified
so again this is similar to when we use
the static methods earlier or you know
it just gives us a lot more flexibility
in terms of doing this if you had for
example a object that may be extended
carbon you would then have access to
these properties which would just make
things a little bit more flexible so
that is a look at some of the setters
that we can use for carbon which gives
us just that little bit of extra
flexibility</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
