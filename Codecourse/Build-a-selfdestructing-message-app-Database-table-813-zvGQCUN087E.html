table you'll notice that i have my my
SQL client open here i'm using sequel
pro and i have a database already
created called destructive now remember
when we set up our configuration we
chose the DB name here we're not
actually connecting to mysql yet but
you'll need to make sure that these
match up so in my case its destructive
and i have that set there as well so we
need a table for our messages so let's
create a new table and i have an ID
field in here created for me already if
you don't it'll need to be an integer
the length doesn't matter you can reduce
this it will need to be unsigned the
primary key of this table and it will
also need to auto increment as well so
what feels to be need in here well we
need a hash which is going to be a
varchar and i'm going to set that to 255
in length and we need the actual message
which is going to be a text type so
that's all we're going to be storing we
don't need to store the user's email
address because we're actually just
sending them a link the hash will be
included in the link that sent to the
user that the message is intended for
and when they click on that we can come
back and look it up by the hash and then
after that we can just remove it from
our database table so that's the
database table very straightforward and
next we're going to look at setting up p
do with in slim so it can connect to our
database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
