ahead and create this CSS comment list
basically this is just going to be some
markup with an image and a couple of
pieces of text and we're gonna star this
to make it look like a user with an
image as posting a comment and this can
just be used you know on the front end
of however you're outputting comments on
the back end so this is what the list
looks like we've got one comment here
that you can see has been made to look
like it's almost like a reply so you
have the option of adding an additional
class on if you want to make it look
like a reply but apart from that all it
is is an image and two pieces of text
we're gonna look at sort of floating and
learn about how the floats we you know
we come across problems with floats here
and things like that and just making
sure that this works cross-browser so
this does work cross-browser the only
browser it's not going to be supported
to on its i7 it's just gonna look a
little bit funny on IE 7 and below but
we don't really mind so let's go ahead
and jump straight into the code for this
okay so we've started out the basic
document layout we've just got a head
body we were linking in the stylesheet
here
title things like that so let's just
take a look at the directory structure
very quickly we've got index.html which
were working on at the moment this is
just for example purposes but obviously
if you have a website that you want to
integrate this into you would just write
the mark-up wherever you needed this
comment list to display we've got a CSS
folder which just basically contains our
global dot CSS file which we also have
open and we've got an image folder as
well which just contains an example
avatar now in this case you would
probably dynamically pull avatars
locations from your database and then
hit your server to pull in the image but
in this case we're just using this image
as an example ok so what I'm gonna do
first is write the markup and then we'll
take a look at how we star the markup to
look exactly how we want so write
everything we need and then we'll look
at it without styling and see how that
see how that looks so the first thing we
need is a container to wrap all of our
comments in and this is just going to be
a div with a class of comments so within
this we're gonna have many different
moment and comment replies so they're
just gonna be obviously divs bar we're
gonna have a class of comment so in here
is going to be the image the the text
and things like that but we'll have
multiple instances of these comments so
let's go ahead and just focus on one for
now so what do we need well we need a
few elements the first one's the image
and that's just going to be container
with an image inside of it so let's go
ahead and do that now and preview it in
the browser so we create another div
element and this is going to be comment
image now you notice a prefixing pretty
much everything with common this just
keeps everything modular and says to us
well this style is associated with for
the comments on my site so it just keeps
everything you know wrap together we'll
be doing this for every element that we
create within our comments sort of
overall element if you like so within
this common image element we're going to
go ahead and just literally create a
comment and we'll give this a source and
an alt and I'm gonna say Alex's avatar
and for the image source we know that
we've got an image within this IMG
directory so IMG /a Vitara dot jpg okay
so looking at this in the browser then
it just looks like an image so it's not
very useful at the moment we want to
make this small and round and at the
moment it's very big and square so let's
focus on the actual body of the comment
we're gonna wrap everything here in a
container called comment body and the
reason we're gonna do this is because
we're gonna float these elements so
we're gonna float this one left and this
one left so they sit next to each other
as we saw in the preview at the start of
the video so the first thing is the
little comment at the top saying Alex
said two minutes ago or someone said X
minutes ago and then underneath that we
on the paragraph where the comments it's
so for the class at the top we'll call
this comment info and remember I said
I'm pre fixing everything with comments
so that doesn't
this isn't an exception so I'm gonna say
Alex said two minutes ago and then a
colon so under here we're not going to
create another div where we're gonna
keep things semantic and so that this is
a paragraph of text so let's take a look
all this looks like at the moment well
it just looks like an image as it did
before with this text just underneath it
pretty boring and straightforward but
it's good to see how the markup looks
before we actually go ahead and style it
so we need to go ahead and just generate
some text so I've come over to cupcake
hips um I'm gonna go ahead and just copy
this text it can be any any text you
like really and let's go ahead and just
paste that within that paragraph so when
i refresh now you can see that we've
just got text under here so this all
looks very boring what we now need to go
do is go ahead and star this so let's
head over to our global dot CSS
stylesheet which remember is already
linked in we're gonna go ahead and just
change the overall font of the page
first of all because it's as default on
my browser and operating system times
new roman' so the body we're just gonna
go ahead and set the font to under 1m or
something like that and we'll go ahead
and choose a more readable font so
trebuchet ms' and we'll put the full
back as a sans serif and it's refresh
and there we go that already looks a
little bit nicer so now what we'll go
ahead and do is look at styling the
actual comments container now we don't
really need to apply this star but I'm
gonna go ahead and use a class selector
select comments and I'm gonna go ahead
and set the width to 100% the reason
I've done this is just to remind us that
the overall container if we inspect this
is a hundred percent it by default is
its block level element so it will span
the entire width of its parent container
in this case the parent container is
body and basically the reason it's 100
percent is as I resize this I want this
to still look nice so we're gonna end up
floating this text up here with this
obviously a lot smaller but when I come
in I want everything to come in nicely
so basically just to remind us that this
is going to be responsive I want the
comments container to be width 100
percent and of course you could change
depending on your needs it could be 70
percent or 50 percent or whatever
so let's go ahead and just give a little
bit of padding to each of the comments
and so we basically using just comment
and let's go ahead and set a padding
here so we've got north east south and
west values what we're gonna do is we're
gonna set 10 pixels to each of these
except the south so the bottom is not
going to have 10 pixels now the reason
for this is if you go ahead and refresh
and just look at the padding here the
green that you can see around the
outside of that it represents the
padding Orange in chrome represents the
margins but we've not put this on the
bottom because if we think about it at
the top of each comment is 10 pixels so
as we duplicate these comments down
we're always then gonna have a 10 pixel
space between them so if we just go
ahead and duplicate this quickly to
explain this we go ahead and refresh you
can now see that between each comment is
that green space there so the green
space at the top will nicely spaced out
each other comments so we'll go ahead
and get rid of that comment just for now
ok so the next thing we want to do is go
ahead and look at floating these
elements in fact we'll go ahead and look
at reducing the size of this first
before we do that at the moment this is
looking a little bit too large so we'll
go ahead and focus on the element that
represents the image so we're going to
go ahead and say comment image and then
we're going to target the image within
that and we'll go ahead and set this to
a width of say 65 pixels so now that
we've done that we can refresh and we
can see it's starting to look a little
bit more sensible now what we want to do
though is in fact let's just reduce up
to 50 pixels we're going to go ahead and
apply a border radius to this and let's
go ahead and take a look what the border
radius property does if you're not
familiar with it if we set a border
radius radius of 10 pixels you can see
this just rounds off the corners with a
radius of 10 pixels what we want to do
is we want to match this with the width
that we've given the element in this
case 50 pixels and what that will do is
it will round the borders off so much
that Len
looking like a circle so this property
supported in all of the you know popular
browsers ie I think eight and below
won't support it so might maybe nine but
you'll find that you know bite as a sort
of fallback this will just go square
which isn't a bad thing at all so what
we want to do now is actually go ahead
and look at structuring this property so
we want to float this text here or this
element this comment body element up to
this so it's sitting next to it
basically now how do we do this well
let's go ahead and just set the comments
background to a light gray and this is
going to let us see what happens when we
start to float so you can see that we've
got this sort of full background here
everything looks fine now what happens
when we go ahead and start to flow
elements well let's go ahead and just
add a selector for comment image up here
and we'll go ahead and float this left
so that actually what we want to do I
suppose we can give this a width so
let's go ahead and give this a width of
I don't know sixty five pixels so if we
take a look at the common image element
you can see that the blue area area
represents how wide this image is and
you can see because it's a div element
which is a block level element it spans
the entire width of its parent container
but when we go ahead and refresh after
that change you can see that now we've
got a smaller blue container so our aim
now is to go ahead and float both of
these elements left so they sit next to
each other so let's go ahead and do that
we'll go ahead and create a multiple
selector source a comment image and
comment body and we'll go ahead and
float both of these left so it's just
comma separating our selectors so now
what's going to happened is nothing too
interesting
it still looks bad and it looks even
worse now cuz it looks like a container
has collapsed on us so we'll go ahead
and look at why this hasn't floated up
here yeah and then we'll go ahead and
look at why the containers
so the reason for this is the comment
body is still a hundred percent with
technically that's what we need to do it
go and do is give this a width itself so
if we come down here and say comment
body width of unknown eighty percent now
you'll notice more mixing percentages
and pixels for this and the reason for
that is when we pull the page inwards we
want the image to remain the same size
so we don't want the image to change
size so when we refresh here we can see
it's already starting to look like what
we saw at the start of the video in it
still looking sort of bad though because
of this container let's go ahead and
just pull this in and I'll show you what
I meant as you come in here you can see
that this 80% element is sort of coming
in it's going along with it and when we
come in here it pulls down but this is
remaining the same size and that's what
we want here you could of course have
this image within it a percentage level
but you know you can you can play around
with this and achieve the effect you
need but that's why we mix two different
types pixels and percentages so now what
we need to do is go ahead and address
this contain a collapsing problem the
reason that this has happened is because
we've got a container here so we've got
a comment here if we go ahead and just
duplicate this comment again you'll see
that we get more than one problem and
that is that we've got this now hanging
around up here so we're in a bit of a
mess here but if you take a look at each
of the comments you'll see that we've
got two small green elements just up
here now when I float an element left
inside of here and I float another
element left both elements are floated
left these two here and this causes the
pin The Container culture collapse
because we've not cleared the floats so
we're going to use a little little bit
of a hack on our comment to create a
pseudo element and this is an element
that doesn't technically exist on your
page but we're using CSS to create this
pseudo element and what we want to do is
we want to go ahead and give this an
empty contents so we're just providing
the content property in a space we want
to display this as
hable yep looks hacky and then we want
to clear both now clear can have clear
left or clear right or clear both so
we're gonna clear both and what that
will do is completely fix everything
and the reason this works is if we take
a look within common element and this
after you can see that where the little
yellow speech bubble is on the page
that's where that element is sitting and
what that means is it means that we
don't have to create another element
after each comment and specifically
clear floats that way we've done it in a
sort of hacky but way where we don't
need to provide lots of different mark
lots more markup to our page because it
things will start to get messy so that's
how we clear both of them it's starting
to look a little bit nicer so now let's
go ahead and just get rid of the
background on that and we'll now go
ahead and focus on some of the other
things so we want to make this bold we
also want to reduce the padding or the
margin between the two elements here so
let's go ahead and do that first if we
scroll down and scroll to comment body P
so we're targeting the P element or the
paragraph element within the comment
body and we're going to go ahead and set
the margin on the top because at the
moment I think it's set to about twenty
pixels we want to go ahead and change
this to ten so when we refresh that just
pulls up a little bit so it just packs
everything a little bit neatly a little
bit more neatly into each other so now
what we want to do is go ahead and set
the comment info which is remember the
element that contains the Alex said two
minutes ago and we want to go ahead and
set the weight of this font to bold now
yeah so when we refresh we now got bold
text you can do whatever you like with
this so that's all done it looks nice in
terms of how responsive it is it pulls
down here you could probably hide these
on mobile if you wanted or something
like that
I will not load them in at all but yeah
basically it's looking you know as good
as we can get at the moment so now let's
go ahead and just quickly focus on the
reply so if I wanted this comment here
for example to be able to reply I'm
going to add a new color
to this so when I do that nothing
happens but we'll go ahead and target
this comment reply and again with a
comment - prefix will target this
specifically to increase the margin on
the left hand side so let's go ahead and
over here to our CSS let's go ahead up
to comment and just below that will say
comment reply and we'll say margin left
now should we use a percentage of should
we use a fixed width here if we use a
fixed width so for example 50 pixels on
the desktop that looks good we've just
basically increased the margin on the
left hand side nothing you know hard or
clever about this but when we go ahead
and reduce down to a smaller viewport
you can see that this is sticking out
almost too much uh sort unnecessarily so
we can remedy this by using a percentage
so if we go over back out over to our
code and instead of 550 pixels we use 5%
what this will do is it will reduce that
in words however when we come out
that'll increase nicely along with it
and then when we're inside you know full
view it looks ok so you can obviously
play around with these values based on
you know how you want your comment
system to look but basically what we've
done here is we've built a front end
comment system with an image we've
looked at floating elements you know
tidying things up and we've also looked
at this comment reply hook or class that
we can just put on to any of the
elements to increase the margin on the
left so that's how we create a common
list with CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
