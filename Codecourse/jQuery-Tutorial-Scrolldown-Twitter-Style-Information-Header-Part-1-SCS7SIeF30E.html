thought it'd be pretty fun to create
something with jQuery since I get a lot
of jQuery requests and basically what
this is going to do is we're going to
have a simple button on a page and we're
going to click it and we'll have a
little scroll button a scroll header
come down and show us some information
about what we've done so you can find
this on the likes of Twitter and some
other websites now you can't you can use
it for other applications as well you
don't have to have the button on click
function you can also use it for when
your page loads or for form validation
when you type text so it's quite easy to
use in a variety of different
applications so this is how it works
you've seen this we've got a background
transparency so we can still see the the
background of the page while we're doing
it this is because I've used a
transparent PNG image a portable Network
graphic image I've just used an opacity
of 80 so if you want erm the background
the source code will be available anyway
on the PHP academy' forum so you'll be
able to access the code as well as the
image as well so let's get right on to
creating the code for this okay so the
first thing to probably do is to grab
the jQuery source code and save it as
jQuery is basically the reason the way
I've done this is I've gone to jQuery
comm I've clicked on the download and
this is the minimalized version of it
and I basically copied that and pasted
it into there so visit jQuery comm to
get the latest jQuery JavaScript library
okay so the next thing we're going to do
is we're going to set up our index dot
PHP I'm going to create the header
basically in the way that doesn't have
the functionality so we can see how it
works as we go and to do this I've got
an a CSS file called H scroll dot CSS
and we've also got H scroll to
JavaScript which is where all the
JavaScript code will go the jQuery code
in order for us to animate this so I'm
going to start by creating an a simple
HTML document
with the header and the body okay so I'm
gonna set my background color through
this way you can do it through CSS but
I'm doing this just for shorthand
someone I said two five five nine nine
BB and what this gives us if we just
come and preview it is a nice blue
background here so quite a calming blue
background okay so the next thing we
want to do is we want to create a div
called header and what I'm going to do
is I'm going to come down I'm going to
type div id equals header and then I'm
gonna end the div now we won't need to
put anything in here the reason why is
because jQuery will handle that for us
and it will put the information or the
data that we need in there the message
that we're going to display but we are
going to be using this space for testing
purposes now at the moment you can see I
will just I will type something a bit
more in a message if we come back to our
browser you can see that all we get at
the moment is this is a message so what
we want is we want a background on here
we want it to come right up to the edges
of the of the page and then eventually
we're gonna make it scroll so what we
need to do is we need to change our age
scroll dat CSS file that's blank at the
moment and but first of all I'm going to
include it and so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to say link href equals H
scroll dot CSS rel equals stylesheet and
type equals text forward slash CSS okay
so what that'll do is that'll include
our H scroll dot CSS and it will apply
the CSS to this document okay so we're
going to start by creating the header
div that we've just implemented in our
page
now the first thing we want to say is
display:none and the reason why is
because we want it well the we want this
eventually but we don't use it at the
moment we want to hire to the div so
it's only active when the button is
clicked so this will come a bit later
okay the first thing we want to do then
is position:absolute and we want the top
to be naught pixels we want the left
it's been not pixels and we want the
right to be nor pixels so if you go back
to our page we preview this you can see
this pic right into the upper hand
corner and also for the text was longer
and eventually we're gonna have our
background in there then it would hit
the other side with a zero margin so
these are the margin sizes that we're
using now I've got an image called
transparent C or transparent and that's
just checking transparent PMG obviously
you're not gonna be able to see it but
it is in here and it's basically just
I've created in Photoshop
it's a white square 20 by 20 pixels and
it has the opacity of 80 so it's saving
as a PNG so we get that transparency and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to set
that as the background image
background-image:url and then we're
gonna say trans parent dot PNG and
you'll see that what happens is when we
refresh this we have the transparent
background so anything under this if
it's maybe a background image or
anything will still display but you'll
only have a 20% opacity because we've
used an 80 percent opacity for this okay
so the next thing we want to do is set
the height for it so we want a nice
height and I've chosen 40 pixels we also
want the border set to naught and this
will be a border all the way around of
zeros to be done on a border you know on
our on this div so let's refresh that
and you can see that some made it a bit
a bit more a bit bigger sorry okay now
we want to extend to this text and we
want to what we want to horizontally
aligner and we want to vertically align
it so it's around here and the way we do
this is we're gonna create another div
and this is going to be called text now
because we've set the height to 40 I'm
going to create the margin top to be 20
so it's half that size so we're
vertically and vertically aligning it
this way we also want to set the font
size and I've chosen 16 pixels we want
the font weight so the formatting of the
font to be bold the font family I've
chosen as Georgia
and the line height is 0px now the line
height is basically the height between
the start and the end of the line the
text that you've written so we want this
to zero because we want to position it
properly with the margin top considering
it's half the length of the or half the
height of the high roof set in the
header we also want text aligned to be
Center that's pretty easy so we can
align the text here Center but to
vertically align it we have to use the
margin top okay so let's check that out
see what's happened okay so obviously
nothing has happened because we haven't
included div text in here at all and so
what we're gonna do is we're going to
come back to our index page we're just
gonna put this text inside a div and
that's obviously idea text and we ended
it there so now when we preview it we
have our text in this Center we've
changed the format the size of it
everything and it's horizontally and
vertically aligned okay so this is over
well and good but we have an animated a
we have no trigger to animate this so
what I said before is we need the hidden
we need it to be hidden so I'm gonna say
display:none
and you're probably guessed this just
makes the whole lot of it disappear okay
so I'm going to leave it at that for the
first part the tutorial in the second
part of the tutorial we're gonna create
the H scroll doc GS bar jf sorry and
what this is going to do is it's going
to allow us to click a button or place
this function anywhere on our page and
the function inside here is gonna simply
pop me out and then give it a delay so a
delay of a certain amount of seconds and
this is all customizable from the
function so the parameters that we give
it are going to display the div but it's
also going to say how quick does it pop
out and the delay it takes before it
goes back in as well okay so that would
be in the second part of this tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
