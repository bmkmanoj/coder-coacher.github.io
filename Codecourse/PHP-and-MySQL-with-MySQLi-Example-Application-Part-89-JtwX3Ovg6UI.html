simple application of what we've already
looked at in this series and that is the
ability to display data from a database
and also allow us to insert records as
well so this functionality is going to
be all on one page you can already see
that we have the records that we have in
the database output here and we also
then have the ability to go in and add
more records so we can enter data here
obviously this doesn't look very nice
but you know it's a it's it's the
ability to to actually insert it that
we're interested in so I can go ahead
and insert new records here so by doing
this we're sort of getting used to the
fact that we can tie everything in that
we've already looked and actually apply
it to an application so what we're going
to do here is start from scratch build
up the mark-up here and give the ability
using what we've learnt to insert and
retrieve records from our database so
let's just go ahead a little peek at our
database here you can see that that
record has indeed been inserted and it's
a visible on the web page so let's go
ahead and and start writing the code for
this so the first thing that we can
actually focus on is outputting this
data into a table on our page so we're
going to build some markup and fetch the
results as we normally would and then
output them in this table at the bottom
of our page in our markup now you've
probably noticed that we have an extra
require here and this is inside the
functions folder and we're requiring
this security PHP file basically what
I've created here is a function that
escapes a string ready for output so
this is to prevent or help prevent XSS
attacks by basically data that looks
like this so if someone was to insert a
record in the database that was an
opening and closing script tag and an
alert that would then the output to our
page and then it would run as a
JavaScript snippet of code so we would
actually see an alert now what we want
to do with HTML entities is convert the
characters that we've just seen into
their entity equivalent we've provided
end quotes which will escape single and
double quotes and we've
I did character encoding of utf-8 which
is a security consideration when using
this function so that's what we've done
there let's go ahead and build the
markup for our page just roughly build
some markup we're not going to include
any style sheets or anything like that
because we don't want it to look very
nice
so I'm just building the HTML tags I'm
going to build a head tag here and a
body tag so inside the head I'm just
going to add a title and this is just
going to save people
so inside body now we want a header so
I'll just use an h3 element just so
people so here what we want is our table
so let's just construct the overall
markup of our table so no PHP code yet
you know we'll do that in a moment
so we have a tea head will open and
close that and we also have a tea body
and we'll open and close that if you not
work with markup too much before don't
worry this is basically just
constructing a table so you know give it
a go constructing this as best you can
and we then want table rows for the
header or one table row for the header
and we want table head elements inside
of here and these are just going to be
by default most browsers will star these
in bold so it's just basically the
header of the of the table nice semantic
markup so we want a first name we want a
last name we want a bio and we want the
date that the record was created so in
the tea body now let's go ahead and add
this markup so it's a TD this time not a
th so let's go ahead and just add some
dummy information just so we can see how
this works
so we'll say Alex Garrett developer and
we'll just say date there we don't
really need to construct a date for this
example so that's how our table will
look doesn't look very nice you know
this is this is default marker we're not
styling it at all we're not really
worried about that we're more focused on
the PHP side of things so we have our
table now that we can output data from
let's
and put an HR there now this space down
here is going to be reserved for our
input form but now what we want to do is
actually retrieve the results from our
database so we can output them if we
want what we're going to do is we're
going to work in a sort of logic at the
top view at the bottom kind of style so
we're going to create a an array called
records and that's going to be an empty
array and what this is going to do is
it's going to store the records that we
want to output below we're going to loop
through we're going to retrieve these as
an object store them in this records
array and then down here we can check if
if this records has any content and we
can loop around this area to generate
the records so it's a concept that
basically you're just collecting data
and then outputting it at the bottom of
the page so what do we want to do well
we're going to create an if statement
and assign a results variable inside of
this so different from records this is
going to be the result of our database
query now we're not binding anything
from here all we literally want to do is
we want to select everything from the
people table that's all we're doing so
now what we want to do is check if we
actually have any rows returned or not
so the row count basically and remember
that we have a property called num
underscore rows available to us from
this results object here the mysqli
results object so now we say if results
num underscore rose that's it so if
that's a positive number we can assume
that we have at least one row so now we
can loop through so we're going to say
while row equal so assigning this each
time so results fetch and remember we
said we want to fetch an object so now
what we're going to do is we're going to
say records remember that's this array
here and this is the notation to append
of a value to an array so append a row
or the value if you like to an array so
we're going to append a row for each one
so now what we're going to do is just
free up the results that we've we've
grabbed we don't need that in memory
anymore so let's free that up and we'll
go ahead and refresh just make sure we
don't have any errors and we don't
we've just got horizontal line there
that we create in the markup so how do
we know that records actually contains
data well let's go ahead and just print
this out just so we can sort of see what
we're dealing with it's always a good
idea to jump in and see what kind of
data we're dealing with so we'll do a
print our own records so let's refresh
and there we go we can see that we've
got three objects here the example that
we added this new record in here and the
two existing records so we now got this
that we can loop through an access by
object proper property notation
first-name lastname bio created an ID if
we need to so we don't need to print R
on this so let's get rid of this what we
do need to do however is down here we
need to figure out which part of this
markup we actually want to loop through
now the part of the markup we want to
loop through is the TR so what we want
is some PHP tags around here with an if
statement so if something I'll just put
one in there for now then we want to end
the and that there let's just indent
that so we can read it a little bit
better so what do we want to check well
we want to check if there has been a
count or the count returns a positive
number on the records array so count
records so we're counting this which
we're potentially storing data in we
don't have to be if there's no records
available then we won't have anything to
show so we want to say if count records
in fact what we could do is put this if
statement at the top of here I was
probably would make a bit more sense to
be honest so let's go ahead and do that
in that way if there are no records that
mark up for the table isn't actually
displayed at all so we'll say if and
then that if count records we can even
say if no count records otherwise so if
no count records echo no records
otherwise and we'll just end our if
statement
down here lovely and will indent our
table so if there are records we're
going to generate this markup and then
we want to loop through this pit here so
now we can actually create our loop down
here it's our for each loop so for each
records as and I'm just going to call it
bar just so it saves typing go ahead and
end that loop there and we'll indent
this now for each of the records that we
stored here we now have access to down
here so we can just replace this
basically so I'm just going to replace
this with echo our first name and I'm
going to do the same for each one but
more importantly remember our security
function our escape function takes a
string and converts HTML entities or
characters and that identity in quiver
'ln with single and double quote
protection and utf-8 encoding we need to
use this in here just in case any data
has any potential XSS XSS well content
that could cause an XSS attack so last
name copy and paste this again bio copy
and paste this again created so let's
take a look at what's actually happened
here
okay we have a syntax error so that's on
line 56 and ah there we are so we forgot
that curly brace there no problem at all
so when we refresh now we see that we
get all of these records output in the
table nicely brilliant we've done what
we've set out to do in the case of
outputting data now what we need to do
is build the form down here that's going
to allow us to actually insert a record
and we're going to be doing some binding
here as well now we're not going to be
doing any any validation is this you
know name bigger than X amount of
characters or going to do doing is
making sure this data is set make
sure is not empty the validation that
we're going to be doing here is probably
not recommended for large sets of data
because it will get quite messy it's
better to use some kind of validation
class or build your own validation class
or something like that
but for now this small amount of data
the fact that we're focusing on MySQL
doesn't matter so the method is going to
be post and the action is going to be
empty we're going to submit back to this
page what we're now going to do is
create three divs and we have these as a
class a field I'm just imagining that
these would be styled in a certain way
but for now we will just use these to
sort break things up so we have a label
for and this is going to be for first
name and this will be first name and
then we have an input field here so an
input type of text we have a name of
first-name that's how we're going to
reference it in PHP when it's available
in our post array and then we have an ID
so you can match this up to the label
that just means if you click the label
it will automatically highlight the
field for you so when I click this label
this is highlighted it's just a
usability thing and that's it really
that's all we need to do will also step
autocomplete 'off okay so let's
duplicate this three twice so this is
going to be last name this is going to
say last name this will be last name
this will of course as well be last name
and then just one more which is the bio
and this war versus a bio this isn't
going to be a input field it's going to
be a text area so nothing changes in PH
people are reading this way this is
going to be named bio ID bio and that's
it
so now that we've got all of our data
together we want to all our fields
together we want to create a button or a
submit button that's going to allow us
to actually submit this so we'll say
submit value insert so that's all we're
going to do and that's basically our
form there we can click insert
submit and we have access to the data in
PHP let's go all the way up and just up
here we're going to perform a couple of
checks just to see if this data is
available so the first one is if not
empty dollar underscore post so does
post have some data in it well if it
does that means we can then check your
first name last name and bio are set
using the is set construct so we can say
is set post first-name you'll notice a
lot of repetition here and that's why I
mentioned about using a validator class
or alternative way of validating if you
were to end up with say twenty fields
here you wouldn't want to do it this way
just a little word of warning so post
last name and dollar underscore post by
oats we're checking if our three fields
set if they are set we want to create a
variable for each one of them again you
can see how this will be tedious if you
had a lot of input data so that's going
to be first name and we also want to
trim that as well
just trim the left white based on the
left and right again we're not escaping
anything at this point there's no need
because we're going to be binding these
values this is going to be by oh let's
just line these ups it's easier to read
so last name and bio wonderful so now
what we want to do is go ahead and check
if they're empty
so promise you the one last check so not
empty first-name and if a user was to
type a load of spaces and it this is why
we use trim a load of spaces are not
empty because it does have content if we
trim a load of spaces that then will be
empty because we trim from the left and
right hand side which will eventually
meet and cause it to be an empty string
so if not empty last name
and last of all not empty bio great now
we can get down to actually working with
working with our database and binding
these values very straightforward we're
just going to prepare a statement buying
three parameters all of string type also
going to include the created value so
that will be a MySQL function will
execute the statement if this statement
has been executed successfully we're
going to redirect back to this page and
then we'll see the the record that's
been inserted so we'll create a variable
called insert so this will be DB prepare
remember we're preparing a statement
here and actually query the database at
the moment so we're going to insert into
people and we need to insert the first
name the last name the bio and the
Creator that date remember we don't need
to include the ID that's auto increment
so the values on this are going to be
question mark question mark question
mark and now so this question mark
refers to first-name this to lastname
this to bio and now to create it so we
need to now bind three values we don't
need to mine four values because we've
supplied at the now function return
value for created field
we just need to bind three values
because we have three question marks
here so all we do is we say insert bind
her Ram and in here we want to define
that we have three strings and then we
want a comma separated list of all of
the values that we want to bind here so
first name last name and bio if for
example buy overs an integer we would
change this to I because this represents
the first variable this the second and
this the third but they are in fact all
strings now we want a quick check just
to check if the statement was x-bow
we're executing and checking it was okay
at the same time so this will execute
the prepared statement with the bound
parameters and it will then determine in
this if statement whether it's
successful or not it was successful we
want to use the header phone
chin to point to a particular location
that will be indexed PHP and then we
just want to kill the script we can exit
the script and really matter so we're
actually now done what we can now do is
go and preview our page what's going to
happen on our pages the first thing
that's going to do is obviously
everything gets included we're checking
whether there have been results or
something submitted we'll explain that I
will explain over this in just a moment
but it's important that this falls below
this because will then do is it will
grab the results after this has been
inserted so we're inserting first then
grabbing results which will show the
newest result it doesn't really matter
in this case because we're refreshing
the page so this could be in fact above
this but yeah we're just we're just
redirecting so user can't keep hitting
f5 and inserting data again and again
and again so that what we're then doing
is running the mark-up checking the
count of the records if there are no
records we're outputting no records
otherwise we are creating a table here
with them looping through the records
that we retrieved up here that we stored
in this records array and then we're
just outputting the escaped data from
our database so I think the first thing
that we should do is go ahead and
truncate our database so if we go to
operations tab we can truncate the table
which basically means remove all data
from the table we hit enter and it says
hit no record so as expected we've got
that message back there I'm now going to
go ahead and just add a record
so what's going to happen here is when
we click insert let's just pop back to
the code to explain this again we this
is true because we have data in our post
array remember we defined that we wanted
to submit this data as a method of post
what we then do is check if each of
these are set so are they available in
this post array if they are let's assign
the values of these to these variables
trimming the whitespace from the left
and the right hand side within checking
if they're empty or not so has a value
being actually entered physically into
that field if it has we prepare a
statement with three parameters that we
need to bind and then we insert sorry we
brighten bind the parameters on this
insert variable we created we have three
strings first-name lastname and bio we
then execute it while checking that the
execution happened and worked correctly
then we redirect to index.php and if
whatever reason that fails we kill the
page we don't - we don't continue
running it so let's go ahead and click
insert and there we are we have our data
inserted so in this in this example
we've looked at retrieving data and
inserting data all on the same page to
actually create something that is that
could be classed as a usable application
and we've done that all using binding
selecting using objects because we're
working in object-oriented fashion with
MySQL I and without putting escape data
so let's just take a quick peek at the
fact that we have escape data and we'll
understand what that means
so I'm going to write Billy Garrett in
here and I'm going to write some some
JavaScript within script tags so let's
say alert
just say one for now so if I insert this
nothing happens we just see this code
here in the database it looks like this
so it's very much an escaped in the
database in terms of the the tags and
the markup but what HTML entities
function does is it converts that to it
this entity equivalent so if actually if
I put that back a moment and I go into
my source code you can see that this is
actually being converted into entities
and therefore it can't be interpreted by
the browser as JavaScript and therefore
we predict protect against an XSS attack
what happens if I don't escape the data
well you probably guessed when we go
ahead and refresh here we get this page
localhost says 1 the script at this
point stops executing when we hit OK and
we run the rest and we have an empty
space here where that JavaScript code is
so it's important to escape data it's
important to bind or not necessarily
bind values but escape data to prevent
against SQL injection on the way into
your database as well and but we've
encapsulated this in one useable page so
hopefully all of this code however
complicating it might look is actually
quite simple
hopefully it makes sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
