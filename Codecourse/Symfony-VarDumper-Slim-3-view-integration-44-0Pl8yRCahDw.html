integration and in terms of actually
integrating this into slim normally it
would work in exactly the same way so we
would be able to use the dump function
as normal anywhere we wanted whether
that's in our controllers within our
normal routes within our bootstrap file
it was just work in exactly the same way
what we're really concerned about is how
to do this for views and how to do this
for twig so going to be creating our own
extension for this and kind of fiddling
around with it so we can get this
beautiful output within our views which
of course is really helpful so let's
start by going ahead and just pulling
slim into this project I've kept
everything here with the set handler
because this is going to work in exactly
the same way we're not going to be
setting up a full slim project because
you know it's a little long to do that
in such a short series but let's wait
for this to finish we'll go ahead and
pull in create some routes create some
views and see how we get on okay so
that's finished the only other thing I
want to do is go ahead and pull in twig
view which you may have worked with
within slim before just allows us to
render views with twig so I'm going to
go ahead and pull this in as well and
what I'm also going to do is pull in
this container binding into my
application so I have this ready to
render views so let's go ahead and just
set our slim up up so I'm going to go
ahead and create a new slim app instance
just here and why don't we just turn to
bugging on this world just so we can see
if we get any problems here so let's
pass into here and override our default
config on our container under settings
let's say display error details and
let's set this to true so down here then
we're going to go ahead and run our app
and what I'm also going to do is go
ahead and grab out my container so we're
going to say app get container like so
we're going to paste that in that we
just pulled over from the slim
documentation and i'm just going to
change over to the the past my template
so in this case i would normally create
a templates directory or something like
resources and views just to keep things
simple let's go ahead and create a
templates directory and into here we'll
say something like home twig this is our
home view so you may have seen this
before we need
to update our path to our templates I'm
going to grab the current directory and
I'm going to go into templates and for
the purpose of this course I'm just
going to turn caching off so now that we
have this setup we can define out a very
basic root here and render that view so
let's go ahead and say get home page
let's pull in our request and our
response and we're going to be testing
out damper on our requests in our
response because these are quite complex
objects I'm going to go ahead and return
this view render passing through our
response choosing the view that we want
to render and that's pretty much it for
now so if we come over to our project
and give this a refresh sure enough we
see our home view so by default then if
we want to start debugging things within
slim view or twig in general we actually
have to turn debugging on so let's go
ahead and look at how this works so
let's say debug true this is just
something that's off by default which
kind of makes sense because we don't
always want this to be on now if we come
over to home and we go ahead and try and
dump something out maybe we want to pass
through the response objects into our
view and we can either do that by saying
response here passing through that
response object or anything you're
passing out to your view I'm just kind
of using this because it's already there
for us now to actually start playing
around with this what we would have to
do is as well as add our slim twig
extension which gives us things like
path for and base URL we would also need
to add another extension in here and
this is the twig extension debug so if
we come over to our home view now that
we're passing down our response what we
should be able to do is something like
dump and then passing in what we want to
dump so this could be absolutely
anything so if we go ahead and take a
look at this you can see that sure
enough that has been dumped out now if
we don't include this notice that it
won't work so we won't have access to
that dump function and of course if we
turn to bug off then we can't do that
either or rather it just doesn't output
anything so what we kind of want to do
is we're going to kind of ignore this
debug here you can go ahead and lay to
hook this into check this is true before
start using it but I'm going to go ahead
and just ignore this for now and I'm
going to go ahead and create my own
extension to make use of the symphony
VAR dumper inside of twig within this
context so how would we do this then
well what we would actually have to do
first of all just to keep things nice
and tidy is go ahead and set up
autoloading you may have done this
before for your projects but in this
case I'm going to use PSR for
autoloading to load under an app
namespace and I'm going to load from an
app directory just within the root of my
projects i'm going to go ahead and
create this this is normally where you'd
place all your models or your
controllers and stuff like that now in
this case what i do is i create a views
directory and i create any custom twig
extensions that i want to inside of here
now in this case maybe i would have a
debug extension so let's go ahead and
create debug extension so we can go
ahead and attach that and we can kind of
cheat and we can open up the twig
extension to grab the structure of this
so if you just pull this open and copy
this over we can tidy this up without
having to really write much code so I'm
going to paste that in there I'm going
to go ahead and open it and just before
I forget I'm going to go ahead and do a
composer dump autoload just so my PSR
for autoloading comes into effect so
let's get rid of this comment and change
this over to app use because this is now
part of our project and we know that
this is now called a debug extension it
still extends the base twig extension
we're not passing any dependencies
through to this it's going to be very
simple we're not getting a name here so
we're not going to find that out and we
don't need these methods here either
we're going to go ahead and introduce
our own methods so the way that this
works is we can define which functions
we can use within our views now in this
case I want mine to be called dump and
here is the method that we're calling on
this class so we referenced this we call
this method when we use this inside of
our views I'm going to get rid of this
old array syntax here and just use
square brackets and we're pretty much
set up to go so what I can now do is as
long as I have a dump function or method
rather on this class so we can go ahead
and create this either public or
protected it doesn't really matter let's
go ahead and create this and just to
kind of test this let's return ABC
and what I'm going to do is over an
index where I'm setting everything up
obviously this could be anywhere in your
project I'm going to go ahead and add
that extension I've just created so
let's add an extension much like we did
with the twig debug extension and I'm
going to create a new app views debug
extension and now we should have a dump
function within our views so if we come
over to home this should work as normal
let's go ahead and check it out but this
time we know that we're just returning
ABC we're not actually doing anything
useful with this at the moment now what
we can do is within our debug extension
we can accept something into this so for
example a variable and we could go ahead
and we can return that variable now we
don't want to do that we want to go
ahead and wrap this using the dump
function that we've already been looking
out throughout the series so in this
case we just wrap this with dump and
that is pretty much it we're done we can
go ahead and we can use this now with in
here and that will output using Symphony
VAR dump component so let's go over to
the browser give that a refresh and sure
enough we see the response that we
passed through 12 you earlier so there
we go if you do work with the slim
framework which I assume you are since
you're watching this part then you can
go ahead and use this anywhere now so
you can use it in here as we saw in the
introduction you can go ahead and dump
out the request if you want to check
what data you have available so you can
go ahead and do that if you want to you
can go ahead and check anything in here
you know it just really really helps
when you are either learning or you're
building something and you're not too
sure what you have available but you
also now have this using a very simple
extension inside of your views as well
so if you did need to dump anything out
then you have that available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
