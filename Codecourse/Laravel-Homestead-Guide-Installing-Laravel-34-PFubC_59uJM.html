running we're going to install laravel
on our virtual machine and the first
step to do this is globally require
laravel in with composer if you've not
worked with composer before it's a
dependency manager for PHP and it just
allows us to easily install any
dependencies and we can install laravel
through this as well so I have the
installation guide up within my browser
so I can follow along any commands I
need to paste into here but the problem
at this stage is any commands we run we
really want to be running them within
our virtual machine but at the moment
we're just on our command line within
our within our machine now a local
machine so for any system commands it's
always best to SSH into your virtual
machine and run them from there but how
do we do this well we're currently in
our main homestead directory which is
where we're always going to head after
we've maybe restarted or just returned
on our computer and when we run vagrant
up we already have our virtual machine
running so what we can now do is use
vagrant SSH to SSH into our machine so
I've just run that command and you can
see here we're now in Ubuntu despite the
fact I'm on a Mac and running OSX so
let's just quickly list a directory here
and you can see that we have that sites
file so that's the far that's been
stinking from our local machine to our
virtual machine so we're going to CD
into that and you can see our test site
there and again you'll just see all your
files in there so this is just what we
have in sync so back over to our main
directory here with sites you want to go
into that directory if you haven't
already so you're within your list of
different projects that you have and
we're now going to first of all globally
require in laravel installer and this is
all within the installation
documentation so if I just grab this
command here I paste this in composers
already installed here on Homestead and
that's going to go ahead and just
download or
wire in the laravel installer globally
and this does have a few dependencies to
download so it might take a little while
okay so now that that's done we can use
the laravel command to create a new
project so it's as simple as saying
laravel new and then the name of our
project in my case I'm just going to
call it code course so that's going to
craft our application and once that's
done we're ready to get going
and again this command might take a
little while to run so let's just wait
around for this to finish okay so now
that that's done we'll have a new folder
called code course just within here
because we called our project code
course and if we just go into this
directory we can see all of the files
that would usually associate with a
laravel installation now what we want to
do now is actually add a new site to our
laravel or our homestead yam or file
because at the moment we can access
tests dot app on port 8000 but we can't
access code Coster app because it
doesn't exist within our configuration
so again I'm gonna open homestead llamó
and under site I'm going to create a new
site so I'm gonna map code course dot
app and I'm gonna map this to home
vagrant sites and you guessed it code
course now because this is a larval
installation and the point of entry into
the application is the public directory
we do need to include public at the end
but for any non laravel projects you can
just give the root directory depending
on how it's set up of course so let's
save this out and again I'm gonna go
ahead and create a new tab within my
terminal and I'm going to edit my hosts
file within Etsy so let's just edit this
go ahead and into my password and let's
come down and add in
one two seven not dot dot one code
course dot app and let's say for out so
we know that we can access it so now
that that's done we're still going to
see another problem this is sort of
common problem we might get stuck if we
head over to code course dot up
you'd think that we have everything set
up properly because we have updated our
homestead yeah Mel file for this new
site and the new domain we've gone ahead
and updated our configuration or a hosts
file but when we access code course to
app we're still seeing our test app now
why is this well what's happened is we
haven't reprovision da grens
and it doesn't know that this code
course dot app exists well how do we
provision our machine and what is it
what does it mean well it basically
means that when we provision we just run
everything again to just set everything
up as we would when we're booting it up
but it doesn't actually restart our
machine so if we head over to the tab
where we're inside of our virtual
machine just here I'm gonna go ahead and
exit to bring myself back to my local
machine and we're currently within our
homestead directory so what we can do
now is we can run vagrant provision to
provision our machine and this should be
significantly quicker than actually
booting your machine up now that we've
done that we can go ahead and refresh Co
course to app on port 8000 and we see
our laravel installation so we already
know how to start vagrant once we sort
of open your computer up and we're ready
to to start working with a vagrant up
command we've looked at SS aging into
our virtual machine with the vagrant SSH
command and we've looked at reprovision
oisin with the vagrant provision command
after we add new sites or update any
configuration so let's jump into the
next video where we can go ahead and
look at day to day use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
