general it's a good idea to be as
consistent as possible within your code
now PHP isn't exactly the best role
model for this we have I just took a
couple of examples from the PHP manual
we have in array which determines
whether an array contains the given
value and this takes two parameters it
takes needle and then haystack
note the order needle haystack we then
have string position or STR pause which
stands for storing position and there
this takes this takes haystack and
needle
whereas this takes needle and taste ACK
so there's warning consistency with PHP
right there so that one was function
arguments this one this inconsistency is
the function name we have SDL Rev which
stands for string reverse which just
replace it
sorry just riff just reverses a string
and then we have sjr replace which
stands for string replace and you should
already know what this means by now it
just searches for a value replaces it
with a value and third parameter is the
value that you want to search now notice
that this this function name here
doesn't have an underscore to separate
the string and reverse whereas this
function does so there's another
inconsistency so why is it good to be
consistent with the code well not only
does it increase maintainability but it
also increases readability so it's a
good thing to be consistent with the
following things function arguments
which which we already looked at
function names which we also already
looked at variable names and also class
interface names so just a couple
examples quickly there
variable names variable names I was
reading some code a while ago and this
guy had had a database wrapper and he
had one property called
database underscore connection and then
later on later on he had a variable
called stored query and you probably
spotted this already here we have snake
case where we just use an underscore to
separate two words and here we use camel
case which just means we capitalized the
first letter of the next word and this
guy decided to use them both in the same
project which isn't a good idea so make
sure to stick with one style whether it
be snake case Pascal case or camel case
and make sure you stick with it
throughout your project class interface
names well there are two standard
conventions to naming an interface for
example we have user repository
interface and we could also have a user
repository which stands for interface I
suppose you could also have interface
user repository I've seen that as well
all of these are perfectly fine is just
a hundred percent personal preference
but make sure that you pick one of these
and you stick with it throughout your
whole project don't think that this
looks nice and then change your mind
later on and start using this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
