domain name to point to this server so
we can actually serve it via the domain
name rather than the IP address now
remember in the last part we look to the
nginx config and we saw that we have in
stick Adam EECOM as the site name now if
you want to only access this by the IP
address and you want to skip this part
just go and update your nginx config
like we did in the last video and you
can just carry on with the rest of the
series but if you are interested in
hooking up a domain name we're gonna
look at how we can do that now so we're
gonna need to do this from digitalocean
so if you head over to digitalocean
over to your droplet section in the
control panel you'll see all of the
servers that have been created obviously
Forge creates a digital ocean server or
a droplet so once we're over in this
section then we can do pretty much
whatever we want with our droplet it's
just a normal digital ocean droplet but
what we can do is head over to this DNS
section and we can actually set up the
domain to point to this droplet
so we're kind of doing everything
outside of forge now but it makes sense
to know how to do this anyway so we're
going to go and create a new domain so
we have this add a domain section I
actually have my domain open just here
within the registrar I've used and I
already have my name service set over
but we'll discuss this in just a moment
so over on digitalocean then we type in
the domain name that we want to add so
it's in stick Adam EECOM and let me go
ahead and choose a droplet so that's in
stick Adam II we click create record and
that's gonna go ahead and create that
for us and there we go so we now have
the name servers here that we need to
set what you're going to need to do is
whatever domain that you've used you're
gonna need to point your name servers to
NS 1 2 3 digitalocean com
once you've done that and is propagated
that domain will actually point now to
this server and you can actually access
your site via that server so if we look
at doing this now we just go over to
insta Khadem e-comm you can see that
this now works whereas before it didn't
work because we were only allowing
requests from insta Khadem e-comm to be
served
so we've now set up a domain name on our
server again you don't have to do this
but it's worthwhile just knowing how to
do it if you need to once your project
is complete and you want to release it
to everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
