switch away from JavaScript to build a
pure CSS accordion or other widget is
the ability to transition so for example
on a JavaScript accordion you'd usually
find these slide up and down quite
nicely in a smooth fashion however we
don't need JavaScript to do this either
we can do this with CSS transitions it's
very very straightforward and the great
thing is that if it's not supported on a
particular browser no worries the user
will just see what we can see at the
moment so let's take a look at the code
as it stands at the moment and we're
going to focus on the accordion content
selector and the accordion content
selector with the target select on here
so at the moment let's just recap over
what we've done we've got a padding of 0
and height of 0 just so that these
sections here stay invisible and we
obviously add the padding back on we add
a height of auto here now in order to do
a transition what we're going to have to
do is we're going to have to set the
height to a specific pixel value so the
transition knows which value to go from
and to so we're basically going from 0
to 200 so the first thing that I'm going
to do is I'm going to provide a height
here so let's just say 150 pixels this
can be anything you need and obviously
in this case what's then going to happen
is if we I mean it still works as normal
but if we would have a little bit of
extra text maybe in the first accordion
so let's add a couple more paragraphs
here with a few more bits of lorem ipsum
you can see now that it cuts off its its
cut off here because we're defining a
specific height for this element and
what we can now do is we can do an
overflow and in fact we're going to do a
overflow on the y-axis and we're going
to choose scroll so we've already done
overflow:hidden on here which makes
sense but on on the on here what we're
going to do is we're going to do an
overflow Y of scroll resetting this
original overflow as
this this basically allows us to scroll
down like that on my browser here you
can't always see the scroll bars but if
you're working on Windows or Linux
you'll likely see these scroll bars so
this works in exactly the same way but
we're now at the advantage of being able
to add a transition to make this look
really nice so this is the exciting part
so I'm going to add my WebKit vendor
prefix here so transition and I'm going
to duplicate this down in a minute
and do the non prefixed version as well
so we have a WebKit transition we need
to choose which property we want to
transition on and that's obviously the
height as it goes from 0 to 150 we want
that to transition we're going to choose
the amount of time that it takes for the
transition to happen in this case and
we're just going to choose something
like 400 milliseconds and then I'm going
to choose the transition type so we're
going to choose ease so let's duplicate
this down then and let's get rid of the
WebKit vendor prefix and there we go so
let's take a look at what this looks
like there we go we've got a nice smooth
transition effect however you probably
noticed that when I click on another
item here
the padding disappears and that's
because the padding's reset
automatically due to this selector here
however because the transitions in place
it's giving us a little bit of extra
time to see that padding disappear can
you see that happening there so what
we're going to do is we're going to
actually get rid of the padding here end
up having reset and what we're instead
going to do is add the margin or the
padding to the content within this so if
you're working with some kind of grid
system you your grid will probably have
margins on the outside so this shouldn't
be too much of a problem otherwise
within an accordion you could add an
additional element that had its own
margin so you could either do something
like margin on this P like so oops
margin of 20 pixels sorry and then
you'll have the following so that won't
affect that so now everything pretty
much looks perfect this is looking
really really nice or what you could do
is you could have an additional selector
like something like inner not P you know
and then you could maybe have say on
this one let's get rid of this paragraph
and let's create a div called inner and
then within this you could have a
paragraph with lorem ipsum and we can
create another one in there with lorem
ipsum so you've got an inner div here
which then will mean that this shouldn't
be affected the reason that's happening
is because we've got paragraphs within
here with more margin so if we just get
rid of that and keep the default then
you'll see exactly the same effect okay
and obviously the reason these are going
is because we're now not happy don't
have an inner div in there but you could
adjust that so let's just put this back
to the P solution that's just probably
something that would be preferred it
really depends on how you are doing this
and there we go there's the final result
a nice transition effect on our pure CSS
accordion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
