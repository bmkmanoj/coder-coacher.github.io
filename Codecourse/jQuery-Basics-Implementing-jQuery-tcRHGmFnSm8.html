welcome to this tutorial on how to
implement jQuery into your page okay so
as you can see I have a blank page open
in my browser
I've also dropped got jQuery comm at the
ready to download the latest version and
I also have my text editor here open in
my page or rather the page that I'm
currently working on now to download
jQuery you can do this in a variety of
different ways however the method that I
prefer is to create a new page and we're
going to copy and paste the jQuery
library code into this page and then
save it out so let's just take a look at
my directory structure you can see that
at the moment I've got index dot PHP
open and I've created a folder called
j/s which stands for JavaScript you can
see that at the moment this folder is
empty what I'm actually going to do is
I'm gonna save the jQuery code inside of
here and call it just jQuery j/s
remember we use a j/s extension for
JavaScript files so let's go ahead and
open up the jQuery website I'm gonna
make sure I've got production selected
because I am actually just using this to
write using jQuery and I'm gonna click
download and as we've seen in the last
part of the tutorial this just
essentially opens up in our browser so
let's go ahead and copy in the entire
page and we're going to go ahead and
paste it into this document here okay so
you can now see that that's been pasted
into my text editor I'm gonna go ahead
and I'm gonna save this file
I'm gonna save it in j/s and I'm gonna
call the file jQuery dot J yes I'm gonna
press ENTER to save that so now we've
got jQuery saved we can close it because
we know where it is we don't need to
modify the file itself and now that
we've saved it we actually need to
implement it into our page now I'm not
going to be using valid HTML I'm just
gonna go ahead and write out a very
basic HTML template the reason I'm not
using valid HTML and a valid HTML
template is just simply so we can focus
more on the include of the jQuery and
then the content in the body area so
inside of our head area we're actually
going to need to include
jQuery so let's go ahead and say script
type equals and then we end a script
okay so in here what we would usually
write our code inhales you know our
JavaScript code I'm not actually going
to be doing that I'm just gonna include
a type and then a source now the type is
text forward slash JavaScript as we
usually write when we are opening up a
script tag with JavaScript code and then
we need a source and this source is j/s
/j query j s that's where we saved
earlier okay so now when we save this
and run out run our page in our browser
this is actually we've actually run the
jQuery library okay so we've got we now
have access to our jQuery library so
inside a body we can actually try to
test this okay so the example I'm going
to use is I'm gonna create a paragraph
tag and I'm gonna have some text in here
and I'm gonna say click here to hide me
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add an
on-click event to this paragraph tag and
that's essentially going to hide this
paragraph tag so probably one of the
most basic examples you could actually
use okay so let's go ahead and create
our event if you're not familiar with
HTML events then I suggest you look them
up we have on click equals something
now with jQuery we use a dollar sign
before the thing that we want to hide
and then we put the thing that we want
to hide the selector in brackets and in
this case it's this and this now refers
to the actual paragraph element on here
because we've called it from inside the
PE tag and after this I'm just going to
dot and then we can include the function
that we want to carry out on this
element and that function is going to be
hide and then we're gonna just end with
a line terminator or semicolon okay so
inside here we can give this a parameter
of milliseconds so I could say 1000
which would be a second or I could say
500 which would half a second I'm gonna
go for a second
and essentially what this is going to do
is it's automatically going to animate
this hiding itself away and it's going
to take one second to complete the
animation that's essentially how easy it
is now if you wanted to say find more
find more parameters that hide takes and
it does take three parameters I believe
you can actually go to the jQuery
library documentation and have a look
down it will tell you all the
information you need that's one great
thing about the jQuery documentation
okay so let's go ahead and try this if
we just go ahead and refresh you can see
that we've got click here to hide me and
when I click it you can see that it just
disappears and you saw the animation
effect that we got now just this simple
example we've seen that jQuery has now
actually been excessively implemented
into our page we've included this script
into our page otherwise this wouldn't
have worked because this is a jQuery
functionality let's just remove that to
demonstrate how it wouldn't have worked
when I click it nothing happens okay so
that's essentially how you include
jQuery into your page I suggest you use
valid HTML I've already explained the
reasons that I'm not for the purposes of
this tutorial however you now have
included jQuery and you simply tested it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
