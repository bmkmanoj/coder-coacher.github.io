user we're going to have to modify quite
a few things but to start with we're
going to modify the form to allow a
checkbox to be ticked in order to detect
whether the user actually wants to be
remembered or not so let's go ahead and
modify the login form itself and we're
going to create a new field so exactly
like you've done already this time we're
going to encase the label and Clayton
case the input within the label just so
the text is clickable and we'll
demonstrate that in a moment
so I'm going to call this remember I'm
going to have an input type of checkbox
and the name of this is going to be
remember and the ID of this again is
going to be remember and afterwards
we'll just other text remember me so now
this looks like the following we can
click on the text too to do the checkbox
just makes it a little easier to tap and
we can detect this within the code at
the top and we'll pass this through to
our login functionality so what we're
also going to do here is well we'll see
create a remember variable and what we
want to do is detect whether we have
this input remember and when if it
equals on or not so I'm going to use a
ternary operator just to say input get
remember and does this equal on if it
equals on then we want to pass true
otherwise we want to pass false and
we're going to pass that through into
our login method so once we've done that
let's head over to our user a user class
and we want an additional argument to be
passed here and inside here we want a
check to see if remember is true or
false so that's the easy part now the
now comes the sort of checking things
generating hashes and storing cookies
and things like that now to do this
we're going to have to build a cookie
a basic cookie functionality which works
more or less the same as the input but
obviously cookies are set slightly
different than the sessions and they're
little harder to set let's go ahead and
just build this functionality because it
ties in to what we're doing quite nicely
and then also gives us the ability to
use this cookie help at another point so
we're going to create again this just
consists of static methods and this one
is going to be exists so we want to
check whether a cookie actually exists
or not so it's exactly the same as the
session one we're just going to check if
is set dollar underscore cookie oops the
underscore cookie and the name that
we've defined is that set and yes if it
is well past true otherwise we pass
false we now want to be able to get the
value of a cookie extremely important so
we're going to have a method called get
and obviously going to have to define a
name here and that's just going to
return dollar underscore cookie name
okay so we're also going to want to
delete a cookie but we can't really do
this until we've created the sorry/not
data delete we're not going to be able
to do this until we have generated the
put functionality the reason being is
that to delete a cookie we don't just
unset it we reset it with a negative
value and a null or an empty string or
something like that so we'll go ahead
and create the put method to basically
create a cookie and we're going to be
able to define a name a value and an
expiry so in this case we're going to
say if something happens so we're going
to set the cookie here and we'll pass
the parameters in here in just a moment
if that if that works we're going to
return true and otherwise we're going to
return false down here so to set a
cookie we pass a name we pass a value we
pass the expiry time which needs to be
appended to the current time so we
always say time
Plus expiry and that's defined in
seconds and we also need the the path as
we're just going to say four so show at
the current domain kind of thing so that
is our functionality now to delete a
cookie fairly straightforward we just
say self hurts because we've already
created our method we just put the name
that we want so we're basically
replacing a cookie with an empty string
and time minus one and that's it that's
all we need to do that is our cookie
class so now what we're going to do is
move on to actually using this to set a
cookie to determine if the user should
be logged in constantly or not we've
gotten a few a few properties or few
values here that we've stored in our
config so it's the set sorry the
remember one so the cookie name for the
remember and the cookie expiry as well
so how long the session if they want it
to be remembered should expire so if
remember well what do we want to do well
we want to be able to actually generate
a hash check that the hash doesn't
already exist in the in the database or
not and then insert this hash into the
database and that will be looked up
every time this user visits the page
because I'll have a cookie set which
obviously will be stored on the computer
so this is slightly tricky and this is
how it's going to work so we're going to
generate a hash and we want to say hash
unique because we've already created
that functionality here it just returned
this make function with a unique ID so
we want to generate a unique hash we
want a hash check so we want to check if
this has been stored in a database or
not and remember we created this if we
go to the login register so we created
this user session table we use a session
table and that contained a user ID a
hash so the if for example I come along
to the website I sign in my want
click remember me what it's going to do
is it's going to store a cookie with a
hash value and then it's also going to
store it in the database with my user ID
so the next time I visit the website on
the computer with that cookie stored on
my computer it will look up in the
database and we'll do all of that inside
of the initialization file in the core
folder it will look up that value and it
will assign my user ID into the session
and automatically log me in so that's
basically how this is going to work with
we're storing a list of people who sum
hashes in a database so inside back back
to our code the hash check is going to
say this DB and we're going to get from
user's session where the user ID equals
this data ID so basically checking if we
already have a hash stored in the
database which we shouldn't because when
we log out we don't want to keep this in
the database remove it at some point so
we'll we'll go back to that in the
logout functionality in a moment so if
we don't have any hash in the database
so if hash check count returns zero we
then want to insert a record into the
database
so insert array so we have a user ID and
we have a hash so we want to put this
into the database then so this is going
to be this data ID and the hash is going
to be just the hash that we generated up
here so once we've done that or
otherwise we want to set the hash equal
to hash check
first hash now this might look confusing
we've we've written quite a lot of
functionality here so let's just run
through with this if we go over to our
login page
if I hit Remember Me and click login
what's going to happen is inside of our
code on the login page we're going to
return true or false here and we're
going to return true to our login method
so our login method is then going to say
if remember yes so run all this
functionality so as long as we've ticked
that checkbox all of this will be run so
we generate a hash we then check inside
of our database - in fact we don't
really need to do this here to be honest
we should really be doing this inside of
here but nevertheless we perform a check
to see if our user ID exists in this
database table already here if it does
it will assume that we've already been
assigned a session at some point even
though it should have really been
deleted but nevertheless we account for
these different circumstances so if
that's the case if it or if it doesn't
exist we go ahead and insert a hash into
database because basically we don't want
more than one hash being assigned to a
user ID so if you have duplicate records
then we get into a bit of a mess we only
ever want one record in this table per
user and there are other ways of course
of doing this but we're just going to do
it in this way for now so we then insert
the user ID that we're currently logged
in as and what we then do is we store
the hash as well otherwise we set the
hash to the hash that's already in the
database so we just set the hash to the
map now what we want to do is actually
store a cookie so we've already created
the cookie functionality but we're going
to say cookie put I'm gonna say this
cookie name now is this cookie name
coming from well that's the same thing
as session name no or not the same thing
that it's more or less
you know the same sort of concept we
just want to store the cookie name from
the config so in this case it will be
cookie forward slash cookie underscore
and name because just refresh ourselves
there so only search remember cookie
name oh okay
so we've now stored the cookie name and
we can set the cookie name just change
that so we can now set a cookie with the
cookie name from our config file just to
keep things consistent the hash is the
value and then config get remember
forward slash cookie expiry so it's
storing it for that amount of time the
expiry that we define in our config file
so now what's going to happen let's just
take a look at what's happened now
this isn't actually going to complete
the functionality we're very nearly done
so don't worry too much if if this is
confusing you know it's not a lengthy
thing to do but it might worth review
and if you don't quite understand I'm
going login as me now keep an eye on on
this sort of area here if I if I if I
log in without this you know nothing
much happens I'll go ahead and log out
again if I log in now by checking this
and click log in you see that we've now
got this hash value that's been stored
here so on just under cookies localhost
we get the PHP session ID we also get
this hash that's been generated here
this long hash here now if we look
inside of our database oh it's not being
stored and let's take a look at why oh
that's why we need to define where we
want to store this so use the session
okay so let's go ahead and delete this
delete this hash from our our cookie set
log out and we'll log back in so now
what should happen is this will be
stored inside of our database and it
will be set as a cookie so we set the
hash here and inside of our database
that still not worked
let's just check what's happening here
okay so if we just check DB and go to
but okay so our insert method inside of
our database wrapper we left the or I
left the users table as the as a thing
that's inserted into so not good at all
so if I go ahead and just replace this
with table will close that let's just
take a look in the database to make sure
nothing was inserted into users which I
have a feeling it hasn't nope that's
fine so because then obviously then
fields didn't exist that's pop pop back
to user session pop back to the site and
delete the hash that you know is stored
and we'll go ahead and log in again so
Alex and password login hash oops
let me know so Alex password remember me
login hash is generated here and hash is
stored in the database along with my
user ID perfect so this hash here
matches this hatch here now how do we
know that when we come back to this that
we're actually still going to be logged
in or not we you know as it stands at
the moment if we closed our browser shut
down our PC and came back the next day
we definitely would not be logged in
again we said we you know we won't be
logged in what we need is when a user
revisits the site we need a way to
determine whether or not they have this
cookie available if they do have the
cookie available we need to go ahead and
look this up in the database table
return the user ID and set this into a
session to signify that they're they're
signed in so what we need to do is
modify our initialization file to make
use of the fact that every request to
the application will potentially you
know log a user in so we want a check to
say if cookie exists
config' get remember cookie or it's
cookie name so if if this cookie
actually exists we want to check if a
user is logged in or not as well so we
also want to say perhaps and session has
I know session exists we want so if it
doesn't exist so if the if the user
session doesn't exist config get session
session name so ok let's let's go ahead
and look at this so let's echo out user
asked to be remembered so what we're
going to do now is hit enter we don't
get that value back to spite the fact
that hash exists if we delete the
session but keep the hash it we're not
logged in but we are signifying that the
user has asked to be remembered so we
now know that we need to grab that
cookie value look it up in the database
grab the user ID and log that user in by
that user ID because that token is
unique to that user so what we need to
do here is we need to grab the or do a
hash check so we need to get get the
cookie first of all so cookie get and we
obviously take this from the config so
that the cookie name from the config
config gets remember cookie name now
we're sort of repeating ourselves a
little bit here but let's not worry too
much about that for now let's create a
hash check to see if that this actually
exists let's say dB get instance and
also get from the user's session table
and we want to get data where the hash
is equal to the hash we just grabbed so
if hash check count hash matches log
user in so that's going to be our
signifier to actually log a user into if
i refresh oh ok it's it doesn't seem to
match let's just check everything ok
something's gone a little wrong so if
hash check count user session hash hash
count let's just go ahead and take ho
this hash out so we can see the the
value of it and just compare that here
so that looks like they match and in the
database let's edit this and it looks
like that is cut off 53 yes so basically
what's happened here is this is not
large enough so let's go ahead and add
this as a 64 character a field and let's
go ahead and delete the PHP session and
the hash will go ahead and login will
signify that we want to be remembered so
we want to be remembered delete the PHP
session and now what's happening is or
should be happening there we go
so hash matches use log user in now if
we were to change the value of this hash
here that would no longer be the case
this this wouldn't unfortunately I can't
from the the chrome the chrome controls
here I can't actually modify this hash
value but if I were to modify this you
can in Firebug if you're using Firefox
then we could we can modify this but
that's the point really that an attacker
is never going to know if they want to
be if they want to login as particularly
use that they're never going to know
what the hash is in the database and is
you know security on this front can
always be improved but for now we're
storing this hash which does match the
hash in the database here and then we
can we can lock the user in so let's go
ahead now and do this so here instead of
outputting that we want to say user
equals new user hash check first user ID
because that's the user ID that's stored
alongside the hash in the database here
so that we four so what we've now done
is we've specified in our user object
when we instantiate it that we do want a
user so what's now going to happen is
we're actually going to find a user if
it has been defined and if we come down
here what we do is we find all the users
data and then we're going to actually
log this user into family users data and
now we can say user login so it's
exactly the same as the login process
we're just doing it based on another
users ID so now what's going to happen
is when i refresh the page
okay so missing argument three for login
okay so we've not defined any of these
so let's um let's go over to our user
cost okay so remember
we'll say that equals false by default
so now we won't go this error and this
hash we go back to index let's get rid
of this and let's get rid of this as
well let's go ahead and login
remember me delete up PHP session hit
enter and oh we're still not logged in
let's just check these okay right let's
find out what might be going on here
then let's echo out something here okay
so that doesn't appear to be logging us
in so let's just see what might be
happening so we're creating a new user
object hash check first user ID let's
just go ahead and echo this out that
should output four lovely so we know
that we can now pass that into the user
object we're calling the login method
I'm not passing anything through because
it should if we go back automatically do
this so login of course right so what
we're going to do now is this this is
something that I completely forgot to
include we're going to check if a user
name password hasn't been defined and
check if the if the user actually exists
or not
now the reason we have to do this is
because at the moment the login
functionality all it's do is it's not
doing anything to do with the user
that's already logged in so if we do a
quick a quick check here and we say if
blah blah blah else we'll put this here
so we want to indent this as well and we
to return false down there that's so
what we're now going to do is well let's
just check this so if user turn true
otherwise want to return false yes we
want to return fuzzball to default okay
so what we're now doing is if we've not
passed in any username or any password
we want to log the user in automatically
if that user exists so we want to say if
no usernames been defined and no
password has been defined and this
exists meaning this user exists then we
want to log user in and we want to log
the user in by the the data ID now this
exists we don't actually have at the
moment but all we want to do to
determine whether they exist or not is
if we have retrieved data from them or
from a user at some point so the exists
function is basically just going to
check whether the data you know exists
in this data array I'm going to say
return not empty this data then true
otherwise Fox so we're checking if a
user name and password hasn't been
defined in this case when we are doing
this sorry doing this it hasn't been
defined and this will automatically you
know create this data array for us so
this exists will be true in that case
then we just want automatically set a
session for the user so that's easily
done we just put a session so session
put and in here we want to just say this
session name we've already defined this
and then because we have access to this
data that we've already accumulated
based on doing this we can just log that
user in okay it's a little complicated
but touch one own things so we know
refresh now oh okay unexpected public
used up a PHP line 84
there we are sorry I forgot a an ending
any brackets so the syntax over there
so now fresh into now it's logged me in
so if I lock myself out I'm always going
to stay locked in because the hash
exists if I get rid of the hash I hit
enter I'm still logged in but if I get
rid of the PHP session this time I'm
locked out so now what's happening is
the hash is going through its generating
everything and it means that now when we
return as long as this hash is generated
and it matches the one in a database
this is always going to return four and
then lock that user in based on the idea
for there's one more thing we need to do
just quickly before we wrap things up
here and that is we need to modify the
logout functionality because at the
moment when we log out you know nothing
we can't really log out because we're
not deleting this hash we're
automatically being logged in because
that's the point of the remember me
functionality so if we go down to the
the logout functionality here not only
do we want to delete this session we
also want to leave the cookie so this
cookie name now that's not all we want
to delete we also want to remove it from
the database as well so we're going to
say this DB delete I mean we could keep
the same hash for each user but if it's
hacker ever found that hash by any means
we would then be in trouble because we
want to regenerate the hash every time a
user logs in so by a user logging out
and logging back in livery refresh their
hash so we want to delete from user
session where user ID equals this data
ID okay
so now it's going to delete where that's
the the current
logged-in ID so when we log out we
actually now log out delete the hash
from our cookie and we also delete this
from the database and then when we go
ahead and log in again it does exactly
the same thing generates the hash here
generic stash here even if the session
doesn't it's expired
we still log ourselves in we still keep
this in the database when we log out
they've both gone again so a little bit
more complex functionality than we've
already seen but this will now allow us
to provide the user with the ability to
stay signed in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
