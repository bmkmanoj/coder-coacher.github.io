same file that we uploaded to the users
Dropbox account and we're gonna store it
back in this files directory what I'm
gonna do is then delete the one local to
the folder I'm working in just so we
don't have it there anymore and we're
gonna pull this down and put it back
into files and again this is extremely
straightforward if we open up the client
we actually have a method here called
get file and it takes a path which is
going to be the path to the image in the
users - or not the image but the file in
the users Dropbox the out stream is the
same as the in-stream is just where you
want to save the file so this time we
reverse it and we do an F open but we
write rather than read so let's go ahead
and do this now then again we're gonna
use client and it's get file we need to
provide the remote path to the file
which remember is photo jpg and then we
want to choose the local farther we want
to save it to so we F open files photo
jpg again you can name this anything you
want to pull it in with or pull it in to
as the name but this time we want to
write instead so let's look at what this
does let's refresh again and there we go
so if we head over you can see that that
photo from the remote Dropbox folder has
been pulled down to our local directory
and that is how easy it is to pull files
down from your users Dropbox folder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
