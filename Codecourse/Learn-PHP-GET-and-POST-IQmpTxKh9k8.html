ability to send data from a webpage back
to your server to be processed so we're
going to be building a form and we're
going to examine get and post both
getting post data types or not data
types ways of submitting data through an
HTTP request and we'll look at the the
differences between them when we
shouldn't shouldn't use them and we'll
create a form to submit a name to
another page to be processed using
either get or post this is going to be a
very basic example but it will set you
up to be able to post whatever data that
you want to to your server so the first
thing that we want to do is go ahead and
actually build a form so let's go ahead
and construct a form now what I'm doing
here is I'm giving this form an action
and a method and we'll cover them in
just a moment so what we're now going to
do is create an input field with the
type of text and we're going to give
this a name now this name is extremely
important because this allows us to pick
up the name that you give here in PHP so
I'm going to call this let's call this
just name so that's how we're going to
pick this up I'm also going to have an
input with a type of submit and this is
going to allow us to actually submit
this data
okay so let's preview this form in our
browser you can see that we just have an
input field here and a submit button at
the moment when we click this is what
it's actually doing is because we've not
defined a method or a or an action it's
submitting to the current page with the
method get' and we can see this in the
URL here you can see there's this name
key here with no data if I was to type
in a full name here and click submit you
can see that we've got the value Alex
Garrett with a plus for a space so this
is this has been set as a get request so
basically this has been sent in the URL
of the HTTP request rather than the body
now the body would be the method of post
there's still available to the server
but it's just been sent in the body of
the request rather than the URL so if I
against have Alex go and click submit
that data is now available to us in PHP
still being sent with the HTTP request
if we check our network tab and we go
ahead and enter Alex Garrett and click
Submit you can see that we get this here
if we go ahead and click on this and go
under headers you can see that we have
form data just here and name Alex
Garrett so you can see that this data
still been submitted let's just change
this back to get actually and take a
look at the network tab again so
confirmed hit yep so we've resubmitted
if we click on this you can see now that
you've got query string parameters
rather than the actual data so you've
got a query string parameter here name
is the key Alex Garrett as the value so
when should we use get and when should
we use post will generally get should
not be used to for example in so record
into a database or do anything like that
it should purely be as a almost like a
getter so I might want to say well I
want to be on page two so I might want
to have a page that looks something like
this page equals two and that might
select page two of the results from a
particular database set or something
like that so generally we would do that
but let's take a look at actually how we
actually pick this up in PHP and we'll
use print our on get and post
superglobals just so we can see how this
data has been transferred so let's
create a new file rather than submitting
this to this one we could of course do
everything up here in actual fact that
might make a little bit more sense so
we're submitting to action with
submitting the action as nothing we
could of course just the index dot PHP
in here this could be in a completely
another file it really reads doesn't
matter where we're submitting to this
data is still going to be available to
us because it's been sent with the HTTP
request well in this case I'm just going
to choose index dot PHP and inside of
here I'm going to say print our dollar
underscore get and that's it and this
looks a lot it's just the super global
notation in PHP you'll see others like
requests in actual fact we could have
print armor and requests as well so if
we were to say Alex Garrett and click
submit you can see that we've now got
named Alex Garrett
now we don't really tend to use requests
instead we want to specifically define
which which method we want to pick the
data up from so when I click on that we
get exactly the same result that but
then again we won't get post data back
here so if we change this to post get
will be empty but instead we can use
post and this will be exactly the same
thing and we'll see now that this
actually comes through as the name as
the key and Alex Garrett as the value
but we haven't got this in the URL as
we've already seen in the network tab so
what do we actually do with this data
what how can we actually do do something
with this data well the first thing that
we really need to do is check if this
data is actually available to us or not
and we can use the ESET construct in PHP
so we're going to create a little if
statement and we're going to say if is
set dollar underscore post name then we
can go ahead and actually do something
with it so um if I was to go ahead and
echo okay here and when we initially
land on this page remember we saw the
sort of empty array notation up there a
moment ago now we see nothing because
this hasn't been set it's not being sent
to our page so we don't have access to
it when I go ahead and click Submit now
it says okay because that data has
actually been set and sent and we can of
course do this with multiple values so
we could choose name and age let's just
put some placeholders in here
okay so we can actually do this with
multiple items so if we look at this
we've got name and age here I want to go
ahead and check if name and age is set
so I can come and separate what I passed
through to is set and I can say if name
and age is available name and age are
available and what I can then do is
refresh and go ahead and type in a name
and just type in any any age into here
and click Submit it says name and age
are available so in this case what I can
actually do is I could say something
like name equals dollar underscore post
name because I know that that exists now
and I can just duplicate this down and
do exactly the same thing for the age
and then I can down here echo out you
are X and you are Y years old and then I
can go ahead and just replace these in
with complex syntax name and age and
that's it so now what we see is Alex
Kara 24 click Submit and it tells us our
name and our age now just as a side note
here and as a little warning what we're
actually doing here is we are are not
really sanitizing any of this data that
we get through now in this case it's
only example it doesn't really matter
too much but generally speaking this
data could be harmful and I'll just
demonstrate this very quickly if I go
ahead and type some open and close
script tags here and I alert perhaps
just the number 1 and I type in my age
when I hit submit here you see if we
inspect this that we have this script
here with potential data inside of it so
let's just do this here
and you can see that we've got a weight
basically in in terms of XSS attacks in
this case we see that we have a XSS
order to refuse to execute script
because it its source was found within
the request the audits done so we've got
a sort of XSS protection built in here
but generally we want to go ahead and
protect against houses so you need to be
really careful when you're outputting
data and we have and we rectify this
with the HTML entities function and
generally what will do is will provide
the or wrap the string that were
outputting HTML entities we will then
specify something like int quotes and
then we'll also explicitly define the
character encoding so utf-8 now in this
case what's going to happen is if we do
this for name and age in fact we'll just
do it for name just for demonstration
purposes and we can get back on track
you'll see that we have if we just type
in the same as we did before you can see
that this is like literally output and
that's because we're outputting the
entity equivalent so here you can see
that this is converted to entities so
anyway that's that's basically now we
have the ability to post data through we
could of course cast this two million if
we were concerned about security as well
because we know that this needs to be a
number so what we've done here is we've
looked at posting data and using or
defining an action in our HTML form and
sending this back to our page checking
and then outputting data onto on to our
page so this is how we submit form data
in PHP now why would we not want to use
get in some other circumstances and once
you post in other circumstances well one
thing is that posts will handle a lot
more data than a get request will simply
because it's it's sent in the request
body so for example if you are asking a
an admin to add an article to a page or
an author to add an article to a page
you obviously wouldn't send their whole
article in a get request you would send
it in a post request because it allows
for more data to be sent via
the by the forum and via the HTTP
request so that's how we use get and
post in PHP and a couple of little
security considerations as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
