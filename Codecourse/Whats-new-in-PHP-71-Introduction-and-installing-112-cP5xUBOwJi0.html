my favorite and most notable additions
to PHP 7.1 and in this course we're
going to look at each of these and we're
also gonna look at a couple of practical
examples as well where you might
implement these because it's all well
and good talking about them but
sometimes you need to know how these are
applied now if you've not watched the
course on the best of PHP seven then
this will cover the really big bang
additions to PHP seven so I'd recommend
you watch that first but if you've
already seen that or if you already know
what the additions are to PHP seven then
we're going to talk about PHP 7.1 so the
way that I basically switch between
different versions to test different
things out is using the PHP seven dev
vagrant box so we're going to go and
install this you'll need VirtualBox if
you don't have anything like homestead
already installed if you don't work with
laravel go ahead and install VirtualBox
it works with any operating system and
the same with vagrant as well they're
pretty easy to go ahead and get
installed now you're also going to need
to get because we're gonna get cloned
down this box we're gonna CD into it do
a vagrant up SSH in and we'll do some
more set up here if you already know how
to do this or if you already have this
box installed then of course you can
skip the rest of this video so I'm gonna
come over to the terminal I'm currently
just inside of a www which I basically
use for all of my projects and I'm gonna
go ahead and I'm gonna clone this down
so I'm just pasting this in and I
usually just call this PHP seven dev
just so it's there I'm ready to go so
once that's done let's go into PHP seven
dev and let's go and do a vagrant up on
this now this might take a while
depending on if you actually have this
box already installed but we'll wait for
this to finish and then we'll go ahead
and continue
now once this has booted up we are just
gonna need to choose how we connect to
the Internet in my case I'm connecting
over Wi-Fi so I'm gonna go ahead and
choose one this might be slightly
different for you and now that we've
done that that will go ahead and boot
this machine up we can SSH into it and
we're gonna create a symbolic link
between a folder so we can sync our
local files to the VM one more thing
though just while this is finishing I'm
gonna go ahead and open up a new tab and
I'm gonna come over to my NC hosts file
on Windows or any other operating system
I have absolutely no idea how you would
change over your hosts file but go ahead
and google around for that and you'll
find it basically what we need to do is
add this to our hosts file so we can
know how to resolve this so if we go
ahead and pop that in there and go ahead
and save this out that should all be
good to go so let's come over to the
terminal here this should nearly have
finished and there we go so if we do a
vagrant ssh now to go into the box we'll
take a look at what kind of files we
have in here we'll check the PHP version
and then we'll create that symbolic link
so we're booted in here we have a source
and a PHP source directory if we just
first of all do a PHP v you can see that
we're running PHP 7.1 dev now we can
actually switch between versions if we
want to using new PHP we're not going to
do that because we already have this set
up but you can go ahead and run that to
switch between any versions so what we
now need to do is just on our local
machine or even within our VM but it's a
little bit easier to do within our local
machine is come over to PHP seven dev
within that directory that I added it in
and I'm gonna go ahead and just make a
source directory just inside of here now
inside of our VM if we come over to
slash vagrant will see that source file
just down here and what we need to do is
create a symbolic link between this and
our source directory just here so if we
first will boot this up in our browser
we'll be able to see this so I've just
come over to literally PHP seven dev
that thing that we added to our host
file the URI that we added to our host
file and we can see here that we can
actually find out our document roots so
if we just search for this you can see
it's var
default so what we can do is inside of
our VM now we can create a symbolic link
between this and that folder that we've
created locally and this will sync up
all of our files so we can actually
write code on our machine and then these
will be synced to our virtual machine so
we're going to create a symbolic link
from VAR dub dub dub default or rather
from vagrant source to VAR dub dub dub
default and we're just gonna run that
again with sudo permissions and I've
opened up that source directory that I
created just within there a moment ago
if we go and save out a file in here so
for example index dot PHP and go ahead
and write anything in here that we want
you can call this folder whatever you
want it probably makes more sense to
call it www or something like that
either way when we come over to here now
run over to the source directory you can
see that we get this out so we can edit
these on our local machine they'll be
synced to our virtual machine and we can
of course see them in the browser
accessing this through the virtual
machine so just quickly then if you did
want to switch between PHP versions you
can run new PHP and this will give you a
list here of all of the versions that
you can switch between and this is just
tends to be how I switch between
versions if I need to very quickly test
things out what we are going to do
throughout the course is also have a PHP
seven box running I'm actually going to
be using something like lamp or if
you're using Windows one or whatever and
we're going to be testing the difference
between PHP seven and PHP 7.1 what you
can do is run new PHP and then the
version number now in our case we're
using seven one and we know that we are
because when we do PHP /v we get the
following so now that we will setup we
can go ahead and look at all of the
things that we're going to cover that
new in PHP 7.1 in this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
