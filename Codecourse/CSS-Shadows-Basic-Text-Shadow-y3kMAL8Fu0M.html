looking at applying a shadow to some
text on our page we're going to be using
the text shadow property to do this and
we're going to be using it in such a way
that we can reuse the text shadow across
any area of our website so the way we're
going to do that is by using a class
which we can apply to any element on the
page in this case of applied the text
shadow to the headline or what we'll see
later is an h1 element and I've used the
text shadow in a way that gives the text
above a 3d effect just emphasizing it
and making it stand out from the rest of
the page so let's look into the code for
applying a text shadow this is what
we'll need initially which is the basic
sort of html5 templates and which will
need for any of our features for a
website really any of our pages so the
first thing you'll notice is a doc type
of HTML which basically tells the web
browser that we're going to be using
html5 we then have an HTML element which
is used to wrap warlock HTML structure
in and we have a head which is where we
put the title of the page in this case
text shadow and a link to our style
sheet which you can see here and the HS
is the path to the style sheet so you
can see that the style sheet is in the
same directory as our HTML file is so
let's start writing some HTML to get the
structure on the page the first thing we
want is a div which is just going to
hold our our headline which we saw
earlier and so let's just create a div
and give it a class of container and I'm
going to target the container class in
my CSS just to give a bit of formatting
to the code and the output next thing
going to need is an h1 which is going to
be used as an the title element itself
so h1 and the text inside this is going
to be dark the dark nights as you saw
earlier
and then the final thing we'll need in
terms of HTML is a span tag with a class
of shadow and the span is actually what
we're going to target in the CSS to use
the text shadow property and the reason
we want to span like that as I said has
a touched on earlier is so that wherever
we want the text shadow applied on our
page we have to do is wrap the text in a
span with class shadow and that will be
applied so for example is to take night
out of this span tag and put it here
then the shadow would not be applied
tonight would be applied to the dark
only but we'll see an example of that
later so i'll save that and see what the
output is on the page a moment is just
very basic we've got the text and that's
that's it so now let's apply the text
shadow so I go back to my stylesheet the
first thing I'll do is format the body
of the page just by giving a background
color of hash 444 which is quite a dark
grey remove any book margin from the
page and I'll then target the div that I
talked about earlier and give it a bit
of padding just to get the title
standing out from the edges of the page
getting it a bit more focused on the
middle of page and then I'm going to
target the h1 and give that some
formatting as well so I'm going to give
a font size of 5am it's just a another
measurement for for text other than
pixels and am is relative to the pixel
size and that's preset which by default
is 16 so 5am is five times 16 which is
going to be 80 pixels and let's give it
a font of georgia which is the one that
i was using to demonstrate the text
shadow early on and we'll give it a
color a white color so hash FFF is
basically white and then now we'll move
on to actually apply in the shadow so
I'll target the shadow class
oops there we go I'll target the shadow
class by using this selector here and
then let's use the text shadow property
now the text shadow property takes four
arguments one of which is optional and
so I'll go through those step-by-step
the first argument is the X offset of
the shadow so what this means is the
value you give will be the distance from
the text that the shadow will render in
the X direction so for pixels there will
mean we have a shadow that protrudes
four pixels and the X direction from the
the text itself the next one is simply
the wild set so if I give 3 pixels there
we're going to have a shadow and to the
right of the text with four pixels and
I'm going down three pixels the next
property is the blur radius and blow
radius is basically a property that
tells us how wide and light the the
shadow is going to be so if I put this
at zero it's just going to be a solid
shadow but if I still have 10 picks was
there the shadow would sort of fade out
a little bit but you can play around
that with yourself and then the final
thing as a color so if i apply hash to
22 which is a very dark grey that's a
bit of a darker color so there we are
that's all the styling we lead let's see
what that looks like there we go that's
the text shadow applied just the final
thing that I'll show is if ice to take
night out of that span tag and put it
here just inside the h1 save that up and
go to the page you can see that shadow
is only applied to the dark and not
tonight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
