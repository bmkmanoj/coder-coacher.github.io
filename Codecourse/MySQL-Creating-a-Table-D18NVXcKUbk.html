do is actually create a table that we
can store data so we're going to create
a table that stores articles so we're
going to have an article name and
article description the date that an
article is created so let's go ahead and
do that now we need to use the create
table syntax so you say create table and
you might often find that you see things
like the actual my SQL commands are in
an uppercase and this just helps
distinguish the commands from the actual
variable names if you like so the names
of the tables the names of databases and
terms of columns things like that so
let's go ahead and create this article's
table so I'm going to say create table
articles and then what I need to go
ahead and do is define the columns
within this table and this is just going
to be the different columns that we
store data in so I've said name
description and create it so this isn't
all we're going we're going to do what
we also need to do is define the type of
data that we're storing here so for
example the name this is more than
likely going to be a varchar which is a
variable character and this allows you
to define the amount of characters that
are stored for this column so for the
name of an article we could say that
this could run so maybe something up to
120 characters now for a description
this might be something like text so
this is just going to be text for
created this might be a date time which
basically allows you to store datetime
field so the day and the time so we can
say create the Creator that field is
date time let's end up with a semicolon
hit enter we see that we now have query
okay but the next thing we need to do is
look at how we actually list the tables
we've created so we can keep an eye on
the ones that we have we've added to our
database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
