you can use ma'am or one or something
similar or using a virtual box is a much
more efficient solution okay so here in
my command line i'm just going to run
make directory or call it chatty which
is the name of the social network and
we'll just CD into there and let's
vagrant in it and if we just edit the
vagrant file which was just generated
for us i'll check this down a bit for
you and we set the syntax to ruby all we
need to do is set the box to a bun
through trusty 64 and then we need to
uncomment this line to forward our pots
okay so that should be all we need from
here let's go back to our command line
and run vagrant up and this will take a
couple of seconds depending on your
computer and your internet and things
like that but it shouldn't take too long
okay perfect so if we go to our browser
and go to localhost 8080 we're going to
get an error and that's because we
haven't set up our web server so let's
do that now let's say vagrant ssh to go
into our virtual machine and we'll see d
into a vagrant directory now to install
apache you were going to use the apt-get
command but before we do that we need to
update the repositories using sudo
apt-get update and that'll take a couple
of seconds so once that's done we're
going to install Apache so sudo apt-get
install apache2 we're also going to want
to install PHP 5 as well as lib Apache
to mod php5 so we'll run nose and we'll
hit wide to confirm okay so once that's
done if we go to our browser and hit
refresh we should get this apache2 abun
to a default page now before we continue
let's just very quickly install
so sudo apt-get install and we need to
install my SQL Server MySQL client is
optional but I like to bring it in just
in case php5 mysql we need that to allow
us to use the mysql PDO driver so let's
install those as well and then we're
going to get this very appealing page we
need to enter a password for the mysql
root user i normally just use root so
i'm just going to repeat that and that
will continue the installation for us
perfect so let's just make sure that
MySQL was installed we'll just quickly
connect to it using the mysql command
will enter a password and great if we
show databases we get our three default
databases here so the next thing that we
need to do is change the document root
for Apache so to do this we go into sudo
nano or you can use vim etsy apache two
sites enabled and 000 oz default comp
and down here where it says document
root we're just going to change this to
vagrant which is our shared folder and
we also need to enter some options in
here so let's just open up our directory
directory tags the directory vagrant
then we'll close that off what we need
to say is options ash indexes + follow
symlinks + multi views then we need to
say allow override all and that allows
us to override the configuration in our
directories and then we're just going to
say require or granted and let's write
that out and we need to restart the
service so suit ourselves apache2
restart and all that does is restarts
apache so it brings in the configuration
that we just changed
and now if we hit refresh in a browser
we're getting this forbidden error and
that's only because we haven't got
anything in a vagrant directory it so
let's very quickly just create a index
dot PHP file and we'll create some tests
PHP hello world write that out and hit
refresh and there we go everything is
working fine so now we have a virtual
box we can move on to getting some
coding done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
