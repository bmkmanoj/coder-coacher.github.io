video number 16 and my new series called
introduction to colored igniter we'll be
showing you guys in this video is we'll
be taking our website that we've made so
far well we will be making the the
values and the data actually be drawn
from a database instead of just from an
HTML sheet by doing that we'll be
actually making the website more or less
dynamic in the fact that or in the sense
that other things can update or other
scripts like a CMS could actually update
the database and make that content
change without actually having to change
any HTML which is extremely powerful
extremely useful in the in the industry
of web development today it's actually
what I make a living doing so yeah it's
I get started what will what we'll start
with is we're actually going to create
the database level that we'll be putting
all the values into and then we'll be
taking the motive we'll go into our
phpMyAdmin and we'll create a new
database we'll call it c i underscore
site database CI on our site has been
created excellent so we can actually go
to it
and we're going to create a new table on
here called page data the number of
columns it will be five will have five
columns I'll show you what those are in
a second click go
first one will be ID obviously sure you
I'm sure you're used to doing this by
now
index primary Auto increment the second
will leave the title of the of the page
in this case that will just be text
varchar' would work just fine if you're
not using this for this version of PHP
myadmin the next one we're going to do
is the page to specify for this row
which page is for text one so these are
both text as well and then texts to
excellent so this is done we can click
scroll to the bottom and click Save
that's done so now we'll go into this
table and we'll add our values we'll go
insert and now if you remember a couple
videos ago we actually put this content
home content about we filled these up
and this is actually what makes up the
bulk of our data on our website so if we
refresh this this is exactly what's
coming out of these views what we want
to do is put this data on the database
so that is trying so these values aren't
in the HTML they're in the database so
we'll just start copying pasting all of
these the title is home page for this
row well copy and paste them all into
the database and then we'll take them
out in a minute the second is this
string of text right here I guess it
should copy from HTML copy this goes in
for text 1 oh I made a mistake this is
not supposed to be int so let's go back
in the structure we'll just cancel this
the structure change should be text save
okay sorry about that now we'll go ahead
and insert this first title is home page
texts one chicken widows mouse of
business and the second one
is the second P tank this whole lorem
ipsum string which actually oh I guess
this I put this one in for Paige we're
actually going to put it in for text one
the page is this one will obviously be
home and I'll show you why that's set
there for a reason in a minute okay so
now we have the first row completed it's
got hope the title of home page ID we
leave blank because that's Auto
incremented that'll be automatically set
to one Paige's home text one is this
text 2 is that we'll do the second thing
for the about page go to the about view
actually just copy this actually retype
it about page this is for the about page
so we'll let me put this and I'll this
is very important for text one is I
guess the same thing so that lorem ipsum
string will actually just copy and paste
it from up here to troll c control v
okay so this should be all good to go
click go and then browse and then our
two rows in our database have now been
entered this won't change anything that
in our code yet we're actually going to
go ahead and do that right now so the
first thing we want to do is create a
new model that's actually going to get
these values from the database no sorry
the first thing we want to do is
configure the database so we'll go into
config database now the hostname for me
is going to be localhost and that is
found right here I'll show you we go
back to click on the PHP myadmin logo
and then I'll show you server localhost
for me right and you can also see that
my user is root there's no password
because this is a local server with no
security setup so I have no security I
don't have to worry about security um so
we'll go and we'll put my username is
root password blank and the database you
just set that up at CI underscores site
so we'll save this and if we refresh our
application we can actually tell if I
had any errors so click refresh and
there's no errors if if we did have a
problem connecting it would actually
show us so if we refresh the page okay
the second thing I'm going to do you're
going to go into our models we haven't
created that okay we'll go into models
we're going to create a new model that's
going to get these values from the
database now that we're connected called
this model underscore get PHP go into it
and here we'll write our model class
model underscore get extends c i
underscore model and here's where we
write off our function we'll call it oh
let's see which we wish we call it get
data because that's what it does now
this function will receive one parameter
and that will just be page so we can use
the same function for both the different
functions in our controller and I'll
show you that in a second too
what we'll do is we'll create our query
object set that equal to this DB get
underscore where
okay I get we're actually reset it
receives two parameters the first is is
the table that work is the table that
we're getting it from
we've already specified the database
which is c i underscore site the table
is page data and the second is the wire
specifier so that is an array or it
receives an associative array so the
first thing will be the row that we're
going to compare the value to and this
the second will be actually the variable
that we pass in which is page so we're
going to specify when we call this
function which paid we're running the
function for and then it's actually
going to grab that row from the database
and then return it so we'll go return a
query object the result of it and that
is a function so those Prem let's go
back another thing we have to do is
check and check and make sure that the
database library is turned on so we'll
do that really quick actually will go
config autoload and this is something
that we usually want to have Auto loaded
and it is so if you're having problems
or this will prevent problems if you're
trying to use the DB functions ahead of
time so this model should be good to go
we'll go back into our site controller
and start using it so what we'll do is
we'll go we'll load the model will go
this load model
and the model will be model underscore
get yes now will call a function the
model will go this model underscore get
and then get data and for this one
because it's for the home page we're
going to pass in the value of home
so our model then is going to receive
whatever we pass in in this case its
home and it's going to look on the
database for the row where the page is
home and we're actually going to do one
more thing we're going to make a new
array to the data array which is pretty
common I use the data array a lot and
we're going to set it equal the create a
new array inside the data array called
results and set it equal to whatever to
the array that is returned full of the
row from the database from this model
next thing we want to do is pass in the
data array to the view that we want to
use it in in this case it will be the
content to underscore home view and then
if we go into content underscore home we
have all this text that now no longer
needs to be static because we're
basically the controller is handing it
to the view and now we can use it inside
the view so what we'll do is we'll leave
that for now and we'll open up our PHP
tags
and we will start a 4h statement will
say for every results as row so it's
going to be receiving this results array
passed from the site controller which
will be this variable here which
essentially will be the array returned
from them from the database for each row
and then we're going to start grabbing
some values out of it out of this array
so in the title will be row title D text
one
row text 1 and text to the row
text 2
okay wonderful the next thing we want to
do is we will echo out a heading which
will be replacing this and we do have
the URL helper already auto loaded so we
can actually use the heading function
part of the auto load helper or go title
it'll be an h1 tag so we can delete this
next thing we'll do is we'll actually
delete this stuff
we'll go open up our PHP tags we will
echo text one and we can delete this and
just duplicate this line in case you're
not familiar I just press ctrl D I'm in
PHP Edie the command is the same for
notepad plus plus and other than that
I'm not sure but in the second line will
be echoing text to inside of text one
because we've grabbed both of them up
here now if we save this and I think yes
I do need to save my site controller
save this too this should actually echo
the exact same thing so if this is a
success it'll look exactly the same we
refresh the page and it looks exactly
the same source our content is now
dynamic why don't we actually give that
a try we're going to see i underscore
site into the page data table for the
home we'll edit some of this data and
instead of for lorem ipsum we'll give it
a couple enters in goat casa sting or
eat Internet
go down and go click go back to our
website will refresh this look at that
oh my goodness how cool is that now we
have content managed pages all just one
page the about page is still the exact
same but let me show you how powerful
this actually is now that I've written
this clean it up a little bit can copy
the exact same thing into this into the
about view
I'll just ctrl C and I'm going to
highlight all of this paste it replace
everything with this exact same thing
we're just going to pass it in a
different row and call it call the
function in the site controller so if we
go back into the site controller you can
copy and paste this ctrl C except for
I'm sure you guess we're going to pass
in about instead of home so it's going
to return the whatever is in the about
the about row you just need to pass in
the data array sure enough now if we
save the controller go back to our
website and click on the about link and
that is our awesome content manage about
page now to test this why don't we
change some of the about data click edit
scroll down
we are in here about
go and if we refresh this whoo look at
that okay getting a little excited
programming so much fun but yeah I think
that's pretty much it for this video our
website is now content managed now if we
have something like a content management
system this this content can now be
changed on the fly with something or
just from a data just from PHP Edie like
you see me do and it updates the website
dynamically it's extremely powerful
extremely useful and that is it for this
video thank you for watching next video
we'll be talking about the forum helper
we'll be working on the contact page
because you've seen here we we haven't
actually linked it to anything so next
video we will be working on sending a
forum and an email and all kinds of fun
things thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
