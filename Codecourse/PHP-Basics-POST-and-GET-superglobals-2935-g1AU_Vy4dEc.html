to anything very very practical in terms
of building your own application and in
this part we're gonna look at the get
and the post superglobal array and we're
gonna build a form that allows us to
submit data through to another file now
superglobals are a special name
basically given to global PHP variables
that hold different types of information
now this sounds really complicated and
sometimes they are but in this part like
I said we're gonna look at the get and
the post superglobal array now if you've
ever submitted a form on a website
or you've seen a question mark in the
URL so let's just go over to the browser
you've seen something like the following
so maybe page equals one these are
actually being picked up on the server
side whether it's PHP or not it roughly
does the same thing so let's take a look
at a very basic example and then we'll
dive into something a little bit more
complicated so imagine you are running a
blog and you wanted to link to a
specific article now there are lots of
ways to do this but in this case if we
just go ahead and hit the index dot PHP
far directly what we could do is in the
query string so this is now called the
query string we're gonna pass through a
slug which is basically a unique string
given to a particular record and we're
gonna pass that in here so let's say we
have learn PHP and these are typically
separated by hyphens so at the moment
then when we have a slug like this we'd
want to maybe pick it up on the server
side look it up in our database and then
go ahead and show the record with this
particular slug now to pick this up in
PHP we basically use the get super
global and this looks a little bit odd
it's a dollar sign us we'd see a normal
variable we have an underscore and then
we have get here in capital letters
really important that this is capital so
if we go an echo out dollar underscore
get what would we do here well actually
I think it would be a good idea to do a
var dump on this since we've spoken
about the importance of dumping things
if we're not too sure what they contain
so let's do a var dump on this and see
what we get
so we can see here we've got an array
with one item we see slug which is of
course and this just in here and then we
have a string learn PHP so we know that
this is an array we know how to access
elements of an array either by a numeric
or associative key so we know how to do
this now of course we can have other
items in the URI as well so for example
to do this we use an ampersand and let's
say we were on page one I mean this
example doesn't make sense but this will
give you a good idea of what you can do
now we have an array with two items slug
and page so hopefully you can see where
this is going let's go ahead and just
output the slug here on the page so of
course to do this we would echo out
dollar underscore get and then in our
square brackets to access that array
item we would pick up the key under slug
so let's go ahead and do that
give this page a refresh and we see
learn PHP so it's really as easy as that
to pick things out of the URL so you
might be wondering how do we even get
these things into the URL in the first
place well what we can do is create
links in HTML which basically output
these things for the query string
remember earlier when we looked at loops
we generated a list of page numbers well
we can actually do that again now and we
can generate a link for each page and
display the one we're currently on so
let's look at a very practical example
of how we might do this now so we know
that when we have a loop to output a
list of page numbers and let's say we
have page one just by default maybe we
also have a search term here which is it
could be anything so let's just put
learn PHP in there for now and we have a
list of how many pages we have now
obviously this would be calculated in
terms of how many articles or how many
blog posts or how many topics there were
so really we're just kind of hard coding
this for now well let's take a look at
replacing this here and this here with
items from our query string so if we go
ahead and get rid of this and go ahead
and say well this is probably being
defined in the URL as search and this
here is probably being defined in the
URL
Paige so we now can pick these up from
the URL okay so now if I go ahead and
echo out and I'm just gonna echo out an
h3 tag here now normally what you would
do is you would put these in some kind
of template you wouldn't necessarily
echo out HTML but we'll take a look at
that later so in here there and we would
say searching for and then in here we
would have the search term now we know
that we can concatenate on that search
term variable like so and we can do the
same thing for what which page were on
so let's echo out P just here and we'll
say you are on page X and of course in
here we want to concatenate on the page
that we're currently on so let's play
around with this you'll notice and we'll
speak about this in a moment we don't
have anything in the query string we're
gonna see an undefined index and that's
because we're trying to access something
from that get super global array that
doesn't exist at the moment so let's
fill these in and we'll see this working
and then we'll go ahead and play around
with this so let's say we wanted to
search for learn PHP and let's say we
happen to be on page 1 let's go ahead
and do that and there we go so we're
searching for learn PHP and we are on
page 1 so now the idea is to go ahead
and generate a list of links here which
are the page numbers and then be able to
basically search but switch the page so
this is a very very useful example and
something you'll probably do quite often
so we know that to output a list of
links we initialize a variable inside of
a for loop and then we go ahead and we
say while I is less than or equal to the
amount of pages we have now we
calculated this value earlier but let's
just leave it at end to keep things
simple and then we went ahead and
incremented I now in here what we can do
is output an anchor so at HTML link and
then we can go ahead and output the page
just in here so in here we can
concatenate on that I variable now let's
take a look at this and you can see that
we've got pages 0 to 10 we actually need
to change this over to 1 that would make
a lot more sense there we go
so pages 1 to 10 when we click on each
of these we want this
to stay in the URL but we want the page
to change so all we need to do is build
up a new URL using the search term but
switching over that page number and we
know we have that available through I so
to do this then we would basically say
question mark search now what you can do
is give the full URL to the page that
you're working on so you could do the
following but typically if you're on the
same page this will just replace the
query string so search equals x so that
is the term that we need to fill in and
then we're gonna have and page equals
and we know that the page is going to be
that I variable so we can replace that
in as well for the search term we know
that's going to be the same so we just
want to replace this in again
concatenate on that search term here and
we're done so now what's going to happen
is when we come to this page we're on
page 1 but when I click on two we've
kept that term in there but now this is
switched over to two and you can see
that this has been updated as well so
it's the same for any of the pages that
we click on it just works all the way up
to 10 so from here then the important
thing is to check if things are actually
set we know that if we land on this page
by default we'll see a couple of errors
so how do we actually check if these
values are set or not well what we can
do here and let's just get rid of this
example just so we can start afresh
we're going to obviously create an if
statement because we need to do
something if this value is set so if the
search term is set we're gonna say is
set so pretty straightforward it reads
nicely and into this we pass and a list
of any things we need to check so in
this case we're just passing one in but
if you need to check others you can go
ahead and pass them in as well okay so
if the search term is set in the URL
then we want to create a variable called
search term this is optional but it's
always nice to create what we call a
local variable so we can use this then
we want to pull out search now down here
we can echo out that h3 that we did
before and then into this we can say
searching for and then we can
concatenate
on that search term variable like so so
now what's going to happen then is when
we run this if we don't have search in
the query string this block will not be
run so let's check it out and you see
nothing now though if we go ahead and we
say search say for learn PHP we do
actually see that in there so it's just
making sure we're sensible about
checking what is set and what isn't and
you do really need to make sure that you
check these since they are very easily
modified from the URL you'll be
surprised the amount of people that try
to change things in the URL when they
probably shouldn't and that's absolutely
fine there's nothing wrong with that
it's your job to protect against what
you do if things exist on our okay so
we're going to cover this in more detail
in the practical examples later but for
now what we're gonna look at is posting
at the moment we've already looked at a
get request to this page with all of the
things that we need in the URL now the
difference between get and post it
basically depends on the request type
when we have a get action or an HTTP GET
action we're basically just landing on a
page when we have a post action we are
perhaps submitting a form we're saying
that we want to post something through
we want to maybe create a user register
someone or do anything else so let's
take a look let's get rid of this
example here cuz we know how to check
things now and we're gonna go ahead and
build up a form and then we're gonna
post this through to a new page so for
this we're gonna kind of mock up a login
page and you could do the same for a
register page as well so into index.php
I'm actually gonna get rid of the PHP
tags because we don't need these in this
case and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
build up a very simple HTML document now
I have a kind of macro that allows me to
quickly do this but if you are following
along you're gonna want to copy this
down obviously this course doesn't cover
HTML but it's good that you try and
learn what this is essentially it's just
a document with a body where everything
goes so we can go ahead and output say a
paragraph in here and this would just be
a standard document now like so okay so
we're gonna build up a form we start out
a form with the form tag and we end it
with a form tag and in here we provide
things we provide the action which is
the page where we want to submit this
form through to so in our case we could
create a new file called sign in dot PHP
and as a second attribute we define the
method now in this case we are defining
the fact that we want to post this
through and we'll see the difference
between this in a minute if you're still
not too sure okay so I'm gonna build up
a label this is basically something that
identifies a form input and I'm gonna
say that this is for the username and
I'm gonna play some text in here that
the user will see and down here I'm
gonna create an input and this is going
to be the type of text so this is just
standard forms that you would see on any
page the name here is username and we're
gonna give this an ID as well this is
important because if the user clicks the
label it will automatically focus on
this input okay so now that we've done
this let's go down and we can pretty
much copy and paste this for the
password it's very similar so let's do
this and we'll change this over to
password and we'll change this to
password as well and of course the type
now is a password so it's blanked out in
the browser and the name for this is
password and the ID again is password
now just a note about the name this is
very important because when we submit
this through anything that the users
entered in these two inputs will be sent
through to our page so if we just take a
quick sneak peek of this you can see
that we've got filled in here that we
can enter some details in and we've got
a password as well that we can enter too
alright so now we just need a button so
we're gonna create a button here and
this is going to have a type of submit
like so and into this we just say
something like sign in pretty
straightforward give that a refresh and
what we can now do if we just get rid of
this query string in the URL because we
don't need that is click sign in and
that will go through to sign in dot PHP
now at the moment this doesn't exist we
need to create this and because we've
posted things through to that page or
that file we can pick up the name or the
username and the password
in that new file so hopefully that makes
sense if you're new to HTML just take a
moment to copy this down
if you are following along but what I'm
gonna do now is create that sign in dot
PHP file that we are posting through to
okay so let's create this so a new file
here we're gonna call this sign in dot
PHP and in here this will be a PHP file
so in here now we know that before we
did things like echo get and then say
username now in this case it won't work
so let's just do a var dump on dollar
underscore get and see what we see
when we post this through so I'm going
to go ahead and enter Alex and just any
old password hits sign in and you can
see we have an empty array that's
because if you look in the query string
there's nothing in here if I were to add
a username in here notice that it does
appear however what's happening is
because we're using a post method this
is being sent through with a request
body not in the URI you wouldn't want to
submit this kind of form as a get
request and have the username and
password in the URI you want it sent
with the body so let's check this out
and let's change this over to dollar
underscore post and see what we get so
again let's just fill this out and click
sign in and there we go so we now have
Alex and I happen to enter the password
as password but of course this will be
whatever the user has entered so now
that we have this then we can echo out
dollar underscore post this time and we
can enter username here to echo the
username out so if we just resubmit this
form we see the following and we can do
the same with the password as well so
let's just go and echo this on with a
break just so we can see it nicely and
we'll switch this over to password so
let's come over submit this form again
and we should see that username and
password just in there so what would
happen after this then is we would
subsequently look up the username in our
database and then we would check if the
password matches now there are a couple
of things around this because what we do
want to do is make sure that we check a
hashed password but really this is
beyond the scope of this basics course
okay so now that we've learned about
this you should be able to submit forms
using PHP
and pick up the values either if you
have something in the query string which
is more for things like search terms and
page numbers or if you want to pick them
up using the post superglobal which is
more for forms that you use to register
users sign users in and do anything like
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
