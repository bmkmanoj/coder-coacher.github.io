setting up a cloud server from start to
finish so you can start developing on it
in this case we're going to be looking
at setting up a server with a lamp stack
so that's Apache the web server mysql
the database and PHP the programming
language all on a linux OS now we'll be
using digitalocean as it's super easy to
get started with straightaway and we use
this to starve droplets which are
basically Virtual Private servers and
they're a blank canvas that you can
start to install other software you need
on from here we'll go on to install
everything we need and this isn't like
traditional hosting so you won't get a
control panel or anything like that
everything will be done here right by
the command line
don't worry though when you're uploading
your files we can them using SFTP so
there are massive advantages to setting
up a server like this including complete
control over your server the ability to
update PHP for example if you need to
update to the latest version and
digitalocean
also charges per hour so you're not tied
into any commitments and it's great for
experimenting with any new technologies
as well like if you need to set up and
nodejs server or something like that now
we'll go ahead and end the series with
some security considerations so you can
keep each job that you create secure so
let's go ahead and look at how we create
a new droplet so we can start working on
setting up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
