really straightforward and one of the
main reasons for this is that when we
use upload care we upload an image we
generate a hash to represent an image
that we upload and then we store the
upload care URL now from this upload
care URL we can go ahead and resize an
image we can add filters to our image we
can do whatever we want but of course
we'll look at that a little bit later
let's get the schema set up here so I
already have a database created called
awesome image bar I want to create a
table within this database and I'm just
going to call that images so the
software that I use has already created
an auto incrementing ID this is an
integer has a length of 11 but you can
reduce this it's unsigned it's the
primary key and most importantly it's an
auto increment so now we can start to
add the other things that we need so we
have a hash which we're going to be
randomly generating and we want to not
allow null for this now the same for the
URL this is a varchar' of 255 and again
we don't want to allow null this is
going to be the upload care URL now
optionally what you can do is store the
created update what this will allow us
to do is just see when an image has been
uploaded so you might find that this is
useful so now that we have this done
what we don't want to do is be messing
around with arrays of data what we want
to do is create an image model to
represent each row of our database so
what we're gonna be doing in this part
we're going to be setting up our model
which is really straightforward we're
going to be installing doctrine DeBell
which is a database abstraction layer
for PDO sounds complicated but trust me
it's very straightforward and we're
gonna be just testing pulling back a
couple of records so first of all go
ahead and just create a couple of
records in here so it doesn't really
matter what we do so we can just say de
F here as long as we have a couple to
play with we can see and get this all
working so the first thing to do then is
install D bar and this is basically an
abstraction layer
P do if you've worked with P do this
will be very familiar for you it just
means that it works a little bit better
and it's a little bit easier to work
with so we can pull this in using
composer so we say doctrine D Bell and
we go ahead and install that and now
that's done again Silex will give us a
service provider for this so we can load
it in we can pass in all of our settings
and we can start to use this within our
routes and everything works nice and
well so we are going to register this
then and they say new selects provider
and it's our doctrine service provider
and into here we can pass in our
database options so DB
options and inside of this array we just
give things like the driver the host and
all of that good stuff so for the driver
then I'm using MySQL so for me this is
going to be PDO mysql and the host is
more than likely either localhost or
127.0.0.1 in just go ahead and enter
that in there and a username and a
password of course mine is root and root
so I can just add these in there and
last but not least we just have a
character encoding for this which I'm
going to set to utf-8 so that is pretty
much it we're connected up to our
database we can start querying now so we
can test this out by think first of all
let's just create our model so the
reason that we're doing this is because
when we pull back records we might want
to implement some other methods to be
able to do things with the race that we
have if you work with PDO before and you
fetched objects or fetched rows as a
class you will know exactly what this
does but if you don't don't worry or of
course we're running through how this
works
so I have created then an models
directory with an hour
and inside of here I'm going to create
my image class so this is just image dot
PHP now of course because we're using
PSR for Auto loading we want to use our
vendor namespace which is represented by
our app directory and of course we are
going into models and we just have a
class called image and that is all we
are going to be doing for this series so
let's pull back some records and
represent them by this class and if you
want to add any methods in here you can
go ahead and do that later on if you
scale this up so let's test things out
then inside of here how do we perform a
query or more importantly how do we
perform a prepared statement that's what
we're most interested in here so we
create a variable say images to access
our database we say app DB much like we
did with app twig and then we just use
methods that we would normally find on
PDO like prepare so in here we want to
select all columns from the images table
now of course we're using a prepared
statement and we don't really need to be
doing this but it's good practice just
to go ahead and create the prepared
statements just in case you pass any
data in and of course when we store our
images we will be passing data in so
we'll definitely be using a prepared
statement so now that we've run this
prepared statement we can go ahead and
fetch all of these images and to do this
we just say images fetch all and I'm
just overwriting this variable here and
we choose the type that we want to fetch
your back by so this is going to be P do
fetch class and inside of here we
provide the string the full name space
to our model or our class so in this
case it's a I models image and then we
use class to grab the full name space as
a string so what we can do now is just
kill this here do a var dump on images
and we should see two records
represented by that model and we do so
we've got an array with two items the
first one here is an image object we
have the ID
the URL on the created update from our
database and we have another one here as
well that's the de f1 that we created so
now that we know that we have all this
set up we can go ahead and get rid of
this
it still works as normal we can leave
this in here because we are going to be
doing this a little bit later on but we
won't touch this until we've actually
started to store images so we can get
rid of these two records in our database
we don't need these and we have now set
up our database we've created our model
we've tested that everything works and
we can move on to pulling up load care
to get ready to actually start to upload
images</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
