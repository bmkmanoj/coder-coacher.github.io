create a real-time chat application
using nodejs
socket IO and MongoDB is our database
solution we're going to be doing this
all front-end and then just using no
just to handle the actual requests to
the server to store the data and then
obviously relay that on to other clients
we'll push that on to other clients
don't worry if you've not worked with
nodejs before sake I or even MongoDB
will be going through you know how we're
actually going to make all these
interact to make this chat application
work and as you can see you can enter a
name up here but this is obviously
customizable you could change this to
actually work with say logged in user on
your website so this this will work
perfectly with an existing solution as
long as you just carefully integrate it
you know follow along and understand how
this all works so at the moment I don't
have my MongoDB server running all my no
js' server running so I'm going to go
ahead and just hit enter on here and
you'll just see we get a failed to
connect message so this sort of
gracefully you know that's the user know
that we they can collect connect so the
first thing I'm going to do is go ahead
and open or run my MongoDB database so I
just type Mongo D like this and that's
going to go ahead and run or you know
start my database and what we can then
do is go ahead and a separate window run
now no GS server so you can see socket
IO started that's what we're using to as
a node module to accept connections
we're going to do that on the web side
of things as well so now that we've got
that working let's go ahead and just
refresh both of these windows you can
see that we don't get the message as we
had before and you can see that just
here we've got a little bit of
information here that's you know come
through from no Jeff so we can sort of
monitor what's going on in this end as
well so we're now going to test just
actually passing messages from client to
client so I'm going to go ahead and into
two different names here and obviously
as we've said or straight Vili as we've
said this isn't highly customizable you
can use this with already logged in
users so I'm just going to type hello
you'll see that both instantly show this
this message if I was Billy and I was
going to say hello the
this would again just instantly appear
regardless of whether you know you are
on the same machine or you're on a
machine you know miles away the late you
will get a tiny bit of latency but the
speed of this because we're using
WebSockets nodejs to serve this content
it's very very very quick there's no
Ajax polling or anything like that
unless socket IO is full falling back to
this so basically this is how the chat
works we're going to start by you know
building out the design and then we're
going to start by actually you know
writing JavaScript there's no library
dependencies here we're going to do
everything using vanilla JavaScript so
no jQuery or anything like that the only
dependencies we obviously have is the
ability to include socket IO the library
so we can actually use it to connect to
our no js' server so that's basically
what the chat looks like and in the next
video we'll be going ahead and actually
designing this out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
