gonna be creating a typewriter effect in
JavaScript with the help of jQuery now
I'm gonna go ahead and start straight
into this and by creating my HTML
document I'm gonna include my head as I
usually would and the body as I usually
would
so you set up a pretty standard HTML
document now the next thing we of them
do is create a script type we're going
to include our jQuery file now this is
downloadable from jQuery comm you can
include the Euro but I'm just gonna say
jQuery j/s sorry
that's my source I'm gonna include
jQuery GIS and just because I have it
saved on my computer now the type is
text a forward slash JavaScript okay so
what that's done is it including the
jQuery file so we can use that the next
thing when I'm going to do is say script
type equals text JavaScript and create a
little area where we can code everything
out hit in here to allow us to work and
put each character in into the body of
our document now I'm going to create a
div and that's going to have the ID of
box I'm going to call it box I'm going
to end my div there now we don't need to
enter any text into here at all
our functions up here in the in this
area are going to deal with that
so the first thing I'm going to do is
create a few variables and the first one
is going to be text and that's going to
equal absolutely nothing the next one is
going to be count and this is an integer
so that's going to equal nothing as well
for now and var max speed when she's
gonna equal 200 and set a max speed for
our character appending each character
over of a string and into our div okay
so the next thing we want to do is set
up the document as it's ready so we're
gonna say document dot ready and inside
here we're gonna say function now inside
this block here is where everything is
going to go so I'm just gonna pop my
semicolon on the end of there and then
pull this down a bit so we can enter all
of our code in here okay so now what
we're going to do is when a crate
there's three functions in total for our
entire program
the first one is character and then
we're having type in the moment a third
function that's going to set out text
which is blank at the moment and then
it's going to initiate our type function
so you'll see how everything will come
together as we do it now the first thing
we're gonna do is create our function
called type and this is the main
function that types our text for us and
puts it into our div now the first thing
we need to do is create a random number
and the reason for this is the text as
it's being displayed we're not going to
display it at the same speed we're going
to do it at a different speed so it's
going to look like it's been typed out
by someone and to do this within a
random character which is going to be
interpreted as the amount of
milliseconds that I'm displayed so math
dot random I'm gonna times that by max
speed so basically this is the maximum
number that's going to be generated so
the maximum amount of milliseconds
they're going to be generated and what
gonna do is because this value is going
to about not being an integer value
we're going to use math.floor
and what this is gonna do is it's gonna
round it down to the nearest integer
okay so the next thing we want to do is
to use the sets timeout function and
this is here is the function name
so we've matching the function name
inside and that's going to be random so
it's saying a random speed if let's say
that was a thousand that would mean that
this function would repeat itself every
one second
same with a hundred that would be a
tenth of a second but we want to add a
random value which is taken obviously
from here now the next thing to do is
append a character to our box now
eventually this is going to be each
character hours of our string but for
now I'm just gonna append so we're
saying box so we're taking our box value
and I'm appending oh sorry not our box
value and we're taking out div and we're
dot append so it appending my character
on so I'm gonna say I I'm gonna come
down here I'm gonna type the type no
it's gonna initiate this function or
call this function and that's refresh
you can see that what it's doing is it's
constantly appending a value but you can
see that the speed isn't consistent
because the random number generator is
generating how quick it should do each
character so you can see at some point
it's going really fast and then other
points it's going really slight so let's
just get rid of this and refresh the
page just so it doesn't carry on
appending that okay so the next thing we
want to do is we need to say count plus
plus this is the integer we stopped here
now the reason we're doing this is in a
minute we're going to create a function
called character and then we're going to
call that function inside append and
what this what this function is going to
do is it's going to allow us to select a
specific character from string so let's
go ahead and create that
okay
so function character now we need three
parameters here we need start and and
text now start is the the position in
which we want to start at to grab a
select amount of characters and end is
where we want to end this so let's just
say we had the text appear to be Academy
if I wanted to grab say just PHP
remember we start at 0 I would say the
start would be 0 and the end would be 2
so 0 1 2 that selects PHP obviously we
only want to select an individual
character at once so this is always
going to be end is always going to be +1
to start so if I wanted to select the
character the next character I this
would be 0 1 2 3 so this is 3 and would
end that at 4 so it would be between 3 &amp;amp;
4 so it would just select character I so
this will all make sense in a minute if
it doesn't already so our function
character what we want to do is we all
we want to do is it's just one line we
want to return text dot substring
start/end so the text entered here is
what we're applying this method to and
this method is saying start between
start and end take the substring of this
so pretty straightforward
let's just say we said document dot
write character and then we said so
we're testing our function start is zero
and this one and text is PHP it's
refresh we're just given the character P
if we wanted to say character 1 to 2
this should give us H there you go so we
know that that works now we can just get
rid of this line bring this up a bit
okay so everything's working so what do
we want to append we want to append our
text up here so at the moment I'm just
going to set this to PHP academy' now
what I'm going to do is come down and I
am going to put what we need to append
so we need to append each character of
this in turn so PHP then AC ad e and Y
so we're going to use the character
function now what do we put inside here
we need to start value and end value in
the text now the text is pretty simple
so we need to start and a text text is
obviously just going to be text because
that's the value up here so we're taking
this value and it's been put into our
function which is then being fed back
into here and then we're using this this
is here so the start is going to be
count the reason for this is it starts
at 0 the end is going to be count plus 1
the reason for this is if you think back
to just a second ago when I put 0 + 1
and then 1 + 2 and we took p + H you can
see we're just adding 1 to the selection
here between start and end
so let's give this a test type and see
what happens
okay so we've written out PHP academy'
we've got a random speed so everything
seems to be working now we want what we
want to do is give the user the option
to change this text value on the fly as
they're calling this function so we're
going to create a new function called
type it and I'm gonna allow the user now
to set the text in this when as they
call the function and then display and
then display it in the typewriter
fashion so we need a parameter in here
I'm going to call it punch
the reason I called it that is just
what's going to be punched into the
keyboard what what's going to look like
being punched into the keyboard may be
silly but it made sense to me so we want
to say text equals punch and then we
want to say type now this is quite
simple what it does is we let's come
down here we call the function you say
type here and we say PHP academy' watch
listen learn now what this does is it
takes this here it comes up this is this
is punch punch punch equals PHP academy'
watch listen and learn now we set text
up here to what punch equals which is
PHP academy' watch this and learn then
we just call the type function the type
function comes down we set the random we
set the timeout and then we append the
character of text which now equals what
punch equals so we're just coming in and
we're setting a global variable if you
like so let's test that it should
display now this text
okay there you go so what we've done
here is we've created a typewriter or
typing effect using some random
characters to give it a bit more
lifelike properties so I hope you
enjoyed this tutorial if you're stuck
we'll don't understand anything please
