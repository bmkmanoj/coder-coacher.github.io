really cool effect that's actually
pretty simple to do basically we're
going to start off with an image in this
case it's just a circular image I've
just given it a border radius I'll be
looking at that if you don't know how to
do this and then when we hover over this
we actually get a gradual change from
black and white to color now I'm only
using one image here I'm using a full
color image so what we're actually doing
is we're going to be using CSS filter
and we're going to be using the
grayscale on that and changing the
grayscale with a CSS transition so we'll
link quite a few things here it's very
very basic but we'll look at how to
implement this and before we start
there's also what works across browsers
as well
any one this isn't working for with
Firefox but in this case we just get a
full back to a full color image so you
can see opera here works as well so
you've got support for this in a good
support fit in browsers so let's go
ahead and build this effect okay so to
start off we've got a basic document
just out here we've got a stylesheet
linked in which is our global dot CSS
star see there's nothing here we're
going to be doing this from scratch
we've got a container here with a class
of profile so this really depends on how
you want to lay things out you could
create this class as a reusable class
you could call it something like black
and white to color or something like
that but inside of here we've got an
image linked in from my image directory
which is just profile PNG so you only
need one color image for this at the
moment we get this effect here there's
nothing really much to it we just get a
square image so let's go ahead and and
start to build this effect up so if
you've not really got this code laid out
go ahead and create a basic document
with everything we need so in global dot
CSS what do we want to do I'm going to
target the profile element I'm going to
toggle the image within that
now what we also want to do is apply the
filter CSS property and we want to use
the grayscale function to change this
from a value from zero percent which
would be obviously full color to 100%
which would be a hundred percent
grayscale so we use the filter property
and we say gray scale and then we say a
hundred percent now we're also going to
look at vendor prefixes because inside
are on can I use which is a really good
resource for things like this you can
see at the moment we are lacking support
from ie and Firefox which we saw a
moment ago but for browsers like Chrome
Safari Opera and a variety of other
browsers particularly mobile we can use
the WebKit vendor prefix so that's
that's really cool so let's go ahead and
implement this and if we just go down
here we duplicate this line and all we
need to do is stick the vendor prefix on
the front that will just ensure that
this works up until there's full support
for this filter property so now we've
done that let's take a look at what we
need to do when we hover over the image
so I'm going to say profile image and
then I'm going to say when we hover over
now in this case we just want to change
this to color so oh we haven't previewed
this so let's just preview this now we
can see it's grayscale so you've now got
a image that's effective if you just
turn greyscale and when we hover we want
to just do exactly the same thing but
the opposite side we say grayscale zero
we don't need to provide a percent sign
here because it's a zero value it's just
an extra character you don't need really
so now let's implement the WebKit
version of this there we are and we're
done so now what's going to happen when
we hover you can see that we now get
this color effect now you could stop
there really you could just say oh
that's all I want but we're going to add
a transition onto this so again under
the original selector for the image we
want to add a transition now I've also
got can I use open for transitions you
can see that we've got
basically at the moment very very good
support for this we do need WebKit
vendor prefix for blackberry browser you
don't really have to implement the
vendor prefix here in this case but if
you want to support so older versions of
Firefox or older versions of of Chrome
Safari anything that uses WebKit feel
free to I'm going to actually do this
just for the sake of the video so for
the transition we need to list a little
bit difficult because what we need to do
is we need to specify the transition for
the filter so we're going to say filter
and then we're going to choose the speed
in this case 600 milliseconds or you
could do 0.6 seconds or you think new
point 6 seconds like that so 600
milliseconds and then we want to choose
the type in this case it's ease now what
we also want to do is we want to provide
a WebKit version of this transition for
WebKit filter there we are so now that
we've done that that's now going to take
into account that when we hover over
this image the filter property changes
and therefore it will transition it so
let's take a look at how this looks and
there we go so when we hover over you
can see that gradually changes from
grayscale to fill color and that's how
we implement a CSS grayscale to color
