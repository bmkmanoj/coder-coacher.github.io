before you actually start connecting to
the Twitter API is actually create an
app and what this allows you to do is
identify yourself to your users you
can't just anonymously ask for access it
has to be tied down to a specific
application so if you head over to App
Store twister comm and that's the URL at
present it might may change so Google
Google for Twitter apps and you'll find
this page here once you're signed in I'm
going to go ahead and create a new app
it's fairly straightforward we just
provide the details that we need here so
the first one is going to be the name of
the app that's fairly straightforward
the next is going to be a description so
you can literally just write whatever
you want in here for the website that is
obviously you know the website that you
want to provide in this case I'm just
going to do I'd know let's just say PHP
academy' org okay so with a callback URL
this is a little bit more tricky we're
going to have to provide a callback URL
that's the same as the environment that
we're working on and if this is if
you're working on production then this
goes live you'll need to change this at
the moment I am asking localhost as
local dev because at present Twitter
doesn't allow localhost but it
invalidate sloka host as a URL so if I
were to type in let's say I'll bet in
there if I were to do localhost this
will actually be an invalid URL in
Twitter's eyes which is a little bit
silly but all I've done is I've head
over to my hosts file and I've mapped
local dev to localhost or 127.0.0.1 and
this is going to be our callback URL
index isn't going to be our callback
it's going to be call back dot PHP so
once you've got this sort of working
this is going to need to be the path it
can be a local path it doesn't have to
be accessed but maybe I should talk a
little bit about what this actually is
so when we authenticate with Twitter it
needs to know that it's coming from the
origin where we
generated the link where we click sign
in and it also needs to know where to
redirect once the user has said you know
I'm going to allow this app to access
all my information so you need this
callback URL to be a valid page on your
on your server and what this is going to
do is going to read the token that's
sent back and that's going to then easy
sort of you know authorization otherwise
anyone could just authorize with it so
we are using local dev tutorials Twitter
auth and callback dot PHP so we'll be
creating this far later that's going to
handle the callback so once you've done
that please go ahead and read the
developer rules here make sure you
understand them and hit yes I agree and
create your Twitter application now once
that's done that will create your app
for you and there we are successfully
created now you're going to need the API
keys tab here this is going to give you
your API key your API secret which
should not be publicly accessible
publicly readable at all you can change
the access level and you've got owner
and owner ID which really we don't need
to worry about too much for now so
you've got your API key
you've got your API secret and you know
your callback URL so from this we can
start to actually connect to Twitter's
API</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
