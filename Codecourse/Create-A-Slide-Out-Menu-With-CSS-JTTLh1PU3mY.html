building a slide-out menu with CSS we're
gonna take a quick look at how this
works and then we'll dive straight into
the code and build this up in it's
highly from scratch so we're not using
pure CSS here we're using JavaScript
just to trigger class on our menu which
is going to use CSS transitions to slide
this out you can see here I've got a
page with quite a bit of content on you
can see that this stays in a fixed
position when we click this we get a
slide-out menu we have our content here
so you can add whatever you want in here
and if you noticed this arrow change
this is also controlled with CSS as well
so you can modify this to look how you
want you can position things how you
want you can change the speed of the
transition obviously you can change
aesthetic things like the colors and the
sizes but generally we're just going to
look at how we can do this all we're
doing in terms of JavaScript like I said
is just triggering a class on here which
is going to force this to pop out with
CSS transitions so with that done let's
look straight into the code and start to
build this up so for our index page
we're not starting entirely from scratch
I've already set up a few things here
just to make this a little bit easier
we've got our basic document layout we
have a stylesheet linked in app dot CSS
which is living in this CSS directory
it's currently blank we have app dot Jes
as well which is linked in at the bottom
here that's where we're going to be
writing our JavaScript and we have our
meta viewport tag here which is going to
assist the scaling on smaller devices or
larger devices but basically this is
just a responsive part of this so we're
going to start then by just adding in a
wrapper on our page and that's going to
contain some content just so we can see
how this sits with content on the page
so I'm going to create a div here with a
class of wrapper and this is where all
of our page content is going to go you
can chop and change this around and use
different class names but I'm just
call it rapper for now and I'm gonna
have a paragraph in here with some lorem
ipsum it's um in I'm just using a jet
generator to do this but go ahead and
just pause the video and take some time
to add your own content in so I'm just
gonna do quite a bit of text in here
that should be enough so let's go ahead
and check this out
cool yeah that should be okay in fact
let's just add one more paragraph down
here like that just to make sure okay so
the next thing to do then is we want to
go ahead and style our rapper give
ourselves a nice font on the body just
so it looks a little bit neater so we're
gonna head over to app dot CSS which
remember is already linked in let's go
ahead and go ahead and apply some stars
on the body so I'm going to give this
font of 1 in we're gonna choose
Helvetica that's the fun and we have a
sans-serif fallback here like so
sans-serif so for our line height this
is entirely optional 1.4 that's just
gonna space out now takes it a little
bit nicer and we're gonna choose the
font weight for everything that's 200 so
that gives us the following
so looks a little bit nicer now let's go
ahead and just style out our wrapper and
we'll see why we're doing this in a
moment we're gonna give a margin left on
this of 50 pixels and that's going to
give us enough room just to have our
little button here that's going going to
trigger our menu coming out so let's
start on the mark-up for the navigation
now we're gonna have an html5 nav
element and we're gonna give this a
class of nav side so we can target that
and then we're gonna have some side
content in here and then within this
we're gonna have an anchor which is
gonna be our toggle so we'll just buy a
hash for the href and we'll give this a
class of nav toggle and then in here
we're not actually going to place any
text we're going to control this using a
CSS pseudo element and that's going to
be able to allow us to set the content
and then we can change that arrow
direction when we toggle and untuck all
the navigation so this is all we need
for our navigation obviously within here
you can go ahead and place all of your
content but obviously at the moment it
just looks like this it doesn't look
like much so we'll go and inspect this
just so we can take a look at it along
the way so we've got this as our wrapper
and then we've got our toggle inside
which we're going style as well so
everyone app dot CSS again then we are
going to style up our nav side so the
first thing we want to do is set the
positioning of this and that we a fixed
position so won't move as these are
Scrolls down the page we want this to be
zero pixels on the Left will just zero
on the left we want this to be zero on
the top we want a high of 100% and we
want a width of a hundred percent and
then we want to give this a max width of
250 pixels like so so let's just give
this a background color now and we'll
choose cornflower blue that's a nice
blue color and just see what this is
done so you can see here it's just
acting as a normal menu we've got a
hundred percent of the height
we've got the width that we defined
we've got the content still inside of
here but it's still not looking great
this is the sort of toggled out state so
this was what it would look like when
the user clicks that button and it's out
now we want to apply a few more styles
here we want to change the box sizing to
border box the reason for this is we're
going to give it a little bit of padding
um adorn that to just the actual width
of the container you can go ahead and
just calculate these but I'm going to do
that for now and that just allows us to
have that without pushing this out
anymore
and we want to go ahead and just set a
color in here so we'll just set that to
white and we will go ahead and just for
now we'll say margin left - 250 pixels
but I'm going to comment that out all
that's going to do is it will hide the
menu but if we set a negative margin
it's going to push this away and we're
not going to see
anymore so if we were to just uncomment
this you'll see that that just gets rid
of it I want to bring this I want to
comment this out again just so I can see
it so we can style our toggle so this is
our navitor here which we can't see at
the moment so let's go ahead and start
this up so there nav toggle and this is
going to be a position of absolute so we
can place it where we want within this
nav side container we're going to have a
right here of minus 40 pixels and the
top of 0 and now let's go ahead and give
this a width and height just so we can
see this so well then I say 40 pixels
width and 40 pixels height you can
obviously go ahead and just adjust this
if you want and what we'll do now is
just give this a background color so we
can see it and again we'll choose
cornflower blue to match the actual
navigation but again you can change this
color or do what you want this so we've
got this sort of square here now and we
can go ahead and do things like add our
arrow so what we're gonna do then is
we're going to say nav toggle I'm gonna
have a before pseudo-element
and this is going to allow us to add
some content and of course here what you
could do is for the navigable you could
have an image or you could have some
text and you can change that with
JavaScript or CSS if it was some kind of
background image but for now for the
content I'm gonna add in an arrow so you
have an escaped entity here and this
will basically place in an arrow like
that so it's not looking greater than my
room but we can go ahead and adjust that
so inside of here then I'm going to set
the font weight to 600 and I'm gonna set
the color to white and then in here we
can go ahead and say things like line
height 40 pixels that's gonna go ahead
and place that in the center we can go
ahead and remove the text decoration so
that will remove that underlying just
there and then we can go ahead and do a
text-align:center
so obviously that will Center that arrow
there so we're looking pretty good
already so the next thing I want to do
is go ahead and add a little bit of a
border radius on this button so we can
say border bottom right radius and we
can set that to 3 pixels so if we just
check that out that's gone ahead and
just given that a little bit of a radius
round there so it looks a little bit
nicer and overall on the navigation I
want to give this a shadow but I'm not
going to apply the shadow to the
navigation side just yet I'm gonna do
that when it's toggled out because if we
apply a shadow to it when it's in we'll
be able to see that on the edge of the
screen so for then I've toggle then for
that toggle button let's give that an a
shadow of 1 pixel on the x-axis 0 on the
Y we'll give it a 3 pixel spread and we
use rgba to give this a black color and
we'll say point 1 in the Alpha Channel
so when we refresh it's barely visible
but you can see that little shadow just
on here and you can obviously play
around with it and make it look a lot
better so we're at the point now where
we've styled our navigation we've got it
looking how we want but we want it in a
state where it's collapsed initially we
don't want it to be out like this when
the user lands on the page so how do we
go ahead and do this well the first
thing we do is we bring back the margin
left of minus 250 pixels that's going to
go ahead and get rid of that this is
still visible obviously because this is
40 pixels wide the main navigation is
250 wide so pulling that in we can still
see this and our goal then is to be able
to click onto this and then this scroll
out so we're only gonna be using
JavaScript to actually add a class to
this nav side nav element and it's going
to be called nav open so we're going to
manually do this now and then we'll use
JavaScript to toggle it later and then
we'll be able to see our transition work
as well remember within CSS transitions
so navin has no effect at the moment
because we
have no class attached to it but we can
go ahead and add this down here so we
can say nav side if that also has a
class of nav open so that's our selector
we're gonna set the margin left to zero
so now you'll see that pop out if we go
ahead and get rid of this within our
developer tools it goes back in so it's
already working to some extent and what
we're gonna do is when that navigation
is open we're going to give that a box
shadow as well remember we don't the Box
shadow in its in because we're still
going to see that at the very left of
the page so we'll say one pixel one
pixel three pixels and we use our GPA to
create a black value with a point one
out for channel and again you can see
that slight shadow there now so again
play around with this and feel free to
design how you want so we need to now
deal with the fact that the arrow even
when it's closed or rather when it opens
it's still pointing this way we want
this to go back the other way so we can
obviously control this with CSS because
we are using the before pseudo element
so we can say nav side with a class of
nav open we want to style nav toggle
within this and we want to change the
before pseudo element and all we want to
do in here then you just go ahead and
add a different escaped unicode
character so that's two one nine zero so
two one nine two is the outwards arrow
two one nine zero is the inward arrow so
now you can see that change when we go
ahead and get rid of this class we see
the art word error so there we are so
this is all good but we want to go ahead
and implement the JavaScript toggle now
and then what we want to do is a look at
transitions on our nav side so it will
get a nice CSS transition when we do
toggle the class so for the JavaScript
side of things then I'm going to be
using jQuery and I'm going to be pulling
this down
from Google hosted libraries but you
feel free to use whichever library or
just use raw JavaScript to do this I'm
just using jQuery just because it's just
gonna be a lot easier and quicker but go
ahead and use whichever solution you
want so I'm going to pull down version
2.1 point 4 of jquery and i'm gonna
place this in my page just here so let's
go ahead and create a script element
with a source attribute and paste that
in and remember down here we have j s
slash apt is linked in so I can go ahead
and write any JavaScript I need in here
to deal with this and this is pretty
straightforward
and again whichever solution you're
using go ahead and use that whatever is
best for you
so our selector here is going to be
within nab side the naviga element and
we want to attach an event handler here
so we won't say that when this is
clicked will we want to run this
callback so in here then we want to go
ahead and toggle that now the open class
on here so let's get rid of this
initially and let's go ahead and just
refresh our page so this is in and then
we can see in action when we actually
get this javascript complete so the one
thing that we don't want this to do is
we don't want when a user's halfway down
the page when they click on this notice
that that will automatically jump to the
top of the page because we have our href
attribute set to a hash so what we want
to do in here then is as an argument for
this callback we want to have E and then
we're going to prevent the default
behavior so we use the prevent default
method on that event object so now when
we refresh and we scroll down and I
click this nothing happens so I'm
clicking this at the moment and we're
not taking up to the top of the page
that's not a good idea for you for your
user experience so now to toggle this
nav open class this is extremely easy
with jQuery which is why I pick this for
this particular example we're saying
this which at the moment represents this
nav toggle which
it's here and then I'm using the parent
method which is going to go ahead and
get the parent to this so be careful
with any extra markup you add in here
the direct parents this is nav side
which is what we want to toggle the
class on so this is absolutely fine but
go ahead and adjust this depending on
either which library you're using or how
your markup is structured so I'm then
going to use the toggle class method so
we're now toggling the class on this nav
side element and I'm gonna go ahead and
toggle the nav open class and all toggle
class means is add it the first time or
remove it the first time and then just
keep cycling so I'll add remove and
remove so if we keep an eye inside of
our elements tab on our croco within
chrome developer tools we'll be able to
see this so when I click this you can
see it adds that class there when I
click this again it toggles it again so
it removes that class so we're
controlling the display of this with CSS
all we're doing with javascript is
toggling that class which is allowing us
to do that and this is a much better
solution than using dot show or using
anything within jQuery or any other
library to set CSS properties it's much
better to have the class there already
so we have a working solution but we're
going to go ahead and improve this with
CSS transitions so let's close off that
we don't need that anymore and under the
nav side we want us to find the
transition that we want to happen which
property we want it to happen on the
speed and also the transition type as
well so this is really easy we just use
transition the non vendor prefix
properties supported by most browsers
now so I'm not going to include the
vendor prefixes but if you are
supporting very very old browsers you
can go ahead and do that so we're
transitioning on the margin property
remember we are changing the margin left
which is minus 250 to 0 when we actually
toggle it open so that's what we're
transitioning on you can say all but
there's not much point here because
that's the only thing that we're
interested in then we have the speed so
again you can adjust this too
which have a speed you want and then we
have the transition time and ease in out
is quite a nice one here we can do
things like ease in or you can have a
linear transition type as well so I'm
gonna pick ease in out so what's gonna
happen here then is when we talk about
class our margin property will change
because we have our transition defined
here that's going to go ahead and
transition going from minus 250 to 0
which remember is just showing our
element so when I click this now you can
see that slides out when I click it
again it slides back in so there we are
we have a nice left-hand slide out menu
mainly built with CSS but just using
javascript to toggle that class which
allows us to show and hide our menu</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
