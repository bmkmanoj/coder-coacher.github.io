at searching records using the like
claws and we're going to do this with
name in description now Ben why these
aren't full-text searches so these are
going to be extremely slow if you want
to do fast searching you should probably
use an indexer something like Sphinx for
PHP therefore well various languages but
basically we're going to use the like
claws just to pick out record that
matches something and bear in mind that
with lots of Records this is incredibly
slow but it's good to know that it's
there and especially with full-text
searches if you go ahead and look that
up it's beyond the scope of this
tutorial but you know that's something
that you could bear in mind anyway let's
take a look at the syntax so I'm going
to select everything so select start
from articles and in this case we're
going to say we're so we're still using
the where clause and we're going to say
we're a specific field is like something
so i'm going to say where name like and
then i'm going to give a just say like a
string value so let's say for example we
say MySQL now this is actually going to
return nothing because nothing is like
MySQL as in terms of that string if I
was to say where is like working with my
SQL that returns this record now that
might seem pretty pointless because what
we could have done is we could have said
where name equals work in mysql and the
difference between like claws that we
have here is that what we can actually
do is we can provide percentage signs to
actually do searches so for example i'm
going to say mysql and i'm going to put
a percentage sign in the front of this
now what this means is where where the
name column or any data in the name
column end in mysql and we know that
working with mysql ends in mysql so this
is basically saying you know anything in
front of this doesn't matter it must end
in MySQL we can do exactly the same
thing and we can say we must start with
MySQL in this case we've got an empty
set
but if we were to say working with we
know that we have a record called
working with MySQL we can do it exactly
the same thing without other record
let's just select all and let's go back
to this so we can say where it starts
with introduction and we get
introduction to PHP now what if we want
to actually search for say one keyword
or us or a small key word or a small
little search term well we can use two
percentage signs to say well anything
can be on the left and anything can be
on the right so in this case I'm going
to say PHP we know that PHP is there if
I was to be even general and say a the
letter A we get an empty set here but
you know listen take a look at maybe
select everything and let's say we're
description like and then if we find a
common word in here so with with is in
both of these so if I type with that
will return both records because with is
contained within both of the
descriptions and that stuff on the left
of that with word and the stuff on the
right of that with word so we can use
the like search if you like to search
specifically within our or any of our
columns and we can obtain results like
that so it's almost like a little mini
search</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
