is just a introduction video to the
register and login series basically this
is a complete registration and login
system the great thing about this is
that it has a variety of features
already but the the system is really
easy to expand on so what you're what
you can see here and we're just going to
take a pre-brief overview of this can be
expanded on so you know different
features can be added widgets can be
added things like that so let's take a
brief look around the system very
quickly just so you know what you're
going to be creating at the moment we're
on home there's nothing here because
obviously it's just a tutorial we've got
a variety of menu items up here contact
us doesn't need to you don't need a
login or you don't need to be registered
and logged in but these two you do so
we've obviously got a register feature
here where you can enter some
information your email address there's
an email confirmation so you have to
verify yourself by email so an email
will be sent to you if you've forgotten
your username or your password you can
recover either of these so with
forgetting your username it will just
email you your username but that's based
on your account password will give you a
temporary password and it will force you
to change your password when you log in
so that's quite neat you can see we've
got a little widget down here just
saying how many users we currently have
registered so let's go ahead and log in
and see what we have when we log in okay
so this is change we've got a greeting
up here and we can also now access these
two pages so that's really the main
thing giving users exclusive access to
content making them register first we've
got the ability to change our password
which is obviously important for users
we've got the ability to change settings
as well so we can change our first name
last name email and a variety of other
fields as well and bear in mind this
system is going to be really flexible so
if you need to add any different fields
here like gender date of birth it's
going to be really easy for you to
a profile as well obviously this is very
limited information I'm just outputting
my email address here but users will
have profiles as well and you'll notice
here that we've just got forward slash
Alex so we're actually giving the user a
forward slash on our URL at the moment
you can see it's /lr /al --ax but in
actual fact when you go ahead and create
this on a public server so something
calm it will be just something calm
forward slash and then the users name we
also then have the ability to log out
now this doesn't look very interesting
but it actually means that once you've
built this as I said before you can go
ahead and you can expand on on different
things and if you need to add to this or
create any more advanced features you
will be able to so have a look through
the playlist there's a link to the
entire playlist in this video
description so go ahead and click on
that you'll see the full list of all the
videos and these are constantly updated
so depending on when you're watching
this the feature set may have been added
to and there will it be more tutorials
created for this also if you do have any
requests you can visit the PHP academy'
forum and that's just PHP academy' org
forward slash forum there'll be a link
to the the forum in the description as
well so just pop any requests in there
and I'll do my best to to record them
and get them out so this is the
registration and login system and the
videos that follow this will teach you
how to create it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
