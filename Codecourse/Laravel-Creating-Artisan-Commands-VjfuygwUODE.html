about artisan commands and how they
might be useful so if I switch over to
my terminal here I'm going to run PHP
artisan and that's going to give us a
list of all the default artisan commands
now what if we want to add our own well
we can do this with a PHP artisan
command make and I'm just going to look
at the help for this so here you'll see
that we have one argument and that's the
name of the command then we have some
options down here which we don't have to
use but I'm not going to go through all
of these but do take a look in your own
time so I'm going to say PHP artisan
command make foo and if we look in our
app commands directory you'll see that
command here so there's a couple of
things we need to do in here before we
can start writing our command the first
thing we need to do is set our command
name so I'm going to set this to foo so
when a user or when a developer types
PHP artisan foo that's when our command
will be executed the next thing that we
need to configure is our description I'm
just going to say lorem ipsum we're
going to skip this for now instead we're
going to go down here and we're going to
comment this out we're going to be
looking at this later so don't worry and
I'm just going to instead return an
empty array and the same for the options
and there we go so before we start
writing a command let's go to app start
artisan and down here we're going to say
add this and add and inside here we want
to pass a foo object so you want to
instantiate that like so so inside the
terminal
let's run PHP Addison scroll up and here
we go see our command right here so we
can run PHP Addison foo and of course
nothing is going to happen because we
didn't do anything inside of this fire
method so this fire method will be
called or invoked when our command is
executed
so what we can do is we could say this
info foo has been fired run PHP add some
foo and we get a little message here we
can also do things like error so let's
go to our terminal and run PHP artisan
foo and there we go we get foo has been
fired and it looks like an error message
so back in here I'm going to show you
one other thing I'm going to say if this
confirm and will say are you sure and
we'll say this info you are sure so
let's run PHP artisan foo and we get
this little confirmation little message
and we can type yes and then we get you
as sure so let's clear that this is all
well and good we know how to create a
command but well we haven't looked at
arguments in options and I don't think
that we can truly learn without looking
at a real example so I'm going to go to
my terminal I'm going to create a new
command PHP accent command make I will
call this a generate user inside of here
we need to we need to set some config
I'm going to say a user generate like so
and that description will be generate a
new user okay so in here we'll just say
for now this info user generated and of
course we're lying
we haven't generated anything yet but
let's not worry about that we'll add
this command in our addison file so I
just an add new generator user now if we
run PHP artisan you'll see our command
right here so let's run it PHP addison
user generate and oh we didn't we didn't
clear the arguments but nevermind we're
going to add some arguments now so if we
look at the get arguments method we are
returning a multi-dimensional array
containing our arguments and in this
example we want to pass two arguments we
want to pass
user name and an email so I would Vela
packet type HP Addison user generate and
we would have user name here and we
could also have email like so and then
we may want to pass an option like
password equals test or something like
that so here we're going to have two
arguments like we discussed we're going
to have user name and this will be
required so we're going to leave that as
is and that our description will be this
that uses a username and we need to
escape this so we're going to duplicate
this and rename this email and there we
go and let's just get rid of this for
now and again return an empty array
let's run PHP ads in user generate and
you'll see that we get this message here
and we also get the correct usage of the
syntax of the command so use the
generate username email sorry
PHP artisan PHP artisan user generates
username email hit enter and we get our
user generated message so up here what I
want to do is I want to first before we
do anything just output one of these
options are these arguments sorry so to
do that we call this argument and then
we pass the argument name so let's say
username so PHP ads and user generate or
say Terry and I'll just pass in some
random data and there we go get our
username so let's clear that and now
we're actually going to generate the
user so we're going to say we could
either use our eloquent model here or we
could use the DB class we're going to
use the eloquent model for now just to
make things simple so we'll say user
equals new user username equals this
argument name and keep in mind that you
may want to do some validation here you
may want to check if the name or email
has already been taken and if it has you
just have a conditional statement and
this era is named at reserve that
something like that so user email equals
this argument email and then we're going
to say user safe and then we're going to
say this info user has been generated
and just to make this a little more
personal I'm going to say a user user
name so let's run this page P Addison
user generated I will put in Terry and
we'll just put in John at example.com
and we get an error because I
accidentally named this wrong so this
should be user name in fact just because
this is called name I'm going to rename
this to name just a picot edge just to
be consistent okay so let's try this one
more time hit enter and there we go
user terry has been generated so let's
look in our database hit refresh and
there is our user now of course we want
to add a password too but we probably
want that to be optional so down here
I'm going to grab this I'm going to
uncomment this and I'm going to say
password and down here we're going to
set the example to the users password so
let's have a look at these arguments
really quickly the first one is as you
probably already guessed the name of the
option the second one is a shortcut
which is basically as it sounds a
shortcut to the option the next argument
is the the option type so in this case
it's going to be optional and we do want
this to be optional next we have the
description and finally we have a
default value and in this case I'm going
to set the default value to pass
so up here I'm going to say user
password equals and we want to hash this
so hash make this option password so
let's run page P adds to the user
generate and here you see that we have
this password option here so let's try
it page P Addison user generate I will
have the username as Billy and we'll
have Billy at example.com for the email
and for the password we'll set that to
and you know what let's just quickly get
rid of this so we know that our option
is working so password equals test and
there we go user Billy has been
generated we can add database and there
we have our name email and password</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
