series on getting started with the PHP
wrappers for Kendall you I
in the previous episode I covered the
basics of getting the PHP rappers into
my project and using them to generate
the necessary JavaScript to run a few
simple kendo UI controls i also created
a kendo UI data source to populate a
drop down control and showed how an
array of PHP objects can be serialized
into the needed JavaScript objects for
the data source if you haven't watched
the first episode yet I recommend doing
that now as it covers the core concepts
of how the PHP wrap is for kendo UI work
in this episode then I'll walk through a
more advanced example that creates a
kendo UI tree view control loads data
from the PHP app using a data source and
then lazy loads child nodes for the tree
view when we expand the parent node
to get things rolling i'm using a
project structure based on the previous
episode in addition to the standard
jquery kendo UI javascript and kendo UI
PHP files low i have a sample database
file i'll use this is the data source
for the server api and load my hierarchy
of data from it
I'm also going to use a simple HTML page
structure that will provide a more
visually pleasing page design
this structure
javascript and CSS references has been
extracted into the header and footer PHP
files so that I can focus on the kendo
UI wrapper code lastly i have a few
files in an API folder these files
contain all of the code that I need to
read data from my sample database and
return a hierarchy of employees
you
now production applications that are
using frameworks like laravel slam
cakephp or others will have their own
way of building the server API for
retrieving data since I'm not using any
of these frameworks and since the PHP
wrappers for kendo UI don't require a
specific server framework I'll only
cover the server API very briefly and
won't go into detail on how it's built
the focus will be on the PHP wrappers
for kendo UI and how to configure them
to use an API appropriately
to test my data API I'm going to use a
command line tool called curl if you're
not familiar with this tool don't worry
about it there's a dozen great tools for
testing api calls including writing your
own JavaScript or jQuery in a browser to
make the Ajax call curl just happens to
be my tool of choice for testing api
calls
now when I request the / AP I /
employees PHP endpoint on my localhost
server curl will send an HTTP request
and display any results that it gets in
the console for me in this case the data
that it returns is adjacent serialized
array of employee objects and it's a
very small list with only one person at
this point representing the top level of
the employee hierarchy in the database I
know that the API works now so I'll set
up the basic tree view structure in my
PHP code this is done by creating an
instance of the condo / UI / tree view
object
but without a source of data to work
with there isn't anything for the
treeview to show
so I'll create a data source and set it
up to read data from the employees API
now in the previous episode the data
source was little more than just a list
of hard coded items for the treeview to
get data from the server API though I
need a bit more than that I'll need to
configure a datasource transport to read
the data and a schema model for it to
understand the data that is returned the
transport is what tells my datasource
how to read write and delete data from
the API it's an abstraction that makes
it easy to adapt nearly any source of
data to be used with kendo UI controls
in this case I really only need to read
data so I'm only going to configure a
datasource transport read object I'll
tell that object to read data from the /
AP I / employees PHP endpoint and tell
it to expect a content type of Jason now
I can assign the transport read object
to the transport itself next I'll create
a simple data source schema model this
will describe the model that is being
returned by the API so that the data
source knows how to work with it the
only field I'm concerned with for the
moment is the ID field employee ID after
setting that I can create a data source
schema and assign the model to the
schema
with that done I can assign the
transport and schema to the datasource
and assign the data source to the
treeview
I'll also set the data text field of the
tree view so that it will show the full
name of the employee
and when I reload the page now I see the
results of course this isn't much of a
treeview with only one item in it to see
more than this I need to change the
rapper Cody is a hierarchical data
source and tell it how to recognize and
load the hierarchy
you
there aren't that many changes to make
in order to get the treeview to use a
hierarchy of data I can pretty much add
the word hierarchical in front of the
three objects related to the data source
and I'm just about done this makes it
rather simple to switch between a flat
and hierarchical data source is needed
one edition will change is that I need
to tell the schema how to recognize when
there is child data to show this will
cause the tree view to show the icon for
expanding and collapsing the tree
to do this I need my data to tell me
when there is hierarchical data to show
and if I go back to the raw data that my
employees API produced there's a field
called has employees that tells me
whether or not I have child data and I
can use this field as the has children
setting of the hierarchical data schema
model
the last thing that I need to account
for is the data source loading the child
data whenever I expand one of the crave
you knows that has child data the data
source will be called to load that data
and to do that it will call back to the
read API endpoint that I configured and
it will supply the ID of the model that
I clicked by a pending employee ID as a
URL parameter now it knows to use
employee ID for this because I told the
schema model that this is the ID field
the end result is a request to / AP I /
employees PHP ? employee ID equals 2 for
example and I can test my API endpoint
at that URL using curl this lets me see
that requesting the URL returns a list
of employees that are underneath of the
specified employee ID
having verified that this works I can
reload my page and see that and roof
O'Leary now has an arrow beside his name
this tells me that there is child data
to view and I'm going to click the arrow
a request for the child data is sent
back to the API and the results are
loaded into the tree view appropriately
you can also see that Steven Buchanan
has an error next to his name signifying
an additional employee hierarchy that
can be loaded as needed now as a
reminder the data source in tree view
that I configured in PHP are not reading
and serializing the data from within the
PHP code itself this is only configuring
the JavaScript that the browser will use
to read data from the server and we can
verify this by viewing the page source
and seeing the JavaScript translation of
the PHP configuration that we supplied
the kendo UI control takes this
JavaScript and uses it to make calls
back to the server processing the
results accordingly
you
it's easy enough to get data to read and
display but what would it take to get a
complete crud solution set up with a
grid create read update and delete in
the next episode I'll walk through
exactly that I'll show the process of
configuring a data source for a complete
set of crud operations show how to
configure the display columns integrate
including custom column templates for
nested objects and show you how to
customize the pop-up editor for adding
and editing rows in the grid and much
more
