manipulating a current date that we have
set within carbon and this is extremely
helpful if you're working with adding a
certain amount of days on or weeks to a
current time to maybe compare them at a
later date or just check out what the
date or month is or something like that
when you've added a certain amount of
days on this just gives you massive
flexibility and it's so easy just to
work with dates in this way once you
have these methods in place so let's go
ahead and create a carbon instance using
the current date and time and let's go
ahead and once again just do a var dump
on this and head over to our browser and
take a look at what we sees this is just
the current date and time
now we're going to look at a few of the
methods that we have available we won't
look at them all because some of them
are self explanatory and you can find
them in the carbon documentation but
let's look at something like adding a
couple of days onto this date now
traditionally this would be really
difficult because you would have to have
the current date you'd have to
manipulate it in such a way to add days
on but what happens if for example
you're at the very end of the month and
you want to add a couple of days on
you're then going to have to calculate
how many days are in a specific month
and you're gonna have to then modify the
month as well this can get really really
messy so what happens if on the current
date that we have so we're currently on
the 14th of July 2015 let's say we want
to add a couple of days to this date
well that's easy we just use the add
days method and then in here we provide
the amount of days that we want to add
on so in here we go ahead and refresh
and we're now on the 16th easy as that
now as I mentioned if we have a dates
like say the 30th of a certain month and
we want to add a couple of days onto
that that's obviously going to take us
over into the next month so let's look
at adding say 20 days to this date which
is obviously going to take us into the
next month
so let's add 20 days to the current date
and let's see what happens and there we
go so we now land on the 4th of the next
month which is extremely helpful so with
just one method we've gone ahead and
manipulated the day and everything has
gone ahead and updated itself so we now
have this brand-new date and time so
there are a couple of other additions to
this or changes to this we can go ahead
and say add or sorry sub days so he can
take away 20 days if we wanted to which
takes us into the previous month so near
the end of the previous month and this
works the same with weeks months years
hours minutes and seconds so all you
need to do is substitute these in so if
we want to add 20 weeks to the current
date we would see the following so we're
now in - sorry sub weeks when we're back
in 2014 if we go ahead and add weeks on
there we are so on the 9th month and the
first day so this is extremely easy to
just manipulate dates in this way and
obviously like I said we have things
like hours minutes and seconds so we
could add say 60 minutes that would
obviously be an hour so we could just do
add hour but let's do 30 instead so when
we refresh you see that we come up to a
different time because we've just added
30 minutes onto that and obviously what
we're doing here is with calling two of
these methods we can call any amount of
these methods because all it's going to
do is just keep manipulating it so you
have total flexibility over taking one
date and time and then just manipulating
it by adding weeks minutes so you can
combine these and chop them up to get
the result you need so more interesting
is a method called add weekdays and sub
weekdays so let's take a look at this so
add week days - so let's just count this
out for now and just remind ourselves
what the
current daters so on 2015 and we're on
the fourteenth day so if I want to add
to weekdays which is obviously Monday to
Friday when i refresh we get sixteen so
that's pretty obvious what happens if we
want to add seven weekdays we're
commonly on 14 remember so when we add 7
weekdays we end up at 23 now that's 2
more than we should have because we've
skipped the weekend so we can just work
with weekdays if we want to that's a
really helpful method in the cases that
you would actually need that otherwise
you would have to just stick with our
days and that wouldn't really help you
out adding 7 days to the current dates
21 but when we add only weekdays we
obviously skip the weekend and we add up
end up at 23 so again in terms of
manipulating we can see how useful
carbon is in manipulating the current
day or a date that we've created or a
date and time we've created in a certain
way using these helpful methods and
again if you just head over to the
source code and just go ahead and search
for add days or something like that you
can see that we have all of these other
methods as well you can go ahead and
just look at them and see how they work
obviously we have something like add day
as well so it just gives a default value
of one if you don't to use something
like add days one you can just skip out
passing an option and just do add day
which makes your syntax a little bit
cleaner and your code a little bit
cleaner so that's how we manipulate
dates in carbon I'm sure you'll agree
extremely useful in a wide variety of
cases particularly when we working with
something as complicated as dates and
times</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
