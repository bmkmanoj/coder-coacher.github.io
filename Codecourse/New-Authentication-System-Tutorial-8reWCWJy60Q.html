coming out very soon and I'm just going
to going to take this opportunity to go
through it show you what's included talk
a little bit about what it's based on
and what kind of packages that we're
using to bring this together and also
some of the benefits of this new system
amongst other things so before we get
started let's go ahead and just take a
look at the database because this gives
away a lot of clues about the kind of
features that are involved and then
we'll also talk about how we're managing
our database as well which is really
important so we obviously have a user's
table and we also have a user's
permissions table and we obviously have
permissions within this system as well
so you can create different permissions
so for example is admin you can choose
any columns here you can add to this you
can go ahead and give users specific
permissions for now we're just focusing
on is admin above course you can add
more so under the users table we've got
everything we normally expect so use
name email these columns here first name
and last name are just things that a
user can add to their profile you can
add to this and output this and update
this super easily it's really easy to do
we have active and active hash so we're
we're giving the users the option to
activate their account not rather than
giving the OP the users the option you
have the option to allow activations or
not so you can turn that on and off
pretty easy we also have password
recovery so if you use user forgets
their password they can enter the email
address and go ahead and not have a
password email to them but they can
reset their password that will just
redirect them back to your app and what
we're using to manage our database is
eloquent ORM which is basically an
object relational mapping which sounds
more complicated than it is it comes
from laravel and we're going to be
pulling that in as a dependency as part
of this project and all this means is
that we can create models around our
tables so for example users is a model
user permissions as a model and then we
can just link these together really
easily using relationships between
models and this makes it extreme
easy to extend your application so for
example if you want to add private
messaging you would have models for this
based on tables and you could link these
two different users and just use that to
output messages it just makes it a whole
lot easier they obviously is a little
bit of a learning curve but is really
worth it so the whole application which
I probably should have mentioned before
is based on PHP framework called slim
and we're using version 2 for this and
this again takes a little bit of a
learning curve but it makes your
application structure a whole lot better
so you can add roots which are
essentially just going to be different
pages I guess in your application or
different the ability to send data
through two different routes and process
them how you want and that just breaks
things up really nicely but we'll be
learning about them in the series and
we'll go into a lot more depth so why
don't we register a user and just
actually see how this works so obviously
we've got nothing in our database I go
from just register an account so i can
just enter my email address enter a
username choose a password now we do
actually have validation here as well
we're using a package called violin
which I created but you can switch this
out for any other validation you want to
use and the validation is also hooked up
to our database so we can easily check
if the email or username or any other
field has already been taken etc so
let's hit register and we go through so
we get a message here you have been
registered with flashing messages here
so it's really easy to include this may
be in a top are if you wanted to add
this into your design so it's entirely
flexible so let's head over to the
database then and you can see that that
has been created we obviously have a
null for first and last names we didn't
give that in the registration process
but you can add that in and it just adds
them interview super easy so currently
not active this would have sent me an
email but I'm not going to go over that
I'm just going to set active to one
manually here and also in the permission
sections created a permission to record
for this user and we can toggle this on
and off or any other columns we decide
to use and
easily checked within your application
as well so let's go ahead and login so
well go ahead and log in the details I
just registered with hit login and there
we go so you can see I've got a little
avatar up here this is coming from
gravatar which is a service that allows
users to upload an image and then tights
their email address we're not going to
be looking at uploading profile photos
because it is a bit of a hassle and this
is a very popular solution which I'd
highly recommend you integrate because
it's so popular now it just allows users
to take one avatar across all of
different sites that use essentially so
the couple of options we've got here
home which is just the home page we can
log out you know what that does we can
view our profile here so at the moment
we've just got my email address being
displayed you could just as easily add
an option in the update profile which
will look at now to show different
profile settings entirely up to you but
here we can go ahead and enter a name
and hit update and that updates
upsetting so now changes up here to hi
Alex camera and we have methods on the
model and the user model that allow us
to get like the users full name or if
they don't have a full name will return
the username so again entirely flexible
and if I head back to my profile it
gives me my full name as well so we can
change our password as well so we can
enter our old password a new password
again this is all validated as well
change that goes ahead and change is my
password we've got a list of all users
as well so I can just click on that and
go through that's accessible by anyone
and we can go ahead and look at the
admin permission as well so if the admin
permission is on we can give the user
the ability to access certain areas you
can see here that it's now added admin
here which we can easily check and also
there's this admin area here so an
example of an admin protected page so
this does look pretty simple but like i
said the structure of this application
is in such a way that it's going to
allow you to add a lot more to this you
can customer
is pretty much anything really easily it
split out so it's fairly simple to just
go in and look at we're using a twig for
our template engine so you can go ahead
and implement your own templates really
easily as well there's no requiring in
of different file so we're not going to
end up in a mess everything here is just
going to be as clean as possible it's
still very simple and it just works so
this is what's coming up if you do have
any suggestions things that you think
absolutely should be included in this go
ahead and pop them in the comments below
and I'll try and address them before the
series comes out but otherwise we can
just take requests and update this
series and make it a really good system
to work with so I hope you enjoy the
series when it comes out feel free to
comment below on anything you think
should be included</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
