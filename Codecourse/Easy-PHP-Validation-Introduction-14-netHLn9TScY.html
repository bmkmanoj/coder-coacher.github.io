creating a PHP validator and I'll
quickly demonstrate how this works and
then we'll take a look at the code and
see how we actually use this class so
you can see that I've got a basic form
here with a user name and email and a
password and I'm gonna leave all of
these blank when I hit submit you see
that we've got this array back here and
we're not gonna be delving in how we're
actually displaying the errors to the
user that's fairly straightforward
because we've got an array structure
here with keys that correspond to the
field names and then all of the errors
within here so you can see here that
we've got a few couple of errors for
each field because they're both required
and we've also got email validation so
obviously an empty email is not a valid
email address and also a username and a
password must be a minimum of three and
six characters respectively so we're
gonna be learning how to do this now
let's take a look at how the code works
will basically be creating two classes
here one is an error handler and one's a
validator the reason we're doing this
because technically the error handling
can be reused elsewhere and it's not
specifically part of the validator class
we'll be doing this if it sounds
complicated to you you know don't worry
it's not it's not that difficult but
we're basically injecting this as a
dependency so the basis of this is to
create a validator instance or an object
and then we use this check method now we
can either pass an array an associative
array hard-coded or build this up
ourself or we can literally just pass
the post superglobal you can see I'm
checking that it's not empty up here
probably better ways to do that but yeah
we I'm basically just pipe passing all
of this post data in and that obviously
comes from the form that we saw just a
moment ago so once this is posted
through it goes into here and then we
pass in an array of lots of different
rules now this is an associative array
and the keys here correspond to the
field name so we've got name username
email and password and then we give
things like required to true max length
20 min lengths
whether we want to validate this as an
email etc etc and this is so easy to
extend so if you need additional checks
for certain things maybe you want to
check if a field is alphanumeric or
numeric or something like that we'll be
going over within the series how you can
extend this for your own use so we're
not just restricted to what we're going
to be doing here we've then got some
sort of helpful methods like fails this
very much replicates you know frameworks
like laravel where it just flows really
nicely so that's the inspiration for how
this self works so if the validation
does fail we've got a couple of options
so let's just briefly discuss these
we've got this errors a method here
which basically returns an error handler
and from this what we can do is we can
fetch all errors which what we saw here
so that gives us all the errors and what
we can also do though is specify and hit
a key so I can say just one all errors
relating to the username so in this case
if I resubmit the form that just gives
us a list of the errors specifically
relating to the username just as a side
note as well these messages here a
highly custom customisable we have
placeholders in name in place of the
field and what satisfies the the check
so what we can also do is we can grab
the first error from a specific field so
if you just wanted to display this maybe
just next to the field here you can see
here we've got this the user name is the
field is required we could do the same
for the password as well for example
that would do pretty much this the same
thing like that so is very flexible easy
to extend and when you actually come to
use the validator class the syntax that
we're going to be building here is
fairly memorable you can easily remember
this for your projects so that's how it
works this is how it all looks we're
gonna be building the error handler and
validator class completely from scratch
it really isn't too complicated
but you get this really effective
validation system out of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
