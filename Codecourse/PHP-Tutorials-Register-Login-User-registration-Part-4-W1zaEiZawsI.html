longer than I thought
however we are going through it
thoroughly we're using security we're
using checks for our username and
password which is really good and in if
I am being confusing please let me know
drop me an email or anything through
YouTube anything like that but now what
onto our registering our user process so
what we need to do here is we're going
to connect to our database we're going
to open up our table I'm gonna input our
values which is simps mmm bit simpler
than you might think so
first of all I'm going to do is I'm
going to write a message saying success
okay and go back to our page and I just
go back onto this what I'm gonna do
first is check all of our our checks
that we've created so I'm going to click
register and it's saying please for now
fill in all fields if I fill in say a
variety of fields and forget one and
click register it's still saying our
message so now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to type Alex I'm going to
choose my username that's time my full
name I'm going to check I'm going to
choose a password which is ABC and for
the next one I'm just going to type a
load of gobbledygook so when I click
register we should say your passwords do
not match so we're back to square one
we're going to type in ethics gara we're
going to choose a username we're going
to choose a password that is say ABC ABC
now this is under six characters so if I
click register past must be between six
and twenty five characters that check
works now I'm going to do is type my
full-name as Alex Garrett with loads of
that and a username just going to be
Alex my password is going to be just a
full length password over six characters
and when I click register you can see
that length of username or full-name is
too long so you can break these checks
up if you want I'll leave that up to you
because it will take too long for this
tutorial but basically at the moment
we've got
a successful form validation and now
what we're going to do is we're going to
continue with registering our user now
this form validation bear in mind isn't
isn't very good in the fact that every
time we get an error
these fields are sort of diminished
they've gone and the user has to retype
so what I'm going to say is is we've got
our our full-name and I username
password variables here considering this
is a PHP page itself we can incorporate
PHP into this HTML code here what I'm
going to do is under your full name I'm
going to take value equals and this will
set a value inside the box and I'm going
to open up a PHP tag and the close our
PHP tag and inside this I'm going to say
echo username or rather sorry full name
okay I'm gonna do exactly the same with
our username so value equals open up PHP
tags close PHP tags and echo out
username making sure we have our line
terminators on that and now what happen
is let's say I choose this ridiculously
long name again and I choose a username
and say Alex you don't your passwords to
be stored not a good idea just leave
that up to the user so I've got a to
longer field this should produce this
error again but when we click register
this time we are kept with our full name
and our username so it's a lot I mean
it's annoying if you get an error and
you have to retype your username
username your part of your password or
your full name or your first name your
surname middle name I don't know however
many field you're using on your register
form it's annoying to have to type them
over and over and over again so using
this using your PHP echo inside PHP tags
inside the value of your HTML input type
is so useful and much more convenient
for the you
much more user-friendly so okay
otherwise echo success so I haven't
actually given a successful form yet I'm
gonna type Alex Garrett just simply my
password is going to be something over
six characters under 25 characters click
register ha right let's see we've picked
up an error if the string length of the
password is bigger than 25 or the string
length of the password is smaller than
six echo password must be and funnily
enough we've run into the same problem
I've just realized that we have an
encrypted value for our password and our
md5 encrypted string is massive much
bigger than 25 characters so again what
I'm gonna do here is I'm going to take
this book of code that we're encrypting
our password cut it out of there tidy
this up and bring it down to underneath
register the user so you can see from
experience order of things is really
important if you get errors like this go
through your code look at them realize
what you're doing
you'll always echo things out in between
code just for your sort of debug
purposes so now I'm going to do is go
back to my form I'm going to re-type my
perfectly acceptable password in click
on register and we've got our success
message so you can see that just by
going through your code you can see that
there's problems I'm a bit quicker at
realizing things sometimes a pause the
video and have a look through and then
resume the video because I don't wanna
keep you guys I don't like a hold
but yeah you'll soon realize your
mistakes so we've got our success so now
what we're gonna do is we're gonna say
open our database okay and to do this we
need our connect variable or you don't
need it but I'm going to say MySQL
connect and I'm connecting to my local
host server which is my computer and my
root
my past was nothing and then we're gonna
say MySQL select DB this is going to
select our database so let's say select
date place even though this kind of
makes it obvious and that is PHP login
and here what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say give a query so query
register and this is going to be equal
to MySQL query and this is the important
part of this tutorial where we ret
actually input our very input our values
and we register the user now this is let
me bring it down so it's easier for you
to see this is insert into okay users
which if you go back to here this is it
PHP login is our table that we've
selected so Mike's ask at MySQL select
DB PHP login and we're inserting into
users which is our table inside this
database and we're gonna say values in
brackets each value of the of the table
so each field that is present in the in
the tape in the table so if we go back
to here and click on browse or say
structures the better one to go into
structure we've got ID you ID name
username password date so one two three
four five so we need five one two three
four five the ID is auto increment if
you know that from the last tutorial so
we just need in here you can see the
order is very important as well so I've
got a name username password date so
this is just name this is user name
this is password don't need to store our
repeated password that was just for a
check and this is gonna be the date okay
so these variables here if you're not
too sure are from up here where we have
our full-name username password and date
I just need to come and change this to
full name okay so this should work after
this is done I'm going to say let's say
you have been read just third in fact
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say died
you have been registered and I'm gonna
say click here or just make it simple
return to the login page I'm gonna put
this as a link back to our index page in
which the user can log in so you can see
how it all holds together in a second
when I preview this to you and let's say
Alex Cairo choosing a username that's
Alex
choosing a password and I'm looking
register
you've been registered returned to login
page return to login page so check my
database
come on browse you can see that I've got
I've got Alex Garret my IDs three my
username is Alex my password is my
encrypted password and my date is the
date okay that's it for that in the next
part I'm going to show you how to just
tidy a few things up and we're going to
test the login process so I'll see you
