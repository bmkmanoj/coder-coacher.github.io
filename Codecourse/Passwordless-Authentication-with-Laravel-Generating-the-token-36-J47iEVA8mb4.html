there's a couple of steps that we need
to take we need to obviously allow the
user to enter their email address we
need to look them up by their email
address obviously if they don't exist
then we don't do anything what we then
want to do is request a link and as part
of this we will be generating a token in
a new table and then we will of course
send the email off so to get started we
obviously need to create a new route we
need to create a new method in our
controller and then start to validate
and then handle things so let's just
duplicate this route down and this is
just going to be a post route through to
this same URI and for this route let's
just call this send token and it's going
to implement this method just over here
so public function send token now into
this we're gonna accept in a request
because we need to extract the email
obviously and what I'm gonna do is just
say something like this validate login
and I'm going to pass through the
request and just extract this out to a
separate method of course you can do
everything inside of the sent oakum but
I find this just helps to clean things
up a little bit so to do this then we
want to obviously accept that request
into there and then we just want to
validate as normal so we know that to
validate within a controller we can just
call this validate passing through the
request so laravel can read the request
information and in here all we're
validating is the email but as I saw
we're accepting so this is going to be
required it's going to be an email
address we can set a max to 5 551 and we
want to make sure that this exists in
the users table under the email column
so we know that we've already registered
the user so this should work well
because we already have one in there we
can test with and that is pretty much it
for the validation so we can obviously
test this out just by entering an email
address hitting send magic link and you
can see that nothing happens however if
I go ahead and enter one it doesn't
exist we should see that we come back
with a selected email is invalid and of
course there is some front-end
validation here but things like this
wouldn't be accept
did now alright so now that we've done
that how do we start to kick off the
process of requesting a link well what
we're going to do is extract this out to
a separate class we're not gonna just
write tons of code inside of this send
token method and what I've decided to do
for this is inside of my app folder
create an entirely new auth folder just
to store everything we need and we're
gonna be storing a trait in here as well
because we're going to be attaching a
trait to the user model which will then
allow you if you have other types of
authenticated users or whatever you can
add that trait in there as well and it
will just work so let's create a new
file in here and I'm gonna call this
magic authentication PHP let's go ahead
and set this up with our name space this
is now under app and Earth and of course
the class is magic authentication okay
so what we want to do is be able to
inject this into here so we can then use
a helpful method on there
so the method is simply going to be
request link so let's create this method
out so request link and what we gonna do
is part of this into the constructor
that's so we're going to accept in a
request which will allow us to then
extract things from that request so we
don't have to pass it into here you can
do that it really depends on how open
you want this to be so into the
constructor then we're going to accept
in a request like so and then we're just
going to say this the request equals
request and obviously set our protected
request proxy up there so from the login
controller that's just pull in that
namespace for the IRF else request
object and what we can now do is in here
just to test this out we can do a die
dump on this request and over in our
controller we can now pull this in so
let's just tidy this up a little bit and
I'm gonna go ahead and use app or magic
authentication and what I can now do is
inject this into this method
so let's do that and we're gonna call
that off and then down here we're gonna
call off request link like so okay so
let's just test this out so I'm gonna go
ahead and enter a valid email address
and hit Send magic link and we see that
request object so what laravel is done
is automatically figured out that in the
constructor accepting a request and it's
gone ahead and set that in there you
can't pass it into here if you want for
example you may just want to send an
email through it really depends on what
you want to do with this okay so the
next step then is looking up a user by
an identifier now what I'm going to do
is keep this open because you might want
to identify them by a username or you
might want to identify them by something
else so I'm going to keep this open by
creating some kind of identifier just up
here and this is kind of similar to the
way that laravel authentication happens
anyway you can actually change this
around to work with the username if you
want and you can find all of that under
the earth controller so have a go and
have a look at that if you want so the
identify them will say well we want to
pluck out the user by their email
address so in here we're gonna say
something like this get user by
identifier and into this we want to pass
in request get and then this identifier
so all that will do is it will say this
request get email which is the same as
saying request email like so so this
method then so get user by identifier
we'll go ahead and accept in that
identifier and all we do here is just
look up a user basically really really
straightforward so user where this
identifier and then we compare that to
the value that's passed in so this
should actually be a value sorry and
then we just go ahead and say first or
fail because obviously if they don't
exist then you know we don't want to do
anything
they shouldn't have they should never
have got to that point because we have
that validation in place but it's always
a good idea anyway so let's just pull in
app user it's just in the default place
within fresh Lara installation and we
should now have a user by that
email so let's go over and check this
out go back
hit Send magic link oh and of course
this will need to be this request so
let's give that refresh and there we go
so this is my user account with that
particular email address great so now
that we have the user we're now getting
on to the trait side of things so what
we want to do rather again than doing
everything in here I'm gonna create a
trait on the user model which will allow
me to store a token send the magic link
off and all that stuff so if we think
about this we need a relationship for
the user because we need to insert a
token so really the next step is to
start to think about the database schema
and how we're gonna store tokens for a
particular user
so let's generate a migration then so
I'm gonna say PHP artisan make migration
and this is going to be something like
create users login tokens table and in
here we can pass in the create flag to
make this a little bit easier for us so
users login tokens and we will also
generate a model as well we could have
generated the model along on the
migration but we'll go ahead and do this
separately so make model and we're gonna
call this user login token like so and
let's start to fill out our migration so
create users login tokens now in here we
obviously need a ID so integer this is
going to be a user ID we can setup a
foreign key constraint but we'll go
ahead and leave it for now because we're
going to be manually deleting anything
but feel free to do that if you want and
we're also going to have a token so we
have a string which is a token now by
default laravel will create a 255 length
token and we're gonna be generating a
really huge token as well so this just
helps but of course you can reduce the
length if you want it's entirely up to
you so let's just migrate so we have
that in there and we are on our way to
go so the user login token model let's
first of all really importantly define
out the table name because this probably
won't pick out by default so we're going
to say users log
in tokens and we'll just make sure
everything is looking good here so user
login token brilliant and now we want to
just to find out our fillable fields and
of course all of our other stuff as well
so the fillable in this case is
literally just going to be a token
that's pretty much all we need to fill
in this case you may store other things
in here later so go ahead and add them
to fill it all so with this then we know
it belongs to a user so we can very
quickly and easily set up that relation
in here so we can access that user from
the token this is going to be really
important because we're going to be
accepting a token into a URI this in
turn will then use root model binding to
actually pull that token out and then we
need to be able to access the user to
pick out things like the email address
and of course to sign them in as well so
belongs to user so now what we're not
going to be doing is coming over to the
user model and start to create our
relationships in here we're gonna leave
that up to the trait and that means that
if like I said you did want to use this
with another model you just go ahead and
you use the trait and it will just work
so let's focus on the trait because then
we can set up the relationship between
any magically authenticate able user and
the user token model so this will just
make it a little bit more flexible so
inside of or then let's create a new
folder called traits and inside of here
we're gonna create a new file called
magically authenticate able dot PHP of
course you can shorten this if you want
it quite a long name so in here the
namespace then is app or traits and the
class is magically authenticate able so
now what we can do then is set up that
token relationship because we're going
to be using this on the user model so in
here then we know that a tok a user is
only ever gonna have one token they
don't they're never gonna have many
tokens that will they lease they
shouldn't so we're gonna be handling
that later but we're going to set the
relationship up as a has one
relationship so user login token
and that is pretty much it so what we
can now do is use this over on our user
model we're going to be adding some more
methods to this later but this just
makes it like I said before a little bit
more flexible so use app or traits and
that and then all we need to do is go
ahead and use that in there so we now
have that relationship on there but
inside of a trait and of course sorry
that should be a trait
okay so now going back to our magic
login controller when we hit request
link over in magic authentication we
know that we've got the user so what we
can now do is from this point we can
start to actually generate a token we
can then go ahead and grab any more
information we need from them we can
send the email and all of that stuff so
really the first thing I want to do is
delete any existing tokens before we
start to generate any new tokens so to
do this because we have that user model
and we have that token relationship
we're just going to say delete so we're
just going to delete the token if
they've already requested one we don't
want to keep filling up this table with
more and more tokens so that is super
important and now what we want to kind
of do is something like user store token
and then something like send magic link
and then go ahead and pass through some
additional options now we'll leave this
just for now we'll look at actually
storing the token first and then we'll
go on to actually sending this off in
the next part so to store a token then
all we need to do now because this kind
of relates to any particular model
that's magically authenticate able we do
this on the trait so it can be reused
wherever we want because storing the
token is a little bit more complex than
just inserting a record we have some
very specific things we want to do and
we know that we can come over to our
tray to find that stuff if we need it
so at the top then let's just create
this store token method so store token
and inside of here then all we're going
to do is say this token
create and then in here we are going to
specify the token now this is just gonna
be STR random if you want to pull in
another library to handle the random
token generation for you that's
absolutely fine but STR random uses PHP
seven random bytes to actually generate
this so it's pretty good there's nothing
necessarily wrong with using this and
then we're gonna return this to go ahead
and allow us to chain this on and
actually if I think about this this part
here kind of makes sense to really go in
there I think this is absolutely fine we
can kind of assume that by storing a
token we want to kind of flush out the
existing token so I'm gonna go ahead and
place that in there of course it's er
entirely up to you okay so now that
we've got to this point we should be
able to go ahead and enter our email
address and that should store a token
for us so we have our table we should
see a long token in there so let's go
ahead and do this so into my email
address hit Send magic link and of
course inside of our trait we just need
to update this so magically authenticate
able to pull in that user login token
model so app user login token Brehon so
let's go over into my email address and
there we go so we should now see that
token in there created I'm ready to go
and of course because we have the
relationship set up it has already given
my ID in and pre-populated that so now
that we have the token we're ready to
email this off it's not that complicated
but gonna leave that till the next part
because we've covered quite a bit in
this part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
