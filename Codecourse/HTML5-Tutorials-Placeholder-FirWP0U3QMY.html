in this video I'll be showing you the
difference between new and old in terms
of placeholders so a placeholder is
basically when you have a field and an
input field of some kind and it has some
text inside it that is usually a
placeholder if it's there by default at
least anyway and normally what would
happen is a great effort to be of a
second normally to get some data in here
you'd have to do value is equal to some
value and when you click aside it is
there and you'd have to delete highlight
it delete it and then start typing
however that's just messy and it's not
really wanted most of the time what you
want is that the relevant information
inside it but when person goes to click
on it they get to have it still you can
start entering their data immediately
and if you click outside then it stays
there but if they believe their data and
web reason it goes back and fills up the
placeholder now one two things but you
should notice is firstly this requires
quite a bit well as one line two lines
per field one from focus or one from
blur you could do this as a function but
it gets more complicated and i'm not
going to go into it since I'm not
actually explaining what this code does
and also it looks the same as an OL
input so you might not know the
difference for example they may not know
whether what they wanted enter Ingo what
has been entered is relevant or not for
example user name that's obviously what
you're going to have to enter but for
some weird reason if somebody's usually
was using or more importantly if the
password feels here we've got password
and it's showing up the word password by
sharing it with the black dots and that
is simply because it is just having a
value inside there and we're just
telling it to hide the value or delete
the value once we're clicking into it so
the way to get around this is you could
ever add a lot of extra code which will
make its overt it would change the type
of this field when you click on it and
turn your back when you click out a bit
but only if it's not the default value
and so on Oh
you can go new html5 way which I've got
open here in new folder or new file
rather and instead of doing value is
equal to change value to place holder
and change that to me using oil and if
we open up this file here you can see
it's got a slightly gray so that you can
tell us a place holder not your
information if you still there when you
click on it so you don't forget when you
start typing it go it's when you start
typing get disappears and replaces it
with the black or whatever color text
you decide to put and you start typing
and you when you click out even though
it's the same as the default it stays
there and doesn't disappear whereas I'm
this one if I change move username it
disappears it seems to go back ribbit
ribbit if Alex click back it doesn't
disappear okay and the other thing
that's quite useful if if we set this
one to password we here we now see where
is password without the data type so the
input type doesn't really matter you can
have anything you like within reason I
don't think you can use stuff like the
full of it file import but that's a
different topic and there is wasting it
around that but that would be included
having an extra spam tag next wave so on
and when you click into it it's still
there but what you start typing is
password</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
