mobile emulation we're not going to go
too deep into this because there's a lot
you can just figure out for yourself but
it's good to know that it's there as
part of the chrome developer tools so
when you are developing responsive
websites you want a general idea of what
they're gonna look like on different
viewports now of course what you can do
is with your basic page that you've laid
out we've got a meta viewport tag just
here with the sort of standard
responsive content and we have a body
with just text obviously what you can do
is just go ahead and pull your browser
window in just to see what this looks
like another great tip by the way is you
can actually detach this so you can go
ahead and just pull that off and you can
have it wherever you need it so if you
are sort of pulling this in to test
anything it's really useful just to have
this here you can go ahead and do
whatever you want with it but really the
best part about the mobile emulation
chrome developer tools is you just hit
this button you can go ahead and start
playing around with different device
sizes so let's just get rid of the
chrome developer tools for a minute so I
don't actually close it off altogether
I'll just detach it just pull it down
here so here we have an Apple iPhone 6
but we can change this to really any
device on here so for example on Nexus 5
that will give me the device size for a
nexus 5 there are other useful things
here so for example we can change the
user agent so if you are for some reason
detecting a user agent which obviously
isn't a good idea
or if you're doing anything really here
you can just go ahead and play around
and modify this value and obviously what
it says here is you might need to reload
the page for proper user agent spoofing
and viewport rendering so if you do have
any problems just go ahead and refresh
the page like that so you have this sort
of like sort of circle here where we can
click and do what we would normally do
with links or whatever we can manually
change the device size here as well we
can change the throttling so for example
we can change the speed in which the
page is
actually accessed which is really useful
we can go ahead and increase the size as
we would normally see and really this is
just pretty useful if you are doing
responsive web development this is a
great tool to use just to just roughly
check what what you'd normally see on
here so for example we could choose a
Kindle Fire and we get this if it's a
tablet here really just very useful it
obviously doesn't replace testing on a
real device but it's the next best thing
to doing so and you can do all within
the browser really easily so that is a
very brief introduction to device
emulation with Chrome developer tools</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
