give them the option to reset it and
this comes in two stages the first stage
is clicking a link just down here which
will take us to a forum to allow the
user to enter their email what that will
do then is send an email to them with
the link they then click that link and
they're forwarded to a new forum where
they can enter a new password and
confirmation so we already have the kind
of security practices in place to
generate long hashes or long strings and
then hash them so obviously in our
database here we have this recover hash
and we can store this here a hashed
version of a long identifier to increase
security here because obviously again if
anyone got hold of this identifier we'd
be in trouble because someone could just
reset someone's password and what will
also be doing is removing this
identifier once a user has changed their
password and that just means that
someone else can't say get get hold of
their email and just reset their
password so we'll start off by creating
the root in the view which is going to
be the recover view and then we have a
reset view which is when the user clicks
the link so let's have the link to our
login form if we come under our views or
login we can add this just below here so
we could say forgot your password and
this is going to be a URL for that root
so URL for password dot recover and we
don't have this root at the moment so
let's create this under our routes so
under auth password we're going to
create a new file and that's going to be
called recover dot PHP so inside of here
what we need to do is render our form we
need a
recover password route we're going to
use app and we want this to be protected
so only guests ie people who aren't
authenticated can access it and then we
want to say app render off password
recover dot PHP which we haven't created
just yet and let's also name this
password dot recover so let's create
this view and we'll create our form and
then we will click through onto this so
under views or password or create a
recover view and again we'll take the
template from home just so you don't
have to type all of that out and here
we'll say recover password and this will
be our form so we'll just write recover
here for now so on here let's take it
out of course we need to add this to our
roots so let's just separate this out
password for cover there we go
forgot your password and we go to our
recover page so this is a very simple
form it's just gonna be the user's email
address this is going to be for password
recover dot post we're gonna have a
method of post I'm going to turn
auto-complete off again so we need to
create this password recover post root
so here we say app post recover password
we also need to be a guest to access
this we don't logged in users to say
they forget their password and just echo
out submitted there so we'll give this a
name
and we're all good to build our form so
in a paragraph here we're gonna say or
just above this actually we're gonna say
in to your email address to start your
password recovery and inside of the form
we just have one field which is the
user's email address we have an input
type of text here the name is going to
be email and the ID is also going to be
email and we need our submit button so
input type of submit and we're just
gonna say request reset and of course
when we submit this form we have a
cross-site request forgery token
mismatch so we need to implement our
hidden input field with a name of
cross-site request forgery key we've
already done this before so we know
exactly what to do and the value is
cross-site request forgery token so we
can now submit this form let me get
submitted perfect so now what we need to
do is focus on actually processing this
submission so as normal we bring in our
request object here app request we only
have one field so we don't really need
to do this but we'll do it to keep
consistency in case we add anything else
here it's a request post email that will
be the users email that they submitted
through we need to validate this so
we're gonna say V equals app validation
let's say V valid a and we only have one
field to validate here and that is the
email address just the email we just
created that variable in I'm gonna say
required and we also want this to be an
email so if the validation pass is
we are going to just kill this and say
past otherwise we need to output our
errors so we need to render our view
and we need to pass through here our
errors and we're gonna pass through
request so we can output the form
contents again so request there we go so
let's just check this out
when I request this we obviously have an
error but we can't see anything yet
that'll be a required error so we can
update our form to output any errors and
again we've done this before so if
errors has email can end up there and
here we can output errors dot first
email and that will give us email is
required type in something rubbish and
it would say email must be a valid email
address and what we also want to do is
store the value that the user submitted
and just in case they missed typed it so
they don't have to type the whole thing
again so because we have that request
object in there we can say if request
dot post email end our if statement
there we can say value equals and then
here we can out per request dot post
email like so so now if even if I type
rubbish and I hit that we still get that
stored so we can then go ahead and give
a real email and from that we pass and
we can then go ahead and send an email
to the user so if it does pass then what
we're going to do is grab the user
record I'm going to say user equals app
user where email equals that email I'm
going to grab the first record now if
the user can't be found we want to bash
a message otherwise we want to send an
email so let's focus on flashing that
message
so we say app flash flash that global
message and say could not find that user
and the regardless of whether we have
found a user or not we want to redirect
the user anyway so we're gonna response
redirect to app URL for home
okay so let's test this out when I
request an email blah blah we yeah error
messages if I type a valid email we send
back to the home page and we'll
eventually flash a message to say that
an email has been sent but if for
example it can't find an email address
in the database we say could not find
this user you could even keep them on
that same page and I think we will do
that actually it makes a lot more sense
so here we will redirect the user here
we will redirect them back to the
current page that we were on which is
password recover like that so if it
can't find an email we're just sending
that them back to that page you can even
implement your own validation rule if
you wanted to to make the validation
appear here so you might want to say
email exists entirely up to you how you
do this we already know how to add
custom validation rules so you can go
ahead and do that
so what we want to do otherwise is we
need to generate a long string is our
identifier and we need to hash this and
store it in the database under recover
hash will send that identifier along
with the email when they click on the
link that we forwarded we can hash that
identify look it up in the database to
make sure it matches and then we can
start the password reset process so I'm
going to say identifier I'm gonna say
app we use random Lib to generate
a string of 128 lengths now we're going
to say user update we're gonna update
recover hash and we're gonna set that to
a hashed version of that identifier so
app hash hash identifier and then we can
send the email but in here what we want
to do is flash to tell them that we've
sent the email
I haven't actually sent the email yet
we're gonna be doing that there send
email so we're gonna say we have emailed
you instructions to reset your password
so let's test this out make sure that
this works so tabby at code course comm
request reset we've emailed your
instructions to reset your password and
it looks like the recover hash hasn't
been stored so let's check this and
let's just check our user model here
just to make sure we have okay so we
haven't set the recover hash in fillable
so we need to do that now recover hash
that's why it wasn't stored so we can
update this now and let's try this again
so let's login we've forgotten our
password enter our email request a reset
and then that hash of that identifier
will have been stored there but we're
gonna get rid of that because we haven't
sent the email yet so now is the job of
creating the email view sending the
email and including that identifier so
we're going to say app mail send the
view is gonna be stored on the email or
password recover dot PHP the data that
we're sending through to this is going
to be the user so we can attach their
email to this if we want
and the identifier is going to be that
identify that we created and then we
have our call back here where we need to
use user so we know who to send it to
and we also need our message argument so
I'm going to say message to user email
I'm gonna say message subject recover
your password
okay so let's create this email view
remember it's in views email or password
and it's called recover dot PHP and
again we can steal one of the templates
from another email view that we have so
in here we're going to say you've
requested a password change and
obviously change this to whatever you
want and in here we're gonna say click
this link to reset your password and
then gonna have a link there so we check
this email sends so let's click forgot
your password enter our email and that
looks like that sensor go to our inbox
there we go
so hello there you request a password
change click this link to reset your
password but we now need to actually
insert the link here so to do this then
we need to output our base URL we need
to output the URL for the form where we
can actually reset our password so
that's going to be called password reset
we haven't created this just yet after
this we're gonna output the user's email
so we know who to look up so we're gonna
say user dot email remember we have our
user object pass to this view and we're
gonna set the identify
- that identifiers that we passed in but
remember we had problems with this
before so we need to URL encode it so
let's create this password reset root
just because otherwise this won't work
so under our routes under password let's
create our reset root this is where the
users gonna end up when they click the
link so I'm gonna say app get password
reset this user needs to be a guest to
be able to access this we're gonna use
app and for now we're just gonna say
reset and we'll give this a name of
password reset cool so we should be good
to go now unless we have any problems
but what we should now get is when we
submit a request okay
so named root out of course we forgot to
include it once again now roots so let's
include reset dot PHP and let's go and
do this again there we go we check our
email and there we see our link so let's
just take a look at this link we've got
password reset which we know we set our
root name to email and then my email
address then the identifier in here when
we click it we go through to the reset
page so we can use this page now to
build up that form that's going to allow
the user to reset their password so
let's close off of this and we need to
create a view for this password reset so
app render that's off password reset dot
PHP so let's create this view now orth
password we'll create a new file here
reset dot PHP and again we'll take the
template for
home template and paste that in there
reset password and we'll say reset for
now that looks like it doesn't find our
views so let's see what's happened here
so okay so crease this in the wrong
place let me just go ahead and move this
so let's delete this old one that's in
our email section so it's auth password
reset dot PHP and there we go so we've
got our reset form just here so our
reset form will consists of two fields a
new password and a new password
confirmation which will also validate
and then if they both match we can
update the users password and delete the
old token so the URL here is going to be
password reset dot post the method is
going to be post and we're going to turn
auto complete off so before we do
anything let's create this post root for
our reset so it's a p-- post password
reset we need to be a guest
we need to use app and we'll give this a
name password reset dot post and we'll
say here posted just so we can see that
okay so now inside of this form we need
like I said two fields so we're going to
have label for the new password which
we're just gonna call password we have
an input type of text which is going to
be called password and the idea of
passwords it matches up at the label and
again we'll copy and paste this just to
save a little bit of time this is going
to be password confirm
password confirm or in this case we'll
keep consistency and say confirm
password will change that as well and we
also want our submit button so change
password and again because this is
cross-site request forgery protected we
get a token mismatch so we need to add
that in as well so hidden input field
now cross-site request forgery key and
the value
our cross-site request forgery token
perfect we can now submit this through
and it says posted and we have the
identifier in the in the URL so what we
can do as part of the process of showing
this page this technically could now be
anything we could add a know AAA on to
the end of this URL and it still shows
this password reset form we'll get rid
of that which isn't good so as part of
this here we need to actually do a few
checks so we need to grab the email and
we need to grab the identifier so let's
create our request object that's app
request we'll set the email to request
yet remember it's get now because it's
in the query string that's our email and
then we have our identifier
and we need to hash our identifiers so
I'm gonna say hashed identifier that's
gonna be app hash hash identifier so now
what we're going to do is we're gonna
look this particular user up by their
email address if the user doesn't exist
or if they don't have a recover hash or
if the hash doesn't match we're going to
show some errors or just redirect the
user it's entirely up to you what you do
so here we're gonna actually pull the
user in by that email so I'm gonna say
app user where the email equal equals
the email that's in the forum and we'll
grab the first record and we'll say if
not user and we could say if not user or
not user recover hash or the hash
doesn't match but what I'm gonna do just
for the sake of clarity and in case we
need to do anything else I'm just gonna
do these on a sort of line by line basis
and then duplicate the redirect but of
course you can feel free to change this
around of what you think looks best so
if no user we're gonna say app response
redirect I'm gonna redirect to app URL
for home so if the user can't be found
so in this case the user can be found
but if I change this to say tabby at
code cost or org we just get redirected
to the home page the next check is if
the recovery hash doesn't exist on the
user's account for whatever reason so if
they've already recovered their password
so if no user recover hash we're gonna
do exactly the same as we do here so I'm
not going to demonstrate this because I
want this hash to still be in here but
that's gonna go ahead and redirect if it
doesn't exist and finally we want to
check that the hash or the hashed
identifier matches the hash in the
database and if it doesn't we need to
redirect off so if not app hash and
remember we have that hash check method
where we can pass in the actual known
hash which is the recovery hash sitting
in the users database record and we can
compare that with the hashed identify
that's been passed into the URL then we
can do the same thing we can redirect
off okay so once we reach this stage we
know that the password reset process can
continue we know that we've got
everything we need there's a couple of
things we need to send through to this
reset form and that is the email address
of the user and hash as well because we
need to keep this in the URL so we're
gonna add this to our view variables so
email is going to be the user's email
and the hash is going to be the
identifier that's been passed in so you
now have email and hash inside for this
reset view just here so let's refresh
everything's working fine if either the
username here or the email here can't be
found we know that we redirect or if the
identifier can't be found so let's just
get rid of that we redirect so we are
now in a good position to actually reset
the password now on the reset password
form we need to attach these to the URL
so when we submit the form so at the
moment when we submit the form we lose
the identifier we still need these
identifiers there so there are other
ways of doing this but I'm just going to
keep them in the URL so after this we're
gonna say email equals and then we'll
output that email and we'll say
identifier equals and then we'll output
that identifier and we will we've
already URL encoded it so it should be
fine here but now when we submit the
form it might not be actually let's just
check under here oh sorry hash let's
call this identifier that makes a lot
more sense
there we go so that looks like a so it's
not URL encoded you can see this part of
it change to a plus and that's not what
we want so we want to URL encode this as
well perfect that's now being posted
through and then in the post version of
this we can pick these up again and then
we can you know work with them
the alternative to doing this is to
taking to take these and put them into
the form but that makes it a little more
difficult when you're working with
validation and we show the form again so
we'll just stick with the way we're
doing it now just so it's a little bit
easier so now what we can focus on is
the actual post route so what happens
when the user posts the password and the
password confirmation well we need to be
a little bit inefficient here and we
need to do pretty much exactly the same
as we're doing here because technically
we're again looking up the email and we
are comparing the identifiers so
although I don't like doing this and
this could be extracted somewhere else
to make this a little bit better I'm
gonna paste this into here because we
are taking the request object we're
looking up the email on the identifier
which remember that we're keeping in the
URL we're then looking the user up again
so we can actually check that their
password or check the you know their
hash is correct and all that kind of
stuff check that their user account
exists check that they don't already
have a recovery hash and check that the
hash matches and then we can go ahead
and actually reset their password so
down here then once all this has been
done once we've checked all this we can
just kill the page and just say all okay
so when I submit this we get all okay
but if this does change
we're redirected off so instead of doing
that we need to validate the passwords
so we're gonna say V equals
validation I'm gonna say V validates
password and we don't actually have the
password that's been submitted through
here yet so what we're going to do is we
are going to say password equals request
host password because that's coming
through in a post request
remember these are coming in the query
string so they still get I'm gonna say
password confirm that's password
underscore confirm so these are from the
form these are from the query string
that we persisting so validating the
password it's required and we want it to
be a minimum of 6 and we have our
password confirmation which is required
I will just type confirm which is
required we don't have to have that
minimum of 6 because remember as long as
the password matches the password
confirm we're good so I'm going to say
matches password and if the validation
passes we can set the new password and
remove the recovery hash so if the
passes we want to update the user so we
already have the user here by that email
so we're gonna say user update and we're
going to set the password to the hashed
version of the password that they
submitted through in the form and we can
use our password hash up for this so
we're going to say app hash password and
we pass in the password there and we
want to remove the recovery hash because
we don't need that anymore that will
essentially allow anyone to reset the
password an unlimited amount of times
and we don't do that directly from that
same link and then what we want to do is
flash global message to say your
password has been reset and you can now
log in or sign
or whatever we want to call it so now we
want to redirect the user back to the
home page so app response redirect and
we want to grab the URL for the home
route now if the URL doesn't pass we
want to render that view and show any
errors so app render or password reset
and we're passing through here any
errors we see which is from V errors
perfect and we're not sending the
request through because we don't want to
output the passwords in the form as we
do with no part any passwords so here we
can check them errors so if errors has
password in the F there and if then if
that does have any errors we can say
errors first password and we can
duplicate this for the password
confirmation and just update these
strings or keys okay so let's check this
out
when I hit change password password is
required let's type two loads of rubbish
in here and it look like it did redirect
us so that's a little bit strange let's
just check out what might be happening
here so we've got password confirm and
what we also want to do is pass through
like we don't want here the email and
the identifier otherwise we'll see this
problem when we submit the form we get
the validation when we click again we're
redirected because these one in the URL
so we're just gonna add these here so
I'm going to say email user email and
identifier
identifier and that will just populate
them inside of the form again so when we
view the page source you can see that
they're populated in here so when we hit
this we can hit this as many times as we
want and we don't see a problem so what
we're gonna do now is just enter a load
of rubbish
our validation I've just noticed as well
that these aren't password fields so we
can go ahead and update that now so
we're gonna say a type of password and
here we'll say a type of password and
let's now choose a new password so I'm
gonna say password and password they
both match they're both large and six
change password your password has been
reset and you can sign in let's go over
to our database chain look at this hash
change when i refresh the table so
that's changed and also our recover hash
has been changed to null and I can now
go and log in with my new details so a
part of this video then we have created
the routes and the views that we need to
be able to reset the password we have
given the ability for the user to enter
their email address like so request a
reset head over to their email account
find that link in their inbox click it
update their password
we have validation in here and we change
our password and that resets our
password removing any token from the
database which means that when we click
this URL again we're just redirected
back to the home page and it doesn't
prompt us to enter our password again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
