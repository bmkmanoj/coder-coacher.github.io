2 of this tutorial on creating a very
simple drawing application in the html5
canvas element so if you'll recall last
time we're at this point where our
program would place a dot every time the
user clicks now we want to get to this
point where we have smooth lines being
drawn so let's let's have a quick recap
of where we were at in code so we had
this very simple markup with our canvas
element and then we were hooking up to
JavaScript just like so we then added
this event listener which would execute
a function put point every time it
receives a mouse down and that put point
function would draw the circle that we
wanted now there are a couple of things
I want to point out about where we left
off last time so firstly last time I
mentioned this thing about the margin:0
on the body which was supposed to get
rid of scroll bars because if we have
our canvas the whole width of the
browser and then have margin either side
we're going to get scrollbar and a
couple of you may have noticed that we
do have scroll bars anyway so why is
that so by default a canvas element has
a display of inline so like this this is
the default and what this means is that
it displays in line with the text but it
also means that it has line height so if
you think about lines of text you have a
small margin between the bottom of one
line and the top of the other and that's
essentially what we're getting with
canvas so there's a tiny margin at the
bottom which is what is which is what is
creating our scroll bars so if we change
this to display block and we're just
going to do this in the opening tag
again like we did in the margin just for
simplicity we do that and then refresh
you'll see we get rid of our scroll bars
and that really is something to bear
and whenever you're working with the
canvas especially if you're going to
make it the entire height of the window
the other thing I do want to point out
about where we left off last time was
this offset X property that we use this
is a property of the event object that
we were passed from our event listener
now the offset X property returns the
offset of the event relative to the
event target so in this case the event
target is our canvas and this offset X
and the offset Y is very useful because
you have to use it so often well
unfortunately it's not very well
standardized so Firefox for example does
not support this property so instead
we're going to be using the client X and
client Y properties the client X and
client Y properties return the x and
y-coordinates relative to the actual
browser window the reason they are
interchangeable with offset X and Y in
this case is just because our canvas is
set to the width and height of the
window so we can get rid of this line
okay so as I say we want to instead of
be drawing dots we want to get nice
smooth lines so how can we do that well
let's look at this event listener first
of all so at the moment we're listening
for mouse down and putting a point
whenever we hear that but I'm sure a lot
of you will know there are many other
Mouse events that we can listen for and
so I've pulled up this page here from
Mozilla developer Network and I will put
a link in the description in case you
want to have a look at this so this is a
table of the events that we can capture
and here are some mouse events these are
not all the mouse events that we can
capture but there are plenty here so we
have mouse down which we've already used
which is where the mouse button is
pressed down Mouse enter where the
cursor is brought onto an element Mouse
leave when a car is brought off of an
element Mouse move is whenever the mouse
moves Mouse out when it leaves in
an element or it's child there's many
you can have a look at this yourself and
mouseup of course is when the mouse
button is brought up so let's have a
look at this mousemove event if we use
mouse move in here let's see what
happens so if we change this for mouse
move go back to our browser and refresh
and you'll see we are drawing smooth
lines but there are a couple of problems
with this so firstly if we move at any
sort of speed will see that these dots
are not connected and these are just a
lot of dots and secondly we're drawing
even when the mouse button isn't held
down which is not something that we want
so this is what we're going to solve
first this issue of drawing when the
mouse button is not held down so
unfortunately there's no way no reliable
way to check if a mouse button is held
down at some particular moment we can
however make one for ourselves so if we
create a variable up here called
dragging and set that to false so this
is going to be whether or not our mouse
buttons help down so we're going to set
this to false to start with we're going
to assume that when the user loads the
page they're not going to have their
mouse button held down and then we want
to set this to true when the mouse is
held down and then false again when it's
lifted up so this is where our events
table is going to come in handy again so
looks like we're going to want to use
Mouse down and mouse up so let's connect
to those events we're going to use event
listeners again so canvas tour add event
listener this one's going to be Mouse
down and we're going to create a
function called engage
and Gege yeah engage and we'll do the
same thing for house up and pull that
disengage and it's great those two
functions so far engage equals function
we won't need to take in the event
object this time so we'll leave that
empty and then we'll say dragging equals
true and we'll do the same thing for
disengaged and set dragging to false
all we need to do now is have put point
check if dragging is true and then only
execute its code if it is so all we need
to do for that is say if dragging then
do this premise let's have a look at
that okay so now you can see I'm moving
my mouse over the canvas and nothing is
being drawn when I hold my mouse down
we're getting our dots show up one thing
to point out is that if the user just
clicks then nothing shows up this might
not be what you want so I'm going to
have engage execute put point after it's
set the dragging to true to do this
though we will need to take in our event
object so we're going to say EE so our
event listener is going to pass in
engage the event object as its first
parameter going to name a and then we're
going to pass it on to put point so now
if we look at that that should if we
just click that should show up as well
now we're going to solve this issue of
connecting the dots we'll do this simply
by drawing a line between the dot and
the previous dot but how are we going to
get that previous point we could do this
by storing the previous point in a
variable
then using it that way instead we're
going to take advantage of the campuses
way of drawing paths so let's have a
look at that a path in the canvas is
made up of sub paths and a sub path is
just a collection of points joined
together by lines you can see over here
we have an example of a path which
contains two sub paths and envoy those
two sub paths are not connected they're
all part of the same path so let's have
a look at how you would go about
creating these sorts of paths in code so
if we imagine this grey rectangle here
as our canvas we can see how we go about
creating the path of a rectangle so the
first function we use is this begin path
function this clears any current path
and starts a new one next we use context
move two at this point nothing is drawn
but move two is set us our active point
to ten ten so let's say this point is
here the next function lying two then
draws a line from that point 10 10 to
its given point so 160 comma 10 so
that's drawn a line from here over to
here now we have the next line going
from the previous point again so 160 10
down to 160 130 we then have another
call to line two going from 160 130 to
10 130 we then use this function closed
path which just returns to the first
point in the path so as you can see
functions often use the last point that
was used so line two uses the last point
which here has been defined by move to
this next line it uses the point defined
by the previous line two and so on so
each of these is setting an active point
for the next one to use then close path
is drawing a line from the current point
to the first point and then marking that
sub path as closed before opening a new
sub path once we have our path we can do
whatever we want to it so at the moment
nothing will be showing up on our canvas
until we say context stroke or context
Phil and there are other things you can
do with that as well which will maybe go
into in the future so as you can see
there are many ways to change the active
point so I move to line to closed path
and a whole lot of others there is only
one way however to clear the active
point and that is with begin path so
what does this mean for our program well
this means that we can connect to a
previous point without having to keep it
in a variable so I'll show you what I
mean in the code so when we execute put
point I'm going to start a path at the
end after we've drawn our circle I'm
going to say contact stop begin path and
then I'm going to use move two and move
to our current Mouse's position and then
the next time we use put point I'm going
to use line two and use that same point
so now every time we use put point we're
setting up a path we're opening a path
for the next execution of put point so
now we have that path we can use stroke
to add a stroke to that and let's have a
look at what that looks like
so now you can see we have this line
connecting all the dots what we want to
do of course is make this line the
thickness of the dots so to do this
we're going to use a property of the
context called line width and we're
going to set that equal to twice the
radius so radius times two so if we say
that and have a look now we have a nice
smooth line we do still have one problem
however in that because we're leaving a
path open every time we use put point
when we click again we will connect to
the previous line to fix this we're
going to use our disengage function and
we're just going to clear the current
path using context dot begin path so
that will get rid of that point that we
added at the end of the point so now if
we look at that refresh we should have
nice smooth disconnected lines and with
that our drawing application is complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
