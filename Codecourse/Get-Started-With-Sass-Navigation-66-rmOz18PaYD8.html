building to round this series off is the
navigation at the top of the page which
thanks to the placeholder we've created
for the inline list and the transition
that we created to transition on any
element for any length of time in any
effect this isn't going to be too
difficult so let's lay out the mark-up
again first of all I'm going to do this
above the wrapper so it sits nicely at
the top of the page full width and we
are going to have another element with
the class of top nav and we can style it
the rest of all right up the rest of the
markup we can create our component and
start writing the code for this right
away so inside of here then I'm going to
have a deal for the class of logo I'm
just going to write code course in here
for now but you can obviously include an
image and feel around the stars to
position that we're also going to have
an unordered list in here and this is
going to have a class of top nav items
we could of course give this class of
inline if we wanted it if we wanted to
use in line lists but we're going to be
using the placeholder that we created
for an inline list to utilize that so we
can go ahead and add solve more custom
styles to this so inside of here we
obviously have list items and we're just
going to say something like home and
will create a few more here so videos
and get in touch okay so that's pretty
much it for the mark-up doesn't look
great at the moment but let's create our
component inside of our components
directory for our now so I'm just going
to call this nav SCSS and we can start
styling this up now so remember the
class is called top nav we're going to
set a background color here and we're
going to use a variable nav BG color so
let's define this inside of variables
let's come down here and say nav so we
want nav BG color and we can obviously
just choose a color for this I'm going
to say 444 let's define some other
variables from
while we're just in here so we're going
to have the nav text color I'm going to
have a nav link color as well so for the
text color that's going to be white and
for the link color and that's going to
be a lighter grey so back over to our
component then we have our background
color that we've already created we're
going to give our navigate of 60 pixels
we're going to set the color which we
already have a variable for is nav text
color so that's the color across the
entire nav I'm going to set the margin
on the bottom 220 pixels so let's just
preview this once we've included it
again into components list so that's now
we refresh we see the following so it's
still not looking amazing we need to
sort out this this inline list here so
what we're going to do then is we're
going to position the logo and we're
going to float this left we're going to
have a high of 60 pixels on here we're
going to have a line height of 60 as
well to Center that text vertically and
we are going to have a margin on the
left of 20 pixels and that just pulls
that into the following position the
reason for this spacing here is because
of this unordered list but we're going
to sort that out now so remember we gave
that a class of top nav items and easy
as possible we just extend inline list
which cell placeholder here remember and
that's gone ahead and magically made
that an inline list perfect so what we
can do now is float this left as well so
it sits next to the logo we can give
this a line height of 60 pixels as well
we're going to give it a margin left of
40 pixels to bring it away from the logo
and for the nav items we're going to
have point 9 m on the font size so we
see the following nice and lined up so
now inside of this we're going to nest a
so we're going to say any anger within
our top nav items unordered list we want
to display these as a block we want to
give these a high of 60 pixels because
we're going to have a hover effect on
this so we want to change the color and
we're going to set a padding of 0 on the
top and bottom I'm going to pad this out
on the left and the right so we have the
following so if we just inspect this
here we can see that each anchor is the
height of navigation so that gives us
the ability to have a large click area
and also have a background color show up
when we hover over each one of these so
again we're going to set the color we
already have a nav link color variable
for this I'm going to set the font
weight to 400 like so I'm going to
remove the text decoration you want that
to be none so we now have the following
so when we hover over these we want the
text color to be white and we can change
the background color of this entire
thing if we want to in fact we won't do
that but you can go ahead and try
implement that so what we want to do now
is we want to set this hover so let's
say hover color white and we can easily
include our transition now because we
already have the mix in created to
transition on any property for a given
length of time with any effect so we can
just easily say include transition we
can transition on color for 100
milliseconds and again we want this to
ease in so now when we hover over the
text as well as it turning white we now
have this nice transition on that and of
course what you could do is go ahead and
transition the background color as well
using the hover background mixing that
we created earlier too but I'll leave
that up to you to go ahead and try and
implement and see how you get on and you
can go ahead and rearrange this
navigation to suit you and just
play around generally just tidying up
anything you think would be better that
would be reusable so for example we can
see here that the line height would be a
really good reusable part of this
because for both the logo and the top
nav items we're setting the line height
what we could do is we could maybe
create a mix in to pass in the height of
an element and then we could create a
placeholder which go or a mixing rather
which goes ahead and gives you the line
height based on that high the vertically
aligned text but I'll leave that up to
you to go ahead and create your own mix
in to do that or anything else you think
would be necessary so we've come to the
end of this series and we've pretty much
looked at all of the features that we
would use on a daily basis when we're
writing code and compiling with sass
we've been using the S CSS syntax but of
course you're free to go ahead and use
the sass syntax if you wanted to we've
learned how to structure our application
in a way that it makes it really easy
for us to find things we automatically
know that we have mix-ins placeholders
and our entire array of variables here
as well as each one of our components
that we've built that we can just easily
click on start modifying and go ahead
and update our design so that's it a
very basic look at writing styles using
sass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
