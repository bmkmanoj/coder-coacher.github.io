of development we can't really get out
of using them but what we can do is
apply some very basic rules to just tidy
up the way that we actually use if
statements so there's a couple of things
that we're going to go over a couple of
bits of advice I'm gonna give you and
when you start to apply these to your
projects you'll find that actually your
code looks and reads a lot cleaner so
just to start with let's look at a basic
example let's just say we had some kind
of user model and inside of here we had
some kind of method which allowed us to
grab the full name now the whole reason
that we would use a method in here is
because what we'd want to do is
concatenate the first name with a space
and then the last name and that would
avoid us having to repeat code
throughout our application now what we
would need to do in this case is check
if the user had a first name and a last
name potentially they don't have either
so what we would do is something like
the following so we would create an if
statement we would say if this first
name and this last name and then from
this we would then return maybe this
first name and then we would concatenate
on this last name so pretty
straightforward
now what we might do as a default is
just return null or return an empty
string or whatever you would expect to
see here now this is going to be a
really basic example and I'm gonna try
and explain why this is best practice
but generally what I found when I
developed the rule is always return what
you're expecting last eg do the checks
that you need first and then don't nest
any of the return values that you'd
expect to see and hopefully by the time
you switch this around you'll see why
this is the case so what I would simply
do here is I would get rid of this or at
least move it down to here and then in
here I would return null but I would
return null if this didn't exist or the
last name didn't exist now the way I
look at this is what we're doing
we're doing perhaps other checks in here
as well now if we were to return this in
here and we needed to do another check
that of course would mean we may have to
duplicate this line so I always tend to
do is the expected return value I add
last and then inside of here I can do as
many checks as I want returning null
throwing exceptions whatever you need to
do obviously this is a really basic
example but hopefully you get the idea
so that's just what I would do in some
kind of method to me this looks a lot
cleaner now I can see oh I'm returning
null here if these don't exist and then
finally I'm returning my expected value
so now that we've done this let's look
at a slightly more complex example and
this kind of involves nesting if
statements and also using if-else now
obviously by this I mean saying if and
then else and then by nesting I mean
placing another if statement inside an
if statement and then potentially
another one inside of there this tends
to get really messy really quickly and
when you're trying to debug when you're
trying to go back and change things this
is an absolute nightmare I've been there
in the past and I'm sure you have too so
let's look at an example kind of pseudo
example of what we would happen if we
uploaded a file so the first thing we
would want to do is check if that far
was sets now obviously this isn't real
code it's not gonna work but you may do
something like this or you may check the
file super global whatever now what you
might have inside of here is another
check now that you know that file has
been set and this check might see if the
file extension is within a list of
allowed file extensions so you may do
something like if in array file
extension which you would have created
earlier and then maybe in allowed file
extensions like so now obviously this is
a very simple example but in this case
we may go ahead and upload the file now
otherwise so let's say we have an else
we might say return and this might be
somewhere where we error and we redirect
the user back with that specific error
now there's still one
thing we might add it up to this if the
file doesn't exist we might want to tell
the user so we would add another else on
here we would return and again here we
would error and redirect now you might
not see anything immediately wrong with
this but obviously this is a really
simple example and for more advanced
functionality you're going to end up
with lots of lots of if statements
nesting else's now I'm gonna tell you
you can do exactly what we've done here
without using an else and without
nesting so you can very quickly and
easily tidy this up and so it reads a
lot better so to do this then let's just
comment this out so we can refer to it
and see what we're doing now think about
it this way think about checking things
that are negative much like the example
we looked at the user model we said well
if the user doesn't have a first name or
they don't have a last name
then we just want to return null now in
this case we can do exactly the same
thing so rather than saying if it is set
we're gonna check here if it's not set
so we would say if not is set dollar
underscore post file or again using the
file super global then we want to do
that return and we want to error and re
direct the user now that's all we need
to do because at this point you are kind
of breaking the flow of your application
and you may be redirecting the user here
so that would redirect and you could
show an error now the next check is
obviously the in array so in this case
we would do another if statement on the
same level so there's no nesting here or
so we would say in array file extension
allowed file extensions and again we
would say if it's not in there so again
we're checking for a faulty value and
then we're erroring and potentially
redirecting now it's important to note
at this point that you would have to
break the flow at this point so either
it's a very simple application kill the
page here return if it's some kind of
method or use a redirection here whether
using a framework or just from raw PHP
so now all that's left to do down here
is upload the file because you've
redirected someone off if something went
wrong now
here you consume well everything's fine
so I can just go and upload the file so
it really is as simple as that
just thinking about taking an example
like of this or you may have some code
at the moment that does look like this
and just thinking about it in this way
and you'll end up with a much cleaner if
statement easier to read easier to
maintain which is really important with
in development</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
