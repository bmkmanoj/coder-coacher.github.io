but it's equally as important and very
useful is auditing the current page that
you're on
so by auditing what we mean is chrome
developer tools is going to go ahead and
analyze this page and it's going to give
you suggestions of how you can improve
the performance of this page so what we
can do is head over to the audit tab
just here and we can choose the audits
that we want to run so one is network
utilization and the other is webpage
performance so we'll go ahead and choose
both of them so what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to choose to reload
the page and add it on load so it's
going to refresh the entire page it's
gonna audit everything so any external
files that we're pulling through its
gonna audit javascript CSS and things
like caching as well so if we hit run
that go ahead that goes ahead and
refresh is the page and it gives us any
suggestions just here so for example
network utilization so it's things like
combining external javascript we've got
four JavaScript files on this page which
could be combined into one to reduce the
amount of HTTP requests we make to this
page we also have things like leverage
browser caching proxy caching and
minimizing the cookie size but probably
the things that we can just immediately
improve on are things that come under
the web page performance section so for
example we could optimize the order of
the stars and the script so if you read
through this it does give you some good
advice we can remove unused CSS rules so
this tells us that 95% of CSS from the
start sheet that we're loading in is not
being used on the current page and also
use normal CSS property names instead of
vendor prefixed ones so there are
various suggestions here that you can
either choose to follow or ignore but
it's without a doubt an extremely useful
part of just making sure that your page
is running as fast as possible by using
these order</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
