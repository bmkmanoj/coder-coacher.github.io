building a language chooser with laravel
we'll go ahead and take a look at how
this works first then we'll install our
eval and when actually build this so you
can see I've got a drop down here with
two choices of language I've also got a
button to go ahead and submit this and
you can see I've got the text hello down
here I want to go ahead and change to
German and click choose that goes ahead
and sets a session which will store the
fact that we want to use German for our
languages and therefore we'll pick up
from our German language file so we'll
be looking at localization in laravel
and also the functionality to build this
form to actually allow us to do this now
this doesn't require a user setting so
it's perfect for if you're using non
authentication on your website and if
the user leaves the website and comes
back this will just go ahead and reset
back you can of course store this as a
cookie if you wanted to in this case
I'll just be working with sessions so
let's go ahead and install our eval
quickly using composer and then we'll go
ahead and in the next part look how we
start setting this up so I have an empty
directory here called language chooser
I've also got my terminal open and I'm
going to go ahead and install composer
using curl if using Windows or another
operating system this may vary if you
don't have curl available but go ahead
over to get composer to org and you'll
be able to find installation
instructions for you so I'm going to go
ahead and install this and once it's
done we can go ahead and use composer to
install our eval so I'm going to say PHP
composer pH AR and then say create
project laravel slash laravel and i want
to prefer the distribution so laravel is
now installed let's just go ahead and
check that everything's worked so we
head over to our browser you can see
I've got laravel directory here but go
over to the public directory you can see
that larvell has been successfully
installed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
