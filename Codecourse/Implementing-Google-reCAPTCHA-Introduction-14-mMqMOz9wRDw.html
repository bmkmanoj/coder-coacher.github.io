implementing recapture to prevent
automated form submission the first
method that we're going to use is doing
everything that's already available to
us with just vanilla pure PHP and the
second we're going to actually pull down
the recapture library with composure so
it's entirely up to you which method you
choose they both have exactly the same
outcome
it's just the second method is a little
bit bit better if you're working within
a framework and this first method is
just better if you want to just build it
not have to use composer so let's take a
look at how this works you can see I've
got a fake signup form here I'm going to
go ahead and enter my email address and
I'm going to click on I am NOT a robot
that's going to validate that sometimes
something pops up just to ask me to
click a few pictures or something either
way what we can now do is hit sign up
and what we're actually doing here is
we're just dumping this object and we'll
be looking at how we can check if this
has been successful we're not going to
actually be redirecting and stuff
because that's entirely up to you how
you implement that but in this case we
have a success because we successfully
validated this now otherwise if we were
to say not check it or it worth it were
to fail you can see here we actually get
success false and then we get a list of
errors so you can detect the problem
that's gone wrong and you can redirect
the user accordingly again we're not
going to be looking at this it's not
really important we're more focused on
the actual implementation you can do
whatever you want show an error message
and an implement it how you want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
