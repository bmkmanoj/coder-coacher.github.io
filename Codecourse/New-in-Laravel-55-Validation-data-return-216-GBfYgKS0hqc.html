controller with laravel 5.5 there's an
easy way to get back the data you're
validating and this just further helps
to clean up your controllers so in this
example I have a very simple form where
I can go ahead and update my name if we
have over to the controller just here
very very simply we're calling this
valid a passing through our request
object so at laravel validate you can
extract that data and use it to validate
the name alongside the set of rules that
we've required now this is where things
tend to start getting a little bit more
messy
you've already defined out what you want
to validate so it's entirely likely that
this is the data that you want to update
with so in this case we are using the
request grabbing the user but you could
just as easily use something like or
user like this if you wanted to either
way what we're doing is we are then
again going ahead and grabbing the
request data we want to update now in
this case what is happening here is we
can assign something that data to this
here and we'll take a look into this
validation or validate method in a
minute
but now we can just pass this like so so
massively clean things up this is going
to work in exactly the same way let's
just go ahead and switch this over and
prove that I work so that is a nicely
cleaned up controller if you like using
validation inside of your controller so
finally if we just head over to our
controller we can open up the validates
requests straight and we can come down
to this validate method what's happening
here then is we're using requests only
to grab the keys from the rules that
we've defined so of course that means
this just here we're grabbing and we're
passing back that data using requests
only so plugging that data route now
because of this this means that you're
not going to see all of your data in
there that you are sending through so
for example if we just do a die dump on
data just here and I was to update the
account index here to include an email
address so let's just very quickly
switch this over to our email and we'll
change all of these over as well there
we go so I want to send across an email
address as well so if I
just go ahead and update this we only
still see a name so we don't see that
email address because we haven't defined
it out inside of here now for any reason
you did want to still use this to re
update or create something in this case
if we don't receive it in there's no
need to update it but in this case you
would just use email with an empty and
you know rule like this so just no rule
at all what that means is that when you
go ahead and do hit that you're still
getting that value in here because it's
plucking it out for the request and you
can go ahead and do whatever you want in
this case you wouldn't need to do that
of course because nothing is changed
throughout the email address you're not
validating it so you don't need to
update it but you may still have a use
case for no validation rules required
but you still want to go ahead and
extract that so that is pretty much it a
nice way to clean up our controllers
using the data that we get back when we
validate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
