users to authenticate without
application using Google authentication
basically I'm going to show you how this
works then we'll dive in and look at the
database and how this is stored so we
are doing a little bit of database
storage as well once we've authenticated
will store the Google ID and the email
address that I authenticated with into
the database so when I hit sign in with
Google what we're basically doing is we
are passing while we're being redirected
to this URL here with various bits and
pieces if we inspect this element you
can automatically see this has been
generated will generate this using the
Google Earth API so this will all be
done for us it's not as complicated as
it looks so when I click sign-in with
Google I'm basically prompted to accept
how this app once used my details at the
moment all we're doing is we're just
reading the email address so there's
nothing really much going on here
if I hit accept this is going to
redirect us back and we're now logged in
simple as that and what you didn't see
is this is sending back a code so the
way this works is a code will be sent
back we then run that through the Google
Earth API and that will think AIT's our
session we can then set a session and we
logged in it really isn't that
complicated at all this has been made
really easy and let's take a look inside
of our database as well because we have
this table called Google users so if we
do a select everything from Google users
on this you can see that we're storing a
Google ID and an email address so if
you're authenticating users for your
application this lot might go into a
main users table you might have a
separate table it's entirely up to you
you can shop and change this but again
this allows you to keep system data
about a particular user the Google ID
will never change so as long as they
sign in with the same user details you
can store other information along with
this table record and then you can
retrieve that later so that's what we're
going to be building let's go ahead and
say everything up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
