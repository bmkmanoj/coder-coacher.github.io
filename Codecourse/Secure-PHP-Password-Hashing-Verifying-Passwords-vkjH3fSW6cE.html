ahead and do now is now that we've
learned how to hash a password we're
going to go ahead and hash a password
store it as if we were storing in our
database and then we'll go ahead and use
the password verify function to check
that the password supplied is correct so
we'll basically go back to the example
we looked at in the first video and
we'll basically recreate this but with
the password hash in the password verify
functions as part of the password
hashing API so the first thing we want
to do is basically create a hash as we
learn in the last video so let's go
ahead and do that now and then we'll
sort of fake store it in a variable and
we'll check that against the supply
password so I'm going to go ahead and
echo out password hash and we'll go
ahead and choose a password we'll just
call this password and we'll go ahead
and provide a password bcrypt
algorithm and I'm going to go ahead and
provide some options here one option
specifically and that's the cost my
hardware can handle around about 12
without seeing a bad page load so now
that we've got that let's go ahead and
just echo that out onto the page you can
see that we get the hash here so I'm
going to go ahead and copy this and I'm
going to go ahead and store it inside of
a variable here as if it was a stored
password in the database so let's just
imagine that you have allowed a user to
register on your website you would go
ahead and you'd store this inside a
password field in your database table so
now what we now want to do is go ahead
and create a little if statement with an
else and this is basically going to
check that a password that we provide is
acceptable so all we need to do here is
we don't need to have rehash anything we
can use the password verify function and
this will return true or false value
whether or not that password matches so
it's fairly straightforward all we need
to do is say password password verify so
we provide two arguments here the first
one is the password the sort of plain
text password and then it's the hashed
password so let's go ahead and compare
something else now my stored password is
password very very insecure but as an
example so I'm going to go ahead and
provide ABC as the password so now we
just basically compare this with the
stored password so this is going to do
all the work for you it's going to take
the soul and the cost and it's going to
you know rehash what you provide here
and then compare it to the hashed value
so here we would say you're in else we
would say try again so in this case what
do you think we're going to get well
we're going to get this output because
ABC does not basically equal the hash
password here so let's go ahead and
refresh and it says try again obviously
so notice that we also get a slightly
slower loading page here because I've
used a hashing cost of twelve so bear
that in mind when you are doing this you
might think to yourself well when I
generate a hash I don't want to use a
weighting say a few seconds for the
server to process the hash or hash the
password however when you go ahead and
sign in or verify the password it's
going to happen exactly the same deal so
let's go ahead and provide the correct
password and see that this works and
we'll just get the output you're in and
then we go so it works so this is
extremely straightforward and that's one
of the benefits of using the password
hashing API with PHP is that everything
is provided for you in a really really
secure way so the only real two
functions that you absolutely need to go
ahead and generate a hash and verify
hash is password hash and password
verify and we've looked at verifying a
password in this way doing this pulling
this from your database or in this case
it's just a variable up here to
demonstrate the password that the user
provides and that's it everything is
securely verified for us and we know
whether we can let the user sign in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
