looking at the symphony of our dumper
component and how it can improve when
you dump out something you're trying to
maybe de bark or just look at the state
of and what we're also going to do is
then go ahead and integrate this into
the slim 3 framework not only just
within your roots or controllers but
also directly within your views as well
so let's take a quick look at how this
looks if I just pull up this project
here that we're going to be working on
all we're doing here is creating a very
simple root and we are rendering a home
view now just as a very quick example
let's kill the page here and instead of
doing something like VAR dump like you
may be used to or doing something like
echo and then wrapping this within pre
tags we're going to go ahead and we're
going to use the dump function that
comes with the symphony VAR dump a
component and i'm just going to go ahead
and dump the response object here that
we get injected into slim roots so if we
head over to the browser you can see
here we've got a much nicer looking
dumped version of that response object
on its own it wouldn't look very good we
can go ahead and just switch this over
just so you can see how this might look
and you can see that obviously the dump
function here is doing a much better job
of showing us what we need now not only
that but when you are working maybe
within slim maybe within any other kind
of framework but you are using twig then
you may want to go ahead and use this
inside of your views as well so if we
just head over to the home dock quick
view you can see that i'm doing a dump
here on request and i'm passing this
through to this view as well now if we
go ahead and give this a refresh you can
see that not only did we get this we
also see this nicely dumped out on the
page as well so if you are having any
problems trying to debug things that
you're passing through to your view then
this is really going to help you and the
setup for this honestly is not that
difficult at all so going to go ahead
and get this done and then you can use
this going forward on any of your
projects just to speed up seeing what
you're working with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
