you to record compress and upload videos
all within the browser and what's really
exciting about this is it does save a
lot of time you don't have to do any of
this stuff yourself if you're building a
project that involves video uploading
the usual steps would be to upload the
raw video to your server
maybe compress it or even not compress
it which isn't a good idea and if you
did compress it this does take time to
kind of develop these things in and it
also takes a long time and a lot of
processing when you actually are
compressing and then you'd have to
obviously have to store it somewhere so
you'd have to either transfer this over
to a service or store it on your web
server which obviously isn't a good idea
so of course the other option is to go
ahead and set this up yourself using AWS
and their architecture but again this is
incredibly complicated and you'll still
have to build all of the front-end stuff
yourself and of course then you're gonna
have bugs and things are gonna break so
it's much better in my opinion and I've
always said this about anything that's
available it's always good to use things
that have been built and tested rather
than building things yourself sometimes
it's fun to play around with things but
I love this because it just works so the
other great thing about this is it lets
you record directly from your webcam and
again go through the compression and
upload much like any video that you may
drag into it and you can upload to
targets like Amazon s3 YouTube and
Microsoft Azure now the great thing
about this is you don't even have to
pull in any other dependencies it's all
handled automatically all within the
browser so we're gonna take a look at
how this is implemented I've created an
example and then we'll talk a little bit
more about it and of course throughout
the series we're gonna take a look at
the implementation and then finally
we're gonna go on and build a really
cool video sharing website so let's take
a look at how this works then you can
see here that we've got a clip champ
button I'm just using the clip trap
button I've pulled in some JavaScript
and
go ahead and set this all up so all I
want to do is click this button you'll
see a pop up here and what we can do is
either record from the webcam which is
really cool or we can go ahead and just
maybe drag a file in so you can see that
when I drag this in we have a preview of
it here I'm gonna go ahead and submit
this so this will just upload and I have
this targeted at Amazon s3 so now that
that's uploaded nothing's happened but
we'll look at the kind of implementation
of doing things with the uploaded video
later I head over to my bucket in Amazon
s3 and then go ahead and refreshing the
videos there so I can technically go
ahead and store the path in my database
and then we could play this back later
to build a video sharing website that
we're going to be doing in the next
section is made extremely simple with
this service so the great thing here is
that the video we've uploaded is also
going to work perfectly on a mobile
device the playback is compatible and
the videos you upload can be streamed on
a mobile device and obviously the webcam
recording the upload doesn't use any
third-party software like flash because
as soon as you bring them kind of
dependencies in you start to have a
problem this is just pure html5 goodness
so as you'd expect this has really great
cross browser compatibility with modern
browsers as well so that really helps so
we're going to take a look about how we
get set up the different features and
settings that we can use and then we're
going to move on to build exactly what
we've just seen here and then like I
said later on we'll build a really cool
project to share videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
