fresh laravel installation or project
that you've already been working on in
our routes file I just have a view being
returned by this closure here and all
that's doing is showing this welcome
page you can download the mark-up for
this welcome page from the course
downloads and I'll go through each of
these and what we've included here so as
I mentioned we're going to be looking at
doing this using bootstrap so just using
their alert component I'm also going to
be using sweet alert which is a
replacement for Java scripts just a
normal alert so in this case you can see
that we just get a normal alert and here
just gives us the flexibility to add a
really nice message there's tons of
information here on suil ER if you want
to go ahead and dive into anything in
more detail okay so what we need to do
then is under public CSS and jas I've
just downloaded the sweet alert files
you can obviously install these however
you want using something like bowery if
you wanted to however you're pulling
them in as long as you have them
available within your project that you
can include in then that's great you can
see here that I'm loading in the sweet
alert stylesheet up here and I'm loading
in these sweet to that JavaScript down
here both of which are required for
sweet Allah and I'm also pulling in the
bootstrap CSS as well and that's just
coming from a CDN and you can see that
over on bootstrap under getting started
so you can go ahead and copy this if you
want to so now that we've got everything
set up
we just need to test the displaying of
these before we actually do anything
with the co course notify package so to
show a sweet alert message we just use
the sweet alert or the SW al function we
pass in the title and message and then
the type and there are a ton of other
options as well that will give you
something like the following that's what
we're going to be doing where we
redirect from another route so the next
step is to test our Twitter alerts and
for this we create a div for the class
of alert and let me give it a type so we
have something like alert success
or anything like that I learn error
whatever you want to do and you can see
that renders that there and you can just
write a message in there and you'll see
it like that so pretty standard stuff so
once we're in this position we can
actually go ahead and install the co
course notify package which are allow us
to easily from any controller or with
any route closure flash these messages
and display them within a view so let's
head on to the next part where we
actually download notify</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
