actually subscribe ourself to this list
so we can start testing it out now the
process to do this is as follows we're
going to submit this form which you can
see in the mark up here is just a form
we've got a post method so we can pick
this up using PHP post superglobal and
we are submitting this back to itself
this can obviously go anywhere you like
in this case we're going to do all the
logic at the top of this page so we've
got two fields here we've got a name
field which is called name we can
identify that within the post super
label and we've got email fairly
straightforward so once you've got your
form set up we can go ahead and we can
do a little checkup here to check if
these two values are set so we want to
check if name and email a set now if
they are let's store these in variables
so we can just quickly reuse them later
there we go now what we need to do is
validate this email address using mail
guns API as I mentioned earlier just to
make sure that it's a valid email so we
create a validate variable and we call
mail gun validates which is what we set
up earlier so that's in init dot PHP
here okay so what we then want to do is
use the get method here and we want to
the end point here is address validate
what we then do is pass in an array and
we pass in the address that is the email
now immediately from this we want to get
the response body like so and then down
here we want to actually check if it's
valid now before we go any further let's
just do a print our on validate so let's
pass in my name and let's pass in
my email address and hit subscribe so
that goes through makes a call to the
mailgun API and it says here or this
basically returns us with an object we
can see is valid is one so we know
that's valid now if we were typing in an
email address like a spam email address
or something like that or in fact just
an invalid email address like Alex and
we hit subscribe you can see is valid is
empty so we can use this to check so we
can say if validate is valid then we can
go ahead and we can do what we want now
you might want to have an else here to
maybe add an error somewhere or for the
user somewhere telling them that
something went wrong but in this case we
won't bother here so now what we're
going to do is I'm going to create a
hash and this basically takes the list
the secret phrase that we added in init
dot PHP here and this will also take an
email address which is the user's email
address now this will generate a unique
hash which will allow the user to then
confirm their subscription by email so
we want to call the mailgun opt in
method and there's a method that chains
onto this called generate hash so
remember we did this here this is the
opt in handler so the opt-in handler
deals with generating these hashes so we
say mailgun opt in generate hash so the
parameters we need the mailgun list
again that's stored here so the actual
list that we want to subscribe the user
to mailgun list and we also want to pass
in the secret as I mentioned mailgun
secret and we want to pass in the user's
email address so again let's do a print
our on hash and we'll see what this
contains or we can just echo it actually
because it's literally just going to be
a string so let's so refresh this page
and let's enter some valid information
here and hit subscribe and that gives us
back this rather long hash so this hash
we can then pass through to an email the
way this is going to work is we're going
to use the mail gun send message method
to send an email to the user confirming
their subscription we're then going to
forward them to our confirm page and in
our confirmed page we can pick up this
hash check it against the API and then
add them as a confirmed subscriber to
this list so we want to say mail gun
send message and all this does is just
sends an email to the user the first
parameter is the domain we store this
again as a constant here so that's just
our domain whether it's the sandbox or
domain that you've added so we say mail
gun domain and then we have an array
with the parameters that we want to send
through to the API in this case we want
to choose a from address and I'm going
to say this is from no reply app PHP
academy' de org and we also have a to
address this is very straightforward
it's just the users email that they've
typed in the subject of the email this
can be anything please confirm your
subscription to us and then last but not
least is the message so you can either
provide a text message here so text or
HTML in this case I'm going to provide
HTML because what I want to do is I want
to send in here hello name I just want
to quickly replace these variables in we
can do a couple of line breaks here and
we can say you signed up to our mailing
list and this can come from anywhere it
could be a template a separate file that
you've stored that you can include in or
anything so please confirm below so
we're just gonna let's just do a couple
more line breaks here and we want to
basically forward the user to
our confirm page so if we look inside of
here we have this confirm dot PHP page
so let's copy and paste this into here
this is going to be wherever your
confirm file is and we're going to put
the we're going to create a get or in
the query string we're going to pick
this up using yet so we say hash equals
hash like that so that's the hash that
we generated here so now that we've done
that that's going to send an email to
the user and it's going to confirm their
subscription fairly straightforward but
we're not finished quite yet what we
want to do is actually add the user to
our mailing list before so the reason
that we're adding them before is at
least we can then add them as a non
subscribed user and then we can update
that later when they can confirm their
subscription so we're just going to say
mailgun host and the end point here is
lists and this is going to be our
mailgun list so I'll just put an X there
for now forward slash members so in
place of X let's go ahead and
concatenate on probably guest mailgun
list so now this takes an array and we
can pass through all of the information
we need to so we're going to pass in the
user's name that's just their name we're
going to pass in the user's email
address which is obviously their email
address and we're going to set the
subscribed here just state then these
are little to no so this is going to add
the user and then all we're going to do
it's forward to the current directory so
this would obviously in place of what
I'm doing now you would put something
like a redirect to a page telling the
user they've subscribed so let's test
this out bear in mind that inside of our
mailing lists here when we click on this
we can see the mailing list recipients
after I've submitted the SUBSCRIBE form
you'll see the user added here
hopefully so let's send my full name and
my email address now remember this is
also going to send me an email allowing
me to confirm so if I hit subscribe now
okay that looks like it was okay so
let's head over to mailing lists and
just refresh and there we go there's my
email address my full name and my
subscription status in this case I'm
currently unsubscribed but I've now
received an email asking me to confirm
my subscription and it's got the full
URL to the confirmed PHP file and it
includes the hash so now what we're
going to do is I'm going to click on
this and I'm going to pull this over
here we're now going to create the
functionality which reads in this hash
and validates the hash and then allows
us to confirm our subscription so what
we need to do inside of here then is if
we go over to confirm dot PHP we're not
doing anything in here but we are
including all of the functionality that
we need in obviously the first thing
that we want to do is we want to check
if this hash is actually set so we're
just going to check if that's set like
that and then we're going to say hash is
and we're going to use again the mail
gun opt-in method to validate the hash
remember last time we use it to generate
the hash inside of subscribe here now
we're validating that hash so we need to
pass in the mail gun secret this is
where the out basically the secret gets
paired up and we can check this is valid
and we then pass in ash so once we've
done that what we can then do is do a
print our on hash and see what it gives
us so let's hit refresh and you can see
it gives me the details about my
subscription if we get say one character
wrong in here let's just done an X in
front of this we get nothing so that
this means that this can only be
confirmed by the user let's receive the
email so now that we have validated the
hash what we can do is we can actually
um check this so if we do a VAR thumb on
hash you can see that we get an array
back if we type a wrong thing it says
false so we can use this in an if
statement so in here we're going to say
if hash and inside of here we can then
start to extract the information the
first thing we need is the list remember
this is an array so we can take from it
the mailing list so if we just copy that
paste that into there and we take the
users email and that is recipient
address so we take that and we paste
that into there so now that we've done
that we need to update the users
subscription status so we say mailgun
put and the end point here is lists and
then the mailgun list and members and
then /the member email address so we'll
put Y there so for the list we know that
we've got this stored as a constant so
we can just say mailgun list and for the
member we know that's the email address
so we can concatenate on the email that
we took from here so now we can pass an
array here with the options that we want
to update in this case is literally just
the subscribed status subscribed yes so
remember here we did subscribe no now
once we validated this we didn't
subscribe yes now what we want to do is
send an email to tell the user that
they're now subscribed and thank them so
we're going to say mailgun send message
exactly the same functionality as we did
here here so mailgun send message we
need to provide the domain which is
obviously this domain our sandbox domain
and we then pass in an array of
parameters so from again is just going
to be no
reply at PHP academy' de org and to is
obviously going to be to the users email
which we extracted here the subject can
be whatever you want and then we have
the Audie which is going to be HTML or
it could just be text in this case it
really doesn't matter
there we go that's it so after we've
done that we're going to just redirect
to the current folder in your case you
would probably say to your user thanks
for confirming maybe do something else
so in this case now when we're going to
refresh this our hash is going to be
validated here we're going to update the
users subscription status and we can
check that from the male gun control
panel and we then send an email so we
can check both of these things so if we
refresh now that redirects us back let's
go over to the mailing list and hit
refresh and you can see that the
subscription status has changed from
unsubscribe to subscribed and we've also
received the email saying thanks for
confirming you're now subscribed so we
have now successfully subscribed user to
our mailing list we've done it in a nice
fashion which means they have to confirm
their subscription so people can't sign
other people up and they get a nice
friendly email when they've subscribed
so what we're next going to look at is
actually sending out this email to
everyone that has subscribed to this
list and it's really easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
