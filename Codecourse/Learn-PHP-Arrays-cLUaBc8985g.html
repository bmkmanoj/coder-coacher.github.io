how to create an array what can be
stored in an array and how we inspect
arrays to find out quickly what values
are in there using the print our
construct which is extremely useful so
let's take a look at the the basic
syntax of creating an array I'm going to
create a variable called names and to
this I'm going to assign an array so we
have the array keyword here and we have
some brackets here now it looks like a
function but it isn't in this case all
we're going to do is we're going to
store data within this array of whatever
type that we choose again we don't need
to declare which type of data we're
storing in here it's very basic and all
this is is it's a collection of data and
all it is is really just yes is a list
of data and but there are certain
differences between how we represent
this data whether it be an associative
array or a numeric array so in this case
we're just going to create a very very
basic array we'll go ahead and inspect
it and see what what's actually
happening here so I'm going to create a
comma separated list of values and these
are strip or string values we can
actually mix up the type of values as
well we don't have to have all strings
or all numbers it doesn't make a
difference
if we go ahead and look at this now
browser it doesn't error or anything
like that we we can mix up the values if
we want to generally you won't mix up
values if you're creating arrays
yourself if you're pulling data from a
database and you have different fields
with different values and you're pulling
back data as an array you might of
course end up with different types but
again it's a loosely typed language so
if we're using type checking when we're
looping through arrays it doesn't make a
difference we can we can check things so
anyway we've got three values in this
array let's go ahead and try and echo
out this array and we'll see what
actually happens you'll see here that
when we refresh we get a notice so not a
fatal error or anything like that array
to string conversion and then we just
get this
Rhea keyword output here so it's telling
us that this is the data type of an
array and in actual fact we are trying
to convert it to a string when it's not
a string so what can we do here to take
a look at what you know imagine if we
didn't know what was in an array how can
we actually find out what's in this
array in and and a little bit more about
how this is represented what we can do
is we can use print R and pass through
and arraign this works with things like
objects as well in PHP too so when we
refresh we see array as we saw before
but now what we're guessing is a list of
the values that are stored within our
array and we can see that these are
indexed by numbers starting from 0 so 0
indexed array now and this is called a
numerical array where we access elements
of the array by the numbers that they're
stored at in a position so in this case
Alex is a position 1 but it's actually
at position 0 as defined by this this 0
index so 0 1 2 so that can be a little
confusing whereas if you want to get the
first element of an array you have to
say I want that that value at position 0
which actually means the first value now
this looks a little strange so what
we're going to do is we're just going to
echo out some pre formatted HTML HTML
element around this and what this will
do is it'll actually preserve the
formatting and it will give us a bit a
nicer list to look at and it just makes
a little bit more sense now we can of
course pass true to this and that will
remove about that little one item there
so we now see that we have an array with
0 1 2 and the values that we've defined
here but what if we wanted an
associative array now what we can do is
we can for example say and to tidy this
up I'm just going to pull this down a
little bit like this like that now what
happens if I want to say person or to
get rid of these but I want to say their
name
is Alex there age is 24 and their
location is London so I've now done is
I've actually created an associative
array I'm going to go ahead and change
this to person and we'll just take a
look at how this looks and you'll notice
that we'll remove these we'll get rid of
these numeric values here because we've
now created an association between this
key and this value so this is the key of
the array here and this is the value so
we now have an array that's holding
details about person but we're actually
identifying what that data is by these
associations here so that's all well and
good but how do we go ahead about
accessing this kind of data well as we
previously saw let's just go ahead and
get rid of this so as we previously saw
let's just change that back to names we
have three elements to our array and as
long as we are good to go what we can do
is we can actually access these by their
by the numeral II so I could say echo
names 0 so this is basically taking the
position 0 and outputting the value
that's within that so in this case we
use square notation for arrays so I'm
gonna go ahead and refresh we get Alex
output here because that's a that's an
index 0 in this array the same of if I
was to use one when i refresh we get the
same Billy and what we can also do is
interestingly we could say pause equals
1 for example pause equals 2 and we can
pass in pause like that and what that
will do is it will get the position at 2
because we've store that in a variable
so we can also mix things up a little
bit now if we were to use an associative
array it works in exactly the same way
so we can do let's just get rid of this
we can do to change that to person we
can do exactly the same thing we can
echo
person but this time we don't want to
say zero well let's just see what
happens if we do that so it now says a
notice undefined offset zero so the
offset is the position and we don't
actually have that available to us so we
can't access zero although this is
technically position zero or the first
position we can't actually access it
like that so instead we say position
name so this time we can say refresh
there we go so we could do something
like echo my name is X and I am Y years
old and I live in Z so we can go ahead
and replace these and we can say person
name I am Y years old so person age and
I live in and we can say person location
so what we can now do is actually access
these elements of the array and output
them into a string using the associative
position so the the keyword that we give
to them to be able to access their
values so that's a very basic overlook
of arrays we basically built learn how
to build an array and inspect an array
to see if it's a numeric or associative
array and then we've learned how to
actually access the values of an array</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
