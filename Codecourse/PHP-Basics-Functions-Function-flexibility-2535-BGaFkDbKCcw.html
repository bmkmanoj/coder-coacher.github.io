functions but now we're going to look at
things that we can do inside of
functions because it's highly likely
that you'll need to return different
things under different conditions now
let's stick with the same example we're
gonna use the full name example and
let's just say that you are attempting
to get the full name of a user so we
know that in here we accept in a first
name and what we're gonna do this time
is we're going to set the last name to
an optional value what we can also do is
we could set this to null this would
probably be more appropriate because
what we're doing here is we're saying
well if the last name isn't provided
tossing this function set it to null now
the main reason for doing this is that
null is a very easy value to check we
can check if something's null within an
if statement very easily and then we can
do something according to that so in
here what we would normally do is we
would return let's say the first name
and then a space and then we would go
ahead and return the last name now if we
go ahead and use this so if we echo out
full name and pass in a full name into
this like so we know that it works in
exactly the same way we just get the
full name now what happens if for
example we also had in here this
separator and that was by default a
space and we go ahead and pull this in
like so
however what happens if we don't provide
a last name because that's not required
so what we're gonna do refresh this and
we have the result we want but actually
what we've got is an extra space so
let's say by default the separator was
an underscore and we get the following
now it may be the case that we want to
check if a last name has been provided
we don't want this underscore in here so
how do we deal with this well we can use
a very simple if statement to check if
the last name isn't provided and then
return a different value you can have
multiple return values within a function
if you want now it's important to note
at this point if I were to return say
Alex here just as an example we now have
return here
and return here now what do you think is
going to happen if we return here then
are we gonna run the rest of this code
and to prove this we can echo something
out here as well just to see what
happens so by doing this what we're
actually doing is not seeing either
hello or this here the reason being is
whenever we use return this will
essentially just exit out of the
function and it will return the value
that we've provided so by doing this
it's not really gonna work we need an if
statement to check if the last name is
null and if it is we just want to return
the first name so in here you have a lot
of control over what you do it really
depends on what you're building but in
this case we would say if last name and
we can either say does it equal null or
we can use a exclamation mark to say if
not last name now the more correct way
to do this would be to do this and it
kind of reads a little bit better as
well so now if that's the case we just
want to return the first name of course
we don't need the separator and we don't
need the last name because it's not
being provided in this case so hopefully
that makes sense let's go ahead and use
the full name just to see what we get
here there we go we get that underscore
as well and now if I don't provide my
last name we just get that value so at
this point we are doing this so inside
of here you can do pretty much whatever
you want in a function you can loop if
you want you could provide multiple if
statement it's really up to you now what
you can also do just lastly is just use
a return on its own now in this case if
we were to provide say an empty string
for the first name then of course we
probably don't want to continue at all
we don't need to output anything now in
this case what we could do is create an
if statement and we could say if first
name equals an empty string and what we
could in fact do is say trim which is
another PHP function which will
basically strip any white space from the
left and right hand side off of the
variable and in this case we have this
one then we might just want
to return now we can just use this on
its own we're not returning a value this
will actually return null from the
function so if we were to do full name
and provide a load of spaces this
obviously doesn't make sense so if we
refresh you can see we get nothing in
here and of course what we can do using
what we learned about far dump and print
are we can do a var dump on the return
value of this and you see that that's
null now again if I go ahead and I
provide Alex in here you can see that we
get the string Alex and again if I go
ahead and I use my last name we get that
full value as expected so that should
just about do it for the flexibility of
functions you now know that you can
pretty much do anything inside of here
and you know how to appropriately return
depending on what you're checking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
