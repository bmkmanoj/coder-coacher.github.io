at how this looks so it's part of the
bootstrap framework we have the ability
to show a kind of error message or
whatever else so let's just create a
partial for this and at least get the
Styles up and running and then we'll
show them only when we have a flash
message available so we want our flash
messages to appear within our container
so if you head over to your base
template on apt wig we're going to
include a partial here so let's just
include this now and then we'll go ahead
and create the actual partial so let's
include and this will be in templates
partials and we'll call this flashed wig
so it's create this far within our
partials folder so let's bring this over
flashed wig and of course now we can
start to create this so this is a div
with the class of alert and then in here
you can say something like alert info or
alert error or whatever you want we're
just going to be using general info for
now just makes it a little bit easier so
in here we'll go our message so let's
just type something in there just to
test this out head over here and we see
our message at the top
perfect so we've got all this set up so
we know what it looks like but of course
this needs to be wrapped in a condition
that condition is if there are any
messages waiting to be shown so what we
can do is test this out let's just test
this out from our home controller so
let's say in here this flash add message
and we'll keep all of these under just a
key called global so let's just say test
flash message so if we head over to our
home page and refresh we don't really
see anything at the moment because we're
not taking this and doing anything with
it it's over in flash we want to wrap
this in a conditional now again where
are we getting flash from how can we
access this from our templates well of
course we have this in our container but
what we want to do is share this with
all of our views so to do that very
straightforward over an app like I said
it's on our container all we need to do
is a very similar thing that we did here
so we can just save you get environment
we want to add a global and that's going
to be flash and it's going to be
container flash so now we have that
flash functionality available in here
therefore we can wrap this in the
conditional that we need so if flash get
message global then we want to show this
so this kind of leads us on to if you
wanted to say show an error you could do
that so you could have obviously there
are different ways that you can do this
but you could say error or this could be
info for example so here you could say
alert error and inside of here
we obviously just need that text that we
output so here we just say flash get
message info and then here we use the
first filter within twig so we can do
this for here as well
and we can say error so this is a really
simplistic setup but really this is the
only way that we can do it with the
flash package within slim I've tried to
make this less kind of repetitive but
it's actually really hard the way it
works of course you can explore other
options for flash packages but this is
pretty easy to implement so we're just
going to stick with this one so now what
we can do is over on our home controller
let's test this out we've come away from
the global thing let's try error so now
when i refresh and then I go back again
you can see we get test flash message
and I think I've given the wrong class
name here so I think this is alert maybe
no so I think this might be warning I'm
not too sure maybe not I think it might
be danger really odd there we go
so this is our error and then of course
if we want to use info for a kind of
more general one you can see it goes
blue so obviously here I'm refreshing a
couple of times because we're not really
redirecting anywhere but as soon as we
actually set this up to redirect so for
example if the user when they go and
sign-in enters the wrong details then of
course we will see an error when we sign
up
and the users in and logged in we can
show the info so we'll hop on over to
the next video and we'll set this up for
both the sign up and the sign in
functionality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
