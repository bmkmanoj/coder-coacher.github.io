typecasting and adding strings to
numbers and all this kind of stuff in
PHP we're gonna take a just a moment
just to kind of talk about this now we
know that when we go ahead and add say
two numbers together like this the
result is pretty simple we get the value
two now what we can also do is go ahead
and add in something like the following
now I'm not gonna do this in here just
year I'm going to hop over to PHP seven
to test this out because otherwise we'll
see the feature that we're just about to
discuss so you can see that we get to
this makes sense and if I were to do say
one a what do we think will happen well
we get the same result and what's
happening behind the scenes is PHP
typecasting this one a and you may or
may not know that if we were to do
something like echo int on one a and we
just get rid of that you'll see that we
get the value one so we can put any
number of characters after this and it
will always be typecast to one now this
is not fine but it will work if we were
to put a 1 on the end then we don't get
the result we expect because just of the
way that type hinting works now the
reason that the new feature that we're
about discuss is so useful is it
actually warns about this when it's
happening now it's unlikely that you're
ever gonna say echo 1+1 a there's no
real reason that you would ever do that
because you're manually writing this
code however there might be
circumstances where you don't really
know where these values are coming from
so this could be this number here that
you're adding on maybe from an API it
might be from the database so you want
to warn against things like this
happening now let's just check what
happens when we do this in PHP 7.1 and
you'll notice that we actually get a
notice so a non well-formed numeric
value encountered on line 3 so now we
know that this is non well-formed and
it's just basically warning about it and
of course you can turn notices off and
on production you would have these off
but for development this is really
helpful now if we get rid of this and
just use a string notice that we don't
see this error or notice so this is fine
but no typically you would see the
problem when you
have any string characters in there now
there's another type of problem here as
well so if for example we have one plus
one we know that this works and if we
add one a this is a non well-formed
numeric value what happens if we
actually add B on here or a on here well
we get a slightly different notice
saying a non numeric value encountered
and the level here changes to a warning
so rather than a notice which can kind
of be dealt with this is a warning
because you can't really add a on to one
you can add one a it's just typecast
behind there but we just see a notice so
these can actually be combined as well
so we can have two types of notices so
this would be a non numeric and this
would be a non well-formed numeric
operation so we get a non numeric value
and a non well-formed numeric value so
although this isn't really a new feature
it's a good way to especially for new
developers kind of work out what's
happening and also if you run into any
problems along the way you'll see these
warnings and you know now exactly what
they mean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
