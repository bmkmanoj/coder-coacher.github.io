projects where I have to generate data
when I actually store something within
laravel again and again and again and
this is data that comes from data
I'm already saving now that probably
doesn't make sense I'm gonna give you a
rough example and then we're gonna look
at how we can solve this in a few
different ways so let's say for example
somewhere in a controller and I'm just
going to do this within the routes for
now I was creating a forum topic well
obviously when we are saving something
out then laravel either using this or
using the create method directly on a
model name we would say something like
title and then we would assign this to
whatever has been provided when we go
ahead and create this and then alongside
a topic we might also have something
like a slug now you may know that you
can use the str slug helper and then
laravel to pass through exactly the same
thing that you're trying to store and
then in this case since we have nude up
a topic model on its own we would go
ahead and call save so either way that
you do this whether you use topic create
and then pass an array through you would
have to every time you created a topic
go ahead and pass this in manually
calling str slug so sometimes these
things get a little bit annoying this is
a really simple example but you may have
other circumstances where you are
wanting to save something from data that
you already have and that's what I meant
by the explanation at the start of this
video so what we're gonna be doing in
this part we're just gonna set up really
basic functionality to store a topic
we're gonna look at the problem once
again and then we're gonna look at a few
solutions to get around this so the
first thing I want to do is just come
over to the projects I'm working and I'm
gonna go ahead and make a migration here
or in fact what I could do is make a
model so create a topic model and also
generate a migration alongside that so
let's just come over to this create
topics table migration go ahead and
store what we need and we're gonna keep
this really really simple just for the
sake of this so I'm going to go ahead
and create a string here I'm not gonna
relate this back to a user because we're
just kind of looking at this as an
example so let's go ahead and migrate
this I'm going to come over to env and
just
switch this over I'm currently using
Postgres so I'm just gonna switch over
the port as well here - and also the
database name as well okay so if we go
and run our migrations so PHP artisan
migrate let's go over to the database
just check this out and you can see that
we have our table in there and of course
because we generated that model we also
have this just here - so over in routes
and web let's actually go ahead and
store this and then we'll move on to
look at a couple of solutions so once
again you can either use topic model on
its own and use the static create method
or what I like to do is go ahead and
create a new topic explicitly and then
start to set properties on this so let's
say the title was just again hello there
and again this would come from your
request data so if you're working within
a controller you would have your request
object in here and you would obviously
pass this directly into here but just
for now we'll go ahead and hard-code it
and we would go ahead and like we've
already seen use str slug to pass in
whatever a user has provided and then we
go ahead and we just save that out so if
we just prefix this with a p-- just so
we don't break anything come over to the
browser
give that a refresh and over in the
database we see this here so regardless
of what you're doing this could become
not a problem but it's a lot more
convenient when you have data like this
that you need to hook into eloquent
model events you may wish to do this you
know kind of get rid of this step all
together just to make your life a lot
easier and of course there are countless
reasons why you might want to do that
and once we've finished the short series
we'll see that we can hook in any kind
of event that we want whether it's a
signing data firing a separate event
within laravel sending an email whatever
you want to do we're going to cover it
so let's jump over to the next part and
take a look at the first solution of
doing this which will help you out later
