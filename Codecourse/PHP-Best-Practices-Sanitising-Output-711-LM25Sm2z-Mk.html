about security so let's just say for the
purpose of this tutorial that this is a
post and this was submitted by your user
using the forum it passes all the
validation tests and it was inserted
into the database now we're on a view
now are on a view post page we're
turning this from the database and we're
coming out echoing it out into the page
so if we refresh here we get hello world
this is the post that the user created
the problem here is for user entered
something like hello world in bold tags
refresh we get this which which is
perfectly fine all tags are harmless
they're not going to do anything but
let's say I use it assuming like this
script script
I love and they entered this into the
database so if we refresh we're going to
get the alert and obviously this isn't
the worst that user could do using Java
Script so to fix this we have two
options we could use something like HTML
entities refresh and our our our actual
tag characters which of these get
converted into less than and greater
than greater than HTML entities so it's
not actually being rendered as HTML just
a character all we could use strip tags
and this is going to remove the tags
altogether now the benefit of using
strip tags is that we can allow I will
use it to use sometimes so for example
if we wanted to forbid script tags what
we want to do is user to be able to use
the ball tag we could save old regret
whoops has to be the actual tag so bold
refresh and we can see our bold output
if we wanted to say italic like this
it's not going to be rendered as italic
because it's not allowed yet but if we
were to pass in I as well refresh we get
italic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
