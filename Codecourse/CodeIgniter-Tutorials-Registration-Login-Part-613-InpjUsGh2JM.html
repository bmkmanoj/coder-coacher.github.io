video number 6 of mine in this new
series where I'm building a login
registration system with codeigniter
what I'm doing in this video is I'll be
creating a new model with a function
called can log in which will essentially
evaluate whether a user can log in with
with the credentials that they entered
so the first thing I'll do is create a
new model we'll call it model underscore
users just like we're loading here open
up my PHP tag I'll leave it open I'll
say class model underscore users extends
I think it's mark yeah users just double
check that really quick I mean yet model
underscore users good extends c i
underscore model okay now I'm going to
create a public function call it can
underscore log underscore in okay now
we're not passing any variables to this
I'm just going to rearrange this a
little bit we're not going to pass any
variables to it because I'm just going
to grab the variables right from the
post data using the CodeIgniter way
which means essentially I can I can have
a have access to their post data whether
I'm in the controller or in the model or
even in the view you can you can use
that post function that I showed you
before so let's do that first thing I
want to do is set to very to where
specifiers for the username and password
so this DB where where female is equal
to this input post email okay and now
I'll just copy this where password
it's equal to md5 whoa do okay count on
it three there for perfect Oh
so too much derp I only need one there
okay cool
that makes sense and then what I'll do
is I'll create a query object and set it
equal to this DB get so this is the get
will actually take any uh anywhere
specifiers already previously to it and
that all i have to do with the get
function is pass in the table that i
want to get it from so in that case it's
just users then i want to go if now this
this query will be an object of
whatever's returned go numb underscore
rose sakelik will to one which means if
it found a user meaning if they actually
did enter valid credentials then return
true else return false perfect should
already be created entered into the
connected to the database now all I have
to do all I have to do is actually
insert a user before I can actually test
this so going back into my MySQL
database click on insert and I'll create
someone with the user with the email of
hello welcome calm then what I'm going
to do is I'll show you how to find this
create an md5 hash of the word password
so I'll just go to google and that's
what I do all the time
I'll go md5 hash generator miracle salad
sweet I'll just type in password md5 and
there's my md5 hash copy it and then
just paste it right here
perfect
now if now you'll notice like right here
I encrypt whatever they typed to md5 and
then I want to compare that to thee to
the entry in the database this is
important because I actually don't want
to store any like raw passwords on the
database that's a huge security risk so
what I do is I encrypt it and when we
register a user we'll also encrypt their
data their password right now we're
doing it manually with a generator but
our code will actually be set up to do
this eventually and if you're familiar
with other ways of like login
registration systems this will be really
familiar to you
cool now actually I believe it should
work so what I'll do is I'll enter some
bogus information then we have a
incorrect username password notice I
actually don't I don't have a callback
to check if the email exists that's a
pretty big security risk because that
way somebody just go through like they
can brute-force it I guess I'm not sure
that's where they literally try every
single like possibility of like email
addresses or whatever but that way like
I'm not telling them if the name a like
just or not I'm just saying if they can
log in with their credentials or if they
can't which is the best way to do it as
far as I've been taught so what I'll do
is I'll even try some other types of
validation and now I'll actually try and
log in with the good credentials comm
and then password is password incorrect
username password okay let's just try
this again welcome comm okay
I'm gonna pause it okay I'm back I
figured it out when I copied this line
actually didn't change the post password
maybe you noticed that were laughing at
me the whole time and saying haha what
an idiot Stephen you know copy a line
you have to change it duh okay so yeah I
changed that and this should hopefully
work now go hello welcome comm password
boom we logged in now there's a couple
other things we want to do right after
we log in like create the session
session data right here before we return
true because if they can log in we want
to log them in right away so and we can
actually do that right in this callback
and it'll be really cool but we'll do
that in the next video thanks for
