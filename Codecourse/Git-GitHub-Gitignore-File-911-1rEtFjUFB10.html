certain files from being hosted on your
repository and this could be for any
reason at all but most commonly it's for
files that contain sensitive information
like database passwords or API keys in
this part we're going to create a git
ignore file which is a file that lists
all the files that you don't want to be
seen by git it will simply pretend
they're not there however on a local
machine you'll still have them available
so you can make use of them let's create
a file called config dot PHP and we'll
head over to our editor and we'll just
return an array in here it doesn't
matter if you don't understand what this
means in terms of the code just know
that it holds a password and we don't
want this publicly available on our
HelloWorld repo let's go ahead and save
this out and if we run its status you
can see that we have an untracked file
at this stage we want to be really
careful that we don't commit this far
and especially careful that we don't
push it up to our repo instead we're
going to create another file called git
ignore and this is a dot file in here we
can use a variety of patterns to exclude
single files directories file types and
so on and just a tip here if you head
over to your console and run git help it
ignore you'll see helpful documentation
giving you more information on this for
now though we're just going to write
config dot PHP in here and save this out
let's head over to our console again and
run git status and you'll see we get
something different to what we had
before it has detected the creation of
the gig nor far and has now removed the
config dot PHP file from the untracked
list perfect now we need to do is add
the git ignore file so I'll say git add
git ignore run git status and then we'll
go ahead and commit this so get commit
there we go so if we do a push on this
you'll see that the config file has not
been added cool
so we've now learned how to exclude
files and directories from being pushed
to our repo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
