migrate command within laravel but first
a little bit computing I'm going to tell
you exactly what it does so just before
that let's go ahead and run PHP arts and
take a look at the commands we already
have and these are status row back reset
refresh and install most of the time
you'll probably just find yourself using
the migrate command on its own
perhaps resetting to rollback all
database migrations or rollback to
rollback the latest database migration
now we have a new command in laravel
called migrate fresh and this is kind of
like refresh but a little bit different
now inside of refresh this will go ahead
and but as it says here reset and rerun
all migrations but this involves using
the down method of your migrations fresh
will simply drop all of the tables
instantly and it will go ahead and then
use up to reset or rerun all of your
migrations so really this is useful for
if you don't have down migrations or if
you're having an issue with you're down
my grades and you need to very quickly
reset your database so let's take a look
at an example I'm going to go ahead and
make a couple of models in here with the
database migration alongside of this so
that's a course and it's create a
migration here and let's do the same and
this is loaded for a maybe for a path or
something it doesn't really matter in
this case and actually pretty much it so
now we can just go ahead and run PHP
artisan migrate we'll notice what
happens of course it's going to go ahead
and migrate both of these like I said we
have the rollback command which will go
ahead and revert to the last batch so in
this case it's them too if we go ahead
and migrate and then do a migrate reset
let's take a look at this that's going
to go ahead and roll back every single
migration and we can then read migrate
now the Refresh command that we've
already spoken about so if we just go
ahead and migrate our changes of course
there's button to migrate at the moment
the Refresh will go ahead and roll back
then it will be migrated so it's like
using the reset command and the migrate
command together let's go ahead and do
that and you can see
that it rolls back each one using the
down method and if we actually just open
up a migration just so we can see what
we're talking about so it will run the
down method and then it will run up now
the difference here is if I go ahead and
use fresh now it's going to not roll
back it's going to drop all of the
tables then it's going to go up so the
difference between this is we simply
don't use the down method to rollback
first of all now like I said you could
use this for a couple of reasons maybe
you don't specify a Down migration maybe
you just have up migrations and you
don't have down migrations well in that
case this command will work perfectly
for you or if you're trying to use reset
or refresh and you have a problem in
your down my Gration sometimes you just
want to use all of your up migrations to
bring everything back up and then
potentially come in and fix anything up
in here either way just looking at this
that is the difference between the
refresh and the new fresh command inside
of artisan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
