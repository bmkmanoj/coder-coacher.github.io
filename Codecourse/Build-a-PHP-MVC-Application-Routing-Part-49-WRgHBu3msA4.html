within our application we saw this in
demo where we passed through home and
index in the URL here we did something
like that
it obviously isn't found at the moment
but that's basically what we're going to
be doing here and it's very very
straightforward it's not an advanced
routing system but the point of this is
just to learn the basics of creating
this MVC application so this is an
advanced routing but it will do the job
what we first need to do is define the
fault controller and the default method
so inside of controllers we're going to
need to create a new file or actually
create a new controller all together so
I'm going to call this home dot PHP so
this is going to be class home and this
is going to extend the base controller
which we've just called controller so
we're not going to do anything too much
here for now we're going to have to put
something in here to actually test the
routing so let's create a index method
and again this is going to be the
default method that we call so in here
I'm just going to say home index just so
we know that we're hitting this
eventually we'll close that down we
don't need that so the first thing I'm
going to do is create a protected
property called controller and I'm
automatically going to set this to home
let's create another one here called
method and we'll set this to index so
these are going to be the default
controller and default method that we
run when we basically bootstrap our
application now we also need to take
into account parameters as well so I'm
going to say params is an empty array
and these are going to be the parameters
that we are able to pass through so
eventually we want to get to the point
where we can say home index and test or
something like that test will then be
the first parameter test2 and test3 will
be the second and third so that's what
we're aiming to do here so inside of the
construct we want to actually parse our
URL but we're going to hand this off to
an
additional function or another function
so this can be public it doesn't really
matter probably better to have this as
protected so this is going to be passed
URL so pausing the URL is going to
involve basically exploding and trimming
the sanitized URL that we have and this
will give a give us the different parts
to the URL so it will give us the
controller it will give us the method
and it will give us any parameters that
are left over after that so the first
thing we want to do is check if this URL
is set now we're going to be doing very
minimal error checking within this
application the reason being that it
basically means that then you can see
what's going wrong we're not going to be
checking if files exist or well very
minimally checking if files exist before
it starts to include them but this is
just this just means it's easier to
debug let's check if your get URL exists
now you might be thinking well how is
this the URL you know you you'd probably
imagine a get to look like this
something now the reason that we are
checking within the get superglobal is
because we're going to be using an HT
access file to rewrite our URL and pass
it through as a yet variable so let's
just echo out dollar underscore get URL
here and this is just let us sort of
debug whether things are working now at
the moment this is not found because
we're not rewriting anything but if we
were to return to the index file and say
URL equals something and then go ahead
and call this part URL inside of the out
construct that will actually output
something so we can use this to play
around with it so what we want to do now
is disallow access to the stuff like the
app directory sorry the app directory
here and things like that so let's
create an HTS far first and then we'll
go ahead and deal with the rewriting
so inside of the root directory let's
create a new file and we're going to say
options
- indexes and this will prevent access
to folders like at let's say this is
htaccess and use a dot and we now see
when we try and access app it doesn't
let us that's really really important
because we don't want to allow people to
browse this now be careful with in your
public directory basically if you
disallow access to CSS files like we've
done here you're not going to allow your
app to render CSS files properly so if
we were to create the htaccess inside of
app instead let's try that now so I'm
going to create a new file inside of
here and say options
- indexes and I'm going to save this
inside of my app directory as an HT
access file and I'm going to use a dot
and there we go we can access CSS but
when we try and access app it's
forbidden
perfect so now let's create this
htaccess file that's going to deal with
actually parsing the URL and passing it
through to the get get super global as
we saw here so inside of public let's
create a new file this is going to be
our htaccess file again so we're
basically creating - now application and
within here this is what's basically
going to handle everything so multi
views is going to let us call pages like
for example if we had index dot PHP we
could call this as index and we also
want to turn the rewrite engine on and
we also want to change the rewrite base
and this is quite important because if
you are rewriting this depending on what
directory and you need to provide the
full directory path and this allows you
to pinpoint the index dot PHP file that
we want to call later on with the
rewrite rule so the rewrite base in my
case if we just open my browser is this
here so I can just go ahead and copy
this like that and but this is going to
be different in your case so have a play
around with it so let's add a few
rewrite conditions the third
Spahn is going to be directory checking
so we say percentage and in here we say
request file name like this the next is
f so this is file checking in fact we
can probably just copy this a little bit
quicker and the next is actually using
the rewrite rule to take the current URL
and pass it through to index.php as a
query string so we use rewrite rule and
we basically want to match everything
and we want to pass that through to
index dot PHP the query string is URL
equals and then we use the first
parameter which is the URL so basically
what this is going to do is it's going
to take the string which is the URL and
it's going to pass it through to our
pass your ret or not pass pass it
through but it's going to pick it up
here and echo out so at the moment we've
not got anything after here but if we
were to say home index I know for the
first problem to Alex you can see that
now we're picking up this value
effectively this has been passed through
as a query string to URL so what we're
going to do now is we're actually going
to I mean on its own this is useless we
commonly do much with this we need to
sanitize the URL split it up so we can
actually see if a controller has been
accessed or a method has been accessed
all parameters have been passed in so
within here what we want to do is we
want to return URL and this is going to
equal something so the first thing that
we want to do is actually trim this the
reason we want to trim this is if it has
a trailing slash this is going to cause
an
another element to be added to the array
when we explode this so we want to take
get URL and our trim will trim
whitespace from the right by default but
if we provide a character that will also
trim that so it removing the trailing
forward slash now what we want to do is
also sanitize this so we use the filter
var function for this and then we
provide here filter sanitize URL so the
last thing we want to do is actually
explode this by a forward slash which is
the reason we remove the trailing so
when we explode this let's just wrap
this in this function first and then the
first parameter is the character you
want to explode by in this case it's
going to be a forward slash and this
will mean that now when we return this
let's just do a print bar up here on
this pass your L method and that now
gives us home as the first parameter
then index then Alex and any other
parameters we pass in will be included
here so the logic now we're not going to
do this in this part but later on the
logic is going to be if this is if this
is a valid controller call that
controller if this is a valid method
call that method on that controller or
include this control and then call this
method the rest of them will then be
parameters that we can then pass through
to our controllers to use in views or do
whatever we want to with so we've now
split this up successfully and we've now
got our URL so we can set this to URL
like this so we've now got a broken up
URL and we've routed that through to our
application we've got the URL here that
we can do something with what we're
going to be doing next is as we said
before checking whether this controller
exists and if it does we're going to
include it and if this method exists
we're then going to call that passing
through these parameters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
