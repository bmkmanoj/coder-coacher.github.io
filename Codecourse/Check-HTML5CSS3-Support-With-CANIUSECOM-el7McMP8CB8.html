website that's really useful for
front-end development and it's called
can I use com
now obviously CSS html5 and things like
that JavaScript API is are changing
rapidly on the front end of development
it's quite hard to keep up with how you
can support different browsers and can I
use sort of speaks for itself in the
sense that if you want to know if you
can use something and it be supported
fairly widely you can head over to this
site type in the CSS selector or the
html5 feature I guess that you're
looking for and then you can check and
see if you need vendor prefixes or
anything else any issues with these
things like that so for example let's
take a look at something that has been
supported quite well or very well in
browsers for quite a while and that's a
border radius it's a border radius
obliviously just round out the corners
of an element with the radius of your
choice so at the moment this gives you a
really good view of how you can use this
across different browsers you'll
probably already guess that red means
not supported so in IE 8 this feature
isn't supported but from IE 9 up to 11
as well as Firefox Chrome Safari Opera
iOS and Safari and Android Browser and
Chrome for Android all are supported
offer a mini isn't supported now with a
feature like border radius it doesn't
really matter if it isn't supported
unless you're really dependent on the
fact that you have to have rounded
corners of an element which is probably
highly unlikely then if something isn't
supported and say I a it doesn't matter
it'll just fall back to sharp corners so
in this example we don't see the
requirement for any vendor prefixes
because there aren't requirements here
if we were to look at a property that
did require vendor prefixes so for
example transform then you can see here
that we have little yellow
box is here to tell us that it's
supported with a particular prefix if
you're not sure a vendor prefix is it's
basically a browsers way of implementing
a feature in their own way until it's
fully standardized so at the moment you
can see that if we have a look here
across these these browsers we've got a
in Safari up till Safari 8 it's
supported with a WebKit prefix because
that's the CSS rendering engine with
let's say for example Microsoft in IE 9
this was supported with the MS prefix so
really it's up to you to decide if
you're supporting back to IE 9 which is
probably a good idea you might want to
continue to use the MS prefix until say
you know people drop off support for IE
9 or stop using IE 9 the same with
Chrome as well if for some reason
someone doesn't have auto update and
then not on a higher version of Chrome
then the prefix will still be supported
back here
I'm with Safari obviously up to the
current version we're still looking at
the requirement to have the WebKit
prefix and by the way this row along
here which has a darker background is
the current version out of browser
versions so again this isn't supports in
Opera Mini so really it's about judging
if you you know really need features and
that's the whole point of the website
can I use now we've also got things well
this gives us a lot more information
here and this of related things to
transform so 3d transforms SVG effects
as well but we also get this these
little tabs like known as shoes as well
so you can look through these and decide
whether these issues are going to be a
problem for you and we've also got
resources as well which is really useful
so this will just go through so things
like the w3 specification which is
really useful to get to know and
understand but also other sites as well
MDM
as well which is a really good resource
so there's a lot on here really so if
you are a front-end developer if you're
getting into front-end development and
you do want to use cutting edge
technology go ahead and this website
should always be your first port of call
to see if you can use things so that's a
brief introduction to can I use comm
we're not affiliated with can I use it's
just a really good resource and there
are other features of this website that
make things really interesting as well
like different stats between countries
there's all sorts of ways you can
present this data so that's pretty much
it for kyu's check it out if you haven't
already and see what you think and if
you are a front-end developer or like I
said if you're getting into front-end
development you will find this useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
