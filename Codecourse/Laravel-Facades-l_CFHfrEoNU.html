class called foo and it contains one
non-static method and that's called ba
now inside our default route
I'm instantiated foo and returning foo
bar and we're getting this result now
let's see what happens if we call this
statically as you can imagine we get
this error but what if we could make it
work and still allow for it to be called
this way well let's take a look at that
the first thing that we need to do is
create a new facade directory inside of
our Acme folder and inside here we're
going to create a file called foo so
we're going to set the namespace to Acme
facade and we're going to create a class
called foo and it's going to extend
illuminate support facades facade now
this needs to contain one static method
and that's called get facade accessor
and here we just returned a simple
string this doesn't have to be the same
the name of the class it could be
anything because we're going to bind
this to our application in a minute
anyway so let's close this let's go to
our routes file and we're going to say
app bind foo and we're going to pass a
closure and return new at Acme foo and
again you probably want to extract this
into a service provider but for now
let's keep it simple so finally what we
have to do is add our facade to our app
file so down here at the bottom of our
elias's we're going to set foo to Acme
facade foo
let's hit refresh and we need to add
something here so return through ba hit
refresh and we get fubar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
