our new input or our new edition of our
fields inside our database table we've
also disallowed the users to log in here
if their account is not activated
meaning the activated row result is 0
and then we're going to die in there
just exit for added security and what we
basically need to do now is come back to
our register and script here when the
user is registered we need to do a few
more things to the database and this is
like I said before adding this field
here which is the random number that
we're generating or random piece of text
that we're generating and this by
default is 0 but we're just going to
stick a value of zero in there anyway
and this corresponds to let's check it
mmm let's find it this corresponds to
random so this here is the random and
activated is this here so this is going
to be a random number and I'm just going
to call this random and up here I'm
going to generate this random number so
generate random number for activation
activation process process I'm really
bad at typing and I ok so random equals
and I'm just going to be using the
random number function you can obviously
say random and like a B C or you know
you can generate some random letters
from an array whatever you're capable of
I'm just going to take to this and what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to say
one two three four five or two three
four five six seven eight nine up to
nine eight seven six five four three two
and that's the same amount 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 1 2 3 4 5 23 yeah so this is
generating a number between this value
and between this value and we're going
to place this inside our database here
that's why I mean
going to do is I'm going to logout from
this account which was successfully done
it is set to zero the moment bear in
mind sir my accounts not active but what
I'm in fact going to do is I'm going to
come in here and i'm going to delete
this here okay i'm going to do just to
test this is I'm going to register a new
user my full name is alex kara my
username is going to be Alex my password
is just going to be ABC and ABC okay I
think at the moment we've got ya between
six and twenty five characters so I'm
going to choose heed and instead I'm
going to click register okay you have
registered return to login page okay so
what I'm going to do now is try and
login with that data so Alex and Haden
click login and surprise surprise your
account is not active yet so let's check
our database for this newly entered
value yep so we've got Alex camera Alex
that's my encrypted password is he
didn't date then we've got a random
number here and activated 0 so this is
our random number now this is the key
thing we're going to use we're going to
send this by email to specify the email
address at the moment I'm not taking the
user's email address so we're going to
need to modify that in that and to do
this I'm going to need to come into the
this the register page yep ok so let's
go for username password password ok so
let's just create a new field here by
copying this structure down and I'm
going to say email address well just
email or something and this is going to
be type text and the name is going to be
email ok so when we come into our
register page we've now got an email
field here which I'm going to use say
Alex heating at hotmail com I've got my
hotmail page up here ready to have a
look at when the email eventually comes
to me so we need to take this into
account in our PHP script and also add
it to the database
so we are checking up here for our all
our data so I'm going to say email what
I'm not going to do is waste time it's
trip in fact we'll just leave it as is
and what we're not going to do is waste
time with validating this whether it's
there or whether it's not because I'll
leave that up to you guys this is just
purely for the registration tutorial and
how to register activate your account
rather by email so this is our dollar
underscore post you can also add the
strip tags I'm just going to do this for
for quickness so we've got a dollar
underscore post of our email address
coming down here we're going to need to
stick it inside one of these values so
I'm just going to like plum this on the
end here and obviously we don't have
this field specified in our database so
I'm again going to choose the structure
tab in PHP my admin and I'm going to
choose add one field let's say after
password click go and this is email
obviously we don't it as an integer
value want it as a vulture I'm just
going to say 30 characters maximum and
we can pretty much save us out like I
said it's up to you to do the PHP
validation yourself and we've got the
email in here so if again I go back and
click browse and I delete this here and
I come back and I reregister so click
register my full name Alex oh I like
Scarah my username my password which is
headon will repeat my password and I'm
going to stick in my email address so
Alex heating at home I'll calm clicking
register okay you have registered return
to login page again our login won't work
you can see your account is not active
yet but when we come into our database
click browse we've seen this edition of
where is it
email ah ok yeah okay my fault and what
we have actually done is I've stuckless
on the end here but not realize that
I've put it after password so I'm just
going to bring this show it in there add
a rester commas in obviously the input
process of this is really important of
matching them up to the field that
you're entering so let's try that again
apologies for that let's delete this
messed up one and come back in here and
register again let's do this quickly
Scarah Alex hedin as my password and my
email address as normal clicking
register everything's worked back into
our database we can see that my email
address is in there the dates in there
the random number and activated is not
and again I'm not going to show you now
we're running out of time but I won't be
able to log into this so in the next
part of the tutorial what we're going to
be doing is actually sending the email
with this value in here arrived a bit
babbling in this video but I want to
make sure you guys get the best you can
out of these videos ok so I'll see you
in the next part thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
