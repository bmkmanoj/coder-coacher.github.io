when you write code you need to be able
to break it up into different files if
we were to write everything in one file
things would start to get really really
messy so let's start by seeing how this
works and then we'll talk about some of
the useful ways that we can break files
up just to structure your projects a
little bit better okay so the first
thing I want to do is create an entirely
new file we'll just use this and as an
example it will be very very basic but
we'll see what we can do later with
functions so I'm going to call this
hello dot PHP so I'm just creating it
alongside the index dot PHP file that
we've been working on now over in hello
dot PHP what I can do is go ahead and do
anything in here and then include that
file into here to reuse anything now
just as a simple example let's go ahead
and echo out hello now obviously at the
moment over on index dot PHP if we just
run this in the browser we're not going
to see anything but what we can do here
is either use the include or the require
keyword to pull this file into the
current file so let's just go ahead and
include hello dot PHP so we just give
the full path to the name if this was in
another folder we would just do
something like say it was in a functions
folder we would just do this and
separate it by a forward slash okay so
now that we've got this included in here
let's refresh the index page and see
what happens and you can see that we see
hello so like I said we can do the
pretty much the same thing with require
here there are subtle differences and
we're going to speak about that in a
minute and let's go ahead and refresh
and see that we get the same result so
the two differences between these is if
there was an error in the file that you
were creating or if the far couldn't be
found your code would actually stop
executing at this point so to prove this
what we can do is here echo out the rest
of our code and we can go ahead and we
can require in a file that doesn't exist
so for example
goodbye dot PHP now if i refresh here
you'll see that we see our warning we
see our fatal error because it can't
find that file now if I were to go ahead
run include or use include instead you
can see that we see that output just
down there so what I would always do my
recommendation would always use require
because really typically you don't want
the rest of your code to run if you are
trying to require in a file if you're
requiring in a file it's more than
likely that you're gonna actually need
that file so another variation to
require and include is something called
require once and also include once and
again there are subtle differences
between these as well so let's do an
include once on hello dot PHP and we'll
go ahead and see what we get and we see
hello and it's exactly the same thing
with require once as well and you'll see
these used at different places you might
see require use you might see include or
require once really it's not that big a
deal but we're going to look at the
difference between require and include
once now now if we were to use say
include twice then we can imagine that
we see hello output twice now the
difference between include once and
require once is the included them
require part stayed the same so if we
require something that doesn't exist or
we do a require once on something
doesn't exist or we have an error the
rest of the code won't be executed
however one once we append once what
this will do is it will only include
this once however many times we output
it so just to recap then we have require
which will stop the execution of a
script if there's a problem we have
include which will include a file but it
won't stop the execution of a script we
have include once which will silently
not include a file if it's already been
included and this won't stop the
execution if there is a problem and we
have required once which will stop the
execution of the script if there's a
problem and it will prevent the same far
from being required in more than once so
with all that said my recommendation
would be to use either require or
require once it's highly unlikely that
you're going to require the same file in
twice by accident but generally it's a
to use or acquire once just to keep
things nice and simple so now really we
want to dive into why all of this is
useful and when you're writing basic
applications you may want to separate
out any functions or large parts of code
that may be set your application up like
defining configuration and you want to
separate that from everything else you
might also only want to require
something in on a particular condition
perhaps within an if statement so let's
take a look at including in a function
and this is definitely something you'd
want to include in another file because
it makes it reusable within multiple
files so I'm gonna delete hello dot PHP
and we're gonna create a new folder
called functions and then inside of here
I'm gonna create a new file called maybe
user dot PHP really it depends on how
you are structuring your project and of
course what you're building but let's
say we had a set of functions that
related to a particular user okay so
we're gonna bring back once again that
full name function so let's go ahead and
define this out here now user dot PHP
file so full name and remember we
include in the first name here and let's
just keep this really simple because
we've seen this a million times before
let's go ahead and return the first name
and let's go ahead and return the last
name in there as well so we now have a
function it's in one file we can now
reuse this within multiple files by
requiring in so let's say we had an
index dot PHP file let's imagine this
showed a list of users and then we also
had another file which was maybe a
user's dot PHP file which listed out a
list of users that you have on your
website two different files that perhaps
want to use this same function okay so
within here then we can go ahead and we
can either do a require a require once
or and include this time we're inside of
a folder so we're going to say functions
slash user dot PHP and what we can now
do is we can echo out full name and we
can go ahead and pass a name in so we
can just use it as we've seen before so
now over on the index file that you've
been working in we see this but now over
on users we
to use that same function rather than
defining that function out again and
again and again we just require it in
it's as simple as that so we can pretty
much do the same thing on here like so
now if we come over to users PHP we get
exactly the same result so when you
start to get into something like
object-oriented programming you'll find
that you won't need to require lots of
files in instead you use something
called Auto loading now we're not quite
that far ahead yet but keep it in your
mind and you'll see how that works if
you decide to move on to object-oriented
programming and the course we have on
code course either way we've looked at
require we've looked at include and
these are still very useful and you'll
most likely use them in every project
that you build</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
