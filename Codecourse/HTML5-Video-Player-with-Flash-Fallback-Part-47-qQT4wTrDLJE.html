gonna be quickly looking at here is some
of the attributes that you can give a
video and we've already kind of given
two attributes here the width and the
controls and I just wanted to show you
the kind of stuff that you can do with
html5 video that's as simple as writing
in what these say so we'll start with
this also play now what also played does
is literally as soon as the video is
ready it'll start playing in terms of
kind of web standards this isn't
something I'd advise using because if
you've ever been on a website and you've
got a video that automatically plays
it's very annoying and one of the
reasons for doing it and this kind of
links in with this preload thing here if
you've got to use its accessing website
from a slow connection and as designers
and developers were still sort of
thinking about users that are on 56k
modems and if it's a big video you're
gonna slow that user down a hell of a
lot which is why it's advised that you
don't also play nor should you preload
because if a user doesn't want to watch
a video or they can't watch your video
that's so big because their insolence
just so slow it's advisable that you
don't use also play or preload for these
reasons and also play is particularly
annoying again just go much what I said
earlier that if you've ever been on a
website which also plays audio or video
it's really quite annoying and will
probably put users off and this controls
is something that we've already poured
in so literally this just adds controls
to the video the the play ball and the
pause button the seeker the volume
controls and this is something that I've
definitely would advise putting in here
however you can actually make your own
controls you can JavaScript and this is
something we're gonna look at it in this
series as well I'm not gonna be
necessarily making a play or a pause
button but
we're gonna be changing the height or
the width of the video but it is
something that you can put in that or
you can create your own using JavaScript
so this is probably a good thing to put
in but it's not necessary if you're
looking to make your own controls the
height and the width these two kind of
common together now in this video here
we've actually specified the width and
that was just sort of lower the the sort
of resolution if you like of the video
when we specified the width we didn't
specify the height and the height still
changed and the reason for this is
because of the way videos work they are
proportional it's not like an image for
example that if you to change the width
of it it would skew you only really need
to choose one of these to change that
sort of height of both and these will
remain proportional as you've really
already seen so if I'll just sort of
reiterate this if you missed it so I've
taken that width thing out I'll save
that we'll go back into the the video
that we've we've started making if i
refresh this goes back to the same size
the original size I should say and if I
just popped that width back in refresh
it as you can see the video remains
proportional the point I'm trying to
make here is that this is all sort of
the height and the width kind of goes
into itself loop specifies if the video
will start again I'm kind of indifferent
to this to me this is probably annoying
me if I finish watching a video than a
place from the start again I don't
really see why you would want this but
perhaps you can think of a reason that
you do the media thing here specifies if
the output of the video should be muted
well what this says is it when the video
plays it'll be sort of automatically
muted and these will have to unmute it
you might find legitimate use for that
perhaps sometimes videos do load when
they're me needs I can't think of a real
life purpose that you would use but
maybe you can it's not overly irritating
unless people play video and they expect
that they'll hit a volume straightaway
might confuse people I guess but again
there's probably a more legitimate use
for this that I'm thinking of poster now
I'm gonna come back to this because
we're gonna be putting this in I've
already kind of spoken up freeload and
why I think it's a bad idea
and I was just got the source which is
the source of the video file something
that we have used and something that we
have to use so which we've done here SRC
so I mentioned about this poster
well poster is an image it'll appear
before the image is played so I may as
well just give the example this so in
this in the root directory got this
images folder and we have a PNG file
called image PNG and it's just this PHP
academy' logo and this in a sense you
could sort of if this is a specific
frame that you like that you want to
represent the video when it's loaded or
you know perhaps you want to put your
company's logo on there or something
like that then this is why this would be
a good idea it doesn't mean though of
course that you're loading the the
picture as well as the video and this
again if we're thinking about web
standards and things like that that
could take time to load it is something
you need to consider but again this is
incredibly simple to do so if you just
add in this a parameter
poster equals images slash image P and G
and that's it and if i refresh my html5
video you can see that we get the PHP
academy' logo text if you like is there
and when we play the video that
disappears and the video starts playing
which is great that's exactly what we
wanted so I think that will do just four
sort of talking about the parameters
that we can include play with them see
what you think with them but just sort
of try to bear in mind different web
standards and different users it might
be coming in with you know there
sort of internet speeds and things like
that so it's worth just taking a look
over these different attributes and just
having a little think about them but by
all means play with them and see what
you think this by the way I've just
gotten off the w3c it's w w3 schools
comm slash tags slash tag on the school
video dot asp you can find it quite
easily on the w3c schools website so
what we'll be doing in the next video I
think is adding a little bit of
JavaScript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
