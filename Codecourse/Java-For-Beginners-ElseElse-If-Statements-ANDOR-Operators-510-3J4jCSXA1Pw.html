this series of Java for beginners in
this video we're going to be looking at
more boolean operators and we're going
to be looking more into the if statement
and also will introduce the else
statement
so you remember from last tutorial we
can have a boolean called whatever we
called a in this case and we can set it
equal to any mathematical equation using
any of these operators here that will
return a true or a false value so we can
say if 10 minus 1 is equal to 9 for
example you can see that we get true and
then if we change that to 8 if 10 minus
1 equals 8
obviously that's false so you see we get
the false value so another useful thing
we can do in Java with the assigning
boolean value is we can actually have
more than one statement so you can say
ok if this is true but also if another
thing is true or and we we can use two
different things like we can use the +
and the or so I'm going to add them here
we have the + operator which looks
something like this is to ampersand
signs and then we have the or operator
which looks like this and it's to I
don't know what call you call these
characters I think I called pipes it's
shift and then the key to the left of
the letters e they're not lowercase LS
or uppercase eyes they're that special
character they're if you do a shift
backslash so let's see what we can do
with these and/or statements so if we
have a condition like this for example
we can say set brilliant a equal to if
10 minus 1 equals 8 ok this is false but
then we can add another condition for
example we may we may not require this
to be true in our program we could have
another condition that if satisfied we
can go ahead with whatever thing we're
trying to do so if we just put a space
to make the code more readable there
doesn't have to be a space but it's
easier easier to read what we can do now
is do this double pipe symbol the or
symbol and then we can do another
another statement another true or false
statement and this can again be in any
valid boolean expression form it can
either be a face value like true it can
either be an equation like this or it
can even be equal to another boolean
variable for example if we had a
variable called B like so but we won't
set it equal to this we'll just do
another equation for example or actually
I'll go ahead and put the value of true
here just so I can show you how this
works so when I run this we're going to
see true and the reason we see true is
because we set the boolean a equal to if
10 minus 1 equals 8 or if true so this
all thing here is the key point this or
a condition here this or this or symbol
of the two pipes it means return true if
either of these two statements is true
if like if one is true if this one is
true or if this one is true or if
they're both true it's going to return
true so this is useful when you only
need one condition to be satisfied and
the other one doesn't really matter so
you can see that we have this 10 minus 1
equals 8 which is clearly false so this
one is returning false here but this
true value is just simply true so we
return the value true because one of
these statements is true so now we can
take a look at the end symbol here and
it does similar to the or symbol except
both statements have to be true not one
of them not just one of them has to be
true they both have to be true for this
condition to be equal to true so if I
have run you'll see we'll get false and
that's because we have this equal to
true here but our other statement also
needs to be true and in this case it is
we can change this back to to be true
and you'll see that we get that we get
the boolean a set to true that's because
both of these statements are true
and I've said true a lot so let's look
at some false statements now we can see
with the syntax of Java we can have any
number of and or or statements I can put
an or after this and then we can have
another condition and then I compare and
after or whatever but this is important
to note it's incredibly important to use
brackets when you're creating your
boolean expressions because this
statement here we can see that there's
no particular definition between the
different ORS and adds if there's no
clear bracket definition within these
boolean expressions left to right it
will read it directly from left to right
and it can get very confusing so it will
say if this statement here and this
statement here are true and then this
whole thing here or this statement is
true and then this whole thing here the
result of this whole statement here is
and this is true you can see gets very
hard to keep track of so to keep keeping
this in mind it is wise to separate the
boolean expression out into a series of
brackets so that the statement is how
you want it so for example if we want
this statement here so we want the
result of this one if this and this are
true or if this is true for example so
we've got two different clear
definitions now we've got the result of
these brackets here order together with
the result of these brackets so we can
predict we can easily read what's going
on here we can see that 10 minus 1
equals 8 is false and then we're anding
it with direct false value so the the
and statement for it to return true both
sides have to be true in this case
neither of them are true so this thing's
just going to return false then we can
say or so we can still it could still be
a true statement if the things in this
brackets were true but unfortunately
both of them are false we're saying it
false and false again when you use the
end Operator both sides need to be true
for it to return true in this case
not even one is true that both false so
effectively we're saying false or false
and that then that will return false
because neither of them are true and it
will return it to the value right here
and you see we get false so sorry if
that was a bit confusing or a bit too
much I know it's kind of hard to read
this code here but the basic point I'm
trying to make is you need to be careful
with your bracketing when you're making
these sort of prolonged
boolean statements but as a beginner you
won't really be making statements this
prolonged so it should be okay let's go
ahead and set this back equal to a flat
value so let's go ahead now and just use
what we've learnt directly in if and
else statements so we can see examples
of how they work in code I'm going to go
ahead and cut this system.out.print line
because we're going to use it in a bit
and then we can go ahead and set up an
if statement so if we remember from last
tutorial the if statements in the form
of if condition is true then do whatever
is in the brackets so we can go ahead
and put a in here and let's go ahead and
make a new boolean value called B and
it's equal to false this time so we have
two boolean values a and B a is true and
B is false so we can say if a and then
we're going to paste this here we'll
system.out.print line the value a
condition is true and then if we run
this we can see we get printed out
condition is true because the condition
of the if statement is equal to a and a
is equal to true so let's go ahead and
put B in there we'll see what happens
and you can see nothing shows up so
let's go ahead and go ahead and add an
else statement now whenever we write an
if statement there is always opportunity
to write an else statement an else
statement can't exist without the if
statement
but the if-statement can exist without
the else statement so what we need to do
is after we've rendered F after this
ending bracket here we can come down a
line and we can write else and then do
open and closing brackets like so and
the else statement doesn't need a
condition because the condition for the
else statement is already employed the
condition of the else statement is
pretty much the opposite of the
condition of the if statement so we're
basically saying if a condition is true
do this but else if the condition of
this is false we're going to do this so
let's go ahead and paste that
system.out.print line again and we're
going to write condition is false so we
can see how it's playing out here so
before when we run it without the else
statement we can see that we got just
nothing nothing appeared but now if we
run it we can see we get condition is
false that's because this B variable is
equal to false here so we say if the
condition is true nope it's not true
let's move on to the else statement so
else otherwise print out condition is
false and there's one more thing we can
do with if and else statements we can
actually make more than one condition
for the program we're using so for
example say we had these two variables
here but there were several different
cases we wanted to try out we didn't we
don't just want to see if B is false or
if B is true rather do this and if B is
false do this we can actually have an
infinite number of cases so after we
write the else statement here if we go
ahead and do a space we can write else
if and an else if statement is different
because we basically have a secondary
condition we're saying if if the
condition is true do this if the
condition is false we'll move on to the
next one check if this condition is true
if this is not true we'll move on to the
next one if there's another else if down
here and there could be any number of
else if statements afterwards so we'll
check if this one's true then we'll
check the next one's true if the next
one is true if the next one is true and
then at the end there will most likely
a defining else statement so if
everything was false if none of them fit
the condition so let's go ahead and make
a few of these and then at the end we'll
just put an else statement so let's go
ahead and use some of the operators we
can say if B is true we're going to do
this B is not true so we'll move on to
the next condition let's go ahead and
check if B and a are true let's put them
the other way around if a and B are true
so let's go let's change the system out
print lines here I'm going to go ahead
and copy these in so we're going to say
here we're going to say B is true then
we're going to say a and B a true and
then in this one here we'll check for if
a or B is true so we can change that if
a or b and then in this final one we can
say a a and B are false so we've got
four different statements here we could
checking the initial condition of B so
we're saying is be true if B is true
we'll print out this thing here B is
true but B isn't true in this case it's
false so we'll move on to the next
statement here else if if a and B are
true so we're checking if a and B are
true so a is true so we're okay so far
so we use the and operator which means
both expressions on either side have to
be true unfortunately B is false so we
have to move on to the next one now
we're checking if a albeit true so if
either of these are true
this statement is going to be run so we
can see that a is true so this statement
returns true we don't even need to check
B because we already know a is true and
when we use the or operator only one of
these has to be true so if we go ahead
and run this we'll see we'll get the
third one here will see a or b a true
like so to reach this final else
statement all of these would have to be
missed which means a and B would have to
be false because if we change this here
a to false we can see that if B is true
it's not sure it's false we'll move on
to next one if a and B are true neither
of them are true so we'll move on to the
next one if a or b are true note that's
still both false
so finally we move on to the final else
statement and this final else statement
doesn't need a condition it's basically
saying well if all else fails if this
was false and this was false and this
was false and any other else ifs were
false just do this final statement here
in this case we just print out a and B a
false because that was the condition so
in the next video we're going to be
looking at more inbuilt functions we can
do with Java such as if and else if
similar to that and we're also going to
be looking more into the operators like
so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
