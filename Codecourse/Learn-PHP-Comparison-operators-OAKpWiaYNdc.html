comparison operators in PHP and again a
very basic overview of comparison
operators and comparison operators that
are most use we've already looked at
equals and identical so we're checking
if something is equal a zero does equal
false but zero with an identical
operator identical comparison operator
will not equal false because zero and
false are both different values so zero
and false have different data types so
this is an integer this is a boolean so
therefore using the three equal signs so
the the identical comparison operator
this will not evaluate to true but what
we're going to do now is just look at a
couple so greater than less than equal
to things that we'd find it on the
languages so there's not really much to
talk about here but let's go ahead and
apply a name here and we'll also include
an age and this will be an integer so
what we're gonna do now is we're just
gonna look at them basically list top
down and and see what they do so in this
case I'm going to say is name equal to
Alex in this case we'll just echo out
true so obviously this is going to be
true so we will see the value true
output in our browser we can also use
our the identical check to check if this
is an identical map so for example does
this equal Alex and is it a string as
well if we were to do something like if
age equals 24 with a double equals now
this looks a little strange because what
we've got here is we've got an integer
here then a string here and but this
does actually evaluate to true because
we're not using type checking and this
is identical to this
so not identical so this is equal to
this so when we refresh we get the value
true back so this is one of the things
you need to be really really careful
with because when you are making a
comparison between two or more variables
you actually need to be really careful
with type checking if type checking is
absolutely necessary
then you need to go ahead and include it
is often best practice to always use
ident
or just simply because if something
slips up you could make a terrible
mistake based on the fact that you
didn't want an expression to evaluate to
true and we can also use not equal or
natural fat let's just demonstrate this
with a comparison operator and we're
also include the ability to output false
as well and when we refresh here we
obviously see false because this doesn't
actually equal it's not identical to it
however if we were to change this to an
integer then of course when we refresh
it's true we could of course as well say
something like age equals string 24
which we wouldn't usually see but it
just demonstrates that this is now
truthy because we've typecast this to a
string anyway let's go ahead and take a
look at something like not equal and
basically all this does is it will check
if it's not equal to it so let's take a
guess at what this might be we've got an
integer here we're checking if this is
not equal so when we go ahead and
refresh we see that we get a false value
back and the reason for this is the fact
that we're checking if age which is a an
integer doesn't equal 24 in this case it
says false if we were to use type
checking again we would see that this is
true simply because it's a string and
this is an integer and we're using type
checking so we also have things like
greater than and less than so let's go
ahead and work with the age in this case
again we'll just say if age is greater
than 30 then we want to go ahead and say
true this is false because the age is 20
for food to set the age to 50 we would
see the value true and what we can also
do is check if it's greater than or
equal to so we can say greater than and
just use an equal sign so greater than
or equal to 30 so in this case if I was
to say 30 we will see true whereas if we
were using just greater than 30
unfortunately isn't equal to 30 it's the
same value so in this case with taking
the equals sign away we
get the same result and of course we can
also use the less than or equal to as
well
so we also have different caveat Slyke
we've already looked not equal but we
can also use this as not equal as well
and this is this is basically exactly
the same so it works in exactly the same
way so if if age which is thirty is not
equal to thirty so is thirty equals
thirty it is so we get false here
because we you know this evaluates to to
false we can also say thirty one now
these don't evaluate to eat this doesn't
evaluate to true so we will see true
here and I guess this is one of the
things that when you explain it you know
it seems very very basic and silly but
in actual fact what's going on here is
that this is functionality that you'd
use without any up through any
application basically and and it's you
know it's one of the things that you
just get used to but definitely with
type checking it's important to
understand that when you are working
with data type checking will be
extremely useful just to avoid any slips
