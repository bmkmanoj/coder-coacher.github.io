show you a few of my favorite bits in
bourbon so let me start by creating a
layout a new file called home dot stats
and I want to import this import home
and how it hope should be imported get
rid of these other guys okay
and then in my mid-20s box all right and
then here's a paragraph with some where
is it okay here we are this with some
Wharram in it and there we go okay so
rendering which it looks like a
paragraph is alarm let me show you
quickly how I can like manipulate these
things quickly with with my ribbon so
the first thing I wanted to show you is
the the size function so are the size
mix in box size 100 pixels I want to
make the background pink and margin play
okay now we see that the size let's look
at our rendered CSS the size is outputs
our height and width really easily and
now this is not this is not rocket
science but it's just saving time which
I really like about it I had to write
order the hood ID right I had to write
size 100 pixels in it it knew that I was
talking about height and width now
that's really cool
and it's even better when it gets to
something larger like
thing that can have five CSS class rules
surprise CSS rules to to accomplish so
something like this position:absolute
let's say 100 from the top auto from the
right auto from the bottom and 200 from
the left now this positioning would see
it how it you know this positioning was
really easy to write over here in the
sass and it was just in one line and
it's really easy to read it and edit as
well but if CSS that you know it's five
lines and again it's not rocket science
but we're just trying to save some time
in complexity and this is exactly what
bourbon does for us and I really that
really makes me excited happy in fact
it's one of the first things I started
using ribbon to do and again that's why
I like it because it is an add-on
library it doesn't force you to use any
of it right away and it doesn't it
doesn't alter any of the code that
you've written previously so if you have
a big old library or a big old codebase
you could add on bourbon today and it
wouldn't change anything and it wouldn't
make anything not work and then you can
just sprinkle it in as you go because
because it's you know so because it's
just a library of mix-ins another one
that's really cool is that they have
predefined font strings so if I go to
that paragraph and I say font family
where's the why font family dollar
Helvetica I could see that you know they
they've changed all the Helvetica right
here but it's not just how Vetta qey the
output CSS is going to have Helvetica
neue Helvetica rowboat Roboto Arial and
sensor so it's a whole backup string as
well I have backups for all of these
font declaration
and this is cool if I look at the
documentation for Bourbons for Bourbon
are our font families we have a Georgia
loose idiot grande
mono space and verdana which all kind of
have a lot of their relative active so
Tahoma is a great backup for the city at
grande but not really necessarily
Helvetica so that's a really great
really cool thing to do okay so let's go
back to here I made this box pink
earlier let's make it red and let's
reimagine a nice room a cherry red there
there are a lot of color functions built
into sass but tint is one that that
bourbon adds and it's really easy to use
just tint you know and I don't say ten
forty percent and then when I look at my
red ever it's nice you know it's just
knock down a few notches and it's not as
saturated so it's cool tint means you're
adding a little white so okay let's take
all of these boxes get rid of this
positioning here let's float them all
right or left yeah see how they work oh
look yeah they floated left just like I
wanted but I but I forgot this you know
I didn't want my pet expert graph to be
on on the right of all of them I wanted
them to to break like a block element
just right down here so I need to have
some type of clear fix built in there
and I can go into the parent right here
boxes and throw a clear fix on that
element that will help that paragraph
break down so boxes plus clear fix done
and thank you thank you bourbon really
nice really nice okay oh there are a few
other things I'm not going to type them
out I'll show you an example just there
I mean there's tons and tons of awesome
things but here like something like the
wilder ones timing function so we know
that CSS has busy a timing you know
easing built right into it but here are
like predefined
bezzie a timing sequences so easing out
back watches I hover over these horses
Luddite jump around he's going to go a
little bit over it and he's going to end
where it should be some of them will go
fast and then slow down I mean this is
all just the these are like predefined
easing busy a calculations so those are
really cool to use I've used them quite
a few times when I just want like um you
know I don't want my my animation or
transition to be linear or easy now I
want it to be something really unique
you can just pop one of these in and you
pop a few of them in and try different
ones and you're going to get something
that you know people don't see every day
that's really nice and another one you
can easily change your pixel
calculations over to ms which is pretty
cool I like that you can even set the
baseline within the function that the M
is calculated based on so that's pretty
cool I really like that okay and this is
bourbon it I mean it's tons and tons of
things I recommend going through just
you know spring climbing into sprinkling
them into your work flow as you go about
your work I think you're going to really
enjoy it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
