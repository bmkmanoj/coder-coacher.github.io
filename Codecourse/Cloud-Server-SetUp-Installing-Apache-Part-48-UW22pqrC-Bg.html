whatever webserver you want but if
you're just starting out or you're just
using this droplet for testing Apache is
probably the easiest to get started with
since there's so much support for it and
it's so popular so we're going to be
installing it navigating to the public
web directory creating a file and
viewing it in our browser so we'll make
real progress in actually seeing the
fruits of our labor when setting up a
server like this now we're going to use
a package tool called apt which stands
for advanced package tool and this
allows us to install uninstall and up
the application so the first thing that
we need to do is actually update apt
itself so we can use the apt-get update
command so let's go ahead and do that
now now we need to provide sudo and
basically because we need Super User
powers to be able to do this so we say
sudo apt-get update so that will go
ahead and it will work through and it
will start to update itself and
basically that's it we'll just wait for
it to complete so once it's updated
we'll go ahead and actually install
Apache now we're going to actually
install apache2 so we simply use sudo
apt-get but this time we're going to use
the install command rather than the
update command and now we give the name
of the software that we want to install
in this case it's just Apache 2 so we go
ahead and run that and we can answer yes
or no to the following question in this
case it's going to be yes otherwise it
won't install and this will go ahead
again and run through and that's it it's
as simple as that to go ahead and
install Apache ok so now what we're
going to do is head over to the browser
and use the IP address of our droplet to
see if everything is working as expected
so we know that we can find the IP
address of our droplet here you should
already have it because you've already
connected to your
ever but now what we're going to do is
we're going to paste our server IP in or
paste our IP in and we see the default
message that's provided by Apache so
everything's working as expected so we
now need to know where to actually
locate this default page and we're going
to go ahead I'm going to create another
file in here as an example to go ahead
and access that so we're going to be
doing a little bit of editing from
within our server using SSH but we'll go
ahead later on and install or use it
SFTP to access files so let's go ahead
and do this now so your public facing
directory is located in VAR dub dub so
let's go ahead and go over to this
directory let's do a directory listing
here so you can see that we've got this
index.html file and that's the file that
we saw in the browser a moment ago so
let's use the Nano text editor to modify
this so we use sudo nano and then the
name of the file so now you can see the
contents of index.html we're going to go
ahead and change this to something a
little bit more sensible let's just go
ahead and pull this down
and we'll just go ahead and give this
document a head we'll go ahead and give
it a title we'll go ahead and give it a
doctype as well now we'll go ahead and
give it character set of utf-8 so now
that we've done that let's go ahead and
save this so I'm going to hit ctrl + O
and then hit enter that's going to save
that file then I'm going to hit ctrl + X
and that's going to exit
so we've now modified that file let's
head back over to the browser to see
what that's done so everything looks the
same but you can see that this has been
modified and we've you know corrected
this initial page basically so now this
has been updated you know we know that
we can update files but it's not always
going to be the case all the time that
we want to go ahead and use Nano to
update a file here so we're going to
want to connect with SFTP to allow easy
access to be able to upload files
securely so we'll be looking at doing
this later on for now though let's move
on to looking at setting up PHP so we
can introduce some PHP code test it here
and see if it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
