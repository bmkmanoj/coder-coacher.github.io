creating justified navigation and by
that I mean something that equally
spreads along the width of a parent
container in this case I've got a white
container here which is centered in the
middle and you can see that I've got
very evenly spaced items here and these
little chaps don't look great at the
moment they've got a little bit of gray
background that's just to demonstrate
how the width of these are basically
even or the spacing of these is even
across this container
now this isn't using any technology
that's new it's it's very old technology
we're basically going to be using text
to line justify to achieve this effect
and this can be done with containers or
anything in this case what we're gonna
do is we're gonna create an and
navigation elements or an html5 nav
element we're gonna create an unordered
list within it list items within that
and then these are just links so anchor
elements and we're gonna basically
spread them across the page now the
first thing that we're gonna look at is
the sort of not wrong way to do this but
the less efficient way to do this and
then we'll go ahead and looking at doing
it this way now you'll notice that as I
pull this in word everything responds
nicely so this is you know absolutely
fine for responsive web development as
well so let's go ahead and dive straight
into the code and see how we can achieve
something like this okay so it was
starting out with just a basic document
outline we're gonna go ahead first of
all and create this container and get
this out the way and done with just
basically so we have something to place
this within so you can see how things
are responding if you're applying this
to your own website you'll probably
already have a container like this let's
go ahead and do this quickly though and
style this up so the first thing I'm
going to do is set the background color
of the body to a light gray or something
like that just so we can distinguish
this between the white of the container
now I'm going to go ahead and apply a
container a class that is container I've
already done so and we'll go ahead and
give this a background off-white and
we'll go ahead and set a maximum width
of this container to 960 pixels and
we'll go ahead and center it so we'll
set the margins to zero top and bottom
and auto left and right and that will
give us something like if we fill it in
with some text
like this so we've got our container
here we can go ahead and look at how we
might build up this navigation now we'll
go ahead and create a nav element we'll
go ahead and give this a class as well
just to identify it we'll call this nav
justify so we're gonna take a look
initially at what we might do to spread
these out and then we'll look at why
it's not ideal and that's just basically
giving this width so if I go ahead here
and create an unordered list as you'd
probably expect from navigation items
we'll go ahead and create our lies and
then anchors within this as well and
we'll go ahead and just enter some text
for each of these so if I go ahead and
just copy these down we'll have home
about us videos contact us and visit us
that will get rid of that home about us
I will go for videos and contact us now
ordinarily you might think well how can
I get these two you know responding the
way I want to well in this case we've
got one two three four containers so
what we could do is we could apply a
width of 25% each of these now likewise
if we had an additional which maybe was
visit us we could go ahead and apply
these at 20% width so we go this at 20
20 20 20 and 20 20 40 60 80 100 makes up
a hundred percent but let's go ahead and
look at a better way of doing this so
we'll do it the first way first and then
we'll take a look at how we can change
this so let's target now justify the
class that we added to our navigation
item and let's target the unordered list
within it and just tidy this up a bit
because at the moment it looks like this
so it's looking a bit like a normal
unordered list so go ahead and set the
list style type to none that'll
basically just go ahead and get rid of
the disks you see there we'll set the
padding to zero and the margin to zero
and also go ahead and at now that's it
so what we now want to do is go ahead
and say with the nav justify li items we
want to go ahead and set these as a
display:inline-block
and now what we see is the following so
basically they're just lined up next to
each other and that's it so we've solved
almost there really so now what do we
want to do well let's go ahead and just
set the anchors to a color so we've got
background on these so we'll say CCC or
something
so we've now got something looks like
that so we can sort of keep an eye on
the containers now what happens if I
want to go ahead and I don't know set
these two we've got one two three four
five so I could go and set a width of 20
percent on these and we get something
like that
now we've obviously got a problem
because we've got some gaps between each
one and let's just go ahead and inspect
these so we've obviously got a problem
where this is sort of breaking
two-four-six-eight
a hundred percent yeah so this obviously
could be fixed but the point is that
this isn't really ideal let's just go
ahead and set this to something like 15%
for now so this isn't ideal because if
we wanted to add more items to this list
we've then got to go back to the stars
and change the width however nice we get
it looking in whatever browsers if we
add more elements to this list to this
unordered list we're gonna have to
change the width of each of the items
and it's not ideal to do so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna look at a little
trick which lets us set the text aligned
on the unordered list itself to justify
now off the bat this doesn't work we'll
see if we set text align to justify you
would expect this to just do what a word
processor would do and just basically
spread out any items to the very edge of
the page if you were to open up your
word processor and you typed a paragraph
and justified it you would find that it
would spread out you know to the end of
the pages and what we want to do is we
want to go ahead and trick this into
thinking that there's too much content
within this one line which would then go
ahead and actually break this and then
that would mean that the rest of the
items are justified so let's go ahead
and look at doing that now what we're
going to do is the
first let's go ahead and create a class
that will go ahead and actually break
these items so we have an Li down here
we don't need to have an anchor in it we
can just give this a class of break or
whatever you want to call it but let's
go ahead and target that so it's nav u
nav justify ul Li and it with a li with
a class of break so what we can do is we
can just say dot nav justify ul break so
we target this so what do we want to do
to this element well we want to go ahead
and set a width of a hundred percent on
this element and this element shouldn't
exist technically so let's go ahead and
give it a height of zero just in case
what this is going to do now is it's
going to add well we've got we've sort
of added it to the markup but it's gonna
because it's going to set a width of
100% this technically breaks this line
up because it's a hundred percent width
it fills the entire parent container so
this will then break and enforce all of
the other items to justify themselves
along to the edge of the page like this
so it looks perfect it's completely and
utterly lined up so this isn't something
you typically could expect to happen
within you know CSS and this isn't
anything new it's not new functionality
that's been added it's been a part of
HTML since version 4 so we can go ahead
and we can add this class to the end
here and it basically just goes ahead
and breaks things which obviously then
subsequently makes all of these items
line up so what we can do is to be a
little bit more efficient we can go
ahead and get rid of this because
technically what we're doing here is
we're adding extra markup so we've got
an empty li here it looks a little bit
messy we can go ahead and in global dot
CSS instead of targeting break we can
target ul and we can use the after
pseudo element and what this actually
does is it goes ahead and it if we just
add a content of space it has a pseudo
element onto the end and pretty much
gives us the same we need to go ahead
and write so basically because this is a
pseudo element we need to go ahead and
set the display type because previously
we had each Li targeted as a
display:inline-block so we'll go ahead
and just take this down here because
basically then it says that the pseudo
element we've
created ax the same as a list item so
there we go we've got the effect back
again we've got the after cedar element
down here and you can see that the stars
have been applied to that properly and
that just sits there like it would
without the need to add additional
markup so basically what we've looked at
is responsive solution you can see that
if we just pull this inwards it responds
really really nicely and the beauty
about this is if we need to go ahead and
add another item or remove another item
let's just go ahead and do so now I will
just say social networks or something
like that then when we go ahead and
refresh that just automatically works so
everything pulls inwards as you know as
you'd expect from a sort of elegant
solution like this and obviously as you
get smaller this will start to break
down but that's not necessarily a bad
thing it's you know if something
naturally breaks down like that it's not
all bad but then again what you could do
is go ahead and add media queries to
maybe tidy this up change the navigation
or use some kind of JavaScript solution
or something like that
so that's basically how we create a
justified navigation system where
everything's nicely laid out and spread
evenly across the width of a parent
