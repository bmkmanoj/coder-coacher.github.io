at parsing markdown with PHP using parse
down which is a really really great
class to pass markdown so if you're not
sure what markdown is don't worry I'll
you're going over this and we'll be
writing this out this is basically
stored in a file called article dot txt
this could be coming from a database it
could be coming from a file it could be
coming from anywhere really you can see
here I've got things like hashes here
I've got asterisks is our on a line by
line basis for this
I've got double underscores here
basically what part markdown is is it
it's a text representation of certain
things so for example these three back
ticks denote that this should be wrapped
in code or pre tags and this here is an
inline piece of code these are on this
isn't a list basically this here is bold
you can also use asterisks is for this
and this is a header you can also do
something like that you might be
wondering why is this useful well if
you've not come across markdown already
and you've not used it anywhere as soon
as you do start to use it you'll see the
benefit however this video is not
specifically about what markdown is or
you know how to actually write markdown
it's more about converting it or parsing
it so this is the result of what you've
just seen in my text editor you can see
that we've got our inline code here if I
just zoom in a bit you'll see the font
difference we've got our our list here
and we've got our bold here so if we
just hit hit the page source of this you
can see how this has been converted and
the other great thing as well is if you
notice this line here that's actually
being converted into a paragraph element
which is really cool when we've not even
done anything here so pass down is a
really good solution to actually do this
within PHP it's my favorite solution and
we'll be looking at installing it we'll
be looking at using it and we'll also be
looking at something slightly different
which is how you might use this within
comment systems on your website so the
first thing to do really is actually go
ahead and install parts down now I've
basically just taken the pass down PHP
file and put it inside
libs directory within my main directory
that's perfectly acceptable however the
preferred solution would probably be to
install it with composure if you head
over to github you can actually find the
github repo for pass down and it will
give you instructions as well you can
hit this link here to go through two
packages to find the composer package if
you are using composer to install that
so let's take a look at how we might use
it so head over to index dot PHP the
first thing we want to do is require
this in if using composer you probably
haven't also load in here that that does
that for you but I'm just going to
require in libs pars down-up PHP perfect
so we can either use the instant static
method or we can instantiate it I'm
going to go for the latter so I'm going
to say pass down equals new pass down
that's all we need to do so now we need
to grab this text from article txt again
this could be coming from your database
or something like that now as long as
you've instantiated this somewhere
you'll then be able to use it for any
content so if you're displaying an
article on your website on your blog or
something like that so if for example I
were to say text equals file get
contents and then choose article txt and
we echo out text this will give us the
content of article so like so now rather
than storing your content as pre
formatted text so for example using an
h1 here and saying my article you're
going to want to use markdown it's a lot
easier it's transferable it means you
can change the formatting on the fly
depending on how its rendered so and
we're going to say my article the hash
and I'm going to say welcome to my
article it is great
so that's now going to be in bold and
you can find the syntax of markdown
anywhere it's really really easy once
you learn it as well so I'm going to say
point two point three and then I'm gonna
need some code block here so I'm going
do some backticks so we can just write
some code in here can literally be
anything and we'll do some inline so
here is some and then we'll just write
echo inline code and again we just pop
some backticks around them like that so
cool we've now created an article like
this at the moment we just get the
following not very good we don't really
have any use for this so let's now go
ahead and say instead of echoing text we
just use pass down and we use the text
method and that's it we now have passed
markdown if you want to implement
markdown on to some kind of commenting
system or something like that you might
want to restrict what you're doing and I
found the best way to do this is either
style an element that contains markdown
to restrict things like large headers or
you can use the line method so let's get
rid of this and let's just add in this
is a comment it is great so what we can
do is we can obviously use parts down
text to pass this like that right so
this could be just a user comment on a
forum or an article or something like
that however what's going to happen here
is if a user decides oh I want to
include this as a header like so that's
just about going ahead and ruin to your
website basically it's ruined the
styling you've just automatically
rendered a header here so what you can
actually do is you can restrict this to
inline elements only obviously things
like the e/m tags or strong tags are
inline elements so for example if we
take a look at if we just remove this
header and we inspect this that's
obviously a strong tag it's an inline
element it doesn't stay at block level
however things like headers unordered
lists sit at block level so let's add
some content to this let's just add
maybe a header here
maybe say one two three and we'll see
how that looks cool so this is what we
would get in a comment not what we want
let's change this now to the line method
rather than the text method and you can
see here everything the in terms of
block level elements is not rendered
however we do have the inline elements
rendered so that's a really useful
option if you don't want to include the
full support for this so that's parts
down I think it's a really good solution
as obviously quite popular as well you
can head over to the github repo to see
things like the wiki so you've got some
usage here as well you can obviously
check out the source code and go ahead
and look at how it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
