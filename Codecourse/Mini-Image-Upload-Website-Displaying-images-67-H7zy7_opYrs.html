images what about displaying them on the
homepage well the majority of this is
going to be styling because to actually
out put them into this home view is
pretty easy in fact we've already done a
lot of the work over in index.php when
we were testing out our models so all we
really want to do here is pass this
images variable through to this home
view and then iterate through them and
then use the upload care PHP library to
display them so to actually pass these
through to the view then we pass an
array as the second argument in this
render method and then in here we give
the key name and the value so in this
case it will be images and images so now
on our home view we have our images
available to iterate through so let's
start out with the markup it's always a
good idea to start with the markup and
then we will style this all up in just a
moment so to actually do this then we
are going to have a container and this
is going to be thumb nails and inside of
here we are going to have a thumb nail
thumb class for each of our thumbnails
and inside of this we're going to have
an anchor because we're going to be able
to click through onto an image to see it
on its own page maybe we want to share
that image and that will be identified
by the hash but we'll get to that in the
next part so inside of our anchor then
we want an image now I'd recommend you
keep your alt tag but I'm going to get
rid of it just for now just because we
don't have any metadata about this image
and for the source then what do we
output well once we actually loop
through these and remember we're going
to be iterating on this we should have
access to something like image URL but
we're going to be doing things slightly
differently we're going to be using the
upload care library to go ahead and grab
this file and this means that we can use
any more methods on it to scale it
change the quality set progressive
loading on all of this good stuff so
let's start by just iterating through
then so in twig we say
for image in and then what we want to
iterate on so each loop will now we
called image and we just go and end that
for just down there so for the image
source then if we were to do image URL
this would in fact work so if we just
refresh you can see that we get two
images just here in that cropped version
because remember when we uploaded it
stored all the properties in but to be
able to manipulate this further the best
thing to do is to use the upload care
library so remember it's under app
upload care and what we can do is say
get file and we can pass that image URL
in and then from this we can say get URL
now this will give us exactly the same
result but because we're now using the
library we can add on additional things
so we can say well I want to scale crop
this so it's always for 500 x 300 in
width and height and this will give us
an effect like this now this is exactly
what we want because we want uniform
sizes for each of the images that we're
going to be outputting on the home page
and what we can also do is use any of
the other items within here so you can
see under the Quick Start Guide for PHP
this is exactly how we do things and of
course what you can do is come over to
the CDN section of the documentation and
you can read all about the different
things you can do with images so there's
a lot of useful stuff in here
particularly if you're building
something like an image upload site so
what we also want to do is change the
quality so we're going to be using the
opie method which allow us to pass in a
specific item or a specific setting into
the content delivery network URL so we
can say something like quality lightest
I'm going to do this because we're
potentially going to be showing lots of
images on this homepage and we can also
say well for JPEGs I want progressive
image loading on so I can just say
progressive yes and that is pretty much
it feel free
to add anything else here you want you
can add filters do whatever you want but
now I have two images here I can start
to style and we're going to be doing
that now so to style these up then what
I'm also going to do is add a class on
to this actual image element and this is
going to be thumbnails and thumb image
just so we can star this out as well and
of course we're going to head over to
app dot CSS and start to write out the
stars that we need to get this working
so for the thumbnails then we are going
to be using flexbox to display these so
flexbox is just basically a kind of grid
system but it works purely with CSS so
it's for layout that's essentially what
it is so we're going to be using a
display of flex we are going to say that
we want the flow of this to be a row and
we want to wrap our items down if they
become too long for that particular row
and we want to justify the content with
space around now this is all we need to
do all of the items now within our
thumbnails element will now be displayed
like so so these are nice and evenly
spaced and we can add more and these
will again be evenly spaced so let's
just upload one more file and we can see
how this looks and there we go so again
evenly spaced so we're going to be
styling up each of these individual
things here then and then we have a nice
responsive image gallery so for the
thumbnail thumb then so thumbnails thumb
we want to set the width of this to 300
pixels so we're going to be creating a
fixed width but that doesn't matter
because we're using flexbox so
everything will nicely move in for us
we're going to be setting 40 pixels on
the top 40 pixels on the Left 0 on the
bottom of 40 pixels on the right and
we're going to be setting a background
color of white now the reason we're
setting a background color of white is
because we're going to be adding some
box shadow in just a moment now i'm also
going to set the padding on his 10
pixels and for that thumbnail image so
thumb nails thumb image we're going to
be setting that you width to a hundred
percent all this won't look quite right
so now we have the following if we have
a look at this a thumbnails thumb the
class here say thumbnails thumb there we
go and there we are so this looks a
little bit better already obviously you
can increase the size of these if you
want it's entirely up to you so now just
to make these pop a little bit we're
going to add some box-shadow to the
thumb container so I'm going to say a 1
pixel x and y offset we're going to have
a spread of 40 and the RGB will be black
with a point one on the Alpha Channel
and all that means is that it has a
essentially a ten percent transparency
so now we have the following you can see
how that is popping a little bit more so
let's just upload one or two more images
just to see how this looks maybe just
one more and you can see that this is
now nicely responsive it comes in and
even when we go down to a very small
view we have this really lovely
responsive grid like effect okay so now
we want to make these a little bit more
interesting so when I hover over these I
want them to scale and pop towards the
screen so to do this we go ahead and set
up a hover pseudo element so we're going
to say thumb nails thumb and on hover
this is the pseudo element or select a
rather we're going to say transform
scale and we're going to say one point
once this is ten percent bigger than the
original element and now in a hover over
you can see that these get larger now at
the moment this is a bit harsh so we
want to add a nice smooth transition and
of course we can do that with CSS as
well so to do this then we just want to
grab the thumbnails thumb class so let's
just pull this up here and we want to
set a transition of transform because we
are using a transform down here so we
want to transition on the transform
element
going to set this to 80 milliseconds so
pretty quick and i'm going to set ease
in but you can set things like
ease-in-out and of course you can adjust
the time here as well you can also use
seconds so you can say 1s rather than
milliseconds so now we should have a
nice smooth transition when we go ahead
and hover over these perfect so that is
pretty much it we have output our images
on the homepage the only thing that we
need to do now is be able to click on
them and see them on their own page and
to do that we're going to be using the
hash that we generated earlier when we
actually uploaded our images</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
