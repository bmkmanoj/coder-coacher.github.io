are going to need to go ahead and
install it luckily enough elasticsearch
make this really easy to do so there's
no complicated setup it's really really
straightforward a couple of things
before we start we're going to going to
need to test our elasticsearch
installation once we have installed it
and we have a node up running now I'm
using postman which is a Chrome
extension it's you can find it in the
Chrome Web Store and this basically
allows me to send request to a server
it's basically just a rest client so you
can use curl for this if you want to on
the command line I'm going to be using
postman just it's a little bit more
visual easier to do and for beginners
works perfectly so to install
elasticsearch you're going to hit the
download button on elasticsearch org and
we have a couple of options here if
you're setting this up on a server maybe
in a bun to server you might want to go
for the debian package but for windows
or for either sex you're going to just
hit the zip file download and we're
going to look at another way to install
this in just a moment so you don't have
to do it this way so before you go ahead
and jump and do things if you're ughing
up using OSX we're going to use homebrew
which is going to be much straight much
easier so once you've hit download zip
i've actually stored this within my home
directory you can see I've got a folder
here called elasticsearch so if we just
do a just to a CD over to elasticsearch
in here you'll find things like the
license notices stuff like that but
we're not really interested in this
we're interested in the binary directory
so it's CD over to that and inside of
here we've got several different things
we've got plugin which allows us to
install plugins more importantly we've
got elastic search which we can just run
just to basically create our start up
our elastic search node now inside
postman at the moment and elastic search
by the way runs on port 9 200 on on
localhost
obviously if you're just using on your
local machine so when I send a get
request to this it will say that there's
no response obviously because we're not
running a sir
but if we go ahead and and start
elasticsearch you'll see something like
this it does look a little bit messy
it's not very readable but this
basically means that now you have an
elastic search node running so if we
head over to a rest client or we use
something like curl and we send the get
request to that we now see things like
the status which is 200 okay the name of
the of the node running the version
number and various other different
pieces of information but you now know
that you've got elastic search running
and you can send post requests to store
indexes and types things like that we're
not going to be looking at that in this
video but you know that that works so
now that we've got a node up and running
perfect that's it we've pretty much got
ready to go this wouldn't be for a
production environment but for testing
on your local machine it's enough just
to play around with it
so let's come out of this and now let's
look at another way we might want to
install it and this is really only if
you're using OSX so if you are then you
may want to drop off the video at this
point so homebrew is a missing package
manager as they say for OSX and it's
really really useful for just installing
packages that you can using homebrew so
we're just going to do brew install
elastic search and there we go so it
downloads the package that that we need
to install we're working one point two
point one here and gives you a bit of
information so it tells you where the
data is stored it tells you where the
logs are stored it tells you where your
plugins are stored and it also gives you
the location of the elasticsearch
installation folder so if we do a CD
over to this you can see we've got the
bin directory as we normally Word that's
all in there for us we can run elastic
search we can do whatever we want and in
this case we don't have the Windows
versions because obviously we're on OS X
so we've also got a command to reload
elastic search after an after an upgrade
so you can unload elastic search like
this bear in mind at the moment we're
not actually running a node from the
terminal however when we send a request
to the server we actually get this back
it's running as a process so if we want
to unload it we can run this command
here so we just run this
let me head over to hear its end and
then we go we can't get a response when
we want to load it back up again we use
this command here we just paste that in
and head over to postman hit Send and
there we go so what we can actually do
is obviously you're not always going to
have this UPS you're not always going to
have this information up so say for
example you think Oh where's my
elasticsearch installation brew gives
you this info feature so you can say
well I want the information about
elasticsearch and it will basically just
give you all of that information again
so if you are running this on your
machine you have your unload and load
commands you have where everything's
stored and the obviously the location of
the installation so there's a couple of
ways we can install elasticsearch as
i've mentioned it's extremely easy to
just download whatever operating system
you're using and just running it so you
can see here that it pretty much gives
you instructions so on unix should rin
run in which we or binary elasticsearch
and on windows should run at a success
dat from your command line so there we
go really really easy to get started
with and once you've done that you can
start playing around with elasticsearch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
