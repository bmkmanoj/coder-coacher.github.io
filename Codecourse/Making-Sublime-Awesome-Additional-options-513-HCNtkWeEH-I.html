file to basically just the settings that
I use but of course you can go and tweak
these to do whatever you want so over in
our default preferences so this is just
sublime as default preference file you
can access this through the Preferences
menu at the top so you can see here that
we've got quite a bit in here that we
can override and override something all
we do is we copy it we paste it into
here and we change the value pretty
straightforward so I always have my font
size set to 17 so I'm going to leave
that as it is but a couple of other
things that I do is I set my line
padding so let's just search for line
padding and the line padding on the
bottom here we can go and paste into
here and we can go and modify this so
for example five and you can see that
that automatically changes I happen to
have mine to five but I know some people
like it slightly larger so it's a little
bit easier to see what you're working on
then entirely up to you you can change
this around the next thing I do is when
I'm writing code I don't want tabs to be
here I want these to be translated to
spaces this helps for things like
version control so in here we have a
translate tabs to spaces and we also
have a tab size now I happen to want my
tab size to be four so all I want to do
is set this to true so I just go and
pull this in and I go and change this
over to true and for me personally that
is pretty much all I do there's not
really much else that I like to change
about sublime the theme the background
here and everything else suits me but
feel free to go ahead and look through
them default options paste them over and
modify it to suit you there's obviously
endless options now there is one other
thing that I do and that is I change the
font to make it a little bit easier to
read so we're gonna go and look at
pulling in a really nice font face which
I absolutely love for coding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
