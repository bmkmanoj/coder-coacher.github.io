is implementing a custom for a four page
for any pages within your new
application that cannot be found so for
example if we type a load of rubbish
after this we see the standard exception
that's been thrown this is a not found
HTTP exception and on a production
environment if you were to have within
your EMV far this set to production or
whatever like that or debug set to false
you would see the following so this
isn't a very nice 404 page so what we'd
want to do is change this so to change
this what happens is when laravel throws
a not found HTTP exception if it can
find within your views a 404 file it
will render that instead of the default
so all we need to do is under resources
views and errors remember that's where
our 503 lives if we ever stop our app or
temporarily disable our app we can
actually create a new file in here so
let's create a file called 404 blade PHP
we want this to be a blade template and
as we've been doing before we can just
copy over the template from our home
page and in here we can do something
like this so oops that page could not be
found and here we could probably say
something like well just have an anchor
here we could say something like go home
we can modify the link here and that
will be a route to our home page so now
instead of seeing that we actually get a
custom 404 page just by creating that
view we can click go home to go back to
the home page and that is how simple it
is
with laravel 5.1 to implement our own
custom 404</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
