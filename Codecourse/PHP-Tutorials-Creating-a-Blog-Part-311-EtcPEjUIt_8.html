here and we're going to start by
creating this dot HD X's file with deny
from all you might already have done
this after the first video that's all
there is to it
you should understand now what it does
so we're just going to close it and
never touch it again
in this video we're going to work with
config dot PHP and in it stop PHP now as
I mentioned config dot PHP is used to
define configuration variables so that's
exactly what we're going to do and we're
going to do it within an array so we're
gonna say config then DB host equals
localhost this is pretty much always
localhost so you can probably use that
then we'll use DB user and in my case
that's the root but this can be
different from for you then we have the
password which is nothing for me if
you're not developing locally I
definitely recommend using a password
then we have the database name which was
blog now I'm going to show you a little
technique that I like to use which is
using a for each loop to loop over the
config array and then defined constants
based on the variable or on the array
keys and values
why constants are a lot easier and
cleaner to use within your code but
arrays are easier to modify I hope that
made sense here you just need to go here
and you can change it to a username if
you were defining one you'd you would
define DB user
user name and you would have to search
through possibly a long list of
definitions and then go in the function
and modify it and this is just a lot
cleaner and well you definitely don't
need to do this but I do la do it
without further ado what you do is for
each config remember we called the array
config SK which stands for key and then
fee for value so what we do is we define
a constant and constant names are pretty
much always uppercase so we're going to
use string to upper which simply
converts strings to full uppercase and
we're going to use the key so now we are
defining a variable DB host DB user and
so forth and we're going to define it as
the value whoops so DB host now has a
value of localhost it's very simple but
very effective and that's all there is
to the config file now in more
complicated examples you could add like
a site name or or a base URL or
something but this is a small project
focuses on my sequel I'm not going to
bother with anything other than this so
in its dot PHP as I mentioned this does
things like set up a database connection
starts sessions and such things
so to connect to the database we
obviously need these database
credentials so we need to include config
to of PHP and now we have access to all
these four constants we just defined
using this so what we're going to do is
we're going to say my sequel Connect DB
host DB a user and DB pass so
essentially what we're doing here is my
sequel connect localhost root and
nothing this process by the way is
called don't repeat yourself it's an
important program in concept and here
it's not so apparent don't really know
how to say that but this is a great
aspects or concepts to utilize in your
projects anyway moving on my sequel
select DB DB name and that's all there
is to that we just set up our connection
to the database now all we need to do is
include the blog functionality which we
store in the functions folder in the
blog dot PHP file and in this case the
init's file is very small but this is
all there is to it it's very simple but
by including just this page or this file
on every page you just made your life a
lot easier than if you would do this
every single time okay
so only about six minutes through let's
see what we can still do hmm let's go
into plot of BHP and I'm going to define
some functions that we will be using
we're going to have function called add
post which adds a title of course the
contents and a category will also have a
function to edit posts gets the same
parameters we will be adding categories
oops
add category and the name will have a
function to delete things and we're
going to give this a field parameter and
no ID parameter then let's see get posts
functions which has an ID equals no and
gets ID equals no I'll cover what this
all means later I'm just defining the
functions now also a function called
gets categories which has no parameters
and that looks just about fine to me so
I'm going to leave you with just this
and in the next part we're going to
start and hopefully immediately finish
adding categories which is the simplest
task to do probably and also the first
one because
we cannot store posts if we do not have
categories so see you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
