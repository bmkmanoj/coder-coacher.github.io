in PHP and how we can actually use them
to determine different circumstances
based on expressions that we passed
through two if statements so let's take
a look at the basic syntax of an if
statement and we'll pass in a couple of
values and will basically see what
happens so an if statement starts with
the if keyword and then we have an
expression within to print or
parentheses we then have an opening or
an open to our block and a close to our
block so within here is everything that
will be executed if something or if this
expression evaluates to true so what's
going to happen here is well let's just
go ahead and just echo okay or something
like that so inside of here what we can
do is to test this we can go ahead and
pass one for example now one is the same
as true in a sense without type checking
in place so we just see okay
output to the page now if we were to
change this to zero then we would see a
holding story whereas the block has not
been run so this syntax isn't
complicated if you've worked with
programming then other programming
languages before but basically this is
an if statement in its most basic form
so for example we could also say if true
or if false or we could incorporate
values to variables inside of this if
statement so for example admin equals
true we could say if admin you are an
admin so in this case what we're doing
is we're taking the value of a variable
and checking this and there we are it
says you're an admin and we could also
say if admin is equal to true would
still work and we could also say if
admin is equal to it is equal to true
but with type checking as well so this
will check not only that it's true but
that it is actually a boolean value as
well so for example if admin was one
this wouldn't work so being careful with
type checking we know that we can now
pass through an expression however
complicated we want it to be and then we
can output a value based on this now for
example we can do other things like use
operators so we could for example say
age equals 24 and in here we could say
if age is greater than 25 you are older
than 25 so in this case when we refresh
nothing happens but if we were to change
this to 30 and we go ahead and refresh
this works so whatever expression you
want to put inside of here if it
evaluates to true then the block that
you provide will be run now what we can
also do is we can combine things in here
and we'll be looking at them a bit later
we can say things like + 1 equals 1 for
example but these could be variables or
anything like that so depending on how
complex you want to get with the
expression that you pass through is
entirely up to you but as you progress
through learning PHP you'll understand
what you can use in here and what you
can't so let's just go ahead and leave
this if age is greater than 25 now we're
also going to look at if or at or else
conditions so in this case what we can
say is else we want to say echo you are
not older than 25 so in this case what's
going to happen is we're going to check
this if this evaluates to true we'll run
this and we won't run this if this
evaluates to false we won't run this but
we will run this so now if we refresh
we'll always get an answer so you are
older than 25 and in this case I can say
for example 18 when I refresh you are
not older than 25 so this is called an
if-else statement now what we can also
do is we can incorporate checks along
the way as well so let's just say we
want the person to be
older than 25 and then we can
incorporate another check here so if age
is greater than 25 you are older than 25
else if age is less than 18 you are
younger than 18 so in this case what
we're doing now is we're checking if the
age is greater than 25 and outputting
this then we're saying else if the age
is less than 18 you're younger than 18
so in the case of something being in the
middle so 20 for example we don't get
anything out but because it doesn't
satisfy any of the conditions that we've
passed through to this if statement
however if we were to change this to 30
you're older than 25 if we were to
change this to 16 for example it says
you're younger than 18 now what we could
also do is we could say something like
else something else and then if we were
to put this in the middle of 25 and 18
then when we refresh it says something
else so there's really you know this is
entirely up to whatever application
you're developing as to what the if
statements are but yeah essentially
that's how an if-else statement works
now let's just take this back to the
very basics now what we can also do is
we can nest if statements within other
if statements so what we can do is we
can say if age is greater than 25 and
then we can say if admin echo you are an
admin and older than 25 now this isn't
strictly necessary because we could use
we could use the and operator and we
could say and admin so we could do
exactly that in one line but let's just
take a look at an example of nesting
because sometimes nesting is actually
required so I'm going to say admin
equals true and what we're doing then is
checking if age is greater than 25 and
then we're checking if we're an admin
and in that case we'll get
oh you an admin older than 25 and yes so
let's go ahead and run this okay so we
don't get any output because we age we
have the age set to 20 we go ahead and
set that age to 30 you're an admin and
older than 25 so we can do this and we
can nest perhaps multiple if statements
within this main if statement so we
could say for example else even on here
you are older than 25 but not an admin
so this is you know interchangeable it's
very basic functionality and it doesn't
make too much sense in a real world
application but OOP sorry
30 and false but basically if you come
across the need to use if statements you
can look at you can work which you
entirely within an application you can
look at it and evaluate how you want
this to work but basically that is the
just the syntax of working with if
statements in PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
