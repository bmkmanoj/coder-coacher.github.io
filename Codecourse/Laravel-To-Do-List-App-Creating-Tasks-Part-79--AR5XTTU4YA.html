and we displaying tasks to a user and
we've allowed the user to mark tasks as
done and undone we're going to go back
to our editor and we're going to allow
our user to actually create a task so
first we need to create a link so let's
go to our home page and inside here
we're going to create we're going to add
a small tag and we're going to say I
hate track we're just going to add a
dummy link for now and say new task
perfect
I know just in case this in brackets
just make it a little bit cleaner
so now we need to add the route for this
new task so let's go to our routes file
routes get new array as new uses
controller at get you and we also need a
post route for that so post new array
uses home controller at post you and we
also want to run the cross-site request
forgery felt so honest so now let's
create those methods in our controller
we have public function get new and we
also have public function post inside
here all we're going to do is return a
view off of new so let's create that
view now new file you've laid up HP I'm
going to extend layout stop main whoops
and then we're going to set the section
to content and stop it and we'll just
say new and just to make sure that
everything works click and we didn't
update the link so let's go back URL
route new refresh click
awesome we're going to say here h1
create new tasks and we're also going to
create a form from open and form closed
perfect so we're just going to have one
input filter it's going to be important
because text name equals name
placeholder it cause the name of your
task awesome
now I lied we need two inputs we also
need to submit button so input type
equals submit finally equals create so
at the moment nothing is going to happen
we're just going to get a blank page so
we need to add the functionality in this
method here so I'm going to create a
rules right we're going to set the name
field to required we're also going to
say minimum characters is three max is
all set it to 255 and what else do we
need I think that's just about it
so let's create the validator instance
by the data link and put all roles will
say if validator fails return redirect
route new with errors validator I'm just
like in our login page we need to add
the error message so we'll just copy the
code from them and we'll test this out
create perfect for getting there if we
enter one character great so let's go
back at the moment if we use it into
some correct import just get a blank
page again so we need to say item equals
new item
item name because input get name and
item save and then we're going to return
the user to home so let's refresh you
name of task feed the cat enter let's
check out database oh we didn't we
didn't specify the owner ID so let's go
back to our code we need to say user
idea pinkles off user ID and below here
just say item owner ID equals user ID
and in fact let's just make this a
little cleaner let's try that again
feed the cat perfect we created a task
in our maka stone London</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
