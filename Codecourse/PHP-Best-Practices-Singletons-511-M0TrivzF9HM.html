Singleton's we have a database class
here we have a static get instance
method all we're doing here is we're
creating a new instance of itself and
storing it and get instance and then we
return and get instance the good thing
about singleton is no matter how many
times this line occurs we're only going
to get this message once so we're only
instantiating the class once the bad
thing about Singleton's is well there's
actually quite a lot of things a few of
them testability if we were to run some
unit tests on this code we'd get into
some issues also it creates tight
coupling on classes think of Singleton's
this way we have name equals Terry
function echo name if we echo name you
should know that we're going to get an
error here no well we didn't call it
echo name undefined variable name and
this is because this variable here is
out of the scope of this function so
what you could do it's a global name and
that would work but this is bad practice
and this is exactly the same thing all
we're doing here is we're creating a
global class which we really don't want
so let's get rid of that we're not going
to refactor this code right now but in
the next episode we're going to look at
what in the next part we're going to
look at dependency injection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
