best to leave commas on the last element
of an array and if you don't know what
I'm talking about I'll explain in a
minute but I show you an example and
then we'll look at my two reasons why I
always do this whether or not you agree
that's completely fine but this really
helps me just day-to-day development so
by leaving a comma on the end of the
last element of an array I essentially
mean when you have some kind of an array
so for example a variable called user
here which is we're assigning an array
to let's say we have some unlucky
username here and then obviously we have
a comma here because we want to create a
new element and then we have something
like name like so so usually you'd think
it's highly things up let's get rid of
this last comma if we do have a comma
here it doesn't generate a syntax error
that's perfectly valid but this would
normally be something you'd write you'd
leave off the last comma so the reason I
don't do that is twofold so first of all
I'm going to just quickly commit these
changes so we have modified index dot
PHP all I'm doing is just committing it
to a repository which we'll see in just
a moment I'll just say update and let's
go ahead and push that up ok so if we go
over to this repository now you can see
that we have this content just in here
so what's going to happen now is I'm
gonna go ahead and add another element
to this and I'm gonna push it back up to
the repository so I'm adding on say age
okay so let's keep this last comma just
in here for the sake of it so let's go
ahead and add that in and let's go ahead
and just commit this will just do the
same message and we'll push this up
again okay so let's head over to here
then and you'll see that we have
if we just head over to this latest
commit you can see here the - the no new
liner into file we actually have it kind
of looks like we've got two changes here
you can see this line here highlighted
in green which was there before and you
can see the new line here highlighted in
green now to me to first look at this I
kind of draw my attention to this line
here when there's not really a need to
draw my attention to this line simply
because nothing the only thing that was
added here was the comma so it kind of
adds more additions to this commit and
that can be pretty annoying if we hadn't
of or if we had a comma in there so for
example if we go ahead and just add
another element and we go ahead and
commit this up as well you'll see that
we have the following so I've added a
new line in I already had a comma on the
end of this last line and it's extremely
clear that all I've done is added this
line so that's one reason that's
probably the main reason it just gets a
little bit annoying if you have too many
additions here and it's hard to focus on
what's been added the second one is
extremely straightforward I use a lot of
keyboard shortcuts within sublime or I
guess you may if you have other if you
have another text editor so the reason
that it's best to leave a common the end
for me is because if I need to add a new
element to this array all I can do is
just duplicate that line down and I'm
done I don't need to do anything else
now if for example you wanted to not add
commas on the last element of an array
you would be in a situation where you
would have to duplicate this down you'd
have to add this comment in here and
that's pretty annoying it's just another
step and obviously depending on how much
you're adding two arrays this could
probably get a little bit slow and kind
of slow you down you might not think so
but it's just a little bit annoying so
if I always keep a comma on the last
of myarray I can duplicate this down as
much as I want fill in my content I
don't need to do anything here I don't
need to add or remove anything and then
when I create my commit through git or
whatever version control you're using
you'll see that we don't have the
annoying problem of it highlighting two
lines as an addition so they're my two
reasons for keeping a comma on the last
element of an array you may have other
reasons why you do this and I'd love to
hear them so please get in touch but
otherwise there's just a quick tip to
hopefully save you a little bit of time
and hassle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
