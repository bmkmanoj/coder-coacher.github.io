messages to our server what we're now
going to do is look at actually
retrieving these first of all when you
first land on this chat and second of
all when you actually send a message now
we've already got plenty of test data
inside of our database so we can test
with this coming through now
the way this is going to work is when
you hit the page or when a client rather
hits a page like this it's going to
obviously we inside of our code
here we know that when a client connects
we do certain things so wait for import
blah blah blah what we're going to do is
omit all messages so when a client first
connects we're going to you know
basically retrieve all of the debt all
of the messages now database obviously
with some kind of limit in place and
then what we're going to do is send them
to that specific socket so ie
I'm just a client connecting and you
know I want to go ahead and you know
just just retrieve all the messages what
what's then going to happen which is
slightly more confusing I guess is when
I as a as a user type in a message like
this what I'm not going to do is I'm not
going to when I hit enter I'm not going
to go ahead and retrieve all of the
messages back again what's going to
happen is my request is then going to
force that on all clients that are open
so let's say a hundred people had this
chat window open and i typed hello when
I type hello their sake
or their client essentially or then they
are going to be listening for any input
so it's basically well not really but
when we send a message it's going to
emit to everyone so when I type in hello
it emits to all people that are on the
chat it doesn't really mess ajiz it just
does the one that I typed in let's just
take a look at how this works so to emit
all messages from the server we're going
to use our collection so call and we're
going to go ahead and use the find
method so exactly
we've done within our database here when
we use the find method like this so the
collection is going to well we're going
to find everything what we're then going
to do is limit it so we'd say dot limit
and we're going to limit it by 100 100
you know you can choose whatever you
want it doesn't really matter what we're
then going to do is sort this and we're
going to sort this by ID and we're going
to sort this in the order in the
opposite order that we would expect so
we're going to do this in the sort of
last first if you like so and what the
reason we're doing that is because when
we get these through in JavaScript we
want to then apply them to the messages
section but we don't want to have to
reverse them in JavaScript so we sort
them in this order here and then we
reverse them or we reverse them here
rather and then we sort them with output
than the JavaScript so this will make
sense a bit later so what when then
going to do is say to array which is
quite important and then we're going to
have a callback here and this is going
to obviously have an error and a result
now if there is an error we want to
throw an error you could obviously
handle this more grace gracefully and
perhaps maybe send a message to clients
but you don't have to do this so now I'm
going to say socket emit now remember
when we say socket dot emit this only
emits to the one person that's
connecting this won't remit to everyone
so if we were to do this differently
which we're going to do in a moment
this would emit to everyone we don't
want every time a new person connects
everyone to get the output again so
we're going to call this output remember
this is a defined name and we're just
going to pass the results as an array
what we're then going to do is modify
our index.html to listen for output so
when we listen for output we basically
just create another on method or solver
listener so we say socket dot on output
our function and we have the data that's
returned so for now what I'm going to do
is just console.log this data
so what this means is that when I now
refresh oh sorry we need to obviously
restyle server again that's just go
ahead and pull this over oops okay so
we've got a little error here and let's
just check where we've gone wrong oh yes
of course we we define that as an object
so this is not a comma at all this is a
little object it's a property so this is
the property that we want to sort by and
if we go and just restart this okay
perfect so now what's going to happen is
when a refresh you'll see that what this
does is it returns an array of objects
and these contain all the messages from
the server so this is actually now sent
all the data from the server that we
need so we've done it but you know we
need to really do now is actually list
through it and outputs it here now the
other thing that we need to do is when
we actually send the message we want
this to automatically output as well so
we want to down here actually output
this data as well so this will output to
all clients instead so let's just go
ahead and say emit latest message to all
clients so what this will do is instead
of using socket dot emit we'll use
client diameter which will emit it too
so there's a hundred people this will
emit the latest message that's inserted
maybe by me to everyone so output and
data and we're supplying this within an
array like this just because you know
the data that's come through is an
object and we want to have this as an
array so now we can test that also when
i refresh let's just go ahead and
duplicate this tab and open it in a new
window so I'm going to connect from here
I'm going to connect from here so what
that's done is it is it has outputted so
our console is outputted an array of
seven objects on both clients now as a I
just pull these over a little bit
as a user what I'm now going to do is
I'm going to say Alex new message or
something hit enter
oops we need to restyle bloom in server
there we go so I'm going to say new
message hit enter now you can see on
both windows that submitted this message
to both clients and you can see that
that's the latest message new message a
new message so the functionality to loop
through all of these objects within this
array and all of these and all of these
objects in the array is going to be
exactly the same it's just going to
output them here so let's go ahead and
do that now so all we need to do now is
the sort of back inside of it if you
like is done where it passes us the
messages we now just want to list
through and output these messages in
here which is you know just a case of of
listing through and outputting things so
I'm going to say socket dot on output
whether that's output when we initially
connect or output when we you know get a
new message posted by any of the hundred
thousand people and we want to go ahead
and actually loop through this data so
the first thing we want to do is make
sure that there is actually data
available because this is an array we
have access to the length property and
we're now going to go ahead and loop
through results remember whether that be
that single one or all of the results on
connection so we create a for loop and
we create a counter in here we're going
to say well X is less than data length
that we're going to say x equals x plus
one so now we are looping through the
count of the messages so what we're
going to do is create an element which
is a div element which is going to sit
within here remember we created these
earlier in the series when we styled
them up so what we want to do is we want
to say var message
equals document dot create element and
we want to choose the tag which is div
so we now want to do is set an attribute
for this remember we have
an attribute of chat message so set
attribute class to chat message that
will now apply that margin-bottom
we then want to go ahead and set the
text content for this so we want that to
be this a little bit more complicated
but it's going to look like this Alex
message so we need the name here and the
message here now remember the data
contains if we look in one of the
clients that we had open the data so
within this object contains the message
and the name so it's just property
message and property name so in here
what we want to do is just well let's
get rid of this we'll say data so the
data that's passed back X remember we've
got our counter here so zero index so
the first message basically and then we
want to say dot name and then we want to
concatenate on a colon and then we want
to concatenate on data X dot message and
that's it that's all we need to do we've
got our name and our message in here all
we need to do now is we'll just space
this out a little bit we want to prepend
this to the or pen sorry so we want to
say messages which is remember the main
container which we selected oh we
haven't done that yet so messages equals
get node chat messages so little and two
messages dot append child and we're
going to append the element that we've
just created message then what we want
to do is we want to insert this before
the last message resulting in reverse
order to say messages dot insert before
message messages dot first child and
that basically just mean that the last
message that's posted is at the very top
so let's go ahead and just grab two of
our windows open and refresh one and
there we go
so we'll refresh the other one and there
we go so this is this is the latest
message
I remember we've already seen this
functionality work because we've already
posted a message and seen the
console.log but now if I was to type in
say I know Dale and Ashlee Ashlee and
Dale was to say hello there that then
works in his past to both clients as
we've already seen in the console but
now actually outputs it and then
actually could say hi and that just
works exactly the same way around so
what we've done is we've obviously
created our you know our styled element
we've connected using socket IO using
WebSockets and we know that we're using
WebSockets because if we check let's see
in our network tab and let's filter this
by WebSockets we can see that we've got
a web socket here and you know in
connection we know that we connecting
via WebSockets we've got a styled
element we've got the ability to type in
a message a name that we sent through to
no js' we've got our server set up here
it validates it sends messages back to
the client whether or not it's a success
or not and basically all of this put
together creates our working chat that
we have here so we can now have you know
however many clients that you know no
Jess will be able to handle open and
chatting away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
