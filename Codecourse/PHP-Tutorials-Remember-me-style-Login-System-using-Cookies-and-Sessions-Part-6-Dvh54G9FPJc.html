gonna create our logout script now and
then we're gonna test if we're allowed
access to our user area once we logged
out the log app script is ridiculously
simple all we all we really need to do
is we need to first of all start the
session I mean we've already started the
session in our functions dot PHP page
but for a logout page we don't really
need to include that again because we're
connecting to our database and we're
setting functions that we don't really
need to use so you're slowing down your
scripts for no reason at all if you
don't need to include a full page you
just need to use one command from it
just simply type it you don't need to go
including pages you don't need things so
first we're going to destroy our session
and that's a simplest same session
destroy' you might have known that you
might have not with unsetting cookies
it's a bit different notice i've used
the word unset i haven't actually said
destroy because we can't actually
destroy a cookie all we can do is
cleverly reverse the process of our
cookie already created so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to say set cookie you
might think that's a bit weird set
resetting this cookie but what we're
going to do is we're going to use the
same name the same element name as
before so that's user name remember in
login we used a user name here instead
of now setting it to user name I'm going
to set it to you might have guessed
absolutely nothing so we're blanking
this cookie out then what we're doing is
we're setting it to the time but instead
of adding on 7200 seconds and remember
bear in mind to unset a cookie you need
to match this value but instead of using
a plus what we're going to do is we're
going to use a minus so we're cutting
this cooking back to a minus amount and
therefore is automatically destroyed and
will no longer be valid because it is in
fact in minus time you can't set a
cookie with a time limit in the feet in
the past okay so now we're going to just
redirect the user well it's probably
just polite to redirect them
back to login dot PHP page which is our
start page that we've we've become used
to
okay so let's test this out then we're
logged in at the moment this page hasn't
changed we haven't added anything on
here all we're going to do is click
logout and we've been redirected back to
our login page now notice this hasn't
redirected us back to our user area
Script because we have in fact been
logged out and now when I tried to
access user area dot PHP I'm
automatically redirected back to login
so I don't have any access to that again
what I can do now is say Alex and one
two three is my password click login
and I'm logged in and then again it's
exactly the same process I can't have
access to back to the login dot PHP page
now the most important part of this
tutorial is the fact we need to test out
our Remember Me feature so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to pause the
video for one second okay so I paused
the video for a second and I've closed
off all my browser windows except this
one so this is the only browser window
I've got open
bear in mind like I said before when you
destroy a session and the way to destroy
a session is to close all your browser
windows then your session is destroyed
so I'm going to log in log in with my
password and I'm not going to check
remember me so what this does inside our
script if remember me doesn't equal
anything we just be setting a session
therefore when I close this window close
my browser all together out we shouldn't
be logged in when we come back to it so
if I click to log on or login we're
logged in successfully now I'm going to
close this right so yeah I'm going to
close this do you want Firefox to save
your tabs yeah I might just say save and
quit
and we've got context open here what I'm
going to do is now reopen Firefox and
refresh oh I'm still logged in okay
let's check and this again I'm gonna say
quit log back in or reopen your browser
and come to local host PHP academy'
tutorials back to the login page and
funnily enough or though we were logged
in before we now have access to the
login page again because we've closed
our browser so if I now now try and
access user area I'm no longer allowed
therefore by just closing my browser my
session was terminated now I'm going to
try logging in Alex one two three and
I'm gonna check remember me and then
going to click login a login was
successful we're not allowed to access
the login page as were already logged in
now presumably now we're logged in with
cookies therefore when I close my
browser and remember our cookie has been
set for 48 hours which is 7,200 seconds
I'm gonna open Firefox I'm gonna
navigate back to my login page and I've
automatically been moved to redirected
to user area and that signifies that our
cookie is still set and I'm still not
allowed access to the login dot PHP
until I log out so basically what I've
just done now is I have proved that by
checking remember me we are still logged
in when we reopen our browser and by not
checking remember me we're logged out as
soon as we close the browser and that is
the difference the fundamental
difference between sessions and cookies
and this is really really useful when
you're using a remember me star login
script so that's basically everything I
have to share with you we've created a
mini login system but incorporated I
remember me
took some security features and put this
back into here I know I've had a few
comments on the YouTube page recent on
my youtube channel recently
with people saying about security
features so I'm going to try and
incorporate these more into my videos
and help you guys out in that way as
well as teaching your PHP okay so I hope
this tutorial was useful if you'd like
me to expand on it then just let me know
if you haven't subscribed to my YouTube
already please hit the yellow subscribe
button it really does help every
subscriber does count and you'll also be
updated with new videos that I create I
hope you enjoyed this tutorial and
obviously there'll be some more coming
soon so thanks a lot guys bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
