this series for Java for beginners in
this video we're going to be looking at
mathematical operations inside the java
programming language obviously
mathematics within a programming
language is incredibly useful in
hundreds and thousands of different ways
so we're going to be learning the basic
syntax for how to do mathematical
operations and it is pretty
straightforward you can see I've left
this comment in here from last time just
so we remember how we declare variables
with the names so let's go ahead and
make two integer variables simply called
a and B and this is another way I'm
going to show you how we can declare
variables if we declare the variable
type if we want to make more than one
variable of this same type we can simply
write the name of the variable that the
name of the variable we want to make and
then we could do a comma and then we put
another one and then comma and then we
can do as many comments as we like to
make a number of different variables so
I'll actually leave these in we'll make
four variables all integers a B C and D
and then we can declare them on
different lines down here we can say a
equals whatever or we can declare them
in line like this but it looks a makes
it look slightly more messy a little bit
harder to read so I'm going to declare
them all up here and then we can
initialize them just underneath so I'll
make a equal to 10 B equal to 20 make
sure we do the semicolons after each
line we'll leave a C and D for now we
can use those later so there's four
different types of basic mathematical
operation we can do without using Java's
built-in library format and those are
simply add subtract I'll separate them
with commas add subtract let's actually
write it subtract multiply and divide
and we use we use these different
symbols here for add we obviously is the
add symbol for subscribe to - key
multiplier is the asterisk and
is the forward slash and we can use
these we can use all these different
symbols in line they're built in the
Java compiler knows what to do with
these we don't have to use any other
special syntax so we can simply go ahead
and let's go ahead and use the C and D
that we've declared so we can go ahead
and initialize C now and we could say C
is equal to we can say with this equals
thing assign whatever's on the
right-hand side to the left-hand side
whatever the result from this right-hand
side operation is assign it to that
left-hand side variable there we could
go and go ahead and say a plus B and
then we'll come down a bit say system
dot out dot print line and then simply
put in that C variable and then when we
hit run we can see that we have 30 here
we've made a equal to 10 we've made B
equal to 20 then we've set C equal to a
plus B the result of 10 plus 20 and
that's 30 obviously and then when we
print out we can see it so that's how we
use basic mathematical operations and in
line we can use as many operations as we
want bear in mind it will be affected by
bod mass or pet mass there's loads
different ways of saying it I brackets
first then operations and so on so we
can go ahead and do any number of a
complicated equation however we can put
this a and B in brackets here then we
could say divide by 10 for example and
this is going to come out with the
answer 3 because we say a let's see eat
be equal to again the equals wind
whatever the result of this is assign it
to C so the result of this is a plus B
we add those together which equals 30
then we divide it by 10 which equals 3
so you're beginning to see how we can
just simply use as if we were just
writing a normal mathematic equation we
can just use brackets the plus divide
times etc and we
can just formulate our own equations and
then set them equal to variables so
let's go ahead and get Dee involved now
we can come down and say D equals a for
example C multiplied by B so just read
it as if it were normal math equation we
have a plus B which is 30 divided by 10
which is 3
then we're going to make D equal to C
multiplied by B which will be the 3
times the 20 and then we can here
run first of all we'll make sure we put
D in the system.out.print line make sure
we're printing out this new variable and
not the old one and we can see we come
out with the answer 60 so now that we've
learned about the mathematical
operations we can do let's go ahead and
learn about some new variable types so
we've been introduced to the integer
here we're going to go ahead and show
you the different types of numbers we
can do in Java the built-in data types
for numbers so there's three different
types of integer we have a short integer
which is basically a small number and
when I say small I mean it's small in
terms of sort of computers and
programming the short integer is a
16-bit number which I think it goes up
to can go up to 32,000 and something and
from from - they 2000 up to 30 mm oh and
there's a one before sure actually we
can declare a byte in Java which is
eight bits and then we'll say very small
number and this can go up this can go
from minus 128 to and up to 128 so bite
sure then we have integer which we've
been introduced to
this is just the average size number its
32-bit which means it goes up to a
pretty large number two to the power of
32 I can't do that off the top of my
head but it's basically integer will be
fine for most normal calculations within
a program for if the integer is not
enough we have the long variable type
which is a long integer and this is a
large number and this is a 64-bit
integer which means 64 bits of memory is
stored aside for this so 2 ^ 64 so this
is a very large number this is the
largest number like primitive number
data type in Java and this will be more
than enough for pretty much anything
you're going to do any larger number
needed in this there's like custom the
sort of custom classes the Java used for
that so these are the 4 different types
of integers usually it's easiest to just
write int because even though these two
take up less space it's pretty minimal
and it's only 4 if you're really
concentrating on optimizing a program
that you're making so just take note of
these 4 integers that the primitive data
types byte short int and long then we
start getting into decimal numbers we
have two different types we have the
float which is a floating-point number
and this is the same size in terms of
memory as an integer at 32-bit and this
can be equal to this can be equal to a
decimal number but not just an integer
so we can set it to point or whatever we
can have a point and one thing to note
about the float which is something you
have to do you can see there's an error
here and I'll explain why if we go down
to the next line the second type of
Fleur decimal point number is called
double
and this is basically like the long
version of the float this is not 62 bit
it's so 64 bit so it's for really
precise decimal numbers this double
usually you're going to use float
because it's going to be more than
enough for something you're doing but
again double is there if you need it and
this can be equal to whatever so you see
here these two different types basically
because there's no way of telling a I
guess for the Java compiler I mean I'm
not I'm not sure the exact reasons but
when you're declaring these decimal
numbers here the float you put an F on
the end just like that for float and the
F is just there to tell the compiler
that this should be a float float
decimal number not the double type of
decimal number so those are the two
different types of decimal number then
you have a the smallest technically an
integer the boolean value and this is
simply true or false and for this type
we use built in Java keywords we can
either set it equal to true you can see
that's highlighted in blue it's a Java
keyword or we can set it equal to false
pretty simple
and the final type final primitive
variable data type we have I'm going to
show you so we've done the integers here
we've done the two different types of
decimals we've done the boolean value
which is a true or false value which
we're going to be actually using a lot
in the next tutorial and the final one
I'm going to show you is char which
stands for character and this character
a character variable type can be any
individual character on the keyboard and
do you remember for when we're writing a
string in this system out print line we
use the double speech marks double
speech marks is four strings of letters
characters and numbers when we declaring
a char
we do single quotation marks not double
quotation marks and we're going to put
one there can be one character inside
here it could be a space if you put any
more than one character you see you get
an error it can be a space it can
literally be any character on your
keyboard and each of these is obviously
assigned their own Unicode 16-bit
Unicode character within the Java
compiler so when you put in a that's
equal to whatever value is I'm not sure
and same with every other character on
your keyboard so now that we've learned
most of the primitive datatypes in the
next tutorial we're going to be looking
at if and else statements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
