to use laravel migrations I can pretty
much guarantee that the use of
migrations in your project will not only
save you time but also save you much
frustration now when you set up a level
laravel project you're not forced to use
migrations so in this video I'm going to
be convincing you to always use this
powerful built-in functionality so what
are migrations well they're often
described as a sort of version control
for your database schema your database
schema is the structure of your database
including the tables you have within it
the columns you have for each table the
type of data they hold and other
information associated with them
for example a unique or auto
incrementing field migrations that you
define within a file how your database
should look including any updates you do
along the way this means you always have
a copy of how the database should be
amongst all the developers on your team
now with the issue of a command you can
update your local database installation
to represent any of the changes other
developers have made or if you're
working on your own on a project and
you're switching between computers you
can basically say goodbye to having to
export import SQL files across different
machines in the next video we'll jump
right in with an example of creating a
table using laravel migrations then why
if you're not installed laravel just yet
will quickly cover that too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
