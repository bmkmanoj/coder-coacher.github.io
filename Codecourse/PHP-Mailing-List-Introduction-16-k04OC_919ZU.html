building a mailing list with PHP using
the mailgun api a little bit about more
about that in the next video
let's take a look at what our mailing
list functionality is capable of now the
first thing your user can do is actually
subscribe to your mailing list so you
can put this form anywhere you want and
you can go ahead and enter a name and
you can enter an email address here now
what that's going to do is that's going
to send a subscription request to
mailgun we could just forward it back
here for now but you can implement you
know messages to tell your users that
they've been subscribed if I go over to
my mail client and we refresh you can
see that we've got a please confirm your
subscription so it says hello Alex
Garrett you sign up to our mailing list
confirm using the link below this is
going through to confirm dot PHP and
it's passing this generated hash in so
if we look here you've got confirmed
what PHP this is all done with mail gun
so you don't need to worry about doing
too much here this is really easy when I
click this that's going to go through to
confirm it's going to forward us back to
the mailing list page which is
essentially this and so if we just
quickly take a look over in our mailing
list section and we'll be learning how
to set up mailing this with mail gun
later you can see that this has
subscribed to me here so now I can
actually do is as in as an administrator
or something like that I can go ahead
and send an email to all subscribers
just note as well that we've just had an
email back through from from our
application saying that we have
subscribed to it confirms that were
subscribed as well so under send this
would be protected by an admin password
or in some kind of admin area for the
subject let's just type test bulk email
this is a test
oh email and we'll also look at things
like parameters that we can use within
these to address people by name or
something like that so if I hit Send now
that's going to send it to or basically
send one request to mail gun that's
going to then mail it to everyone that's
subscribed to my list so
could be thousands and thousands of
people and if we refresh inside of here
you can see that that has indeed
addressed me by my first name
mayor gun has automatically chopped out
my first name this is the benefit of
using male gun and we've then got this
is a test bulk email now more
importantly we've also got this
unsubscribe link which is required I
guess in most countries by law we can
hit this and we can actually unsubscribe
from the list and that will then no
longer allow any emails to be sent and
we can see under here it says that I am
now unsubscribe if we look under
unsubscribers there we are and that
won't allow any more subscriptions or
any more the ability to subscribe again
unless it's removed from there so that's
the functionality because we're using
mail gun this is super simple scalable
it's really easy to use in the next
video we'll talk about the more of about
the benefits of using mail gun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
