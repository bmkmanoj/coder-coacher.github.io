going to create a filter this filter is
basically just going to allow us to
generate md5 hashes inside of our view
and it's going to look a little
something like this we'll have a string
here then we'll have a pipe and then
we'll have our function name which is
md5 and just to make this a little bit
clearer and a little bit more readable
I'm going to remove these dollar signs
from our variables so just remove them
in our view and then now remove them
from our lexer let's just make sure that
we didn't break anything or remove this
for now great so let's put this back in
and now we're going to create our filter
so filters have to be above our lexer
otherwise we're going to get an error so
we're going to say md5 filter equals new
twig simple filter our first parameter
will be our function name which is md5
as we can see here now second will be a
closure and this is going to take one
parameter which will be called string
and this is what I was inside these two
quotes here so if we just return md5
string and refresh in our browser we
should get an error and that's because
we created the filter but we didn't
register it with the twig instance so if
we say twig and filter and b5 filter and
try again perfect we get our md5 hashing
you can have as many filters as you like
there's no limit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
