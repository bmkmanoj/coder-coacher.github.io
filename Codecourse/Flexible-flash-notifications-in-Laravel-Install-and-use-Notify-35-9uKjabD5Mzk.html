notify we obviously need to require it
into our project so we do a composer
require on code course slash notify
that's going to go ahead and download
the notify package okay so that's done
let's head over to config app because
what we need to do now is pull in the
service provider to allow this to work
so this is namespaced under co course
notify its notify service provider so we
pull that in there is a optional facade
but we don't really need this because if
we have a look under the packages files
here you can see we have this functions
file which will just return an instance
of notify and that'll allow us to use
the shorthand function but if you did
want to use a facade you can go ahead
and add it into your facade list just
down here so what we're gonna be doing
is creating a route here which is going
to set a notification redirect us back
to the home page which is this welcome
lady PHP file that we have up here for
this view and then we're gonna in both
ways with bootstrap and sweet alert show
a notification so let's create this
route now it's just going to be called
two slash notify and inside of here
we're gonna notify and then we're just
going to return I'm gonna redirect to
fort slash now obviously all of this can
be done within a controller that's more
appropriate than writing everything
within your routes file but we're just
testing here so you can go ahead and try
out here if you're working with a fresh
installation so let's test this notify
route works so I should just redirect us
back to the home page perfect so let's
try with the bootstrap version of this
first of all so what we need to do is if
we have a notification we just need to
render some markup and then show them to
show the message within that so under
our routes then all we need to do is use
the notify function we want to flash a
message and we can type the message here
so you have signed in for example
then we give a type this can be success
it could be error and this isn't highly
flexible notifier is front-end framework
agnostic so we don't have not tied down
to things like error it can be anything
you want we're gonna do success for now
so if we go back to our notify route
here you can see that nothing really
happens but what we have actually done
here is we have stored session values
and inside of our view we can use notify
to check if these exist without having
to use the laravel session facade so
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to say if
notify ready that means that we have a
message ready to show I'm just going to
type ready in here now just so we can
test this out so if we go to notify you
can see we get ready output to the page
and then that goes after we refresh so
in here then what we want to do is we
want to output alert and then alert say
success and in here we want to output
the notify message so we can say notify
message and what that's gonna do is when
we head over to notify you see you for
signed in so it's that easy
you may have noticed that I hard-coded
in success here now of course depending
on the type you send here you may want
to output that as a class so that's just
as easy you just say notify type and
then for anything we do we get the right
type so for example we could change this
to sign in failed error which is
bootstraps class here for an error so it
would be notified - error and if we go
back to notify now you see sign in
failed actually might be danger rather
than error try this one out there we go
so it's completely flexible if you're
working we've just mark up here and of
course we can pass through additional
options to this as well but we're gonna
look at that
when we look at using sweet alert
which will give us much nicer flash
messages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
