user signs in if their account is not
active so in my database I've already
registered an account here which hasn't
been activated by email and we're going
to leave it that way and what we're
going to do is we're going to try and
sign in with both the username and the
email and we'll see the problem that we
have here so the first thing I'm going
to do is sign in with the username and
you see that's actually signed me in
despite the fact the account is not
active if I log out and I log in with
the email address I used here to
register that won't sign me in so what's
the actual problem here well if we take
a look at the code what's happening here
is we're saying where the username
equals the identifier which is fine or
whether email matches the identifier
which is also fine because we want to
sign the user in by either their
username or email and then we're saying
we're active equals true so what we're
actually doing here is we're saying
whether email or the username equals the
identifier and then separate to that or
where the email equals the identifier
and active is true so this is separate
from this when we construct the actual
query so we need to work out how we are
actually going to fix this or you're
going to be allowing people that don't
have an active account into your system
so what we need to do here then is I'm
going to get rid of all of this we're
going to be rewriting everything here
but I'm just going to get rid of it for
clarity what when it is when let's do
the same thing but the first thing we're
going to do is check if the users
account is active now we're not going to
just be saying where and then email
equals identify or username equals
identifier what we need to do is
something slightly different and this is
a query within a call back so what we're
going to do or in a closure so what we
going to do here is going to say where
and then we're going to have a closure
just in here and we're going to pass
through our query builder this is
elephants query builder that gets passed
through so from this what we can do is
we can return an
a separate set of queries so this will
make sure that the users account is
always active and then in here we can
check if the email matches the
identifier or the user name matches the
identifier so we need to do from this
query is say return query where email
equals the identifier now we don't have
the identifier variable in scope so we
need to use it just here so and then on
to this we can chain or where the
username equals the identifier so that's
how we're going to structure this
remember we need to grab the first
record from this still or we can't
access any of this and that's pretty
much it so let's just test this out and
see how it goes so i'm going to log in
with the email first which remember
worked before that wouldn't let us in
and that says we can't be logged in and
now i'm going to try with the username
and that also can't lock me in so let's
quickly activate this account just from
the database here just so we can see
this working and allowing us in so now
what i can do is i can sign in with my
username I'm in and I can also sign in
with the email that I provided like so
so that's just a quick fix just the way
we structured this was not quite right
and that led to the problem of being
able to login with the username even
though you didn't have an active account
so you can go ahead and update this and
you'll be good to force users to
activate their account before they can
sign in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
