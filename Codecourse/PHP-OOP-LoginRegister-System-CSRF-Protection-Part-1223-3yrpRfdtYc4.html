potential security vulnerabilities in
what we've already built we're going to
address them now so we're going to look
at specifically a cross-site request
forgery and if you're unaware of what
cross-site request forgery is it's
basically the ability to define
parameters perhaps either by get or post
and an unwillingly a user who happens to
be the victim will be not executing but
using these parameters on a page without
their knowledge now let me just give you
an example of how this might work so
we've built our register dot PHP file we
have validation we have the ability to R
it will not register a user yet but the
potential ability to register a user now
because of the way our input class works
and even if we even if this wasn't how
our input class works a user can still
allow another user without them knowing
to post post or get variables to this or
values to this page get is obviously a
lot easier because in the case of that
we can just pass in something like user
name equals Alex and you typically find
this problem on things like shopping
carts where you could say for example
and add item equals item you know idea
five or something like that and that
would add that items that users basket
without cross-site request forgery and
protection that can happen so
unfortunately at the moment in our
application we can actually define
parameters in the URL which you know you
might think now that's a little bit
dodgy and it is so we need a way to
generate some kind of token to only
allow data from this form to be posted
to that to you know to be posted back
back and interpreted by PHP if you're
unsure about how this works or that
explanations a little bit confusing
carry on and we'll we'll you know we'll
go through some of the different aspects
of this in a moment so we want to negate
the ability to be able to do this so how
we going to be able to do that what can
we do well what we're going to be doing
is building
a token class which allows us to first
of all generate a token and second of
all check if a token is valid and exists
and then delete that token so we're
going to be generating a token for each
refresh of the page which only that page
then knows so another user somewhere
else can't direct into that page because
the token will always be checked so
again a little bit confusing but let's
go ahead and start building this so the
token needs to be generated inside of
our form down here somewhere so we need
an input type of hidden with a name of
token and a value of well this is where
our class comes in we need to be able to
generate a token so let's go ahead and
build this token class now we want a
name of a token to be the same all the
time so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to add this to our our our session
config so I'm going to say token let's
say token name equals token perfect so
we'll just call it token or CIFS code
whatever you want to call it so I'm
going to call it token for now so what
we can do now is create a static method
to generate a token for us and what
we're going to do is we are going to
return session put token md5 unique ID
sorry unique ID and that's it but
instead of token we're going to use
config get session token name now we
also have this session class as well
that we need to build and so we'll go
ahead and build and we'll go ahead and
build that now just so we you know we
can we can use this so if we go over to
session
okay so we just will just build the put
functionality because we don't want to
worry about anything else just yet
because we're going to we're going to
work with sessions in a moment so let's
go ahead and just create a public static
function put and we want to put
something a session name with a session
value and all this is going to do is
it's going to return dollar underscore
session name and that's going to be
equal to value so it will return the
value it or return the value of the
session as well we don't need to do this
but we'll do it anyway so let's go ahead
and get rid of that for now we'll
address session class in the next part
so now we have the ability to put in a
session we can go ahead and actually
start to start to look at this so when
we generate a token this this will be
returned and what we now want to do is
inside of a register form literally just
say echo token generate that will be
returned to us because we are returning
the value session put that's why we
returned it in our session class we're
returning a token that will be output
there and it will also be put into a
session so we have that in the user
session we can check so let's go ahead
and just refresh that sorry view the
source of the page and you can see that
we've got a token here now when i
refresh you can see that this value
changes each time so it's now unique to
the users that refreshing that page and
this will be updated in the users in the
session too to reflect this as well so
now that we've done this we need the
ability to check if a token is you know
exists or not so we also need the
ability to get a token from our session
and check if it is the same as the token
that's been defined in the form so let's
go ahead and create another method
called check
and we want to pass in a token to check
if this token exists in the session if
the token equals the session that's
currently being applied so the token
that's been applied in the session we
want to then delete that session return
true if that's the case so in this case
what we want to do is just quickly say
token name equals config get session
token name and then we want to do a few
things which means we're actually going
to need to change our session class a
little bit and let's go ahead and write
this code before we actually do anything
so if session exists token name and the
token that we've supplied to this form
is equal to session get token name then
we want to delete the session by token
name we want to return true otherwise we
want to just return false if none of
that works out so we're checking if the
session exists with the token name that
we've defined in our config we're then
checking whether the token that's
applied to our check function or check
method equals the session that's been
stored by the user so ie this basically
just means does this value is defined as
well as all of the other form data equal
the session token that's been generated
an attacker won't know this token
because it's been generated uniquely by
a user so an attacker will not know this
token value otherwise we delete the
session so we need to introduce three
more methods not difficult methods to
introduce at all so let's just go ahead
and do these and let's get rid of our
input class as well so in session we
need the ability to check for
because it exists let's put this at the
top public static function exists so to
check if a session exists we need to
take a name and we need to return is is
set token name so if the token is set
true otherwise return false simple as
that
the next thing we need to do is the
ability to delete a token this will
again be a static method this will be
delete okay so we now want to also
define a name but we now want to refer
back to whether this token actually
exists or knocks we don't wanna unset
anything that doesn't exist there's no
need so we can say if self exists name
then we want to unset dollar underscore
session name so basically unsetting it
if it exists fairly pretty
straightforward and we also want the
ability to get a particular value as
well and this is again extremely
straightforward this functionality
doesn't really require that much PHP
knowledge it requires very basic PHP
node all we're doing is abstract it so
it's a lot easier to deal with so to get
a value we're just going to return
dollar underscore session name that's
literally it so now our token class and
our session class can work together to
to pull in things helpful helpful things
that we need so what we haven't done now
is checked here to see if our token is
is as good or not so what we're going to
do is I'm going to say var dump and
token check
and on our on our register our register
page we're just going to be saying input
get token so what we're doing now is
let's just run through this because it
is a tad confusing we're grabbing the
token from here which has been set in a
session already so what we now have is
we have a token in our source of our
form so we have this token and this
token ca2 blah blah blah blah blah
ending in five nine is also set as a
session for that user what then happens
is the user submits this form we use
token check to pass in the token that's
been supplied by the form what token
check then does is checks if a session
exists by with this token that's been
set and that the token that we've
supplied matches the session so we're
checking the token form in the form and
the token in this session if it does we
delete it so we don't need it anymore
and we return true and that means that
cross-site request forgery is failed so
let's go ahead and check this there we
go
I've supplied a user name of Alex and it
says Baal false so we now know that the
session has well this has failed so what
we can now do is we can now incorporate
this check into our into our the rest of
our code so what we can say is if else
the dirt all the way down to here just
in then this in actual fact now we we
can get rid of this we don't need to
provide an alternative we can just say
if the token exists or the token matches
if the token check passes then we'll go
ahead and do do what we want to do so oh
sorry we'll need to do that inside of
the class bigger pond so let's get rid
of this and if input exists
and then if token check input get token
now even if this input is token here
doesn't exist this will still fail and
therefore this won't work so now what
I'm going to do is using the same thing
that we looked at earlier hit enter and
oh yeah of course this has been input
here however the rest of the code hasn't
been hasn't been run and let's just
quickly prove that so I have been run so
I'm going to press ENTER nothing happens
so despite the fact there is input
available nothing's been run but when I
click register I have been run and then
we have the output validation output
that we've looked at before so we now
have the ability to not have input
passed here or in fact by post because
we require the register button to be hit
on the page with correct token there so
if this doesn't quite make sense take a
while to let this sink in and try and
understand how this kind of works and
why we do it is a concept that does take
a little while to understand but the
fact that we're doing it really really
you know helps with security means that
we can't the cross-site request forgery
is made a lot more difficult than then
it would be otherwise because we're not
protecting against it at all
so so yeah that's that's basically you
know how we protect against cross-site
request forgery we've created our token
class utilizing some of the
functionality in our session class which
we'll go on to next and and that's it
we've secured our application to another
level so we'll be using this this token
and method how our token class with its
methods and anywhere where we submit
data in our application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
