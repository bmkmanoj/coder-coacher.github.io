object that analogy to either pass will
stringify something so the json object
looks like this and we have methods
parse and stringify we're going to be
looking at the pars method in this video
so what we're going to be doing is Ajax
ink in the file that we've already
created parsing it and then seeing how
we can work with it in JavaScript so the
first thing that we're going to do is
write a little bit of code just so we
can Ajax to this people JSON file let's
go ahead and create a new variable
called XML HTTP and let's set that to a
new XML HTTP request what we are going
to do is create a variable here called
JSON so what we're going to do is we're
going to go ahead and we're going to
open this people JSON file so we use XML
HTTP dot open we choose the method in
this case I'm going to choose get we
choose the file in this case people JSON
and we pass true in what we then need to
do is do an XML HTTP send method so
let's go ahead and check this in the
browser and let's check the network tab
to see we're actually Ajax in this file
in you can see that we are we get the a
we get the JSON in here so what we're
now going to do is we're going to create
an on ready state change handler so we
say XML HTTP dot on ready state change
and this is going to be a collect
function here and in here we're going to
go ahead and first of all check the
ready state second of all check the
status and then we'll start to parse
this JSON so let's do a quick if
statement here to check that the XML
HTTP ready state it's for and the XML
HTTP dot
status property is 200 so once we've
done that we're going to go ahead and
we're going to take this variable here
and assign it the value of the response
text from this Ajax request just to make
things we'll make sure things are
working let's go ahead and console.log
working so let's go ahead and refresh
head over to the console and we can see
that everything is working here so now
what we're going to go ahead and do is
set JSON to XML HTTP dot response text
so let's go ahead and console log JSON
just to see what we get in out in our
console so we see that we get this
string here this isn't actually an
object at the moment because we've not
passed it yet using the JSON object so
what we're going to go ahead and do is
head over here and instead say json dot
parse and wrap the response text in here
so let's go ahead and refresh and you
can see that by console logging what we
get back this has been passed to an
object in JavaScript that we can
actually start to use so what we can now
do is start to traverse all of these
objects and start to use it as we would
normally in JavaScript so from here for
example you could loop through pick out
the data display it on the page
obviously that's a whole nother lesson
so we'll go ahead and leave that for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
