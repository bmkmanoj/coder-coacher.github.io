we're going to be creating our first
view so we can do this by going to app
views and creating a file I'm going to
call this home dog blade the PHP this is
going to extend layouts domain we're
going to have a Content section and
we're going to stop it
it's our table to say homepage just to
make sure that everything is working so
now we have to create this layout so I'm
going to create a new directory inside
our views and inside here we're going to
create a main the blade of HP file now
this is going to contain our HTML
structure so have a HTML we'll have a
head and the body tag the side here
we're going to have a title our two two
application and we'll also be and we're
also going to be including a style scene
so we're going to create that now we're
going to go to our public directory
we're going to create a CSS folder and a
style of CSS file so just to ensure that
this file is being included let's say
your body background black I didn't here
we're going to include our style sheet
so link rel stylesheet' a truth now what
are we putting here how do we say that
we want to get this file here what we're
going to be using la Ravel's URL class
so we're going to say URL asset and then
the path to this file this asset is
returning the path to this public
directory so all we have to do is say
CSS slash style.css
so that's all well and good we have our
two views here and we have our style
sheet but if we go to our browser and
refresh we're just being presented with
the same page so we need to go to our
routes file we need to delete all of
this and we need to create a new rate so
we're going to say route get and we're
going to pass an array we're going to
give this the Elias home and we're going
to use the home controller get index if
you don't know what this does it's
basically telling laravel to detect when
the user visits this URL in this case
down page when it does is going to
execute the code in this controller and
this method so with your default
installation of Narvel you should have
this controller here already if you
don't then create it we're going to
rename this method and inside here we're
going to change this view to the view
that we just created which is home the
blend of PHP we don't actually have to
include the extension we just have to
include the view name so if we return to
our browser and hit refresh there you go
we have our black background that we set
in our style sheet so we can remove that
now so what we're going to do here is
just get the basic structure sorted out
for our application so the first thing
we're going to do is add our style so
we're going to save body we're going to
set the font to Helvetica not arial
sans-serif we're going to set the font
size to 15 pixels and we're also going
to set the body padding to 20 pixels
zero and we're also going to set
background
so what else do we need well we need a
container so we'll do that now we want
this to be responsive so we're going to
set a width which is a percentage sixty
percent but on a large screen sixty
percent is quite large so we want to set
a max width also let's set this to 300
pixels we're also going to Center the
container with margin:0 auto and we're
also going to set the background to
white we also want to add a border one
pixel solid cccccc which is a lightest
gray and we also want some padding here
and let's just also add some css3
effects so I'll add a border radius and
a box shadow rgba 0 0 0 which is black
and we're going to add a transparency of
0.1 I'm not going to bother adding the
vendor prefixes but if you're going to
use this on a live site then you
probably will want to now for now this
will do but we're going to come back
here and add to it eventually so we're
going to close these files and we're
going to return to our main viewing
we're going to create the container that
we just styled and inside here we're
going to yield content so we're saying
grab whatever is inside these tags here
and print it out so if we go to a
browser and refresh there we go
we get this if we change it to hello
world we get hello world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
