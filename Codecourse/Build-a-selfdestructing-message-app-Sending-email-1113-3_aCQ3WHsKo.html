using a third-party service and I've
chosen to use mail gun this is what we
use on code course and the other thing I
like about this is every month you get
10,000 free emails and there is no
credit card required so it's a really
nice way to just get started with a
reliable way to send emails now we do
have a course on setting up mail gun but
what we're going to be looking at is the
very basics of this you don't really
need to add a domain I'm going to be
using the disruptor com domain but you
can use the sandbox domain if you want
and i'll talk more about that when we're
getting set up so go ahead and sign up
for mail gun and once you have signed up
you should see something like this so if
you head over to your dashboard under
your domain section this is your sandbox
domain that you can test with and
there's a couple of bits of information
here that we're going to be grabbing out
so for example the API key that we use
to access the API to be able to send the
email and to complement this we're going
to be using the SDK for PHP from male
gun now this is an extremely easy way to
just implement and send emails and get
them delivered reliably so once you've
signed up for male gun and you have your
sandbox domain here this is your domain
and this is your API key these are the
only two pieces of information we need
to actually send mail so we're obviously
going to be attaching this dependency on
our container so from within our route
just about here we can send the email
off but before we do that we need to
actually install the mail gun library so
let's head over to the github page you
can come over to this as well and if we
scroll down you can see that we can
require this package in this particular
version as well so let's just copy this
part let's head over to our terminal
again and let's composer require this in
hit enter and wait for that to download
so now that's downloaded we can take it
pull it into our container and then we
can use it
within our application so down here
we're going to say container mail and
we're just going to repeat exactly what
we've done for all of our other
dependencies which we're putting into
the container and we also want config
for this so we're going to be updating
out config and we're going to be adding
our mail gun configuration just in here
as well so let's just define this out
first of all to create a new instance we
just create a new mail gun male gun
instance and inside of here we need to
pass in our secret so this will go in
here like that but let's just go and set
this up in our conflict now so down here
i'm going to create a new key called
services and within this i'm going to
create a key male gun there's two things
we need like I said the domain and our
secret so if we head back over to male
gun we can use the sandbox domain if you
want I'm not going to be I'm going to be
using my domain I've set up in the video
we have over on the co course library
does actually teach you how to setup a
domain if you want to do this so this is
my domain name so I can pop this in here
and here is my API secret so I can pop
that in there so we now have services
male gun domain and services male guns
secret that we can access so over in
bootstrap then in here we just say C
config get services male gun secret and
we should be ready to go and start
sending emails with this so now that all
that's left to do is update our code
here to actually send the email however
what we need is a view to be able to
send this off so we're going to be
pulling in this view and we're going to
be passing some data through to it so
for example the hash
we can then build up the URL which we're
not going to be doing just yet because
we don't have a route to be able to view
the message and once we send the email
that view will be pulled in it will be
rendered and then we sent off to the
mail client so let's start to just
define this out then we'd say this mail
because that's the name we gave it under
the container and then send message
which is a method on the mail gun SDK
there are two arguments here our domain
and then an array of options so let's
just tackle this domain first of all
this comes from our config so we just
say this config get services mail gun
dot domain and in here we need to say
who it's from who it's to the subject
and the HTML body so from we can just
say no reply at destructive com2 it's
obviously the email address that we
supply here and we know that we can get
that from params that we've pulled in so
we do is say params email and the
subject can be anything you want but
we'll say new message from destructive
and the HTML body is going to be a view
for now let's set this to an empty
string so we can set up our view so
inside of our views directory let's
create a new folder called email and
again this might seem overkill but it's
keeping everything nice and separate
otherwise you'd have to have a long
string of data in here saying hello ex
blah blah blah and it just makes
everything a lot Messier if we have a
view we can just easily come over to
this view and update it so let's create
a new file in email and we'll call this
message quick and inside here let's just
put what we'd want to see in the email
so you have a new self
destructing message from destruct II
this is going to be our URL just here
and then here we can just say thanks
destruct e so at this point we just want
to test if this sends and then when we
start displaying our message we can use
the root helper to actually pull in the
full path for the route to actually view
the URL so over inside of our roots far
then we need to basically render this
view which is going to be passed into
mail gun sent off to their API and then
delivered to the person that its
intended for and to do this we do a
similar thing that we did with this view
render but we don't actually want to
render the view we want to just fetch
the contents of it so we say this view
fetch and then we choose the path to the
view it's email / message twig and we
also want to pass it in the hash as well
so in here we pass this in as an array
that will be passed through to the view
and we can use that hash value we
generated within that so what we could
do is actually just out put this in here
just so we know that it's coming through
in our email and then eventually we'll
be using this in the URL builder so now
all that's left to do is actually test
this works so I have my mail client open
if we head over here and end my email
address just write a message in there
and hit Send there we go that looks like
it's sent if we come over to my mail
client there we go so we've got a new
message from destructive we get the body
that we wanted to see we have the URL
and we also have that hash as well so
really that is the difficult part all
that we need to do now is build up the
ability to view a message we know that
identified by the hash so we can pass
this through to the URL builder and then
that will give the user that's received
the message the URL that they can click
on and it will be looked up in the day
space and then eventually deleted so
let's get rid of these for now because
we don't really need them and we can now
focus on actually showing the message to
the user</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
