actually output the images to this page
and replace our example images that we
start up earlier and actually get these
working so what we're going to now do is
get rid of this far dump we don't need
that anymore and what we now need to do
is think about what we're going to do if
there aren't any images so we need to
put an if statement around here so I'm
going to say if something
so if images we want to output this and
then I want to say else and then I want
to say end if there are no images so at
the moment what we're doing is we are
checking if there are any images and if
there are we're just outputting out
example content with this for loop here
otherwise we're saying there are no
images Oh up there we go so else so now
that we've got our else statement in
that saying deveneux images they're no
images to display because we've selected
PNG up here if I change that to JPEG
that then outputs all of our example
images so we've got the logic to
actually determine whether our image is
available now we want to swap this for
loop for a for each loop to loop through
the images so we know if we just do a
quick print our on images and we just
surround this with three tags that we
have each element here with an array
which has full and thumb so when we loop
through we need to bear in mind that we
won't need to access these two elements
within this array so if we just go ahead
and get rid of this again we want to
swap this for for for each let's get rid
of the increments and everything in
there and we want to say for each so for
for each images as image and we want to
end for each rather than n for so for
each images as image now this is
actually going to work as it stands
we're going to and
our output 1 2 3 4 5 6 images and we
know that we've got six images here
so it's outputting the right amount
we're just not outputting the actual
source of the image we know that the
full path of the image is what we want
to output so we open and close PHP tags
and we echo image and remember we need
to access that full element there so now
we can go ahead and output this now
we're outputting the wrong thing here
because if we inspect this and open it
we're actually out you know we're doing
the massive the massive version of the
image the larger image so we need to add
the thumb here what we do now need to do
is add an anchor to surround this and
the anchor is going to link through to
image full so what we've now got is the
output of our images these are our
thumbnails if we just check you can see
that this is within the thumbs directory
so it's the smaller version and when we
click on this we go through to gallery
images and the larger version so
basically we've built a PHP gallery
class that allows us to choose which
directory we wouldn't want images to
come from output the thumbnails on the
page we've styled this up and we've done
a bit of filtering just so we can select
which image types we actually want to
include when we get our images</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
