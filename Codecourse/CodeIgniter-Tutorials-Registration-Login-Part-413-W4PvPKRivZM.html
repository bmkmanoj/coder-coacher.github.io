this series where I'm building a login
registration system with codeigniter in
this video what I'll be doing is
building the form validation and we're
going to talk a little bit about a
custom callbacks - which is a kind of
cool a cool little way that I found that
we can do some some more heavy-duty
validations more customizable validation
so you can take this technique and use
it in your own projects as well okay so
what we have here is a form that's
actually submitting to a controller or a
function in it in the main controller
called login underscore validation so
right here you can see there's nothing
there nothing happening so we can
actually do our validation here first
thing we want to do is load the form
validation library so they'll go this
load library arm underscore validation
perfect next thing we want to do is we
can start setting rules for our inputted
data so we know this form validation set
rules and this will be for the email
email field so this will correspond to
the actual name right here the second is
the actual title of it so like the the
viewable title so in this case there
would just be same thing email except
with capital e and the third parameter
is a I guess it's an appended string of
all the different types of validation
that will that will be performing on
this variable so in this case I I'll
start off with just just putting
required and we'll leave that the way it
is now we can just copy this I mean I'm
using a notepad plus plus so that's just
control D but you can copy and paste a
line as well second we'll go password
name it password and then it will be
required and we'll also what we what we
do is we use a straight up line up and
down line
it's like right above the enter button
it shift it shift and then it's like the
shift and then whatever forward slashes
or backslash sorry and then we type in
md5 which will encrypt this in to
encrypt the password field to an md5
value and lastly after we've set our
rules we go if this form station run so
if it runs this run function will only
return true if all of the rules have
been verified so in this case we want to
say load the members page right so we'll
go this actually will redirect to main
slash members okay else if it doesn't
return return true and that means the
value that means the validation failed
what we want to do is we'll just load
the view again we'll go this load the
login view sorry login okay so let's try
this out they're both required so
basically if if one of them if either
one of them is is blank and submitted
blank
well it'll throw an error and actually
one more thing we want to do really
quick is a go echo form sort of
validation errors and it's important to
note that this is actually this function
is part of the form the form helper not
the form validation helper of the form
validation library so it doesn't need to
be loaded up here or auto load it at all
because it's part of the form helper
which has been Auto loaded so so we can
save this view make sure everything's
saved and then refresh it okay so it
passed because we did put in two
different parameters so what we can
actually do is we'll create a new
function in the main
controller function and then we'll call
this members essentially this is just a
function that's loading the view of
members perfect next we can actually go
ahead and create the members view just
so we have it there go into the views
and then just copy everything from login
all the HTML syntax create a new file
called members dot PHP open er up
paste it delete all of our login
specific code members page perfect
refresh this and then we have our
members page being loaded good now we
can actually yeah we'll just remove this
because no I'll leave it there save it
up and then go back to our main
controller now let's see what happens if
the validation doesn't pass so I'll just
go back to our login page or the root
URL say hello at welcome calm and we'll
leave this blank if I submit that that
validation errors function is going to
output any any errors that are thrown by
the form validation validation I guess
so if I leave the email field or both of
them empty it's going to give me two
errors and this is done all
automatically when we set our rules this
is extremely powerful and it's an
extremely quick way to do form
validation because especially
when you're working things like MySQL
and things like that because as soon as
you are using CodeIgniter in the first
place
to handle your your variables and that
kind of thing it escapes all your values
it does most of the security and things
like that for you so you don't need to
worry about it but there is a couple
more things that we can on that topic we
can add to this to the string different
functions that will be performed on on
this variable as it's submitted to
improve the security one of those is
trim I'm sure you're familiar with that
function if you've done any any type of
form validation in native PHP another
thing we want to do especially for the
email field is a perform XSS x SS
underscore clean and I believe that this
is a CodeIgniter function function
essentially what it does is it just
prevents cross-site script cross-site
scripting sorry and beefs up the
security on on your login form quite a
bit and I think for now that's about it
in the next video I'll talk about we'll
build a model for our login which will
essentially just check check and see if
if the credentials are ok and yeah
