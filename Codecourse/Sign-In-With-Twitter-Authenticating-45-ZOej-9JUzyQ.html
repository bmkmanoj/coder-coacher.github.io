creating the authentication process here
so there's quite a lot to do but what
we're doing is we're creating this earth
class or this Twitter earth caste we're
gonna chop this up into smaller methods
as we can just so we can make reuse of
things keep the code tidy and things
like that and also make it much easier
to maintain as well the first thing we
want to tackle is the dependency
injection now we're gonna need to inject
our database an instance of our database
class and the code bird as well into
this class and that might sound
complicated but it's actually fairly
straightforward let's first of all start
defining this class out remember we've
already got this included so we can
start to instantiate that with the
inside of index or something like that
so we're gonna need a couple of things
we're gonna need a database instance
which will be injecting in later we're
gonna need a client in this case this is
the code bird client in actual fact
let's get rid of this database instance
we'll deal with that later just so we
don't confuse things
now I'm also gonna store a callback URL
here so let's say well I'll call this
client callback now this needs to match
exactly what we provided in our Twitter
app when we created it so this is
basically just this URL here with
callback dot PHP on the end so that's
that we'll be using that with without
with code bird later we'll sort of
inject this in but we need to obviously
construct this so let's create a
construct method so a magic method here
now this is going to basically just set
this DB to DB and this that we're gonna
get rid of that aren't we do that later
so this client equals client so the
client is basically passed into this
class when we instantiate it here
let's get rid of that so we're gonna say
something like client equals new Twitter
or I'll call this off actually and then
we pass in our client so we just pass
that in and we can type in this as well
if we want again we're gonna have to
namespace this so code word code so that
needs to be an instance of this in this
case it will be just useful to type in
as well so let's check if this works and
there we go we don't see any problem so
just to verify this we can do avoid um
on this client like so so that's still
working so we now make use of this we've
injected it in and that just basically
means that we're not depending on this
being instantiated inside of this class
so now what we're going to do is we're
going to deal with the get earth URL
method so let's create a method for this
public function will call this get forth
URL so what this is going to do is it we
need to request tokens and then verify
those tokens and code bird make this
really easy for us so let's create a
protected function here and we're gonna
call this request tokens the reason I
call this request tokens is we need to
request 200 auth tokens which is the
whole normal our earth token and the
private one as well so what we need to
do here is return from this the the
tokens so I'm just gonna take the
example straight from the github repo
and we're gonna say this client remember
we've stored that up here now so we can
make use of this it within any of our
methods and we call ooofff request token
and then inside of here we have an array
I'm using the shorthand but you're more
than welcome to use the long array which
may not be available for your PHP
version and in here we have a property
called OAuth callback and you might have
guessed what this is it's the client
call back so is this client call back so
that verifies that and then what we want
to do is store those tokens but let's
just do a var dump on this reply so get
author URL it's eventually going to
return our authentication URL but for
now let's just call this request tokens
okay so let's take a look at what this
does we need to call this from here so
let's say off request
sorry no off get off URL okay so that's
gonna call the method we get we get a
little bit of a delay but here we go
we've got an object back with the OAuth
token the OAuth token secret and a
couple of other bits as we're including
HTTP status which we'll be using later
which is really important we'll be
verifying that as well
so now we've done this we want this get
author URL to return ask the actual
authentication URL so I'm gonna echo
this out here and down here what I'm
gonna do is actually store these tokens
now what all this is going to do is gets
gonna call another method so let's just
define this here protected function
store tokens and this is going to take a
token and a token secret and all that's
going to do is place them into sessions
remember in init we called session
starts we can make use of these as well
as determining if the user is logged in
or not so we're gonna say oh off token
and that is going to be assigned the
value that we pass in token and we also
have a session here called OAuth token
this time the secret one and again
fairly straightforward that just takes
the value that's passed in here so here
we can say this store tokens and we can
access because this an it's an object
we're gonna access the OAuth token and
the OAuth token secret so we are up here
getting the you off your al we're not
well we're not actually ending year but
we're requesting the tokens
once we've requested the tokens and
they've been stored in a session we then
want to verify them so we're gonna call
this verify tokens and the reason we're
splitting these up is we need to use the
verify tokens when we sign in as well so
down here let's create another protected
method called verify tokens so this will
send these tokens to the Twitter API to
verify and we use the set
token method on the client for this so
we say this client sets token and we
pass in these two so in this case it's
session I auth token and you may want to
store the names of these sessions
somewhere obviously things like the
client call back you'd store in your
configuration settings where you would
generate automatically whatever but you
know for the sake of simplicity we'll
just keep this as hard-coded values
it's our auth token secret so once we
verified the tokens that will error if
there's anything wrong with these but
from get or through our L we want to
return this clients who are accessing
our code bird instance and we want to
say Oh Wharf authenticate and that's it
so what this is should do now is return
us with a URL that we can go through -
perfect so this is the URL that we want
to apply to our link when a user goes
and signs in so let's create a couple of
bits on our index page to deal with this
so we know that we've got a method
called that now we can start to create
some markup so we want to eventually do
some checking so let's just quickly
implement this we want to do an if
statement here to say if auth sign-in we
haven't even created this method yet but
we'll do that in just a moment just to
return false
just while we sort of do this otherwise
we're going to want to output that link
that takes us through to Twitter so I've
just done some shorthand here we've got
if it's if you're signed in we're gonna
say you are signed in and then we're
gonna have a link here to sign out and
we'll link that up to sign out dot PHP
which will create later so otherwise
here is our link so sign in with Twitter
and in here as you probably guess we can
just echo or get or URL so let's create
this sign-in method just so we can test
this out so this is going to be a public
function what is it called again signed
in and for now this is going to return
false so that gives us then a sign in
with Twitter link what we can do now is
click on that that will take us through
here and we automatically see all of
this so it's you know it's fairly
straightforward the library were using
does all this and fetches this URL for
us so we can now actually authorize this
app but what's going to happen now is
when we sign in with when we click sign
in with Twitter mean authorize that's
going to come back to callback PHP when
we have created this file but we
obviously don't have any content in here
at the moment
but what you can see is we've got this o
auth token and this o of a verifier
that's been passed through so what we
now need to do is create some methods
that allow us to actually check if this
value is available and then secondly
actually sign the user in so what we're
going to do is inside of our callback
PHP file we're actually going to check
if the sign-in was successful if it is
we're going to redirect the user to the
index page otherwise we're just going to
kill the page and
the sign-in failed sitting cool back PHP
let's create an instance of our Twitter
auth so this is going to mean your new
Twitter auth and that is going to pass
in the client as a dependency and we're
now gonna create an if statement just
here with an else and basically this is
just gonna say if auth sign-in that's
going to check if the sign-in was
successful so we're gonna if that's the
case do a redirect to index dot PHP you
can do whatever you want here now
otherwise we're gonna just kill the page
and we're gonna say sign-in failed
fairly straightforward so inside of our
Twitter or let's create another public
method here sign-in and this is gonna be
a slightly longer method we could
technically break this up but we'll
create all of the functionality in here
that we need so the first thing I want
to do is check if we have a callback and
by that I mean basically does this our
verifier token exists so we're gonna say
if this has callback we haven't
obviously got this method yet so let's
just bang this down here protected
function has callback so this is
basically just gonna return whether all
that underscore get this is accessing
the get super global and it is oo or
underscore verifier so we're basically
just checking if that exists so we can
basically just copy and paste this into
here there we go so this is going to
return either true or false if it's true
let's kill this and just say yeah or
something like that okay so now this
will actually give us that value so we
know that that if statement is now
working based on the fact that that
token has been passed through and the
next thing to do is verify the tokens
again the tokens that be stored in a
session earlier so that's verify tokens
if this is incorrect we will get an
error you can see here that we've got a
sign-in failed already that
just because we're not doing anything so
we're gonna return false by default and
in here we're gonna return true wrap
that later so basically this is just
checking tokens and it looks like it's a
successful sign in here but we're not
really doing anything this is where you
have to be careful that you're not
slipping up in you know how things are
working but we're going to be doing a
check in here in a minute which
absolutely requires that the you know
response from Twitter is acceptable so
what we're gonna do now is we're gonna
do a similar thing to what we did down
here requesting tokens this time what
we're gonna actually do is we're gonna
get our access token so we create a new
variable called reply and again this is
just pulled from the github
documentation so we're gonna say I Wharf
access token and again I'm going to use
an array in here and this time what we
want to do instead of passing through
the callback like we did here we already
know that the call you know we've got
the valid URL we're gonna pass through
the verify token so verifier it's going
to be get a verifier you might want to
store you might want to create another
method to return this verify if you want
since we've created a method up here to
check it entirely up to you so now let's
do a var dump and let's kill this and
let's do a var dump on the reply so
let's check this out so we're gonna hit
sign-in Boop's
let's just try this again oh okay right
so this is working now so let's
authorize this app that's going to
redirect us back and now we are doing a
var dump on what we get back here so you
can see that first of all we're getting
the account that I'm signing in with
details here so this is giving me the
user ID that I'm actually authenticating
with and that's the same as this owner
ID because I'm logging I'm basically
using the app
my account also signing in with my
account so in this case it's the same so
we know that this is the user ID
obviously we've got this here as well
and this is a string we've got the
screen name as well which is just my
Twitter username and the HTTP status as
well so the first thing that we want to
do here is check that the HTTP status is
200 that's really important and now
actually just a point here if this fails
so if the verify token is incorrect we
will actually get an error here now if i
refresh again you see that we've got a
invalid expired token because we've used
this token already we're verified with
this token here already and then
therefore it's you know giving us this
error so basically if we were to try and
make this part we still wouldn't allow
user as users to authenticate so this
obviously going through OAuth through
Twitter's API is really secure so as I
mentioned we want to check if the
replies HTTP status is 200 you can check
for other codes and you can do really
whatever you want here but I'm just
doing it for the sake of it here and
we're gonna keep the return true with
inside of here so return true there's a
couple of things we need to do inside of
here and that is store the tokens again
so this case we're gonna store the new
tokens and this is from the reply
remember we saw the auth token and the
OAuth token secret again that came from
this reply so we can store them and then
what we also want to do is we want to
just set a session this can be whatever
you want to be honest you can call it
user ID you can call it say Twitter ID
whatever if you're using other
applications to authenticate so Google
or something like that you may need to
just keep this something generic but in
this case I'm just going to set the user
ID to reply user ID like this
and then what we want to do is we want
to eventually store the user so store
the user here or call the method to do
that in the next part so let's check
this as well working the last thing that
we need to do actually is create the
signed-in method or create the actual
functionality within the signed-in
method so at the moment this is
returning false whether we're actually
signed in or not let's head back to the
index dot PHP file implement this and
then we will try the sign-in process
again now here this is fairly
straightforward because we've set this
session down here we know that if this
user ID session is set that means the
user is signed in you can use other
methods it's entirely up to you but I'm
just going to be checking if this is set
you may want to you know do something
different here cool so let's try this
out I'll go ahead and open up my cookies
here so I can remove this just to get
rid of the session in a minute so sign
in with Twitter that takes us through I
want to authorize this and then there we
are you are signed in let's get rid of
the PHP session ID and there we go we've
done it so what we're going to do is we
are going to also now look at just
signing the user out really really
straightforward all we need to do here
is we need to create a new file and
we'll call this sign out but PHP we need
to do pretty much exactly the same as
what's done in here I guess we can just
copy and paste that over obviously
except this and we don't need that
ending tag so to sign out so we
basically just need to call off sign out
which we haven't created and then we
want to redirect the user to location
index dot PHP
okay so inside of Twitter author let's
just create this sign out method and
again it's as simple as checking if the
user is signed in we're just going to
unset
the session like that so let's check
this this works we're gonna sign in
we're gonna authorize the app and we're
gonna sign out then we're gonna sign in
again and there we are so we actually
need to do one more thing just to allow
this to work really well under your
settings for your actual app if you head
down you can see this allow this
application to be used with sign in with
Twitter we need to go ahead and and
actually tick this we'll go ahead and
update the settings once they're updated
let's head back over here okay so now
what's going to happen is when we hit
sign in with Twitter this is
automatically going to redirect us back
and the reason for that is under your
Twitter settings you'll see that you
have authenticated with this application
now if you revoke that access what's
going to happen is that application will
disappear and when you go ahead and sign
in again it will all ask you for
authorization to use my account rather
than what we saw earlier which was just
authorizing the app so we're now
actually working with sign in with
Twitter rather than just the
authentication process so when we hit
sign in now we're subsistent lee signed
in we can hit sign out and when we sign
in again this will just automatically
redirect us back as long as the user is
actually signed in to their Twitter
account so that is pretty much it we've
built the main part of the application
what we're going to look at next though
is actually storing the user details in
the database if you want to identify
them and go ahead and store other
information it obviously isn't
completely necessary you don't need to
do this at all but if you do need to
store information against the user this
is really useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
