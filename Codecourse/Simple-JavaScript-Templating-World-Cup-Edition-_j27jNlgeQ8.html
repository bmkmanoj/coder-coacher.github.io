let's do some JavaScript my name is
Chavez and once again as a distinct
pleasure of hosting a video here on PHP
academy' and props to Alex the owner of
the channel you are such a pimp today
we're gonna look at how we can use
JavaScript templating to create this
really cool World Cup player card that
flips out when we hover like this here
we have just a simple table of the World
Cups
top goalscorers now this is as of Monday
June 23rd ok this data is as I'm
recording this may not be the same as
when you're watching this but today
Neymar has had four goals and so forth
with three goals so what we want to do
today is talk about how we can use some
simple JavaScript templating to get this
effect when we hover over Neymar's name
his kind of player card bounces up with
his face his name height weight and
birthplace now this could be really
anything I'm doing a leaderboard here of
the World Cup top goalscorers but I mean
this could be for example a a recipe
name and you hover over and you get a
preview of the recipe it could be your
friends on Facebook it could be like
members of a community or like items in
a store anything that has organized data
so what I mean by organized data is
every player is gonna have a name height
weight and a birthplace so I could add
those ill and and a photographic all of
those elements can be in our template
organized an output with JavaScript so
this is what we're gonna build and let's
get started with that
okay now I've reduced this back down to
scratch here we have just a very very
very basic table and let me show you my
code structure here I have a base SAS
which is just you know like it's got a
reset in it's got pulling in my font
just some base tiles for the you know
headlines and everything links and then
I'm pulling and then I have some styles
here for the actual table and they're
just again simple like
just giving it some padding and margin
just giving the header a background and
and so forth just very simple nothing
functional here just styles so what I
want to do is I have a sass document
called card and in here I'm importing
base and then in my index I'm linking to
CSS card so this sass the card is where
I'm going to build out the styles for
that card and and show you how to to get
them templatized so the first step that
I do is I go in and I before I build
templatized something I just build it
statically and so let's go into the
first person here
Niemeyer and i want to start building
that card and I'm going to do it inside
of his his linked name so I'm gonna
break out this anchor here and then and
then just start building so this is
going to call the div class player card
let's get his image in there and I have
all of the players images here in my
image folder so it's gonna be IMG / anyy
and they are dot jpg then I want his
name I'll put that in an h4 and then I
want some quick stats about him and I'll
put those in an unordered list
right and so I'm gonna I'm gonna make
sure to separate the different the
different stats in like little
containers that I can inject content
into when I am doing the JavaScript even
though I'm not doing it right now
so I also want to do weight and
birthplace that looks pretty good for
the template let's refresh over here and
see what we got okay
now it's just through our table all out
of whack now we have to apply some
Styles here to get that table where they
give that a name card looking good like
we had it we want to start at the very
top so our table is gonna be called
world cup and then inside of there we
want to look at all of the anchors and I
want to make sure they are
display:inline-block and I need them
also to be positioned and there are
going to be a position:relative so that
we can use them as anchors to position
those cards when they're ready next is
the player card itself player card and
you're going to be display and
position:absolute
and I don't want the background to be
transparent I want it to sit on top of
everything it's also background white
and padding we need some padding 10
pixels is good you don't have to kind of
float above everything someone put a
back shadow on it zero pixels or two
pixels ten pixels and then RGB a about
40% opacity okay I need to well let's
just see what we got okay cool that
looks good except for he needs to be on
top of everything else so I'm gonna
throw a little Z index on there just
make him one I guess does that work that
works doesn't need to be too much just
just a little bit let's let's make let's
look at this image a little bit right
now and then we'll go back to the card
the image needs to be it's a little it's
a little big so let's constrain the
width to like 80 pixels and the height
can be Auto and then hmm
we want it to float it left so that the
text can be on its right and give it a
margin right of like 10 or 20 let's say
20 pixels so that that let's take a look
here oh this box needs to be bigger
width so let's say 400 pixels
there we go okay now I have the default
headline as text-align:center so I want
to say that h4 is gonna be
text-align:left and then there looks to
be some margin bottom on this so it
needs the only about 10 pixels since
that other stuff up pretty good okay and
then let's make the whole font size
generally about size about 14 pixels
that looks good and then these okay
these are not actually hyperlinks but
they're inheriting the color from the
hyperlink here because they are
technically wrapped inside of the a so
let's get what are they strong strong
actually let's just set the color on the
baseball card I'll set it to six six six
there you go
that's nice these spans are inheriting
the span from the country name and
that's fine with me I like it it's
generally not advisable to do like weird
associations with I mean this should not
impact this but that's not what we're
talking about today so I'm fine with it
let's tile this face a little bit image
I want to give it a border border of one
pixel solid and see see see that's good
Neymar maybe this can be 12 okay yeah I
like that looks good move it's a little
wide let's cinch that up to be about
3/16 there you go good okay and then to
position it a little bit I'll say top
zero and then left ten okay now this is
where it will let's go top ten - there
you go
so when I hover over this name I want it
to just show up so I'll do this display
none and however layer card
display:block okay so so his name and
his card is popping up as we hover over
his name this is just like we wanted
let's add a little bit of flair and use
animate dot CSS and this is just I mean
these are pretty cool I like this one
flip in X this is what I had on the on
the example here it gives you this like
this nice nice little animated touch
makes it feel nice and fresh so let's
download that and then put that in our
project download that on github
I love the zip here's the CSS file and
dropped in my CSS here and then in my
index I'll just link it above my card
CSS you know this is um kind of a hefty
file just for this little thing that
we're doing so if you're gonna use
animate CSS I would recommend going into
animate CSS and finding the animation
you're looking for like for example
bounce and then just pull that
individual one out but since we're not I
mean this video is not about optimizing
your animations this video is about
making a template so we're not gonna
worry about that but as a recommendation
I would say optimize those animations
because there's a lot in there a lot of
cool things that can do but if you're
not gonna use it all just optimize it
for the ones you are using and I mean
CSS cool now to get this animation
working after going to my template here
play our card and write animate flip
in Ex I believe let's try that that's
not it it's animated it's animated okay
there you go that's pretty good it's
kind of slow but then again this video
is not about optimizing your animation
so if this were about that I would speed
that up a little bit because you XY is
somebody's not gonna want to wait
forever until this thing gets done
moving about but it is a really nice
quick animation alright so now what we
have is we have the the template
outlined right here the structure and we
also have this the styles and styles are
basically done we're done with those now
let's close that out and what we want to
do is find a way to replicate this
structure and and pull the data out
across all these other ones and
infinitely more of them really quickly
so what did you do what we want to do is
go into our JavaScript file and we're
gonna make a function called template no
one calls that hard
okay and then function player card all
right let's see what we need to do we
need to go into these prefs
and I'm gonna classify it get a class of
player hard reference and then I need to
take these few key stats namely his name
but we have his name in the content of
the link
I need his height weight and birthplace
and I'm gonna use data types data height
equals and this guy is 5 now this is a
unique problem but it will probably
still be a problem because we have you
know to represent the inches we're using
the end quotes of the actual data and
data height quote so I need to escape
them by using the HTML characters which
I think are and pound 39 and then and
pound 32 I think actually this is 39 and
this is 34 sorry I have to do that on
every of the height ones but that's
that's okay
no one data weight and he's gonna be 132
lbs and then data place and he was born
in Brazil okay now basically all of the
pertinent information that I need to
reconstruct this template here is is in
these data strings which are contained
in the link okay so to get his image I
have his name is that it's the same to
get his name already have it height got
that in the string
wait got that and birthplace and then
everything else we got okay so what we
need to do now is run over to our app J
s and now the first thing I want to do
is I want to be able to go through and
find all of the player cards or actually
the player card references so I'm going
to use jQuery to select them by class
and say each and then inside of that
when I throw in a function and so this
is going to happen for each of these
player cards that it finds I'm gonna
start loading the loading our variables
with some of those data types so the
first one that we want I mean get some
room to breathe here first one we want
is name I'll call it player name and
that's going to be actually the first
thing I want is its to get of this
dollar oops this equals this ok player
name is going to be this text
I think that should be fine and then mmm
player height it's gonna be this data
right and same thing about their weight
it's and lastly the place right did I
call that I called it yeah data place
okay I call it player place okay now we
have all the that data stuck into our
variable let's go ahead and check out
make sure I'm kind of paranoid when I
did JavaScript so I was like end up
doing these kind of things let's do a
console log and check that our variables
are spitting out the right the right
data so I want to say player name I want
to see player height
player wait and player place now when i
refresh this should have happened
eat automatically for each of the player
reference cards in our player card
references we only have one of those so
far so let's refresh over here and take
a look at our console o
player height oh this needs to be
uppercase okay try again okay cool
what did we get okay the first one okay
this shouldn't have happened because
we're not gonna have our templates
built-in but let's look at what else we
got we got his place
we got his weight we got his height and
this should be C the reason all of this
popped in was because I called player
name text and currently we all of this
stuff is in player name all of this
stuff is in player name but it shouldn't
be but I need to extract that template
and then it should work fine but like
what I want to know is that are these
things registering and it looks like
they are so so that's good now I want to
build a template and I'm gonna take that
mark up bar template equals
this whole thing okay and this is kind
of what I do about about all of this
I'm just kind of like capturing them all
in in strings and this is gonna form the
template that we're gonna start sticking
data into so right here will end the
string and then put in our variable of
what was that height so player height
and this is going to be player weight
I'll put our name and also right here
it's gonna be player name name jpg okay
and I'll end this with a semicolon to
end our variable okay that looks good
now I can get rid of this basically and
close this up like so now these all kind
of look this the same except for the you
know the data types that are in here but
now what I have to do is I have to take
for each so this is let me read my
JavaScript to you says for find all of
the player card references and for each
of them do this function find all of
these variable find all these datas and
store them in these variables store this
template in a variable and inject these
data types are these data variables into
the into the template oh this one missed
one
clear place okay now all I have to do is
say this and now this at this point is
referencing the player card itself and
then I write append and then inside
there I'm going to append the template
okay
cross your fingers I think this should
work refresh yeah so this content was
created dynamically based on the class
of player card reference and the these
data bits right and also the content of
his name so the rest of these should
should go pretty fast I don't have to
build out this con this structured
content for them I just have to fill in
these variables and this is something
you can give to an intern to do and yeah
so I think I'm gonna run into a problem
when I get to these guys with two names
named rzz he only has one name but
Kareem has two names and his image has a
hyphen between the two names so what I
need to do is I need to take player name
and find that text and I need to look
for spaces now it's good right here but
for the image hmm I need to make another
type here I'll call it player
name image yeah and this is going to
equal the player name and then we'll do
a few things to it we're gonna have to
use a JavaScript method called replace
and inside there will say find the
spaces and
and then replace those with hyphens and
then just to be sure we'll we'll set it
to lowercase and then we have to go into
his image and say IMG okay I think that
should work its refresh and uh-huh that
works okay great
and that's it we did it this is how you
make a really quick JavaScript template
and fill it in with data that's provided
by your your attributes in the parent
cool okay everyone thanks for watching I

now we're doing a long-form project
ruing a portfolio site from scratch so
you can check out this playlist to see
