actually upload a profile picture on the
co course website so you can see this
over in your account area and it's
literally as easy as either clicking
this and dropping a file or pasting a
URL in or you can just take an image and
just drag it in it'll go ahead and
upload for you
now there's a reason I held off on doing
this and such a simple thing as
uploading a profile picture is actually
very complex in the background the
reason being is the variety of pictures
that can actually be uploaded mean that
you have to resize things or at least
have them on some kind of server or
content delivery network to actually
manipulate the images on the fly so
resize them scale them change the
quality on the fly so this can be really
annoying so for example let's say your
user uploaded an image and you resize it
to say 80 by 80 pixels now that's fine
you have a profile picture that you can
use for example like in this area here
now the only problem is what happens
when you want to display that image
larger do you store lots of different
files well that's pretty complicated now
to achieve what you've just seen here I
used a service called upload care and in
the next few videos we're gonna go
through basic implementation uploading
our files and then going ahead and
talking about how we might store them
and then later on we'll look at all of
the additional options like I said we'll
style up the button we'll style up the
little circle you see when you upload we
look at the different sources you can
actually upload from there are a lot
more than the ones I choose to allow on
co course and of course then we'll look
at the content delivery network from
upload care which means that we can
resize scale and do all sorts of things
with our images so let's take a look at
how we do a very basic implementation of
this it's really simple to get going so
we'll go ahead and set this up now so
the first thing you're gonna want to do
is obviously sign up for an upload care
account pretty straightforward
and once you are in you can head over to
your dashboard area you can see I've
already got a project open here but what
we're gonna do is create a new project
we're gonna head over to our browser
simple flat file we don't need anything
too too advanced
and we're gonna go ahead and look at the
basic implementation so let's create a
new project we can call this whatever
it's just call it website for now and go
ahead and create this okay so the first
thing that you see is the amount of
files we have stored and the bytes we
have used the different plans mean you
can store more or less it really depends
on your needs but more importantly we
have the public key and we have a secret
key so there are two kind of sides to
this we can use the public key obviously
for the JavaScript side of things and
the secret key for the server side of
things now we're not gonna go too much
into the backend kind of stuff of this
we're just going to look at actually
getting this widget on the page and
having the ability to actually upload a
profile picture because we can just
store the URL then we don't really need
to touch the backend unless we really
want more fine-grained control over this
whole process okay so let's start to
implement this out in the browser and
just take a look at how it works so I
have a really simple index.html file and
just a basic document layout that's all
we really need to be honest next thing
that we're gonna do is go ahead and pull
in the widget JavaScript so down here at
the bottom somewhere we want to go ahead
and pull this in from upload care so we
pull this in from upload care CDN comm
some of the widget the widget version so
two point eight point two in my case and
then we just want to say upload care and
upload care dot full MnDOT is so now we
have this on the page really easy
straightforward and we're ready to start
defining out some of our settings so the
first thing I'm going to do here is just
set up the locale so in my case this is
just going to be en of course you can
check out the documentation and find
other locales that are supported I'm
also going to go ahead and set up load
care live to folks
and I'm gonna go ahead and set our
public key as well of us really
important or we're not gonna be able to
use this so I'll blow public key and of
course we just need to pull this over
from here
pop it in there okay so now that we're
done if we head over to our page
obviously not much has changed what we
need to do now is define an input so
obviously when you are uploading some
kind of profile picture you're gonna
have a form so like you saw in the co
course website we will just have a form
hanging around that will submit through
to maybe a store dot PHP file or
whatever route you are working with and
of course this can include other things
as well you just the email name whatever
so in here then let's just define out an
input now this is going to be a hidden
input that's really important what I'm
actually gonna do is pull this down as
well because we're going to define quite
a few things in here so the name of this
can just be whatever you want this is
just Kerry you're going to pick up on
your back end and here we define a role
of upload care uploader so let's just
take a look at what this looks like
let's put our input button in here our
submit button at least and just say
something like save they're really
simple we pulled in the JavaScript
library we win ahead and define some
settings just up here as Global's
and then we have an input so now you can
see on the page we have our widget
created for us really straightforward so
if we get rid of role you see that goes
this is what allows it to be placed on
your page so now you pretty much have
something that can upload files let's
take a look at how this works so option
one is to just click this and you can
see that by default we have quite a few
sources that we can upload from now of
course it's entirely up to you which
ones you choose and we'll cover that in
the next part but just for example for
now if I wanted to go ahead and drag a
file onto here you can see that I've
successfully gone ahead and uploaded
this file so of course this can be any
image we can go ahead and cancel
and upload another one if you want to
really straightforward stuff and here we
just see the name of the file and of
course if you take a look at some of the
other sources here we've got copying
pasting a link in so just a far from the
web Facebook Google Drive Dropbox
Instagram Evernote and Flickr and
onedrive so you've got plenty of options
for your users to upload files there's
no real problem here particularly if
they're just dragging an image which is
what I prefer that's why I've just
allowed that on the co course site okay
so now that we've got our image and
we're happy with it we can go ahead and
add it it signified here that this is
ready to go and we can hit save so how
do we go about accessing the actual URL
well what's actually happened behind the
scenes if we go back over to our project
settings and give this page a refresh
you can see that we have actually
uploaded these files already so these
have been stored with upload care so
what that means is that when we do
submit this form we'll get a URL to the
content delivery network with upload
care that will give us the file that we
can work with so let's create this store
dot PHP file of course if you're using
any other back in language it really
doesn't matter as long as you know how
to pick up variables posted through the
forum and here just to demonstrate this
we're gonna do a var dump on post and
remember we call this avatar so simple
as that so when we hit save you can see
here we now get a string and this is
actually just a URL to this image now
this is the UUID so it's a unique ID
that represents the image that this user
has uploaded and you can see here that
this literally just contains the image
that I uploaded simple as that now this
is slightly different this isn't just
serving one file on one file only this
gives us the ability to manipulate this
image on the fly so we've still got the
original file here but what we can
actually do is become a niculae tip
we're gonna look at doing that a little
bit later on so the benefit of using
this then is that we can upload from a
variety of sources we've seen how easy
it is to just
implement the widget you know couple of
lines of code and we're pretty much
ready to go and of course everything is
hosted away from your server less
straining your server you're pulling it
through from a CDN so now that we know
the basic implementation and we've seen
how this works as well as actually doing
things like dragging it onto the page as
well so that works too we're going to
look at some additional options that we
can use to kind of customize the
experience so let's head over to the
next video and check out what we can do
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
