around with clip champ you're obviously
going to need to create an account so go
ahead and register if you want to follow
along and once you're in you'll see your
dashboard so very very simply here we
can see our API key we also have a
production website domain so once you're
ready to launch your project you can go
ahead and enter your domain in there
that's really important so no one else
can use the clip champ button on their
website so for now because we're going
to be testing this on our local machine
will be entering a test domain and if
you go under show all settings you have
the ability to enter your test website
domain just here now we also have the
option to hook in several services the
services that we want to enable for
uploading and this is pretty much all
the configuration you'll need to do in
terms of entering your keys you won't
have to download any additional
dependencies as long as you have your
bucket set up say if you're using s3
then you're good to go the process is
just really quick and easy so we're
going to be using Amazon s3 for this
part we're going to set up our bucket
and then we're going to look at the
implementation and later on we'll look
at how to configure something like
YouTube which is incredibly simple so
you've got options here and of course
later down the line if any more services
were added then you can just go ahead
and enable them and the switchover is
super simple you don't have to do
anything really on your website ok so
now that we've seen how this works and
we've dived into some of the settings we
can see here we want to go ahead and set
up amazon s3 so if you are following
along make sure you have your test
domain put in here and you're going to
want to allow upload to AWS s3 and don't
worry about the keys just yet we'll be
looking at how we go ahead and grab them
from amazon in just a moment so first
things first we want to grab our amazon
s3 credentials so we need to set up an
IAM user
so if you go ahead and register for s3
if you don't have an account already I
have a few buckets in here but we're
going to be creating a new bucket and
then applying some settings to this but
like I said we want to go ahead and get
our credentials in here so over up here
by your name you want to go over to
security credentials and go over to I am
users so I'm going to go ahead and
create a new user and I'm just going to
call this clip champ and we want to make
sure that we are generating an access
key for each user that's really
important so you'll only see these once
so if you need to go ahead and reuse
them anywhere make sure you copy them
down somewhere you can always download
the credentials here but of course all
we're really doing here is just
configuring this with clip champ so all
we need to do is just copy these over
here and go ahead and apply these Save
Changes so now that that's done we are
good to set up our bucket and later we
can implement the button this will just
work like magic okay so now that we have
these set up let's go back to our user
because we just need to go ahead and
enable some permissions we need to
attach a policy here so let's go an
attachment policy let's just type s 3
and we want s3 full access this will
allow clip champ to go ahead and write
to your s3 account all or at least store
videos there so let's attach this policy
and we're done we're done with users so
we can head over over to services over
to s3 and we can start to set up our
bucket so if you've not work with s3
before think of this as just a storage
area almost like a directory you'd find
on your computer now i'm going to call
mine video upload code course calm so
i'm just going to go ahead and write
this in here and i'm going to leave the
region that will just choose a default
region for me now because we'll be
making cross-origin requests remember
we're doing everything from the browser
these videos aren't being uploaded to
clip champs servers they're going
directly from your users browser into
amazon s3
we need to set up a cause policy on the
bucket or the browser or reject our
request okay so if we go over and click
on our bucket and head over to the
properties part just here under
permissions we can add a cause
configuration will also be adding a
bucket policy a bit later and we'll see
why that is ok so the default cause
configuration won't work so if you head
over to the course downloads you'll find
the cause configuration here so if it
changes i'll go ahead and update this
but you're going to go ahead and just
paste that in pretty straightforward and
essentially all we have here adjust the
permissions to allow our browser to go
ahead and upload so we don't really need
to worry about this too much you can
find this on the clip champ
documentation as well if you want to go
ahead and copy it from there so let's
save this out and close this off and we
are pretty much done so we want to go
ahead and create a folder so I'd
recommend not storing your videos all in
the root of this bucket we're going to
separate them just in case we need
different locations later on okay so it
depends now if you want your videos to
be publicly available so later on we'll
be building that video upload website of
course when you use upload a video we're
going to need them to be public now
otherwise you'll need to set up a bucket
policy so if you want them to be private
leave this otherwise we'll set up a
bucket policy so we can actually make
these public the first thing I'm going
to do is just make this folder public so
once you've done that we can now go over
to our bucket again over to properties
and under our permissions we can add a
bucket policy so Amazon s3 makes this a
little difficult but it's not too hard
we have a policy generator so all we
need to do here is go over to this page
select s3 bucket policy we're going to
allow the principal is going to be an
asterisks we're going to select an
action so you don't want to select too
many actions here or you'll give to
much controlled to just the general
public but what we want is we want get
object now all this means is we can
users can just grab an object
essentially an object is just a file so
pretty straightforward so the resource
name it gives us an example here we're
going to copy this paste this in here
and for our bucket name we already know
that yours might be a bit different mine
is video upload code course calm and the
key name which again is kind of the
terminology here for a folder is just
videos so we have the bucket name and
videos we're going to add this statement
that's added it in there we're going to
go ahead and click generate policy we're
going to copy this and now we can go
back over to here paste it in hit save
click close I'm going to go ahead and
hit save here as well and we're done so
now we will set up to very very easily
implement the clip champ button to be
able to record from webcam or drag and
drop video files to be uploaded to our
bucket into this folder so you can go
ahead and keep this open just to make
sure that you set everything up properly
so head over to your clip champ
dashboard and we'll go ahead and cover
this in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
