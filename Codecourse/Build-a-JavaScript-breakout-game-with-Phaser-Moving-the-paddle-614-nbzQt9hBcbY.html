moment of course it doesn't move we're
gonna fix that now by encapsulating the
logic over inside of paddle dock JSI
mentioned this in the last part let's
first of all just start out to see how
we can get the input for the x-axis so
for this I'm going to go ahead and
reference this game input X simple as
that and let's see what this does
so if we go ahead and move our mouse
notice that this will give us the
position that we're currently in and
notice that this is constantly
repainting so we can see the position of
the mouse on the x-axis now the reason
this is important is what we're gonna do
is say this x equals this game input X
and then based on the position of this
we're gonna move the object let's just
start by leaving that as it is by
referencing this X what we're doing is
saying that we want this to move that's
the position that we're currently at the
only issue is this is going to kind of
overlap the side of our canvas we don't
want this to happen we want it to stop
at the point that the very end of the
paddle and the left stops here and the
same for this as well so to do this we
just need a very quick if-else statement
so let's go ahead and build this in and
see how we can get this working so we're
gonna say if this X so the current
position of this object is less than
this width so the width of the paddle
divided by 2 then that means that we are
at the end so we're gonna say this X
equals this width divided by 2 that's
just gonna halt it from going any
further left than we need so if we just
go over there now you see I can't move
this any further than the edge of the
world because we're taking half the
width of this and we're setting the
x-axis of the object to the point that
we need so of course 0 is going to be in
the center and then we want that to be
kind of half of that half that object's
width if that makes sense now otherwise
we can handle the case where it falls
out just here we can create another if
statement just to tidy this up we could
say return and we create a new if
statement you could create an if-else
whatever you prefer we're gonna say if
this X is greater than this game width
because of course now what we're dealing
with is the
entire width of the game and we're gonna
subtract the width of the object divided
by two so we're doing it in the same way
but of course just the opposite side now
in this case this means that we have
gone past what we should do so that's
just log out test here just so we can
see this working so this is all good we
can move this around hit this side as
soon as it reaches just there then
that's going to go ahead and log out
test so we just want to basically limit
it as we did before and we want to set
this X to the game width like so
subtract the width of the object divided
by two and we can go ahead and return
there just in case we do anything else
down here now the reason that this works
like I said is because we already know
the end of the world on the x axis is
zero but it's a little bit more
difficult when we get to the end here
because that is the width of the world
and notice that if I go ahead and resize
this and I try again it still works in
exactly the same way so that's just
limiting the paddle movement to inside
of this world hopefully that makes sense
now that we've done this we can look at
adding the ball and placing it onto the
paddle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
