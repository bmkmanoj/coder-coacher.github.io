so for which is basically a service as
we mentioned in the last video that
allows us to build a server with all of
the software we already need installed
so we can pretty much just start
developing what we can then do is we can
point out domain to our server and we're
ready to go so you can create your
service normal in digitalocean we can
hook this up we can create a site on
forge as well which we're going to look
at later and then pretty much everything
will just work it's particularly useful
for our field development since it's a
lot of our own product however it's just
as helpful for any other framework or if
you're just writing a project in vanilla
PHP and the great thing about for just
that you can actually deploy code from
github directly from forge so you don't
actually need to use Mboya
however we're gonna be looking at doing
this with Mboya later basically because
it's a lot easier and we have zero
downtime deployment and we'll talk about
that later so why are we actually using
Forge why can't we just set up our own
server install everything we need and
upload files now of course you can do
this but Forge makes it so easy to
manage servers can get everything set up
pretty much once you use it you won't be
able to live without it and the amount
of functionality included it makes it a
really powerful tool and you'll rarely
ever have to SSH into your server and
update or install everything so it's
just easy it just gets you started so
with all of that out the way we're gonna
build our first server on forge in the
next part so you should by now I've
signed up for a four word account and
you should have gone ahead and linked
your digitalocean account and we can
move on to the next part and start to
build something amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
