a heart with CSS much like the one you
can see here it's not entirely difficult
to do this but we are going to look at
some cool things that involves of
rotations and transforming and basically
to pseudo elements that will provide
this shape now regardless of whether you
actually want to produce a heart shape
it's quite interesting to understand the
process that we go through to actually
create this shape so you can actually
learn some things about CSS along the
way despite the fact you may never use a
CSS heart on your website so with that
said let's go ahead over to the code and
start writing this out okay so over into
my text editor I've got a basic page
setup here with a title a stylesheet
linked in which I also have open in my
text editor and I've just got a body
here I'm just gonna add one element
that's all we need to do we're gonna use
pseudo elements to handle the rest which
sounds a lot trickier than it is if
you've never come across them before
let's go ahead and create this element
I'm gonna just create a div with a class
of heart which makes sense and we're
going to refer to this class to style
everything that we need so the first
thing to do is set a couple of
properties just basically relating to
this general heart shape without any
pseudo elements here and this is
basically just gonna say that we want
the position to be relative the muk we
want to say a little bit margin or we
want to give it a height and width as
well let's go ahead and set the
positioning first it's relative so this
is just going to be position relative to
its container whether that's within the
body like it is at the moment or another
element like a div container on your
page we'll go ahead and give it a margin
of 20 pixels basically just give it a
little bit of space around the outside
I'm gonna give it a height and width as
well now this might not make sense the
moment ball will shape our heart to
these Heights and widths this doesn't
necessarily mean that the heart is going
to be this size it just means that we're
gonna provide a nice container for this
to sit in so let's go ahead and open the
element inspector and you can already
see here the blue area
is the 170 by 200 space we've got a
little margin around the outside and
because this is obviously a book display
element it just is filling the whole
width of the page but you can modify
that if you need after you've actually
created the heart shape so we're now
gonna start start to sort of introduce
pseudo elements and these are just
elements that don't actually exist on
the page but they're created with CSS
and instyler well you can add content to
them which is of the the usual way to go
about with CSS pseudo elements or pseudo
elements so I'm going to selectors here
we're gonna apply some general
properties to the before and after
pseudo elements so I've just comma
separated these and I've used the colon
to define the before and after pseudo
elements fairly straightforward now
we're gonna take a look at sort of
actually you know how this works so I'm
gonna go and say content content hello
now might look a bit strange if you're
sort of not from a CSS background let's
take a look all that's done it's
provided us with - hello elements on the
page before and an after
so what we're now gonna do is we're sort
of exploiting CSS here and we're doing
being a bit hacky we're gonna create two
elements here which we're gonna bend
inwards create a v-shape and that's
going to turn into our heart so what we
can now do is go ahead and just use this
as MP sort but this is an empty string
and we're gonna set the position of
these both these in its - absolute and
what that does is just allows us to give
a top and a left absolute position value
which we need to do within this to be
able to you know paste them where we
need and then rotate them and everything
I'm also going to go ahead and give
these a width as well so to start out
let's go ahead and give these a width
that I know is gonna work so you know
you don't expected sort of know these
you know off by heart or anything these
are just by these I've played around
with and I'm gonna go ahead and set a
background of red and we'll now go ahead
and take a look and this starts to get a
little bit more interesting so we now
see we've got this red rectangle we've
actually got two red rectangles if we
inspect this you can see that we've got
a before and an after
it's if for the for example for the
after one I went ahead and just created
a selector here and I said heart after
and I was to go ahead and say left 500
pixels you can see that that after
element moves across the page 500 pixels
so that's basically demonstrating that
we've now got two elements on the page
and what we actually want to do is is
like I've said before been this one in
woods this wavy or this sort of
45-degree angle this one in a 45 degree
angle so we get the sort of classic V
shape of a heart and then we'll go ahead
and use border radius is to transform
the rest so what we need to do is now
target that before-and-after separately
because one we need to rotate minus 45
degrees and one we need to rotate 45
degrees so let's go ahead and say heart
before and we'll copy this and we'll say
heart after okay so for the heart before
we actually want the left of this offset
by or the along the x-axis to be offset
by hundred pixels and we want that after
to be a offset of zero from the left of
left hand side so that now looks like
this we've sort of got this sort you
know a hundred percent offset which
happens to be the width of these
containers so now these are but
basically plush next to each other so
what we're going to do now is go ahead
and choose the origin for the
transformation because what we're going
to do is we're going to use the rotate
function and provide a 45 and a minus 45
degree for each one so this does get a
little bit confusing but let's go ahead
and and do this so we're gonna say
transform origin and all this basically
does is it changes the origin from which
the element is transform transformed
using the transform property so for the
before pseudo element we're gonna say 0
from the X on the x offset and a hundred
percent on the y offset and we're gonna
basically just duplicate this and apply
the WebKit prefix because I'm using
Chrome or if you're using another
browser that uses a WebKit rendering
engine
then you'll need to use the WebKit
prefix as of this video being published
so let's go ahead and copy this down we
need to change the values slightly the
origin for this is going to be X a
hundred percent and Y offset a hundred
percent so now that we've got the
origins done that's not really going to
change much because we haven't actually
provided any transformations here what
we're now going to do is start to get to
the fun part
so we're gonna use the transform
property we're gonna provide the rotate
function and we're gonna provide a minus
45 degree angle for the before and a 45
degree angle for the after just go ahead
and do that now so we use the transform
property we pass in the rotate function
and we say minus 45 I means the degrees
here so now we can do that but with the
WebKit prefix cuz that's required also
and we can go ahead and copy and paste
these two lines down to this one in fact
let's take a look before that what this
is done so that's sort of bent that in
this way now we'll also see that this
one is then bent the opposite way
creating our V shape so let's go ahead
and just paste this down we want that to
be a 45 degree angle and there we are so
we've got this lovely V shape here now
now don't worry that it's sort of
touching the top of the page we rectify
that in a moment
not just with a top property on the
before and after sectors but we'll also
need to round out these edges here now
bear in mind that these are just two
rotated elements and we can sort of you
know have a little deeper look into this
by providing a border so I'm gonna say a
border of one pixel solid in black and
that's basically gonna let us see the
outline of both of the elements here so
you can see that we've basically just
got two rectangles we've got the before
and the after they just overlaid into
each other
they've been rotated so now what we can
do is we need to scrap that and we're
going to go ahead and we're going to
provide a border radius now with the
border radius we have four different
values that we can pass in here so I'm
just going to do this
and I want to say 50 pixels and fifty
pixels what this is going to do is it's
going to bend or wrote apply the radius
to the top left at the top right and we
want to ignore the bottom ones and
that's going to apply the it to this
right here this part here this spot here
and this part here this is basically the
same as saying border top left radius 50
pixels and border top right radius so if
I was to get rid of this shorthand
property we'll put it back in just a
moment
it does this lovely we've just made a
heart shape so let's just go ahead and
get rid of these
so we're basically using the shorthand
property here very useful saves time
save space so now we have a heart shape
and we can go ahead and just we just
sort of add the border back in if you
want just to have a look at how this is
all looking and there we go so you can
see that we've just rounded off this
part of the pseudo-element this
rectangle and that's then formed in to
make a nice heart shape and so there's
one that last sigh anything I want to do
and let's go ahead and add a top four
five pixels on here and that's just
going to make that sit really nicely
inside the container that we created
earlier so now you can see it's sitting
really nicely inside that blue space the
200 by 170 container and that's it
basically so we've used CSS to create a
before and after pseudo element style
them up rotate them and then go ahead
and give it a lovely red background and
just round off the edges with a border
radius which gives us a CSS heart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
