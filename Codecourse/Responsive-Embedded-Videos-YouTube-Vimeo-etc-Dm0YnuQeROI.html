at embedding video from a site like
YouTube or Vimeo anywhere where we use
some kind of iframe embedding and we're
gonna make it responsive now by default
when you include one of these videos
you'll find that it will have a height
and a width property and that will
maintain the aspect ratio of the video
but it won't make it responsive it won't
respond to different viewport sizes and
that's pretty annoying but we're gonna
come up with a wrapper we're gonna do a
little bit of CSS styling and we're
gonna work out how we can get this to
work as follows so you can see here that
we're maintaining the aspect ratio of
this original video is just an embedded
video from YouTube like I said we can
use embedded videos from anywhere and
this will work so we'll take a look in
just a moment at the fault code that we
will use from say YouTube and then we'll
start to style this up so it works as
you can see here so let's get going
and we'll start writing out the code
that we need to make this work so here I
have the default code that I have copied
and pasted over from the embed link on
YouTube now at the moment like I said
we've got a width of 560 and we've got a
height of three one five at the moment
on the page this looks like the
following so it obviously has its aspect
ratio maintained we can do things like
play the video and whatever but as soon
as we bring the viewport size down it's
obviously not responding and there are a
couple of things you might think will
help here we could add maybe a width of
a hundred percent and remove the height
which will give us a really funny
looking video like this a really long
video that does respond down but
obviously we're not maintaining that
aspect ratio that we need so what we
need to do then is we need to come up
with a much better solution and to start
with we're gonna get rid of the width
and the height attribute on this iframe
now on this document I've got a star she
already linked in here and that's this
app dot CSS file here with nothing in it
at the moment and we're going to be
adding a wrapper to this iframe it's a
little bit annoying that we need to add
a little
of extra markup but really to get this
effect it doesn't matter too much so
let's go ahead and wrap this in a div
and we're gonna give the class of save
video wrapper you can call this what you
like and let's pop this iframe just into
here like so
so not much is gonna have changed now
it's going to look exactly the same
obviously this is reduced in size it's
still not responsive though so what
we're gonna do is we're going to target
the video wrapper we're gonna add a
couple of styles onto this we're gonna
position the iframe within this as an
absolute position and that means that we
can give it a width and a high of 100%
we can stick it at the top left and then
the magic happens in the actual wrapper
so over an app dot CSS then let's create
our class targets here so we're gonna
say video wrapper and we're also gonna
start video wrapper and the iframe
within that these are the only two
selectors that we need so for the video
wrapper then we need to give this a
position of relative the reason being is
that we need to position the iframe
absolutely within this wrapper and
otherwise if we don't provide this it's
gonna float off where we don't want to
so this is just a little bit of CSS
theory here so at the moment this isn't
going to make much of a difference it's
just going to look like the following so
nothing has really changed here so what
we need to do then is for the video
wrapper we need to give this a specific
padding on the bottom so what we're
gonna do is first of all I guess we can
give the iframe width of a
hundred-percent we can give the I from a
height of a hundred percent because we
want it to fill the container that we're
putting it in which is the video wrapper
I'm gonna stick it on the top and we're
gonna stick it right on the left so
that's just zero and zero so this isn't
going to make much of a difference at
all in fact it's completely disappeared
because we need to apply some padding to
the video wrapper to actually make this
show so we're going to give this a
padding a padding
50 6.25% and that's gonna seem really
weird at first but I'll tell you how
that's worked out in just a moment so
let's give this a padding-bottom
50 6.25% and let's preview this and you
can see that it's actually filled this
container it's looking good so let's
just resize this looks fine so in
everything seems to be okay but how did
we arrive this 50 6.25% of having bottom
we've already done the magic now let's
just work out why this value is here
well we have a aspect ratio of 16 by 9
or 16 to 9 so that would look like it's
just creating you far here 16:9 so to
work out the percentage that we need to
give for this particular aspect ratio
obviously if you're dealing with another
aspect ratio this is going to be a lot
different but the math is the same all
we do is we divide we do 9/16 and that
gives us if we just bring up a
calculator I've already got the sum here
but let's just get rid of that so let's
do 9/16 and that's not 0.5 6 to 5 this
will look familiar is 50 6.25% that is
how we work it out so 56 and then 0.25
that's how we arrive at that number so
whichever aspect ratio you're using you
can use the same calculation to work
this out and then you have yourself a
responsive video just here so if we
press play
it just works in the same way and that
is it we've created a very simple
wrapper with a little bit of CSS to give
ourselves a responsive embedded video
using an iframe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
