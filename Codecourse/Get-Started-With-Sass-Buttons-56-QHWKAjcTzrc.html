this is going to bring us to another
feature of sass which is mix-ins we're
going to be trying to be as clever as
possible to save us the greatest amount
of time in the future using mix-ins
which are essentially like functions
let's start by just styling out the
buttons that we're going to place in
here and as always we'll write the
mark-up first so just under this
paragraph I'm going to create a single
button so it's just going to be an
anchor and this is going to have a class
of button and in here we're going to
have some text so it could just say
something like learn more for example so
we've now got that link in there we want
to transform this into a nice-looking
button that has an effect when we hover
over it and we are going to do this by
creating a new component which is going
to be called buttons duress CSS so
inside of buttons then we have our main
buttons selector which we've already
applied to our element and we're going
to just basically change them styling
around here so we're going to display
buttons as an inline block we're going
to give buttons of padding so i'm going
to say eight pixels on the top and
bottom and 14 on the left and right you
can obviously adjust these values we're
going to set text decoration to none and
we don't the underline effect just there
so that's done the following once we add
it to apt is CSS so let's just are they
now and refresh so that's done that so
it doesn't look great at the moment but
what we're going to do let's just close
off some of these is we are going to set
a border radius here and this is going
to be a variable so we are going to
define this in here and again you feel
free to add more variables free for many
more properties it's entirely up to you
so I'm going to call this button border
radius and we'll set this to say 5
pixels so inside of buttons now we can
say button order radius
and for now what we're going to do is
we're going to set a standard background
color and this is just going to be a
button background color so button BG
color we haven't actually created this
yet so let's go ahead and create it now
under variables just duplicate this down
we'll just say button BG color and we
are going to give the standard button BG
color as the value from another variable
so this is another thing that you might
want to do is define say different
standard widely used colors for your
application so let's just say colors and
we're going to set a primary color which
of course we could use to set things
like the container photo color if we
wanted to it's entirely up to you what
you do with this and for this I'm going
to say a 0 is a0 e 0 what I'm also going
to do now just prematurely to actually
building the bottoms i'm going to set a
success color an error color as well so
a success color is going to be a green
color and for this i'm going to choose 5
e bc for one so you can obviously look
up any color palette any colors that
inspire you and we're going to have an
error color as well which is going to be
a red which is the BB 28-28 and what we
can do now then is safer for the button
BG color will set that to the primary
color so when we change the primary
color if we've changed the primary color
or or use the primary color for any
other components our design is going to
be updated to reflect these standard
colors so entirely up to you what you do
you could have a secondary color if you
wanted as well but generally this just
makes it a lot easier to update the
whole design so now what we can do then
is under buttons we'll just save that
out and we'll go and refresh and you see
we get out primary color there we get
that gray color in the background now
we're actually actually going to be
changed
this to include a mix in a bit later and
all that's going to do is when we hover
over it it's going to start with an
opacity of say point eight and when you
hover over the opacity is going to go to
one and we're going to use a mixing to
achieve that so we can reuse that mix in
anywhere else in our design but first
let's tackle the problem of different
sized buttons so this is only a really
rough example and I'm defining these
down here so let's just duplicate this
and we'll say button medium so we now
have two button elements one is going to
be a medium sized one is going to be a
standard size so for the button medium
we have a padding of 10 pixels 16 pixels
we have a font size increased to 1m and
we have a font weight of 500 so that
gives us the following so we can always
go ahead and just change these around in
fact let's give a font way of 500 to all
of our buttons just to please look a
little bit more even so this is slightly
larger you can you can feel around this
if with this if you want to it's
entirely up to you and let's while we're
at it the final large button as well so
we're going to set the padding even
higher on this said 12 pixels and 18
pixels we have a font size of 1.1 m and
it where we don't need to find the font
way there cuz we've already done it up
here and then we get an even bigger
button when we actually define the
mark-up so we have a button large like
so so we've got three different sized
buttons now but what about different
colored buttons so we're going to sort
of come off of our success in error
colors and we're going to say button
success we're going to set the
background color here to the success
color and for our button error so sort
of error star button we're going to set
the background color
to ever color and while we're at it
we'll say color button error text color
and we'll do a similar thing for the
success as well so we'll say success
text color so we have these two
variables here that we want to include
so we'll say button success text color
or set to white and we'll do the same
for the error color as well so if we
just apply these classes so we could say
button medium success and button medium
error or bun large error sorry we now
see the different colors here so these
are easy hooks that we can use to build
in you could of course build a mix in to
deal with the increase in padding if you
wanted to there's many things that we
can do here but we're going to focus on
creating a mix in that originally sets
this background color of the button to a
slightly less lower opacity value and
when we hover over it it's going to
increase that capacity value of course
what we could do is we could say
something like hover and then we could
change the background color here but why
waste writing will that mark up when we
can create a reusable function within
sass and these are referred to as
mix-ins so i'm going to create a new
file under base where we keep our
placeholder than variables and i'm going
to call this mix-ins 2's CSS and in here
then we define over all of our mix ins
and i'm going to be defining a mix in
called hover background not a really
amazing name but we can sort deal with
it for now and this works like I said
exactly like a function so we define
that it is a mix in we give it a name we
have a list of arguments that we can
pass through to it so we can have
multiple arguments here and inside of
here we can set properties you might be
thinking well why is this different from
a placeholder obviously the first
difference is that we can pass in a
value and we can use that value within
our mixing so for example what I could
do now is I could say well I want the
background color to be rgba so this is
satis RGB a function passing in color
point eight so all we're doing here is
we're saying when we call this
functional mixing and we pass in a color
we're automatically setting a background
color property reducing the opacity 2.8
and you might be thinking well why is
this useful we'll see in a minute why
this is useful but let's first apply
this mix in to our buttons where we
where we've included a background color
here here and also here so to include a
mixin we use the include statement like
this and we just give the name of the
mixing and we pass in the color and
because we know the close button bgcolor
we can pass that variable directly into
that mix in and we're going to be doing
the same thing here down here so we pass
in the success color instead get rid of
that and we want to do the same thing
for the error and we want to pass in the
error color like that now if you're a
bit lost in your thinking well why am I
doing this why have I just created a
mixin or a function to reduce the
opacity when we could have just done
that well this is all about the hovering
of the element and it makes it easier to
define this and reuse it across our
application if we wanted the same effect
anywhere else we obviously have an error
here because I've not imported the
mix-ins so let's do that now and it's
just refresh here so these are a
slightly darker color if you like a
rather darkest of less opacity color but
we can see that they're not as vivid as
they were before but
we hover we want them to become as vivid
and you might be thinking well why is
this useful why what's the point in
doing this well it just means that we
don't have to declare these properties
again and again and again and it also
provides a really nice way to then hook
in things like transitions and we'll be
doing that in just a moment as well so
for this mix in then we want to say when
we hover over any element that's
included this we want to change the
background color back to the original
color that it was so we're just reusing
this or recreate in this functionality
for everything based on a color that we
pass in and by doing that we then have
this effect here you can see that the
Apache changes to one when we hover
hover over them to anywhere else in your
application where you think I want that
button or link color to change or
something like that you can use a mixing
that deals with that so now let's look
at transitioning and we'll be looking at
using transitions on our navigation as
well and this is a perfect opportunity
to reuse the mixing we're about to
create we'll do that when we create our
navigation so I'm going to create a new
mix in up here and this is a mixing
that's going to be able to be used
anywhere for sure on your site so we're
going to have transition now for a
transition we need to know which element
we're transitioning on we need to know
the speed and we need to know the effect
that we're using so we're going to pass
in the property here I'm going to pass
in the speed I'm going to pass in the
effect now the point of this is if for
example you require vendor prefixes for
any CSS properties that you're using you
can define them all in here so you don't
have to repeat them you're just cool
transition and we can just output all of
the vendor prefix properties in here so
I'm going to go ahead and say transition
on a particular property
for a particular length of time and with
a certain effect speed I guess should be
sort of length of time but we'll leave
it at speed for now so if you had say a
WebKit vendor prefix for this which is
not required at the time of recording
anymore but that's sort besides the
point you can just include them in here
and by having this transition mix in we
can then say inside of here well we want
to include the transition we want this
to be on the background color we want it
to last for a hundred milliseconds and
we want to have an ease in effect on
this so now we see that when we hover
over these you can see that they are
transitioning between point eight and
one of their opacity so there we are
that is pretty much or our buttons done
we've looked at using mix-ins here to
achieve our hover background effect
really easily by just going ahead and
passing in the color that we want and
that's just does it all for us it keeps
this far nice and clean we've looked at
some very basics like creating medium
and large-sized buttons which you can
obviously tweak in me better and we've
also looked at creating another
transition the reason that we created
this transition then we've used this
transition inside of another mixing or
use this mixing in Sidon another mixing
we will be using this mixing later on
its own so we won't be including this in
another mixing and we'll be using that
for the navigation which we are going to
go onto and create next there is however
one quick thing I think we should update
here and that is inside of our buttons
file that we've been working in you can
see here that we're chaining on these
selectors and that's fine if you want
this to look a little bit more readable
down the page that's absolutely fine
however what we can do is we can do the
same thing we did with our hover pseudo
element so for example here but we can
do this with selectors as well so even
though we're training these on and
they're not nested within
assess what we can do is we can take
this we can use an ampersand and we can
just paste this in here let's just
indent that we can do that for each one
of these so let's grab this paste this
in here and let's change this to an
ampersand and we can do the same for
these two as well so let's grab these
two here paste them in like so and just
go invent them and go ahead and add an
ampersand just here so it's entirely up
to you this I guess looks a little bit
neater because you are nesting it and
you know that these are attached so we
do that in exactly the same way as we do
with hovering so now you can see we have
exactly the same styles but we have
something that looks potentially a
little bit tidier so let's head on over
now and build that navigation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
