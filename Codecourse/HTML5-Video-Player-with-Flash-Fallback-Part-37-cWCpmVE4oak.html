we've done is convert an original video
file into the three formats that we're
going to be using to generate this html5
video the top one is the original file
that we used and this you can really
delete now it's not necessary that you
have it but we've got the mp4 file the
OGG file and this web M file and this is
all stored in our videos directory and
this is the root directory here which
you've got a video folder in here
containing all of the videos and just to
reiterate we've got this index file
which are going to be playing with now
and this style sheets folder with the
style sheets CSS file inside so let's
begin working with some HTML so the
first thing I'm going to do is declare
the doctype dot sight as an HTML we want
the HTML tags here the head and the body
body / buddy now in the head we're just
going to do some formalities here I'm
going to put a title in there just
called html5 video oops and we're going
to just create a link to the stylesheet
the style sheet is not all that
important I'm just doing it just to make
things out kind of but it's good that
says so the link rel stylesheet the type
is text slicker CSS and the references
that is style sheets slush style sheets
CSS so for the
that's now done so let's work on the
body now I'm going to create two tags
here one is a section tag and then we're
going to have the video tag in here and
the HTML doesn't really get much more
complicated than this in terms of html5
video I'm going to give the video just
an ID here of video and this is going to
play into when we do the JavaScript
because we're going to be wanting to
sort of identify this particular element
using the ID in this case it's video
I'll talk more about that when we start
working with the JavaScript now what
we're going to be doing is inside the
video we're going to have three children
and these going to be the links to the
videos so if i type in the source in the
arrow bracket SRC equals and we'll start
with and before so it's videos / video
mp4 we're going to want to set the type
to video / and p for this video element
will now play mp4 files it's literally
simple as that it's going to do this
twice more so source SRC videos /video
dot web M and the type is video / web M
web M there we go and finally we got the
source again SRC equals videos / OG v
that's kind of our OGG file oops videos
/video odv and the type is video slush
OGG so it sits up video so let's test
this so if i save this HTML file and
open up google chrome refresh this you
can see we've got this giant black blob
on the screen and this is to be expected
because we haven't given many sort of we
haven't they told it exactly what we
want to do i mean if i right click on
this and play the video plays so it does
work in a sense but we want some
controls in here so that the user will
be able to play pause it see through the
video whatever and incredibly simple to
do and other parameters you want to add
to the video element here is just
controls and that one of the things i'm
going to do is set the width of the
video too I don't know she'll say gopher
420 I'll do and what this is going to do
now is going to reduce the size of the
video and add in some controls as simple
as that so if I save that refresh it we
have the video let's play it plays
obviously click it again I'll pause it
got some volume controls here
full screen seeker bar basic controls
which all of this doesn't need a plug-in
like flush that's the beauty of html5
video is it what we've done is
relatively simple it doesn't need flash
it doesn't need plugins this player is
built into the browser as it is with
every other browser which means that
you've got a faster loading time and
you're not worried about say when flash
player for example has errors and their
kind of outside of your control it's
better it's quicker it's more semantic
it works so we'll leave this for now
let's just do a little bit of CSS work
it's not really necessary that you do
this it's just again more of a formality
sort of thing so I'm just going to
select all of the elements everything or
all using the asterisk sign set the
margin 20 and the padding 20 I'll do for
that we're going to select the section
that we created and I'll just set this
to text align Center what this is going
to do is sent to the video and anything
contained in the section island and
we'll select the video remember we gave
it an ID so we're going to select the
video and I'm just gonna give it a board
and the reason given a border is just to
say it sure that it's there more than
anything in all truth it's not
necessarily do the CSS file I just like
to sort of know where the video is using
this border just a sensor everything and
just to get rid of some of the browser
defaults but if i refresh this well
played chrome as you can see we've got
the video sent it now we've got this red
border around it so that we know that
it's there which and we've also got rid
of the the margin and the padding that
would be there usually so I think that
will do for this this part of the
tutorial in fact what we can probably do
next is take a little bit more of an
in-depth look at some of the parameters
that you can add to the video element
and I'm going to discuss these in detail
tell you what they do and perhaps give
you a little bit of advice on what to
use and perhaps what not to use but the
parameters are as simple as adding in
these little sort of you know in this
case controls you can add a poster image
that's one thing we are going to do you
could set the height if you wanted to
it's not necessary to set the height
I'll talk more about that later but for
now you've actually got your video more
or less working but there's a little bit
more stuff that i want to show you so i
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
