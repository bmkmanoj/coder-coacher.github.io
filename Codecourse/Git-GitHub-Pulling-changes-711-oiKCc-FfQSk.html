another computer or someone else
contributes to your project well the
files you have locally won't be
automatically updated let's go back to
the github interface and we're going to
use github editor to actually edit this
far and that's going to sort of not
someone else editing it because we're
not doing it locally and then we'll go
ahead and pull these changes down so I'm
going to click on edit here this gives
me a text edit interface where it can
make changes as I need I'm going to get
rid of the exclamation mark and down
here I have the chance to enter a commit
message as we saw earlier so I'm just
going to say removed exclamation mark so
I'm going to hit commit changes and
there we go that's now updated we
obviously don't need to push the changes
as we did in the last part because we're
already on our origin which is github so
over on our local machine if we check
the index.html file you can see that
there's no change to it at all now
remember when we first pulled this repo
down from github we used git clone you
might think this is the command we need
to run to pull down more changes but we
don't use this instead we use a command
called git pull so when I run this
that's giving us details about
everything that's just happened and you
can see one insert a ssin and one
deletion if we head over to github and
we just take a look at the commits here
you can see this is the latest commit
this is just a side note really if we
look at the commits here or the changes
here to this file you'll see that it's
removed the line with the exclamation
mark and it's added the line without the
exclamation mark and this is just how
git deals with changes to lines so don't
let this confuse you so let's go ahead
and we'll run git log and we'll add a
pretty option here just so we can see
how commit and you can see that that
commit has now been pulled down now if
we head over to our index.html file you
can see that the exclamation mark has
been removed and there we go that's how
we pull changes down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
