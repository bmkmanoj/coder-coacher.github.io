before and there are plenty of
generators around the web to allow you
to generate content that looks like this
and this is generally used for testing
when you're building some kind of layout
some people disagree with using lorem
ipsum that's fine but especially if
you're just perhaps working on a very
rough output of something sometimes a
big chunk of text like this is useful
because obviously typing all this
yourselves really really difficult I'm
using a plug-in in my text editor called
Emmet if you don't already have Emmet I
suggest you go ahead and check this out
it basically allows you to generate
markup based on CSS star selectors and
we've covered this in other lessons so
we're not going to go through the basics
of Emmet or any of the other
functionality in this video we're
specifically looking at generating lorem
ipsum so let's head over to our text
editor again and remove this now what's
going to happen here is when we do
generate long whip sand this is actually
going to generate random lorem ipsum for
us it's always going to be different
which is really useful because sometimes
you don't always want to send content so
with M it will generate an html5
document layout here and I'll just
indent this and within the body here
we're going to choose a kind of
structure that we want to generate down
our page now let's say we wanted here a
section like so and let's say within
that section we wanted to have a header
and then under this header we wanted a
couple of paragraph tags like the
following or few we'll do three
paragraph tags ok so inside of the
header we would obviously want some text
here and inside of the paragraph we
would want text here and so on and so
forth so doing this weighs fine I've
spent perhaps 30 seconds typing all of
this out and then I'd go ahead and I'd
head over to some kind of website that
would generate Laura
for me and I would copy that and I would
paste it in here but within it we can do
this very very quickly and we can do it
using predefined selectors that we can
expand out so for example just to run
over the basics if I wanted say three
sections I'd do this that will give me
three section elements that's fairly
straightforward what I'm going to do is
I'm going to wrap all of my items in a
in a bracket here and I'm going to time
that by say 10 and what this means is
anything I type in here and expand out
as long as I am at the end of here that
will be multiplied by 10 so we want 10
section elements so we want 10 section
elements now within the section elements
we want to put a h1 we know that now
within that h1 we want lorem ipsum so
let's pull away from this just for a
moment long mixin can be generated by
typing lips 'm and then tabbing so that
basically expands out a selector now by
default i don't know how many words this
is but if we would do lips and one that
gives us one word if we do lips and two
that gives us two words and the same for
three four five you can imagine so this
is really useful because we can define
how many words we want generated which
is really really useful my default is
just this that might do but you might
want a you know a whole article worth of
lorem ipsum so you do lower lips and
1000 and this is entirely flexible and
we can obviously place lorem ipsum
within elements like this so for a
header we might expect to have maybe 15
words or not 10 words let's say so we've
done that now what we now want is next
to the h1 or yes or adjacent to it we
want to have three paragraph tags but
what we're going to do here is because
we have included this Lipson text here
we need to go back a selector to then
add this next to the h1 because at the
moment if we were to do an adjacent
selector like this it would add it next
to this
texts and things that get a little bit
confusing so we do this modify her to go
back one so then I'm going to say well I
want three paragraphs here but within
them paragraphs
I want more lorem ipsum text let's say
one one fifty so that's a paragraph with
lorem ipsum in times three so let's
expand this out oops sorry we need to do
e times three I think there we go so now
we've expanded this out you can see at
the side of my my text editor sublime
gives you a good view of the whole way
down your page you can see now how much
content here has been generated and we
can of course preview this in our
browser and just have a look at what
this is done and you can see all of this
content that's been generated here and
you'll notice that if you check so the
second paragraph out here that's
different to the second paragraph here
it starts well there's different text
being generated so this is really useful
and the same with a header as well we've
got some exclamation marks here so this
is really useful so that's the selector
I've used to generate this give it a go
and in your next project
hopefully it'll really speed up your
development</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
