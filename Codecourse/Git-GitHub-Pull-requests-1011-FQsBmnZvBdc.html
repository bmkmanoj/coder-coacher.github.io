a completely different user to the user
I've been using throughout the series
and will contribute to the hello world
project using this code course user
doing this is fundamental to the
community side of developing on projects
since it's highly likely that you'll
want to contribute to a project or
others will want to contribute to your
project
now I'm quickly going to explain the
difference between a collaborator and
someone creating a pull request so if I
head over to my hello world project and
hit settings and then the collaborators
tab adding collaborators to your repo
basically means you're giving them the
ability to make any changes they want
and they don't have to issue pull
requests it's important to understand
this because you don't need to grant
everyone collaborator access because
they can still contribute to your
project through pull requests now the
reason that pull requests exist is
simple it gives other people the chance
to make improvements to your code but
allows you to review the changes comment
on lines etc so let's look at how we do
this the first thing I want to do is
fork this repository and forking
basically take someone else's repository
at the point it's currently at and lets
you do what you want with it think of it
as basically making a copy of it
although it's still linked to the to the
original repository in the sense that
you can submit pull requests if you're
still confused don't worry all hopefully
will become clear very soon so I'm going
to head over to this repository Alex
Garrett / hello world and then I'm going
to hit the fort button just here and
there we go that's now fort now it's not
available to us locally yet so I'm going
to head over to my command line just
here I've created a new folder in here
that's not in the same folder as the git
directory we've created a new one here
and we're going to go ahead and clone
this so as before I'm going to grab the
HTTP link and I'm going to head over to
my terminal and I'm going to say git
clone and then just paste that in so
again that's going to clone into the
hello world directory so we'll see that
just appear just in here so once that's
cloned to that directory you can use
all the knowledge you already have on
committing branching pushing you can
just do everything as normal now this
point is good to remember that we're
working as a fake another user so this
could be someone else so it could be you
on another computer just bear that in
mind now at the moment we're not
touching the original repository you're
just pushing changes up to your own
forked version of it so for example if I
go ahead and create a new file in here
let's save this out as new dot HTML and
let's add code to it so hello new file
so over in our command line now we can
just run git status and you'll see oops
if we just CD into that we can run git
status and we see this so we can go
ahead and add that new file and we can
go ahead and commit this like so and
then we can push it up and I'm just
going to enter my credentials for this
new account and there we go so let's
check this out here let's hit enter and
you can see that we've got noodle HTML
over on the other board of the original
repository we don't have that file
obviously that's what we're looking at
we're looking at the fact that I've just
committed to my forked version of the
repository and now I want to send a
request to the author of the original
posit tree to tell them I want to push
the changes into that so all I need to
do is over on github head over to the
pull requests tab I want to click new
pull request now up here we can see the
branches that we're requesting to merge
into so if I just hit edit in this case
you can see the base fork and the head
fork I'm basically asking for my master
branch on the hello world repo to be
merged into the brant master branch of
the original hello world repo on the
Alex camera account you can edit this
particularly if
/ you're contributing to has a specific
branch for developing so you can choose
basically which you want to merge into
from this one so you might have a master
branch on your forked and you might have
a develop branch here that you want to
basically merge into so we hit the
create pull request and then we go ahead
and give a description at the moment
this is pulling from the commit that I
have here which is inserted or added a
new file I call this so I'm just going
to hit create pull request so at this
point nothing is merged because you
don't have write permission to the hello
world repo but at this point you have
the chance to comment comment on
specific lines exchange files if you
want to but that's pretty much it if we
head over to here now you can see that
we've got a pull request open and we can
review these and this should also notify
you by email as well so we're back over
to the original repository and we see
that a pull request is created and we
can build the usual stuff as the owner
of this repo once I decide that I'm
happy with the changes I can then merge
them in and you can merge from the
command line but in this case I always
find it quicker and easier just to click
merge like here most pull requests and
then go ahead and confirm the merge and
that will then automatically close the
pull request for you and if we head over
there you can see that that new far now
exists in the original repo and that's
it we've basically contributed to a
project from a fake account with a pull
request</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
