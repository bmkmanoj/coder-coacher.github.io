this tutorial we're going to be creating
a email validation form so you can
incorporate the technique I use in this
video into any form you like now we're
going to go down a slightly
unconventional route for form validation
in terms of email addresses and we're
going to look at doing this using a
function that PHP actually gives us
we're not going to be using regular
expressions if you've come across
regular expressions before favela dating
URLs email addresses it's extremely
complicated on first glance if you know
you know the certain aspects that make
up the regular expressions then it can
you know look quite easy but in terms of
PHP we're given a function that allows
us to easily filter an email address
validate an email address so let's go
ahead and test our how this works I'm
going to go ahead and just type in site
Alex at PHP which I'll see isn't a valid
email address because we've got no
domain extension so if I click Submit
you can see that we get the message
sorry invalid email address if I go
ahead and type in site Alex at PHP comm
which obviously is my email address but
if I go ahead and type in my actual
email address something that we still
get that two valid email address so if
we were to type load of rubbish in for
example then you get sorry an invalid
email address now there are a couple of
problems with this but you know it
shouldn't really hold you back if if a
user is trying to register genuinely on
your site they tend to you know 90% of
the time give a valid email address
however you know if they were to
accidentally type something this can get
a little tricky in terms of validating
the domain extension obviously you know
you can't really validate domain name
extensions like com org for example
because new ones can pop up new ones can
become available at different times so
you know there can't be a set standard
of validating the end of it so for
example if I typed Alex up
P Academy dot PHP which obviously isn't
a valid domain extension and click
Submit it tells me that it's a valid
email address even though it isn't so be
warned that this is a problem with this
however you know there's not very much
you can do about it apart from validate
you know you could for example split the
email address by dots explode but then
again that's a whole another tutorial so
we're just going to focus on validating
an email address in this way which you
know does does a good job in itself so
we're going to go over to the code or
the editor start writing this out okay
so we're starting with a blank canvas
let's go ahead and create our PHP tags
now this is where all the validation is
going to take place just up here and
down here going to create our form which
we're going to allow our user to submit
an email address just go ahead and
create a simple form we're going to
leave the action blank which is going to
go into submit the form to the current
page that we're on and we're going to
supply a method of post will end the
form there and we'll start to create the
input so we've got an input type first
of all of text that's where we're going
to be placing our email address in and
then we're going to give it a name so we
can identify it when we pass this
through to PHP so I'm going to call this
user underscore email ok so below this
let's go ahead and create a submit
button so this input type submit we
don't need any other attributes for this
field by default in Chrome let's just
see it's a submit so we can type an
email address in here now and we click
Submit that passes the variable or the
you know value in here back to the
script okay so inside PHP we're going to
do some other validation here as well
we're first of all going to check if
this variable is set because if we try
and access this variable without
checking if it is first set we'll get an
error in PHP for example echo dollar
underscore post
click there user email if we go back
onto our page you can see that we've got
this undefined index error which is a
problem so the first thing we want to do
before we you know echo it out or set it
into it or place it into another
variable we need to go ahead and
validate let's create an if block just
here we've got if our parentheses and
then two of our curly brackets
we're going to use the is set language
construct and we're just going to say is
set dollar underscore post user email
and we want that to equal true and we
also want to check whether whether the
user has typed anything because
obviously we don't validate a blank
email address so we want to say empty
dollar underscore post I use it email
and we want this we want to make sure
this is equal to false so we want to say
is this set ie is it true is it empty I
you know is it not empty has it got some
content then what we can do is a place
it into its own variable so I'm going to
say email equals dollar underscore post
use a toilet properly user email and
then below this we want to go ahead and
perform the email validation now this is
extremely easy we can just do this using
one function as I said earlier so if I
was to say if and then we can grab a
block there on to say
so if filter underscore var and then in
brackets I'm going to give this a couple
of parameters in a minute I want this to
equal true here we're going to say yay
and else we're going to say no so this
is going to be the message if it's a
valid email address and this is going to
be the message if it's a invalid email
address like the filter of our email we
can pass that variable into it and now
we're going to type here filter
underscore and in capsules by the way
filter underscore validate underscore
email so we're telling this filter var
function which isn't specifically set
aside to validate email addresses
it does
validate other things as well we're
saying validate this string here and or
so basically filter var with you know
filtering down and checking this
variable here for a match and we're
telling it to validate it as an email
address now if it had if it can't
validate it as an email address
dysfunction then it will pass the value
false ie this won't equal true and we'll
end up in this block here otherwise it
will end up in this block so here I'm
going to go ahead and echo that's and
I'm just going to escape that they're a
valid email address otherwise we want to
say not a valid email address or
something like that so let's go over to
our browser and preview this let's just
go ahead and type in a load of rubbish
and click Submit you can see that we get
the not a valid email address text if we
go ahead and type in a valid email
address ie my email address and click
Submit you see we get the message that's
a valid email address so you can see
that using this tutor using this
function we've either validated an email
address and you can go ahead and
incorporate this into you know
validating through a different form
fields if your user is typing so user
name and email address etc etc so it's
extremely easy just to incorporate into
the validation system that you currently
have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
