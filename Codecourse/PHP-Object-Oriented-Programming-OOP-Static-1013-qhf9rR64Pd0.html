static and this is actually a very
simple concept but the reason I left it
so far into the series is because I
really don't want you to get into the
habit of relying on static for your code
so I'll explain a little bit more about
that later on
but for now let's create a new file and
require it in our index file here so
publicly sorry class foo and this is
going to contain a public static
function this keyword is very important
it will call this hello and we're going
to return hello world and what static
means is that we can call this method
without creating a new instance so we
don't have to do all of this we can just
call straight away at foo hello and we
do that with foo which is the class name
double colon and hello so if we look in
that browser hit refresh and we need to
echo this we get hello world and like
earlier we could just
well like always we can just specify
arguments so return far and we can
change this to hello so they act just
like a normal function and it's the same
with properties so if we say public
static bar equals foo bar we can access
foo dollar sign bar foo bar
now one very important thing to mention
is if we remove this and let's say I
want to return this variable here so
I'll return this bar and we say foo
hello hit refresh we get fatal error
using this when not in object context
and that's because technically we're not
accessing a an instance here now the way
I like to think about static is a secret
PHP instance that's dedicated just to
static
methods and properties and I know that
MAME may not make much sense but if it
does then great because at first static
really confused me but just persevere
and it will come now I don't want to
mention that you should really not be
using static loosely only use it when
it's absolutely necessary because when
you move on to things like testing if
you use a lot of static in your code
then your life is going to be really
difficult</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
