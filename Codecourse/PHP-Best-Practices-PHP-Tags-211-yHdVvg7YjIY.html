at the PHP tags and we're going to be
discussing why the closing tags should
be omitted so I have my demo project set
up I've index dot PHP which is including
start then I'm redirecting the client to
Google if we take a look in starts we're
calling our session start and then we
have a closing tag and we have two lines
of whitespace
now these this white space here is
actually output that we're sending to
the browser so I'm going to demonstrate
by just commenting this out now I'm
going to type hello world so if we go to
work if we go to our browser and refresh
we see hello world now if we have white
space here this is actually this is
still output we just can't see it so if
we uncomment this and go back to our
browser refresh we're going to get an
error kind of modify header information
that is already sent on start the PHP
line seven so this is because we're
sending output down here as I just
explained and as we all know we can't
send the header after we've outputted
something so to fix this what PHP
developers do is they just remove the
closing tag like so and then they can
have as much white space as they'd like
and it still isn't going to give us this
error we're just going to get redirected
to Google now while we're on the subject
of PHP tags I'd like to also mention
that short tags like this you've
probably seen all they do is they output
word servers in whatever is inside
short tags like this should not be used
and the reason behind this is that any
PHP version before 5.4 requires that the
server configuration allows them to use
these short tags now obviously if you're
if your project is only going to be used
by you on your own server then that's
fine you can use what
like but if this is going to be an
open-source project or something you're
making for a client then you have no
idea what PHP version they're running or
even if they're the PHP version it we
don't any supports these tags so it's
really a simple fix
that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
