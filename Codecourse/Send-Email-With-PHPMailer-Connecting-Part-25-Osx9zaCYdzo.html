an SMTP server to be able to send email
with PHP mailer now I'm going to be
using Gmail but you can use any SMTP
service go ahead and look one up and
once you have the details you can use
them here so the first thing that we
want to do is create a new PHP mailer
object so let's store this in a variable
called M just for simplicity this in my
case just stands for mail or email or
whatever this is going to be a new PHP
mailer
we don't need back it we're not passing
any options through to this but what we
now need to do is go ahead and set
different properties the first thing
we're going to do though is call a
method called is SMTP that will just
tell PHP mailer that we want to use SMTP
to send our email so we say is SMTP so
that's what we need to do to tell PHP
mailer we want to use SMTP now we need
to do things like set the host the
username the password and all that other
information but what I'm going to do now
is say SMTP auth is true so now what
we're doing is setting properties so we
set this to true a boolean value also
going to turn to bugging on and this is
really useful if you are connecting to
an SMTP server for the first time but
you might be having a few problems so
this will set debugging on and I'm
setting this to 2 which is going to give
me just messages you can set this to 1
that's going to give you error codes and
messages so now I'm going to choose the
host I want to connect to it's obviously
really important this is host with a
capital H and I am choosing
smtp.gmail.com let me just separate
these so little easier to see
so we now want to supply the username
and the password so let's just fill them
in if you're using SMTP like nee to
authenticate you can use all the details
like the host and the pour
we're going to look at in a moment and
also that the secure type as well so all
you'll need to do here is replace your
Gmail username and password so in this
case I into my email and I enter my
password okay so the next thing I want
to do is set the secure type in this
case it's going to be SSL so we say SMTP
secure and this is using SSL and what we
also need to define is which port we're
using this isn't necessary for all SMTP
servers but in this case we're going to
specify which port you want to use here
now this is actually all that we need to
do to connect to our SMTP server and
start sending email down here so go
ahead find your details apply them here
and we'll go ahead and look at sending
emails in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
