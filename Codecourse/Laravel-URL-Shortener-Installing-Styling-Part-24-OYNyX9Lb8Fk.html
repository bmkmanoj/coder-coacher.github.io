actually install laravel so let's use
composer to create a new project and
that's going to be laravel laravel and
we want to install laravel in the URL
short directory i'm currently within
this laravel directory here so specify
the target folder and we also want to
prefer the distribution so once that's
installed we can go ahead and start to
configure laravel okay so let's go over
to the directory now browser just to
make sure everything looks okay and
we'll head over to the public directory
and you can see that laravel has been
successfully installed let's now open
this now text editor to start
configuring it so the first thing that
we'll do is define our document markup
and we'll start to apply some styles to
this but the first thing is we currently
have this you have arrived message that
we get with that every laravel
installation so we need to create a new
view and change this so inside of app
and views hello is the view that you can
currently see in the browser so I'm
gonna go ahead and get rid of that and
I'm gonna create a new file and I'm
gonna save this as home dot blaze dot
PHP so we can use the blade templating
language now that we've done that we are
going to head over to the controllers
area and into home controller and I'm
gonna change this make hello to make
home I'm also going to change this to
index we'll go ahead and get rid of
these comments as well and inside of
routes let's modify this route to change
this to use the controller so we get rid
of this callback function and we pass an
array through and the alias for this
we're going to use as and we're gonna
call this home also going to specify
which controller this uses and in this
case it's home controller index so now
what's going to happen is when a user
hits this it's going to go through -
home controller and the index method
that we've renamed here and that will
then make the home view that we
it here let's create some text in here
just to make sure this works when we
refresh we see that that works so that's
done we can now define our document
markup so I'm going to create a doctype
HTML tags a head and a body and inside
of the head let's change the character
encoding to utf-8 and let's give this a
title now let's also link in a
stylesheet and we'll create that
stylesheet in the public directory as
well so we say link rel is obviously a
stylesheet and we choose the location to
the star she let's create this first and
then we'll look at linking this up so
inside of public I'm gonna create a new
folder called CSS and inside of this I'm
going to create a new file and I'm gonna
call this global dot CSS so this is
where our CSS goes let's change the body
style just so you can see that this is
working we may as well change the input
style at the same time we'll change the
font here 2.9 m/s to Homer and serif so
inside of home under href we want to
output something with the double curly
brace syntax and we'll say URL - this
will be the relative or path - or the
absolute path to the public directory so
in this case we just do CSS slash global
dot CSS so in here let's write home and
when we refresh that's obviously taking
effect and we actually need to change
this to sound so ok so inside of home
now let's define the mark-up that we
need here we're gonna have a container a
header and then obviously our form that
we enter the URL into and hit the button
so the mark-up here isn't difficult at
all
it's just div class so we're going to
give this a class
of container an inside of here will have
an h1 and we'll give this a class as
well so we can specifically style this
title and we will say shorten a URL
fairly straightforward so now is the
form I'm not using laravel helper class
helper methods for to generate this form
entirely preference so here we want a
URL to something eventually let's leave
this out though for now until we create
that route the method is going to be
post so we have an input type here of a
URL this is going to force in browsers
that support this this will actually
force the validation of the URL before
the user can actually submit this form
in the case that this isn't supported in
a browser it simply falls back to a text
type so it doesn't matter we don't need
to worry about backward compatibility
here and also you'll find that we're
gonna validate inside of laravel as well
so you don't need to rely on this
front-end validation you should never
ever rely on front-end validation so the
name will be URL that's just the key
that we used to pick this up inside of
the input and we'll also use a
placeholder here as well so I'll say
enter a URL now this will fall back to
nothing on older browsers so you may
want to create some kind of label or
something like that in your form for now
they will just leave this because we
just focused on the back end
functionality really so the type here is
going to be submit for the obviously for
the submit button and the value here
I'll just say shorten that makes sense
so let's check this out and then we'll
apply some styles so it looks okay but
we can do better so over to our global
CSS stylesheet we will apply some styles
here now for the title all I want to do
is change the font weight back to normal
I don't this to be as bold as it is so
that will just leave our page looking
like that
so quite nice and for the container we
want this to be centered I'm gonna give
this a width of
hundred percent but then I'm going to
define a max width to it and this will
mean that it's nice and fluid so it
won't look bad on on mobile or tablet
devices
assuming you set the device metadata at
the top we won't go into that so we'll
also set the text alignment to Center
that will just center everything for us
in there or not everything everything
that we need and we'll set the margin to
zero and auto so what that's going to do
then as I've said will send to the
container and we'll also Center all of
our contents in here so we can follow on
from to star the inputs now I'm just
targeting all inputs you probably
wouldn't want to do this if you have
other inputs on your site but in this
case I'm just being a little bit lazy
I'm gonna set the padding to Tempe
pixels I'm gonna set the background
color to white I'm going to set the
order to one pixel solid and we'll just
do a gray color so CCC and I'll also set
the margin to zero this will help it sit
as close as possible to the submit
button
so we'll specifically now target the URL
input that we have on the home page
again probably not a good idea if you
have other elements on your page but
we'll just give this width of 300 pixels
so when i refresh it looks like that so
we've now got a nicely styled home page
so what we'll go onto now in the next
part is actually building the backend
functionality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
