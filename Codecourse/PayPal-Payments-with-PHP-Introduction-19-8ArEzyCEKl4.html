making payments with paypal via PayPal
REST API and of course we're going to be
doing this in PHP we're going to pull
down the dependency that we need to be
able to do this and the code from there
is pretty straightforward so the first
thing that we're going to do is look at
how this is actually going to work in
this kind of system we're building just
to warn you the code is going to be very
procedural this really just gives you an
overview of how the payment process
works rather than actually building it
into your application but once you do
understand everything that we look at in
this series it should be really easy to
go and integrate this into your
application so we're going to be working
with a kind of example application where
we're not a member we make a payment
that transfers us to PayPal we come back
and once we've paid successfully within
a member so in the database if we look
under the users table here that we've
got we've also got this transactions
table that we're going to be using to
log transactions you can see that I've
just got a user name email and then the
field here obviously these are
self-explanatory member will go from 0
to 1
once we've paid and we've returned to
validate the payment so here then it
says at the moment I'm not a member I'm
going to go ahead and hit make a payment
that's going to it's a little bit slow
we're using PayPal sandbox to test this
so it is probably slower than it would
be in a production environment when
you're actually using a live version you
can see here we've got facilitators
account tests all this just means that
we're using a sort of facilitator
account in order to test this and I can
go ahead and log in with some
credentials here so I can log in with my
email address and put my password in hit
login this again this Alex at Co course
comm this is a test account that I've
set up specifically on the sandbox with
a test password and once that's logged
us in you'll see a fake address here as
well which is really cool when we hit
continue then that's going to return us
back to the site to validate that
payment and that should turn us into a
member
there we go so we've got thanks payment
complete if we head over to the database
now and refresh you can see that members
change to one and also a transaction
here has been logged if a user starts a
transaction journey and doesn't finish
it complete will be set to zero you
don't have to do this but it gives you a
good idea of who has actually gone
through the payment process and not
completed it so when we go back to the
home page just here let's just change
this wait thousand you can see you are
remember so really this or
authentication side of this is faked
there's natural authentication here
again once you've learned how to do this
you can integrate it into your own
application so there's a couple of
things that you're going to needs to be
able to to be able to follow this series
you can only composer because we're
going to be downloading the paypal PHP
SDK and this is payment this is a
restful api the way we're interacting
with here and you can see this unpack
just as well you can see the versioning
information etc we'll go through this
though in the next part you'll also need
a PayPal developer account if you
already have a PayPal account just
Google for PayPal developers and you'll
be able to sign sign up and you'll be
able to create apps then we'll also be
going through this in the next part as
well so with that out the way in the
next part we'll look at how we need to
set everything up in order to actually
start writing the code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
