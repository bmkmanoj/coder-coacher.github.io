arrayed to referencing which sounds like
a complicated term but in actual fact
it's fairly easy straightforward to
understand and will make your life a lot
easier now there are a sort of
consideration to doing this so we'll
talk about that in a moment when we've
demonstrated what I mean by arrayed
referencing so you can see on the screen
at the moment I've got a class just
called something I've got a private
property just called results and that
holds an array of four items I've also
got a function here or a method rather
and cool results that basically just
returns this so that's all we're really
doing in in that sense and on index dot
PHP are just requiring this class and I
instantiate it so we've got an object
now that we can work with so this is all
well and good but what am I talking
about when I talk about arrayed
referencing and what's the point of it
well let's just take a look at something
that we would have to do to access say
the first element in this array and this
results array if we were using a version
of PHP prior to 5.4 so what we would do
is we would say results equals something
results let's just go ahead and print do
a print our own results just to see what
we're dealing with and just to prove
this is actually returning a result set
which it is you can see four elements
here in the array that we're printing
out here so what we would do is if we
wanted the first element we would just
say first equals results and you
probably guessed zero that just takes
the first element so if we go ahead and
just echo that out that will should echo
out Alex there we are
so we've retrieved the first element
from this array now this is all well and
good it works you know why should we not
do this well it's actually quite
annoying because what we had to do is if
we don't need this result set again
we've had to create a temporary variable
here so we're creating a variable and
really it's unnecessary so what we could
do is with versions of PHP 5.4 or higher
what we can do is we can actually use a
raid referencing so
we can we can access the first element
directly from the array returned from
this method now from 5.4 you can do this
with array literals which I'm not
running five point forks I can't
demonstrate it unfortunately but go
ahead to the PHP documentation and this
will all be explained and you know you
can play around with it yourself if
you're running version 5.4 but basically
what we can do to change what we have at
the moment with PHP version 5.4 or
higher is we can remove this completely
and we can just say first equals
something results and then we can use
our zero zero index to access the first
element so what this will then do is if
we go ahead and echo this out well
nothing will change we have exactly the
same Burroughs result here I've
refreshed and we get we get the same
thing now in versions prior to five
point four this would actually error so
you wouldn't be able to do this and
likewise if you were to access you know
element 10 in here you just get the same
error as you'd get if you were trying to
access an array or an item of an array
that didn't exist so this is really
useful simply because we don't have to
create temporary variables like I said
if we if we don't need to store these
results anywhere you know this is it
we've we've achieved what we need in one
line rather than two which is always
good now there is a problem here and
that's if you are developing this on
version 5.5 of PHP or higher and then
this is this code is run either
intentionally or unintentionally on a
version of PHP that's lower now this
will cause an error and then you'll have
to go back and fix it up or the person
that's using the code will have to go
ahead and upgrade their PHP version and
this is extremely difficult if it's on
you know shared hosting or something
like that so if you're developing you
know an application for yourself and you
know that you can you know you have
complete control over your server and
you can install always you always keep
up to date with the latest PHP version
then you'll fine you can use this knit
wall it should help you out in your in
your development workflow but otherwise
a consideration does need to be taking
into account if you're using this in
code that's been given away sold
used on other systems and or anything
like that so that is a consideration but
otherwise this is a much better way to
access elements of an array through a
radar referencing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
