modal window with CSS Morse are going to
make it responsive so it adapts to
different browser sizes or different
devices so this is what the modal looks
like you can see that as I scroll in the
background it just stays in a fixed
position you can of course choose an
absolute position so it Scrolls with the
rest of the content that still stays in
the middle and you can basically star
this up how you want we're gonna look at
the basics of centering this and also
making it so it's responsive and stays
really really nicely within the page
like this so let's go ahead and jump
straight into the code and look at how
we would do this so we're starting off
with an empty document here it's
basically a document layout we've got a
star she already linked in called global
dot CSS and that's within a CSS
directory here there's nothing in here
at all at the moment so the first thing
that I'm going to do is just generate
some content on the page so a load of
paragraphs with some lorem ipsum in and
that gives us a nice base to play around
with scrolling up and down as well as
pulling the browser window in and out
and we're gonna define where this modal
is gonna sit this might be generated
with JavaScript or something like that
if you're using some kind of plug-in
that forces you just style your own
modal window I'm just gonna call this
modal so it's just gonna be a div for
the class of modal and I'm just gonna
say I am a modal so when i refresh we
see that up here but obviously we don't
have any Styles associated with this now
it's inside of global dot CSS then let's
crouch selector for modal and let's get
started the first thing I'm going to do
is choose the positioning of this
element and in this case it's going to
be a position of fixed you'll notice
that the rest of the content comes up
because this now is in our control we
can move it wherever we want on the page
and this is one of the hardest things to
grasp by CSS how can we Center this in
the middle of the page well of course
you could do something like left 50%
but that's not going to work as well as
you hope they might look like it's
centered let's just start to build up
the rest of this window and then we'll
look at a little trick that we can use
using the CSS transform property so I'm
going to go ahead and give this a
background so we'll say white and let's
change this to background color and I'm
going to give this a border as well so
we'll say one pixel solid and I'd know
ay-ay-ay
so this is starting to look more like it
would be a modal window we just need to
make a few more adjustments so we can
set some padding on this so 30 pixels
for example when we refresh we get this
and we can then go ahead and do things
like round out the borders with border
radius so 5 pixels and we can perhaps
move this from the top about 50 pixels
just so it sits a little bit further
down the page so we've got this now but
we need it centered so let's give this a
width now I'm going to give this a width
of 70% and I'm then going to give this a
maximum width of 700 pixels the reason
I've done this is the width of 70% gives
it that actual width but then the
maximum width controls that within
different sized viewports so now when i
refresh you can see that we get this and
it's not looking great at the moment we
can't really see what's going on with it
resizing so let's go ahead now and look
at how we can actually send to this
container
in actual fact let's add a box shadow
onto this I will say 3 pixels 3 pixels
X&amp;amp;Y officer will give it an 8 pixel
spread and will set the background to
Naut Naut Naut with a point 5 or 6 alpha
so that gives us the following effect
the little shadow underneath so it's now
acting more like a modal window looks
like a modal window but there's a final
property that we need to apply here to
make this Center and that is the
transform element and we're gonna
translate this element which essentially
is moving it around and we're going to
say my
is 50% on the x-axis and 0 on the Y so
now you can see nothing works that's
because we require the WebKit then the
prefix for this particular property
within chrome so now it looks like I'm
miss spelt this so it's transform we
probably don't need this WebKit prefix
actually at the time of recording WebKit
is still recommended to be used just for
a few browser versions back just in case
this hasn't been implemented so let's
check this out and there we go it is
centered so when we pull this in now
you'll notice that it's maintaining that
700 pixel width up until the point where
it's less than 700 pixels and then we
can see the percentage come into place
there so it pulls in nicely and comes
out to reveal this it's important to
know that this isn't actually 700 pixels
if we check this out it's actually 76 -
now the reason for that is we've got 30
pixels padding so what's actually
happening is it's adding 30 pixels on
the Left 30 pixels on the right as well
as the top and bottom but we're not
massively concerned with the top and
bottom it's a 30 pixel on the left and
right is 60 and then we have a 1 pixel
order which is giving us that extra - so
it's 76 - now if you do need a very
specific width you can either look into
box sizing or you can just adjust the
units just - or the values just to make
this the exact size that you need it's
probably rare that you need an exact
size from modal anyway so anyway we have
created here a responsive modal window
there probably are better solution but
if you are just needing to create a
quick modal window that responds to
different sizes then there is and as I
mentioned before if you didn't want this
to stay in a fixed position as you
scroll you might want to look at using
an absolute position which will mean it
will still allow you to control the
position but it'll actually scroll down
with the rest of the con
and this is ideal if you have much
longer modal content where you want to
give your users the freedom to scroll
down and view lots of content within the
window so there we are we've built a
very simple modal with CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
