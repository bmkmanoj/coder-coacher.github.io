video number 13 in this new series where
I'm creating a login registration system
using codeigniter what I'll be doing in
this video is we've already checked to
see after in the registration you in the
register user function I've checked to
see if their key is valid and I have
tried to add their add the user to the
database I guess the first thing we
should do is test this to make sure it
works so we'll actually will refresh
this refresh this page and there's a
error okay so the user tutorial user
doesn't exist on line number 58 okay I'm
going to pause it trying to fix it okay
I found it in the model underscore users
model I'm trying to insert it into the
user table instead of the user's table
so let's try again I'll save that and
refresh it
it says success so we would assume now
that the temp temp user's table would be
empty because it was deleted yep so
there's no entries in there and if I
click on users and then go browse you
can see that this user that we created
tried to sign up with was successfully
signed up which is awesome that means
we're ready to actually log them in and
send them to the read to the members
page so that's what we're gonna do
actually in the main controller instead
of echoing out success so what we'll do
is we'll make it a data array Dave that
go to array and then we'll say the email
is equal to well actually we don't have
access to their email I'll come back to
that and then the key or the is logged
in will be yes or one
just go in to one okay and then after
that we would actually like log them in
set the set the user data let's do that
then this this session set underscore
user data data and then we redirect to
the members only page main slash members
sure that's where I was called just
double check members yeah perfect now we
have a problem though is we actually
don't have their email address and so
what we would have to do normally is
query the database and create a new
function in the model that will just
grab the user data but we don't have to
in this case when we're locking them in
all we have to do is grab their email
address and we have access to their
email address in this data array right
here so instead of returning true it's
actually return well
data email so that's going to send
essentially the email of the value for
email which will be the email that we're
actually deleting from the temp users
database and adding to the users
database which will work just fine so
instead of this we actually need to set
this equal to a value so we'll say new
email if new new email is equal to
except from setting new email equal to
this model model underscore users add
user now we can actually use new email
right here cool and that should actually
work so now we'll we'll delete PHP login
Tut from our database and try again I'll
just go back and delete these
and then let's try this again go right
from right from the first page name okay
unexpected double arrow on main line 117
unexpected double arrow oh it's not a
dollar sign array it's just regular it's
just the word array save that okay
perfect so we'll click sign up we'll go
sign up will be PHP login Tut at
gmail.com
astrolutely password well sign up the
email has been sent
excellent I'll check my email sure
enough there it is click here to confirm
your account so once I click here it's
going to send me to the register user
function it's gonna check if my key is
valid which it should be it's gonna try
and add me as a user
grab the new from that and then the log
me and and redirect me to the members
page so once I click this even though
it's going to the register user function
it's gonna redirect me to the members
page if everything was successful and
whoa look at that I am now successfully
logged in and signed up so now if I
actually refresh this you'll see that I
now have a new entry and that's PHP
login Ted at gmail.com and my password
is password and I now have access to the
members page so now we have successfully
created a system where we can log in and
we can sign up I'm using CodeIgniter you
can also log out and now if I want to
try and log in with that new with this
new credentials that I've just created
and signed up with no PHP login tut at
gmail.com password password click login
and there we go I'm logged in my email
is PHP login tut at gmail.com and it
looks good so I believe that's
basically what I set out to build thanks
for watching this video tutorial this
video tutorial series guys I hope I hope
this helped you have with your with your
own projects and maybe some of the
techniques helped you improve your
programming and yeah thank you for
watching this series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
