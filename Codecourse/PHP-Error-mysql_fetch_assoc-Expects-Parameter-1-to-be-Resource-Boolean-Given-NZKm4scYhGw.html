this video we're going to be looking at
a common error that we get when we read
or query a database a table for some
data and that is this error you can see
here it is MySQL fetch a sock which
stands for associative array expects
parameter 1 to be resource boolean given
okay so it's quite a not cryptic error
but it's something that you might not
immediately understand if you're new to
PHP so what we're going to be doing is
we're going to be taking a look at why
the error is caused and we're going to
be looking more in depth so you know
hopefully you'll come away from this
video understanding why this error you
know can be caused and we're also gonna
look at some techniques that we can use
to start to solve this this problem so
let's go ahead and take a look at the
code that I'm using that's generated
this error I've generated the error on
purpose so I've modified my code to to
make it incorrect it won't immediately
look incorrect but let's go ahead and
look at what this is doing well I'm
doing this all in one file for just for
clarity but we're connecting to a
database we have a keyword that we're
searching for which is the and I'm
searching a MySQL database table here or
querying a table and you can see it's
just got a list of different articles
and a few have got the in so essentially
what we're doing is we're just saying
select article title from articles where
article like the so we're basically
saying return anything that has the as
in th e within it now the fact I'm doing
this doesn't you know matter it doesn't
matter that I'm using like oh I just
wanted to create a more complex example
however if you have a query what however
simple it is and we get and you say you
know not written the query correctly or
there's some kind of syntax error then
you'll have a problem here and this is
the error that you may get so let's take
a look first of all at the the error and
what line it's on and everything like
that and then determine how we can sort
of progress and try to solve this so
we've got the MySQL fetch a sauce sock
functions returning the error that
doesn't mean we've got anything wrong on
line 12 let's go back to our code line
12 is here now you may think well
there's something wrong with my code on
line 12 well in actual fact it's saying
that there's something wrong with what's
been passed to the MySQL fetch a sock
function or Sulc however you want to
pronounce it and the problem is with the
query itself so the the actual problem
is with this line here so the first
thing that that's done is you know it's
confused us it said well the errors on
this line it's actually the query that's
being passed to it and a query is a
parameter is parameter 1 now with the
MySQL fetch a sock we can pass another
parameter to it too and this is the the
database connection to use we're not
going to worry about that but that's
where that part of the error comes from
parameter 1 so remember we can pass two
parameters I may be more thinking I
think it's just - yes - can pass two
parameters to this the first is the
query and the second will be oh no it's
not no sorry ignore you can all that
anyway this is the first parameter if
you're unsure of what can be passed this
go to the PHP manual hurt php.net so
yeah back to the point we've got this
query that's returning something you
know it's returning false essentially
says here boolean given now if you
understand the basics of programming a
boolean is a value that is true or false
or can sometimes be represented as sort
of 0 or 1 depending on on which language
you're writing in anyway a boolean is in
this case being returned now you know we
might think well you know what's the
problem here I don't understand this
query here is failing and therefore the
MySQL query function has
returned false because it's returned
false we're passing false into here so
essentially what we're doing is this
okay
so I've changed this to false now and I
have you know my query is not being used
anywhere so let's go ahead and refresh
and you can see that we get exactly the
same problem okay so we're still we're
passing essentially what was being
passed before into this function and the
reason being is that the query is you
know is right it doesn't it's not being
it's not being recognized as a query or
something can't be you know processed
properly by MySQL and the problem is if
you haven't already noticed that we've
got where article like this and in
actual fact if we look at our database
the field is article title so all I've
done is I specified an incorrect field
name for this so I need to go ahead and
correct this and then when I would go
and refresh the problem would be solved
however it might not always be that easy
you might have say a 10 line or a 10
statement query which would you know
cause you some kind of problem looking
through this for errors now there's a
couple of ways we can solve this we can
either go ahead and paste this into a
PHP my admin or we can take a more sort
of infile approach but let's go ahead
and we'll paste this into PHP myadmin
remember any variables that you use
within a query you're going to need to
substitute when you paste them into
phpMyAdmin
so let's go ahead and go up here to this
SQL tab here and let's go ahead and
paste this query in and let's go ahead
and substitute what we would normally
have within the variable now if this is
like a user ID or an article ID or
anything that you're passing through to
it you're going to need to substitute it
in with the correct data you know you're
going to want it you're essentially
simulating what would happen within your
code so I've copied and pasted this in
now let's go ahead and click go and run
this and you see we get a more specific
error back so PHP is really being stupid
and it's it's not check it well it's not
being stupid but it's not doing the
legwork
for us it's not checking the Quarian and
returning back an error on this query
but what it says here is it says unknown
column article in where clause so it's
saying where article so it's in this
where clause is the problem and it's the
fact that the the field article the
column article doesn't exist and it's
actually article title so if I was to go
ahead and correct this we would return
the results that we've already seen on
our page so that's one way of going
about it
however you might not you know want to
go ahead and copy and paste and
substitute you know different variables
in the other thing that we can do which
is slightly easier we can we can look at
the query with regards to what we've
actually injected in through in terms of
variables so what we can do is we can go
ahead and we can cut this out of here we
could just say something like query
string go up here and create a new
variable called quick query query string
and what's going to happen now is it's
going to work the same way we're going
to pass the query here into here so it's
going to work exactly the same way we
still get this error okay now that I've
changed this back to our ask instead of
article title but what we can actually
do is we can go ahead and we can echo
out query string now the reason I
sometimes use this method is if I'm
passing lots of different variables into
a query you may find that some some
characters might not have been escaped
you might have say some of these sort of
back ticks in here you might have
anything that interferes with your query
and therefore just by echoing out the
string that you're passing through to
the function you can see on the page the
query string itself so when i refresh
here you can see that we've had this
this variable substituted in now if you
had say something like the and then you
had ID no let's put these in double
quotes you had that and then let's just
say you had a single quotation mark in
there and you win and refresh this you'd
know that let's just
change this to article title so our
queries now our queries now correct
however we're still getting this error
back and that's because I've included a
single quotation mark in there and
that's interfering with the outside of
here so this is beside the point really
but what I'm saying is that when you
echo out a query string like this you
can see ah that's the problem I know
that that's the problem because we're
starting this here and it's not being
escaped so for example if I was to go
ahead and escape that and refresh we
don't get this error here you can see
the errors disappeared it hasn't worked
because this string with the single
quotation mark can't be found but again
this is just you know as an example so
hopefully that makes sense you know to
go ahead and and use this process to try
and determine the cause of the error
you know echo things out it doesn't
matter it's it's now it's it's the a
good way to go about doing things so
let's go ahead and get rid of this we
leave this as it is because it will work
in the same way the other way to do this
is to use a condition at the end of your
MySQL query now MySQL query allows us to
say or Die
so we're basically saying execute this
function with this string or if
something goes wrong died and then we
can use the MySQL error function within
within died which will output this here
and what this is going to do is it's
going to give us the error back that we
saw in PHP myadmin a moment ago but it's
going to show it to us ah that it's
correct so let's go ahead and modify it
so it's not it's going to show us the
error within our page so remember that
that error that we saw earlier in PHP
myadmin we saw it up here somewhere
it's now been shown in our page so we
can now say well unknown column ask how
that make sense article you know I don't
have a field called article let me go
ahead and make make a change here and
this will also pass back any let's say
you know there was a a none escaped
quotation mark or something this might
give you a clue as to as to what you
problem is so this helps you in both
ways really so it's a really really good
way to do things but this is a really
really common error that a lot of people
come across and it's only due to the
nature of how the error is explained to
the user that it makes it really really
hard to determine what what has actually
gone wrong here because the error ends
up you know it's saying oh it's on this
line here when it's actually to do with
your query so hopefully that's clear a
few things up there we've explained
while we've looked at the error as a
whole we've explained why the error
happens because of a false value being
passed in because the query fails and
we've looked at a few methods that we
can use to try and pick out this error
and make make adjustments accordingly so
hopefully that's helped and that is the
the you know probably the most common
error that I have seen people get back
to me on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
