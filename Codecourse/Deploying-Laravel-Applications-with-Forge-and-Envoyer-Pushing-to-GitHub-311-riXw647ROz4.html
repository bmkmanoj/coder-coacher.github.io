actually push our project up to github
or whatever version control you that
you're using if you know how to do this
all of all of this video is just
covering how to push it up so feel free
to skip it if you already have an
existing project on github you can go
ahead and move on to the next video so
we have our project locally I'm
currently in the terminal within this
directory with everything that I
actually want to push up and I don't
have a repository created at the moment
so we're going to do that first
initialize get on the command line and
push everything up so let's create a new
repository on github and we'll go ahead
and call this in stick Adam II obviously
you can call yours whatever you want and
I'm gonna set this to private this
doesn't have to be a public repository
because when we authenticate with on
voya
we have access or envoy it has access to
all of our private repositories so we
can choose what we want to link in so
I'm gonna hit create repository wait for
that to finish and we're done so over on
the command line then what we want to do
is initialize a git repository and I'm
going to type git init to do that I only
had one existing but obviously this
might show something different for you
so now that we've done that then we need
to add all of our untracked files so
we're just gonna say git add and then a
dots that's added everything and we can
run git status to just see the status of
everything that we can commit here so
now we're gonna get to commit and we're
gonna give a message so I'm just gonna
say first commit like that
that's everything committed there and we
need to add the remote repository now so
we can just copy this line over on
github and we can go ahead and push that
up so we just paste that in like that
now we can go and actually push it up to
github this is obviously still empty at
the moment cuz we've not pushed anything
up so we're just gonna say git push
origin master and that last for my
username and password we just run this
again so you just enter them details in
there you might already be authenticated
with get on the command line and that's
gone ahead and push them up now so if we
go ahead and refresh on github you can
see once this is finished that all of
the files are in there and we can use
these later on
to grab with envoy and then we're going
to push them over to our laravel forge
server which is obviously a digital
ocean droplet so once you're at this
stage if you already had a git
repository up and ready to deploy then
you're pretty much ready to move on to
the next step
where we're going to talk a little bit
more about digital ocean and why we need
a digital ocean account</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
