number 15 in my video series called
introduction to code ignitor what I'll
be showing you guys in this video is the
URL helper we're going to take our nav
and we're going to make it work we're
going to take our styling and we're
going to make it external link to an
external stylesheet then we're also
going I'll show you how to like link to
images I won't actually do it but and
like script like a JavaScript just so
you get the feel and kind of like the
idea of what the workflow is like to be
linking to external resources in a
CodeIgniter application okay so let's
get started first thing we'll do is we
will Auto load that the URL helper so
what we'll do is we'll go into
application config and then open the
auto load PHP file and then down in
helpers we will load this URL helper
save it up second thing we have to do
for the URL helper is there's a little
bit more comfort go to the config.php
file in the config folder and the base
URL we actually have to set this where
we get that from is the browser
basically everything before and
including the folder that or the name of
your CodeIgniter project for example
mine is basic site and that's in my
local host so I'm going to take the
folder name and everything before that
copy it
it'll just paste it right in there you
don't need that backslash at the end I
think it puts it puts it in there for
you
but I found the only way I've done it is
without one and it works fine without it
so we'll save that up next thing we'll
do is well we'll open up our nav view
we'll start linking to different
controllers or different functions in
the controller so we'll go site
underscore nav and here we have these
empty just with the hashtags so we'll
open up our PHP tags here we go echo out
bass underscore URL
and then I'll just I'll just do it
explain after go controller name and the
and the functioning all of this
okay so what I'm doing here is I'm
linking two functions in the controller
we do the base URL then the controller
name and the function in the controller
we save this we can actually see that
I'm just going to refresh this
now our nav is actually linking properly
so if we check out the page source of
this scroll down and we can see
localhost basics sight sight and then
home so all that's doing is echoing out
echoing out it's in our base URL so you
don't have to type it every time and
then you can reference things insert
other than that like the controller and
then a function of that controller or
this next thing which is actual folders
in the root directory of your coding
matter application so in this case we
could go into say like applications the
others up delete this okay ignore that
there's three main folders in my basic
site in my basic site application which
is the code another application what we
can actually do is create more folders
in here like Styles which you saw me
delete because I messed up in a previous
try of this video and forgot to delete
it so we'll create a new folder and then
we'll actually put our style dot CSS
this will be the external stylesheet and
now if I go into my site header and copy
all of this styling information will
actually cut this so it doesn't do it
twice paste it in here I'm just going to
ctrl and shift tab to get everything all
lined up and pretty save it now if I go
back into my header site underscore
header view I'm actually just going to
load this external resources like I
would
any other external stylesheet so we'll
just go type text/css
and then let you do the trick and then
for this we open up our PHP tags again
echo with the base URL and then the
folder name which is styles and then a
file name so if we save this and we
still have styling that means it worked
and it didn't work so what went wrong
let's check out the page source it is
trying to get stuff here basically why
is the background color blue this is
maintenance
Oh a fret put Braille is he'll do
stylesheet and that should fix the
problem yes okay good so now we
officially have page linking done and
we're loading from an external style
sheet which is right here don't know why
that's open twice occasion yeah so um
the last thing I want to do is well I'll
show you how to like load in some
external scripts to go a new file or a
new file delete this new folder scripts
which is pretty common pretty common in
most applications here will create like
some test jeaious just like a really
simple alert to see if it's working and
if it's working then it will alert us
and tell us that so if I go into if you
don't have any JavaScript just just type
that I promise you it'll work next we'll
go we'll actually link to this script
source is equal to
then again our PHP tags a crow base
underscore URL scripts slash test dot J
s which is the file that we just made
no you actually don't need that anymore
it's been proven so under your fresh we
get that alert saying it's working sure
enough not cool so we are now linking to
an external stylesheet we are we have
our page linking working awesome and
it's working in every page so when I
changed the page I get that alert and
actually that's getting annoying already
so I will go in to test out yes and
remove that save it up and now it's not
doing it anymore sweet and that's it for
this video that's the URL helper it's
extremely useful because it gives you
that base URL function and you don't
have to type in your base URL every time
I guess one more one one more quick
little thing if you had images could
also link to them by creating an images
folder in that root directory you could
also like create a resources folder and
put all all of like the script styles
and images folder in that resources
folder so what a lot of people do is
what I've done in my prep in some of my
past projects but in this case I like to
just kind of keep everything just right
here and if you add images you can just
link to that images folder and then the
image inside of that and it would work
just splendidly so um that's the URL
helper thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
