just going to reiterate what we've
already learned about posting data
through using forms so the way that this
works is we're gonna go and enter our
name in here we're gonna hit the greet
me button and of course it's gonna greet
us by our name so we've already covered
this but it's just to go over like I
said what we've already learned about
forms and posting data through so let's
go ahead and build this one out okay so
we're gonna start in index dot PHP we're
not gonna write any PHP code in here
instead what we're going to do is
include a form now we've already seen
throughout the course a basic structure
here if you're not too familiar with
HTML go ahead and copy this down and of
course we can go ahead and fill the rest
of this in okay so inside of the body of
our HTML document we want to create out
a form as we've already seen and you can
see here that we need to define out an
action now you could technically post
this through to the same page and then
go ahead and pick this up in the top so
you could define out some PHP tags and
you could end a PHP tag here however
because we're working very simply we're
going to go for best practices and it's
not always a good idea to place your PHP
opening and closing tags at the top of
an HTML form alright so the action then
we're just going to choose the place
where we want this to post through to
and because we are using that post
method we're going to define out the
method here as post so inside of here
then we need a label this is going to be
for the name that we define in and of
course inside of here we can just give
this a little label in here we could say
something like your name it doesn't
really matter so in here then we have an
input here with the type of text it's
not a password it's not anything else
and of course really importantly we need
to give this a name that this is how
we're going to pick it up with PHP so
now what we want to do is very quickly
give this an ID so when we click on this
label it will auto focus on this and now
we can create our submit button so this
is gonna have a type of submit and in
here we're just going to say greet me
alright so now let's go over to the
browser and check out our form you can
see here we can enter in a name and we
can
head greet me it's obviously not in the
query string because we are posting this
through but now we can look at picking
this up in a new file so let's create
this name dot PHP font like so name dot
PHP I'm gonna go and create our PHP tag
so we can go ahead and start to output
this so again this is gonna be really
straightforward we're just gonna echo
out a string here and we're gonna say hi
there comma and then inside of our curly
braces just here we're gonna use dollar
underscore post and then we're going to
access that key within that array super
global and that is it we're pretty much
done now of course an alternative to
this would be to concatenate it on and
in this case because we are using the
post superglobal we do need in our curly
brackets so let's check this out and
then we will just slightly add to this
to redirect us back there's no need to
do this but we'll learn more about the
header function as well so let's go on
into a name hit greet me and you can see
that it greets us okay so what happens
if we wanted to redirect after we've
done this let's say we were registering
a user or logging them in of course at
the end of our script we would want to
redirect the user back again so we've
already learned about the header
function and in here we just use the
location header and we set this to where
we want to go now in our case this is
going to be index.php or more
appropriately it would be the full path
to the URL so in this case we would say
the following and then it would be
index.php so this will go ahead and echo
something out although we won't see it
because we will be immediately
redirected off so we could in fact
comment this out and go ahead and just
redirect back so let's go ahead over to
our index file enter a name in here like
so greet me and there we go we've
redirected immediately back ok so now
that we've just had a look at the header
function why don't we just check if that
value has been defined now obviously at
the moment if I was to just hit greet me
we don't see anything so let's go back
and let's go ahead and redirect the user
if they do not provide a name so we know
that we can do something like name
equals dollar underscore post
grabbing the name and then what we can
do is we can by default if it's not set
set it to not now in this case it's more
than likely that it will be set because
it's part of our form if we click click
greet me you can see that nothing really
happens here and if we do in fact change
this over to something else when I go
ahead and submit this we don't see ABC
that's because this check here is
checking if this value is set so what we
can do is we can go ahead and set this
to null just in case it hasn't been set
and down here we can create an if
statement to redirect the user if they
haven't provided a name so let's think
about how we might do this we know that
we can use empty but we might also want
to trim this like we've already learned
so let's check if name is empty and then
if that's the case let's go ahead and
use the header function and use the
location header to redirect the user
back to this page here so let's copy
this and paste it in okay so now if I go
ahead and click this you can see that we
redirected back it's very quick but we
are in fact being redirected back now
what happens if I just type a load of
spaces in here and hit greet me you can
see it's still not working so the best
thing to do in this case would be to
trim the name first and then check if
it's empty so we can do that as we've
already learned all in line we pass the
trimmed name into empty and it's a lot
more robust now so let's go ahead and
try this out again into a load of spaces
in here hit greet me and we're
redirected back into a normal name it
works and of course into nothing at all
and it still redirects back so there we
go just a very small project just to
reiterate how we go ahead and submit a
form through and a couple of things that
we can do as well just to make sure we
have the values that we need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
