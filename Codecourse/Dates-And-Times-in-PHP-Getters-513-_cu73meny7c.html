the getters that are available to us
within carbon and by getters I mean
basically being able to get certain
parts of our current date in a way that
we want so in the last video we looked
at doing something like see format and
then we could pass in Sadie to go ahead
and grab the date out or the day sorry
so that would be 14 so notice here i'm
using this static now method which is
get just getting today's date and time
so this is a little bit annoying if say
for example we just wanted to get the
day out but we don't have to do this if
we just want the day or the year or the
month hour minute second or timestamp we
can use our getters so for example the
current year is 2015 and all i need to
do here is use the year getter much
easier than using format so when i go
ahead and refresh you see 2015 we can
obviously do the same for things like
the minute so we can go ahead and see
that so you can grab parts of your date
that you need if that's cleaner in terms
of how you want to use this now we also
have interesting things like time stamp
which is really useful if you wanted to
grab the time stamp for the current date
you can see that that's been output and
obviously when we refresh you can see
that updating so even more interesting
are things like day of week let's take a
look at this if i refresh you can see to
now it just so happens that today is
Tuesday so we know that too would be
Tuesday because one would be Monday
three would be wednesday and so on so
this allows us to get the current day of
the week in terms of one through 27 now
we can also do things like day of year
which could be useful so it's currently
the 100 third day of the current year
and we can do things like quarter as
well so if we take a look at this we can
see that we're in the second
quarter so currently in April what we
can also do though is really
interestingly things like age so let's
go ahead and get rid of this whole thing
here let's say we wanted to work out a
user's age this is extremely simple all
we do is we create a new carbon instance
here we pass in a date of birth so for
example 16th of November 1989 if you
wanted to find out the age of this date
of birth so obviously this can be any
format so if you're passing it into your
application like this 1989 1116 this
will work too so let's just run with
this example so let's just do a VAR dump
on C just to make sure we understand
what we're working with here and you can
see that we've got 1989 1116 so we know
that this is correct so all I need to do
now is go ahead and echo see age so this
getter here we'll get the age of this
compared to the current date and time so
if i refresh you see 25 this in fact is
my date of birth and i am 25 so I know
that this is accurate so this will
obviously work with times as well so if
you want to be really really specific
you can go ahead and use time so it's
extremely accurate so in this video
we've looked at some of the getters
available in carbon which as you can
imagine would be really useful if you
want to work with parts of the date or
more interestingly things like the day
of the week day of the year the week of
the year as well we can use and things
like quarter and then finally we
finished off with an example age which
is probably very very useful and a cool
example of what carbon can actually do
and how powerful it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
