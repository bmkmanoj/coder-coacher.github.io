kind of rounded box-shadow hover effect
on a CSS button we're going to be
building the CSS button as you can see
at the moment but then what we'll be
doing is adding this hover effect which
gives it a rounded kind of shadow and it
makes it look a little bit less flat
when we hover over it quite a nice
effect to implement just to give the
idea that someone has actually hovered
over this and can go ahead and click on
it so we're going to start from scratch
and build this up then we'll look at the
hover effect this does work for button
elements as well as anchors this is
currently just a normal link with a
class of button so work for both form
submit elements and also just normal
links on the page right then so we're
starting out with a very basic document
layout I've only done two additional
things here I've linked in a style sheet
which lives in this CSS directory it's
just called app CSS this office you
might be different for you and I
currently have an anchor on the page
with an HR f of just a hash we're not
going anywhere and a class of button and
obviously I have my text in here so like
I said this is also going to work for
button elements in which case you can
remove the class and it will work in
just the same way but at the moment you
can see that these two things look
drastically different and our first goal
is to make them look the same and then
implement that hover effect at the
bottom that that rounded shadow so we'll
keep these two buttons here just so you
can see the differences between them as
we're adding Styles inside of this file
and then we can see what kind of
problems we come across in the
difference between a button and an
anchor so to start out I'm just going to
kind of reset my body in terms of fonts
so I'm going to set the font family to
help vesica you can obviously choose
whatever you want and we have a
sans-serif all back here I'm also going
to change the font site to one realm as
well so obviously this will depend
entirely on what you're doing or your
current existing site so to start both
anchors and buttons we obviously need to
start button and the class button this
will
and now we can start adding our styles
in so the first thing i want to do is
remove the border from this submit
button that obviously won't remove the
border from the anchor because we don't
have them in there by default but let's
go ahead and set the border width 20 for
both of these you can see that's got rid
of the border and also weirdly change
this background color to a grey which we
can fix later without generic background
color throw buttons so the next thing I
want to do is set the cursor to a
pointer the reason for this is at the
moment when I hover over a link we get
that hand icon when we hover over a
button element we don't so now you can
see once i've refreshed we have this for
the for both of them and we are going to
set the line height here to normal just
to make sure nothing dodgy happens i'm
going to set a margin on the bottom of
the button this world just for purposes
of if you're adding more elements on
your page you want to have a border just
on the bottom here now notice that for
the anchor this doesn't work and that's
because an anchor is an inline element
but we want to style this like an inline
element we wanted to sit like an inline
element but we also want to act it to
act like a block element so we can
actually style it with margins and stuff
so up here i'm going to say display
inline block so inline-block so now
you'll notice that when we hover over
the anchor we see that that border and
the same for the button as well perfect
so the next thing we want to do then is
set the position to relative i'm going
to put this at the top as well we'll see
why we're doing this a bit later on and
what we now want to do is start to do
things like set the text alignment get
rid of any text decoration for normal
links so we can set the text decoration
to none that gets rid of the underline
of this link we can set the text align
to Center and we can add some padding as
well this is going to give us that kind
of button shape that
one so what i've done here is i've added
15 pixels on the top and the bottom and
25 on the left and the right so you'll
see that that gives us a significant
area to work with we still have the
problem of first of all the font sizes
different and second of all we don't
have a unified background color here so
why don't we just set the font size now
21 REM you can obviously change this
it's I'm just playing around with this
but there we go we have similar font
sizes or the same font size and we'll go
and set the background color now you can
obviously pick a color but if you want
to follow along i'm using 009 eff which
is that nice blue color that we saw like
that so you'll also notice the problem
of the this is slightly higher if I just
zoom in you can see this is ever so
slightly higher and what we need to do
here is say vertical align middle and
that will fix that problem like so okay
so let's set the text color of both our
button and our anchor to white so now we
have a very similar-looking button for
both an anchor and a button element and
but what we also want to do is give this
a border radius just to smooth it out a
little bit and I'm going to choose 5
pixels so that's just rounded out the
edges just a bit and that will help with
that curve that we need at the bottom
when we hover over so now what we want
to do is focus on this bottom part I'm
just going to pull this down and zoom in
a bit just so we can focus on this a
little bit better so to actually achieve
this curved affect what we actually need
is a pseudo element and the pseudo
element is just basically yes an element
we set with CSS that doesn't technically
exist within your markup but it is
actually there and it assists us in
doing all sorts of things with CSS so to
do this we say button colon after and
also the button class colon after so
this is adding a pseudo element after
the element it's still going to be
within it but we'll be able to star this
as a new element so for this we're going
to set this to position absolute the
reason we chose position relative here
is so this pseudo element stays within
the button otherwise it'll float
and do all sorts of weird things and as
usual for sudo elements we set the
content to an empty space we're going to
set the top 20 here we're going to set
the right 20 going to set the bottom 20
and the left 20 as well and we're going
to give this itself a border radius of 5
pixels will see why this is in a minute
so now when we sort of do anything it's
you know it's kind of not not making any
sense it's you know it doesn't show
anything else it's not added anything to
what we wanted to do but you can see
this fills the entire section of the bus
and it fills everything and the same
with this button element as well it's
just covering everything now what this
will allow us to do is when we hover
over and let's just apply to the button
element first of all when we hover on
that button element we want to style
after so a pseudo element after and what
we do is we apply box-shadow here this
is going to be inset otherwise we're not
going to see it will fall outside of the
button we're going to set 0 on the X and
Y axis minus 3 pixels here I'm going to
have an RGB a value this is going to be
black but it's going to have a point 25
on the alpha channel so it's basically
going to be slightly transparent which
means that whatever color we have on the
button it will still show a kind of tint
of that color in the shadow that's a
really nice way to do things so now when
i refresh you can see that when I hover
over not this once we've not done that
yet when I hover over because we applied
a box shadow to that border radius to
that after pseudo element we're getting
this box shadow so let's inspect the
markup in here and just see what's going
on so we have this after pseudo element
here when I hover over you can see in
the side here if we just apply oops if
we just apply our hover here you can see
that we've got
this popping up here so when we're
hovering over we're styling the after
element here and we're applying this box
shadow if for example for this after
pseudo element we were to remove the
border radius you can see that that kind
of falls flat and sits at the bottom by
giving it the same border radius we're
effectively just masking over it like
that so that's how that works so let's
just quickly apply this to the button
class as well so we just exactly the
same thing like that and we now have we
just zoom out a little bit two buttons
that look pretty much identical with the
same hover effect so you've got them
unified across your project now so let's
take a quick final look at what happens
if we change the color because we can
see here that we have in this shadow a
slight tinge of blue the same as the
background color because it's
transparent slightly transparent so
let's change this to 72 d 771 and let's
see what happens so we've got a nice
green effect now when I hover over you
can see that this shadow has a slight
tinge of green rather than setting this
to a solid color it just means that
whatever background color you have for
any of the buttons on your page it just
means that they look pretty much
identical and stay the same have this
same effect so there we go we've created
a really nice curved hover effect for
both anchors and button elements which
obviously button elements you can use on
forms and anchors you can just use
anywhere and obviously you can extend
this functionality to add different
classes to hook in different button
colors and sizes and there you have
yourself a nice hover effect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
