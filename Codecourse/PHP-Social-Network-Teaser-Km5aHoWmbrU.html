different to the norm we're going to be
discussing a series that we currently
have in the works now first I'll explain
very briefly what this series is about
we're going to be building a social
network very similar to twitter or
facebook and we're going to build it
with PHP now we're not going to be using
laravel or symphony or do I need to
mention codeigniter instead we'll be
building our own MVC in the series on
which we will build our application now
we're going to be using solid principles
we're going to be we're going to be
testing our code where possible I'll get
into that in just a moment we're going
to be following every best practice that
we can but it will be fully functional
and it will hopefully turn out very well
so we will be covering testing in the
series mainly unit testing but once we
have the application code so that we
will also be going in to be DD if I just
go into this directory here we have one
test unfortunately we can't test every
single class in the series because as it
is the series is already going to be
massive so if we were to test every
class that's probably going to double
the amount of episodes so obviously that
isn't very practical instead we'll be
testing one or two classes I don't want
to leave testing out of the equation
altogether because it is such an
important skill that a modern PHP
developer can have so it's very
important to include that where possible
so there's just a little teaser for this
upcoming series unfortunately we don't
have a set date as to when we'll be
releasing this but you can expect it
within the next few weeks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
