this video we're going to learn how to
validate two URLs or web addresses as
they're more commonly known what we're
gonna be doing is we're gonna be popping
a invalid URL into this form and
clicking submit
we should receive an error message and
then we're gonna be placing a correct or
a valid URL into this form and then
we're gonna click Submit and if the the
URL is valid it's going to transfer us
to that URL so it's going to redirect us
to that page so let's go ahead and test
this out I'm gonna type a little rubbish
in and click Submit and you see we get
this error message back sorry not a
valid URL now if we go ahead and type in
a valid URL so I've probably already got
in here yep so www.google.com
to pH TTP or HTTPS for secure Transfer
Protocol or FTP for file transfer or to
put any of any different protocol that
you can add it will try and validate it
will just sort of look for you know this
structure and we're not gonna be using
regular expressions so we don't really
have much control over that we do in
some respects I'm not going to go into
detail but for this tutorial we're going
to be requiring the protocol in the end
on the sorry the beginning of the URL
anyway let's go ahead and click Submit
and you can see we're transferred
through to Google so in this case we've
had a look at how this works let's go
ahead and start writing the code okay so
we're over in our text editor now let's
go ahead and start to think about how
this is gonna work obviously the first
thing we need is a form so I think we
should go ahead and just build our form
first
so I'm gonna say form action equals
blank that's just going to submit this
form to the page that we're on and then
I'm going to say method equals just
spell it properly
method equals we're gonna say post
that's just gonna
whereas post data as opposed to get data
just won't appear in the URL and it'll
allow us for a lot more data not really
relevant in this tutorial but if I had
mention it
so now we'll create a form field the
first one is going to be type text this
is where the URL is going to be typed we
need to give this a value to the name
attribute so we can pick this up in PHP
as we send this back to the same page
which is obviously a PHP file so I'm
just gonna collect your out for
simplicity okay so now we need to go
ahead and create a submit button just so
we can actually submit the form so input
type equals submit so when we refresh
our page you see that we get a form here
and a button a form field here and a
submit button here so don't really do
anything at the moment because we
haven't created our PHP code up here now
the first thing we're going to do which
is important for any you know kind of
server-side processing of form data is
check that it exists first of all then
check it's not empty and then we can go
ahead and perform some kind of operation
on it ie check if it's a valid URL so
we're gonna say if there's something now
anything inside here is going to be run
if this is true and we're going to check
first of all that it's set ie has been
passed through to this script and second
of all whether or whether it's not empty
so the first thing is to use is set and
say dollar underscore post this is how
we access that posted data and we're
gonna say URL because that's the name we
gave to our piece of data here in our
form field now if that equals true that
means it is set we're gonna use and so
we're going to say and empty I'm gonna
do the same thing and check posted URL
for empty now we want that to be equal
false so now here this block will be run
if first of all we click the submit
button and that data is transferred over
and then if the form field is an empty
so quite straightforward now let's go
ahead and create a variable called URL
and just place that posted data in this
URL
variable so we have better access to it
through our script and so you're out
there now here comes the fun part of
actually validating the URL itself so we
create another if block inside of here
we need the condition so we're gonna be
using the filter var function no regular
expressions as I said earlier which can
get complicated and we're gonna pass
through the variable that we want to or
the string that we want to validate and
then we pass through almost like a
condition saying you know how do we want
this string to be validated so we're
gonna say filter validate URL okay and
if this equals true that means that the
URL is valid so we echo valid URL
otherwise echo sorry invalid rel just
because I want to be picky I'm just
gonna change that to caps now in here in
a moment we're gonna transfer the user
through to the URL not entirely
necessary but it sort of gives some kind
of purpose to this validation so let's
go ahead and test this out so I'm gonna
type load of rubbish in click Submit and
we get the form sorry we get the error
message sorry invalid URL now if I go
ahead and type in Google code at UK and
click Submit you see we get valid in the
URL so what do we want to do now that we
have a valid URL well we want to
transfer the user to that URL so we use
the header function and inside we say
location : we do a space and then we
concatenate on the URL so really it
would look like this
blah blah blah blah so we can catenate
on the URL and that will transfer our
user through to that page so let's go
ahead and just refresh tap load of
rubbish doesn't work type in google.com
UK and it transfers us over so in this
tutorial we've learned how to validate a
URL quite easy using the filter of our
function now just one last thing to
mention there are a lot of varieties of
this option that you can provide here go
over to php.net take a look
type in filter bar and you'll get a load
of options that you can use on this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
