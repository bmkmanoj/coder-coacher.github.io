and the first thing we're gonna do is
just grab the token in or authenticate
the user and then redirect them to the
intended page that they wanted to visit
but then what we're gonna do is go in
and first of all check if the token is
expired which is really important we
don't want to leave it like two weeks or
a month and then still have the link
valid and then we also want to check if
it belongs to that user by the email
that we send through in the query string
so let's go and implement our route
let's go ahead and fill in the
controller method and then we'll be good
to go so let's come over to our routes
again we need a very similar method to
this so I'm just going to duplicate this
down again this will be a get route but
this time we'll have a wildcard in here
because we're able to pass through the
actual token so let's pass that in and
then we'll go ahead and create some kind
of validate token method okay so over to
the controller let's create this method
out so public function validate token
into this we're gonna put in our request
but we are want to use route model
binding to pull the token in if you're
not sure what route model binding is it
just means that we can basically say
well we're expecting in an instance of a
user login token model here and I'm
gonna call that token and in here we
want to automatically look at that up it
just means that we don't have to do
something like token equals user login
token find by an ID or a another field
so in here then that's just to add I
dumped on the token and we'll get this
working now at the moment this isn't
going to work because this will by
default look it up by the ID so for
example we were to click on this latest
link that we were sent and of course we
pull in our model at the top first of
all so use the login token we can see no
queries that results for model so we can
see that this is in the URL but it's not
looking trying to look it out by its ID
so it's trying to get out by this here
so what we can do is over in our user
login token model we can actually set
the root key name that we expect to do
this it's as simple as saying
at root key name and then just returning
a string now in our case we're expecting
this to be pulled in by its token and
now we see the following so now we have
user login token and of course because
we have this setup so it belongs to a
user we can also grab the user from this
particular token as well so now that we
have the token let's go over to the
controller again and we want to start to
think about how we do this the first
thing I want to do is delete the token
now that might seem really strange but
with the stuff that we're doing here we
want to just make sure the token is just
as a kind of safety precaution deleted
immediately we're still going to be able
to use the model here to actually say
things like is expired later on but it
just means that as a kind of first step
we delete it that's really important so
now we just want to lock the user in and
then later we will go and just update
here to do some checks so to do this we
just say auth login we pass in the user
remember that token user and then
remember we have that request in here so
we just come over remember so we can
pass this through so all we want to do
is so request remember and that's it and
then we can redirect them so we can
return redirect to the intended page
really important because we want them to
go back to the page that they were
trying to access and that is pretty much
it let's just put in our oath facade and
we can check that this signs us in so
let's close this off and let's delete
the inbox contents come over here into
my email address send the magic link
over go over to the mailbox click on
that link and we should be signed in
there we go so as this is this isn't bad
there's nothing necessarily wrong with
this but with anything to do with
authentication we want to just add a
couple of additional checks just to see
if something has expired or using that
email that we pass in and the query
string as well we want to check the
token belongs to that user so the first
thing that we're gonna do is over on
user login token model we're gonna
implement an is expired method and this
will basically just check if the Creator
that date of the token has a difference
in second greater than a specific expiry
that we define so what I like to do is
say at the top of the model I'm gonna
create a constant here and I'm gonna say
token expiry and I'm gonna set this to
say 30 seconds and I think 30 seconds is
probably a little bit too short probably
a couple of minutes would be fine so you
could do something like 120 seconds but
we'll leave it at 30 because that means
that we can very easily just wait for 30
seconds and test that it is actually
expiring at the time that we give it so
we're going to down here go ahead and
implement this method in fact we'll do
it just up here so we're gonna say is
expired and this is really simple
because with eloquent when we use our
created out and updated out columns we
get back a carbon instance and we can
use carbons functionality to very easily
test this so we can say created at I'm
gonna say diff in seconds and the
difference in seconds is between the
time this was created and the current
time so we just used carbon now and we
want to check that that's greater than
self token expiry and that's it that
will tell us if it's expired if the time
that it was created is greater than 30
seconds so just to make sure that we
have the carbon library pulled in at the
top and if you're not familiar with the
carbon library just go ahead and check
the github link that I'll leave in the
course links and you can see and read
all about this okay so this is good
enough then to check if it's expired so
we can just very quickly implement our
if statement here again this is entirely
optional so you can leave this out we
now have control over you either do we
want this or do we not want this so
we're gonna say is expired and if it is
expired we want to redirect to a
particular page and I'm just gonna
redirect to login slash magic and let's
implement a kind of error flash
notification as well and just save that
magic link
expired and of course what we can do is
come over to resources here over to
views layouts where we created that
notification partial we can duplicate
this and go ahead and change this over
to error and the class here is danger
within bootstrap
so what we can now do is sign out go
ahead and login enter our email address
send the magic link over go over to our
mailbox but not click it for about 30
seconds so I'm just gonna literally
pause the video and wait for 30 seconds
and then we'll try and access this
okay so I've waited for about a minute
obviously if you want to test this you
can lower the expiry but when I click on
this we should now see that magic link
has expired and of course what we can
then do is just go ahead and request
another one when that comes through
click on it and again we're signed it
perfect so the next thing I want to do
is remember we have that query string in
there with the email we can just use
this as a kind of another form of
protection just against anyone trying to
basically try lots of tokens now it's
not entirely required but I like to
always add another layer of protection
in here
so what we're gonna do is something like
if not token belongs to email and we're
just gonna say request email because
remember we get that in the query string
then we're gonna do a very similar thing
here and we're just gonna redirect so
we'll implement this method in a minute
so we'll just say I don't know invalid
magic the link whatever you want to say
okay so belongs to email then that's
obviously a method that we need to
create over and I use a login token and
again it's very simple so let's create a
method here belongs to email we passed
through an email and into this we're
going to return this user so we're
checking if that token did match well
does the email address also provide
match with the link to user we're just
going to say we're email equals that
email address we're going to grab the
count and we're going to check that's
equal to 1 and what we can do is wrap
this in parentheses here and go
head and cast that to a boolean if we
want to as well so there we go what we
can do is test this out as well come
over to here go ahead and login enter
our email address hit send magic link
come over here and rather than click
this directly we're gonna go ahead and
copy the link address I'm going to
duplicate this paste it in and I'm gonna
change this to Alex at Koko's to org
and you can see we get an invalid magic
link error and to be honest that pretty
much covers it we've now gone ahead and
giving the ability to actually generate
the link we click on it we do a couple
of necessary checks and then we go ahead
and sign the user in with that
preference if they want to be remembered
redirect them to the intended page which
again is really important because they
might have tried to access a page but
being redirected to the login page and
that is pretty much it now in the next
part what we're gonna look at is
something that's not entirely necessary
but this is just generally going through
and clearing up any tokens in here that
the users haven't used because remember
when we go ahead and request a token
it's placed in here if the user never
clicks on that link maybe once a day we
want to just go through and get rid of
any expired links entirely optional but
we're going to cover that in the next
part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
