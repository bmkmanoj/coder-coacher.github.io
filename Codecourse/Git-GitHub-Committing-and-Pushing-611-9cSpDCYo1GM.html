this part but our main goal is to create
a new file with some content in and have
this push to our github repo so it
appears here now if you've used FTP
before to upload files think of it as
creating a file and then uploading using
FTP although we get we have much more
control more security and more
flexibility the first command will look
at is get status now at the moment I'm
within the hello world directory and the
one file present is the readme file that
github generated earlier
everyone gets status this gives us a
message telling us that our current
branch is up to date
now origin just means the remote
repository a master is the current
branch and we only have one
we'll look more about branch from latest
only this put you off now we also see
nothing to commit working directory
clean that's simply because we've not
added removed or modified any files so
let's dive in and create an index.html
file and see what happens when we run
this command again so there's the file
created
we'll run git status again now you can
see that we've got an untracked file and
what does this mean let's pull up the
file status life cycle on the git
website and take a look now at the
moment we have an untracked file an
untracked file is a file that hasn't
been staged and all staging means is to
tell git we want to include this file in
our next commit commits sometimes refer
to as snapshots by the way and this
terminology is often interchanged now
what we need to do is add this file
using git add so let's head back over to
here and we were going to say git add
and then the name of the file so git add
index to HTML you can also use things
like an Asterix if you want to include
everything or a folder name now let's
run git status again and see the
difference you can see that we have a
tract file now which is ready to be
committed we also have the options here
to untracked the file and if you're
wondering what head is just think of it
as a
pointing to the current branch which is
master we'll cover this later though now
that we have tracked file we can commit
now this won't add it to our repo so
what exactly is committing while
committing means taking all the changes
that we've added and recording them our
name and email address will be recorded
against each commit and you can commit
as many times as you want before you
push up to your server so let's commit
this change then we'll modify the file
and we'll commit again to see how we do
this so we'll do git commit M and we
pass the M option in here to give a
commit message now make this descriptive
of your change so it helps other people
understand what you did here so I'm
going to write created index file now
you'll see a summary of this commit
including any additions and deletions
inside of files in this case we didn't
actually add or remove any content we
only created a farm so both of these are
obviously zero we also see the name of
the current branch and the commit
checksum now let's run git status again
and you'll notice the difference there
is absolutely nothing here now our
index.html file commit is ready to be
published to our origin which is github
but we don't see it in here because we
haven't changed anything again as soon
as we add some more content this file
rename it remove it or do whatever we'll
be back to the start the ability to
stage and commit more changes now we
create commits so we can then roll back
changes if we need to now think of
commits as little steps along the way to
build something or add some more
functionality with the ability to go
back in time to a previous point now I'm
going to add some content to index to
HTML and we'll see how this affects get
status so I'm going to add hello world
in here and I'm going to save that so if
we head over to our terminal and run git
status again you can see it says we have
a modified file and these aren't added
to our necks c'mere so let's add the
file changes using git add just for the
sake of it I'm going to use an Asterix
this time now running git status again
gives us confirmation that I've changed
staged so let's commit again we'll do
git commit ml intro message so modified
or added hello world to index hit enter
and we're done you can see we've got one
insert a ssin so you're probably
wondering where you can see all of the
commits that you've currently made let's
have a look at those commits using git
log so I'm going to type git log here
you can see an initial commit here which
was the one made by github when it
created our readme file apart from that
we see the two commits that we've made
along with the details of the commits
now the git log command is extremely
powerful and can output logs in a
variety of different ways for example we
can use git log and then the pretty flag
and we can set this to one line and that
shows a compact version and a number to
limit the amount as well so we can say
something like - sorry - now if you need
more flexibility in how you output
commits go ahead and look up because
there are a ton of options available
here ok so we've made a couple of
commits the last thing we need to do is
actually push them to our repository as
you can see if we head over to github
here these changes have not been
reflected in github at all it's exactly
the same as when we started now let's
push our changes
I mentioned origin earlier which
represents the remote repository and
master is the current branch so all we
do is git push to origin we want to push
the master branch so let's hit enter so
let's go ahead and refresh you can see
that that change has been added we can
also see the commits made in this
section if we just click on this you can
click on them to find more about the
change that's been made another cool
thing is you can leave comments here and
you can also do comments on particular
lines as well so we've now successfully
pushed changes to our github repository</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
