function in this video and the first
thing that we're gonna do is build
exactly what you can see here but we're
gonna build it without the calc function
and then see how the calc function makes
this extremely easy and what's so
special about this little panel this
alert is that when I pull this in it
does have a hundred percent width but
the side stea pixel value that's really
hard to achieve because you would have
to do all sorts of things or maybe make
the container slightly bigger it can get
really confusing easily but we're gonna
look at how easy such a simple thing
like this can be made with the calc
function so let's go ahead and look at
how we traditionally might build this
and then we'll go ahead and look at some
of the calc theory and then apply it to
this so here's the document that I'm
gonna be working with just a basic dock
layout here and I've got my main dot CSS
stylesheet linked in and currently there
are no stars at all here so opening up
our browser we have absolutely nothing
at the moment so let's build the markup
for this and we'll see how this works
I'm gonna create a div with a class of
alert and in here I'm just going to type
some text so this is an alert you better
pay attention to something silly like
that okay so when we refresh now we just
have text let's talk to style this up
just to see how it would look originally
so let us target that alert we'll give
this a width of a hundred percent and we
will in fact we won't give it a margin
just yet we'll set the background color
here let's say Tomatoes it's quite nice
and we'll set the color of the text in
here to white and we'll give this some
padding as well so I'll say 20 pixels
we're also gonna do is use the box
sizing property and set this to order
box to alter the box model so the
padding doesn't affect the width or
height out of the width of this element
okay so here's our alert this looks fine
you know it's it does its job but what
we want it to do is we want to have 50
pixels on this side and then 50 pixels
on this side
exactly so how might we do this well
we've got a width of 100%
we can't exactly say margin-left 50
pixels and margin-right 50 pixels
because that will result in the
following
oops it's come off the page a little bit
everything looks a little bit messed up
here if we take a look there you've got
the you've got the fifty pixels there
but the reason this isn't working is
because the width still wants to be a
hundred percent so there's another way
that we can remedy this we can change
the percentage as instead so we could do
say two percent on the margin on the
left and two percent on the margin on
the right and then we could obviously
set this to 96 percent because obviously
to add to s 4 + 96 had 4 100 so this
works it looks like the result we
originally had but when we get down to
this size can you see that the margins
are increasing and decreasing that might
be fine for some people or some projects
but in this case I want the left and the
right to maintain a 50 pixel width while
still staying a hundred percent so there
are ways that we can combat this for
example at the moment the outer
container is the body let's just create
a container here and let's place the
alert inside of this container so we
could do something like this so we've
got our container let's apply some
styles to our container and let's set
the padding to zero zero and then we'll
change the padding here to 50 pixels so
this is top and bottom zero and left and
right 50 pixels so in this case we're
going to get something like the
following so as I pull this in we get
that 50 pixel maintained either side
okay so that's fair enough
however what we actually want to do is
we want to remove the need to rely on a
container like this and there are plenty
of other uses for the calc function here
but this is just one of the ways that it
can help so let's return to our original
so we've got a hundred percent width
here let's take a look at what the calc
function actually does first of all and
while we're doing that will actually
apply it to our width so I'm going to
keep the hundred percent for browsers
that don't support the calc function
that's really that's really important
particularly if
don't have a block-level element and you
are specifically defining something like
display:block and then you're setting
the width of the element so this time
I'm going to re-write if you like or
repeat the width property so if the calc
function here is not supported it will
revert back to the hundred-percent width
so it's important to add keep in our
fallback whether this is a percentage or
a pixel value so inside of here we can
add an expression which as you know is
just something like one pixel plus one
pixel for example so if for example I
said I want this to be 50 pixels plus 50
pixels you can imagine that the width of
the element happens to turn out a
hundred percent width and sorry a
hundred pixels width and you can see
that our hundred percent width there is
gone so that's one way we can do things
but obviously doing that is absolutely
useless because we could just do a
hundred pixels there and remove that
altogether though you no need to do this
necessarily but when percentages come
into practice this will automatically
calculate the size things should be so
for example we want the width to be a
hundred percent we know that ah we want
fifty pixels to be either side of the
element so all we need to do is minus
100 pixels off the entire width of it by
doing this as the browser is resized
this will be automatically recalculated
now at the moment that's going to look
like this we've got a little gap here
but that's a hundred percent gap sorry
100 pixel gap now we don't want this to
be the case because we want this
centered so all I need to do here is add
a margin of zero on the top and bottom
and auto on the left and right and as
you may know that will just send to that
element so we've now got this element
with a hundred percent width
ah as we drag this in it's being
automatically resized to take into
account that it needs to - a hundred
pixels off the total width which is
obviously 50 pixels either side so this
is a really easy solution to a problem
that you had had to add extra markup to
or JavaScript maybe heaven forbid so
there we go we view
the calc function to calculate the width
of an element and there are plenty more
things you can do with this so if you
are developing something and you come
across a problem like this then you know
that you can use the calc function to
solve this so that's it that's a little
example of the CSS calc function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
