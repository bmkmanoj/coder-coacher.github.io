model there's a few things that you're
going to need alongside of that first of
all it's a migration
second of all you'll probably want a
model factory for that model maybe to
just generate a load of fake data or to
use in testing now if you're not too
sure about model factories if you just
come over to the database section here
over in factories we already have a user
to find out and this uses the fatal
library to generate fake data you can
either run this to actually generate a
set number of fake users or any other
model or you can use this in your test
to quickly new up your user to test with
maybe just sign in with now we're not
going to dive too much exacts we cover
that in other courses but what we are
going to look at is some new additions
in laravel 5.5 which pretty much makes
creating all of these things together
very very easy now I'm currently working
with laravel 5.4 here and you may
already know that we can use PHP artisan
make model we can create a new model
here and we can use an M flag now what
that will do is not only create the
model for us and the scaffolding for
that it will of course create the
migrations as well so we can just start
to fill this out now I'm going to
quickly switch over to verify 5.5 and
we're going to see what else has been
added in here to make our lives a lot
easier
okay so I've just switched over to
laravel 5.5 let's delete the post model
and the post migration and let's come
over and run PHP artisan and let's just
go ahead and run this on its own for now
just to see what commands we have here
so under the make section here you'll
notice that we have a new make factory
command so let's just go ahead and take
a look at that so PHP arts and make
factory and let's go ahead and create a
post factory or in this case we can just
give the singular version of this and it
will append on factory for us so that's
going to head and created an entirely
new file which is great with this
particular factory to find out in here
so we have a post in here you could kind
of group these if you want to you know
you could stick everything in model
factory but the fact this is on the
command line of course makes it a lot
easier rather than having to coming
and copy and paste everything now let's
just go ahead and get rid of this and
come back over to the example we're
looking at earlier when we use PHP
artisan make model let's go ahead and
run the help flag on this and see what
we can do now not only can we parse the
M or migration flag in we can also pass
the F or factory flag in which will also
generate a factory for us so one simple
command we will generate the model the
migration and a model Factory as well
which is absolutely brilliant so let's
go ahead and just try this out very
quickly I'm sure you can guess exactly
how this looks but let's go ahead and
make a model here called post post the M
flag passed the F flag and it looks like
I all need to compose a dump for the
migration so we'll just kind of ignore
that for now but the post factory is in
there the post is in there and the
migration would have been created just
as a kind of sight note if you do ever
run across this error after deleting a
migration and regenerating it you just
want to either run composer dump auto
load potentially with the optimized flag
or run PHP arts and optimize class the
problem with that there okay so that is
pretty much it we have the ability now
to generate model factories on the
command line as well as alongside our
models when we generate our model and
our migration as well so really really
quick to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
