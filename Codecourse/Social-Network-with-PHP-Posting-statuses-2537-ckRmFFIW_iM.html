and we can see this form on our timeline
view we want to be able to type a status
in here click update and that's store to
our new statuses database table we're
not actually going to be displaying the
statuses on this page at the moment
because this timeline is a combination
of our own statuses and our friend
statuses as well so we need to do
something slightly different from that
rather than just output a list of our
own so the first thing that we want to
do then is create our status controller
so let's create a new file under
controllers and we'll save this out as
status controller dot PHP and we'll go
ahead and we'll copy over something like
from home
in fact we'll do it from our search
controller so we've got our request
import in there so we don't need DB just
yet at least I don't think we do and
we're gonna change this to status
controller and get rid of this method so
we now have our new controller we need
to implement our post status method so
this will be handling the validation and
posting of a status call that post
status we again have our request in here
because we're dealing with what we want
to actually deal with our request data
and we need to create a route for this
as well so we can go ahead and update
this too so down here let's create a new
common area and we'll just call this
statuses and this route is going to be a
post route because we're actually
posting a status through here and we're
just gonna say status we have an array
here with our usual items and we can
just copy and paste this again to save
time and just update these so it's now
our status controller and it's get post
so this is our method just here or post
status rather
okay so the name of this will be status
dot post and we need to authenticate so
we need to know that we are completely
authenticated here which is obvious and
what we want to do is we want to return
to our view so under resources views
timeline index want to update out form
action here to go through to that so
route status dot post and we've got a
placeholder hit our text area here with
a placeholder which we're going to
change in a moment with a name of status
let's just quickly change this now and
this is going to be getting the users
first name so we need to do is say off
user get first name or user name and
when we go and refresh here it just says
what's up Alex this will be obviously
the the signed in users name when we hit
update status we see our token mismatch
exception so obviously in this form here
we just need to add our hidden input and
we have our token and our value like
we've seen with all the other forms that
we've worked with such a session token
so now what we can do is hit update
status and oh okay so get status does
not exist I think that was post status
was nothing you know of course you
probably saw that so once more and when
we help those aces there we go so we're
through to the that method now so in
this method we need to validate we need
to make sure the status actually exists
so there's actually content in there so
we just a normal validation so this
validate passing in our request we have
our array here and our status is
required and we want it to be saying max
of a thousand obviously as always you
can change this to whatever you want
so let's kill this here and say all ok
again and obviously this isn't going to
be all okay if I click update status we
redirect
- back without errors so we need to
handle these in our form here and show
the validation errors so once again for
the form group we need to if there is an
error on this so if errors had status we
want to output space and has error and
then otherwise are just an empty string
and then down here we want our if
statement which is going to actually
output the error that's happened so we
will check inside of errors to see if
that status field has an error if that
is the case we have a span again with a
help block and we output our first error
so errors first status perfect so now
when I hit update status we get this
read and the status field is required so
that's all of our validation done what
we need to do now is actually create the
status in the database and this is
fairly straightforward what we don't
have is a model for our statuses which
we need to create and we don't have a
relationship between our user and our
statuses because a user can have many
statuses so we need to create our status
model so over in models let's create a
new file and let's call this status dot
PHP and I'm going to in fact we'll do
this from scratch you can copy over the
user one but it contains probably more
than we need so I'm gonna namespace this
under chatty models the class is status
this extends the base model so we can
work with eloquent and we need to import
that as well so we use illuminate
database eloquent and model and inside
of here we obviously need to define the
table well we don't need to do this but
in this case for the player all we do so
status is and we need to also define the
fillable fields so fillable is an array
and in this case it will be the body so
remember we have that body in there so
what we need to do is we need to modify
user model to actually go ahead and
relate basically relate this to a status
let's go up where the rest of our
relationships are we'll put this just up
here so inside of our user model the
user can have many States's we're just
gonna create a method called statuses
this is going to return a has many
relationships so this has many we define
the full name space of our model which
is chatty models status and we relate
this the foreign key is user ID so the
foreign key here relates to the users ID
okay so we now have the relationship for
our statuses inside of status we need a
relationship to relate this back to the
user as well in case for a specific
status we need to access user
information which we will be doing so
let's say public function user and we
return this belongs to so this status
belongs to chatty models user again the
foreign key here is you to ID so there
we go
we have created our relationships and
that means that now in the status
controller we can easily create a status
we don't need to use the status model to
do this we can use the currently
authenticated user to do this so we need
to do is say auth user statuses that's
our relationship method create and this
will automatically when we insert this
it will automatically fill in the user
ID for us we don't need all we need to
do is pass in the body so the body we
know that comes from the form so it's
request input status and then we can
redirect the user back home and say your
status has been posted so let's return a
redirect to the home room you could of
course use back here if you wanted to
I'm gonna say with
info status posted if you want to okay
so let's check this out let's go ahead
and say hi everyone
yeah update status okay so we've got a
import error so orth can't be found
obviously so let's go ahead and import
this facade there we go so we can use it
here let's go ahead and try this again
everyone there we go to status posted we
can't see it at the moment but if we
refresh our database table you can see
in there a user ID of one it's
automatically you know detected that and
related that to my user account and we
have the body
hello hi everyone so next we're going to
look at outputting the statuses on the
home page here and that includes our own
and our friends statuses so we're going
to be using our other browser to post
some more statuses and then we can see
them all appear in the same list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
