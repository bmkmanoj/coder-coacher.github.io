video number 17 in my new series called
introduction to coding matter what I'll
be showing you guys in this video is
I'll be showing you a contact page we're
gonna be building the contact page and
I'll be showing you the ins and outs of
the form helper I want to show you all
the functions but I'll show you a good
chunk of them and show you where to
learn the rest so let's get started
first thing we want to do is we'll go
into our site controller will actually
create this function in the in the site
controller like function contact is the
name of the page and actually we can
just copy and paste this stuff and do
like we've been doing so far it's
changed the contents undersquare about
to condemn to underscore contact as I'm
sure you would imagine next thing we
want to do is create an it create that
view so go into the views create a new
file call it content underscore contact
PHP open it up and we'll just copy and
paste this basic stuff here we'll paste
it and we can remove this stuff okay so
the first thing that we will do is we'll
actually again we'll open up our PHP
tags there you go
got this in a bit okay we will actually
load the helper so we'll go this load
helper and it's just the form he'll
agree
the reason we're actually doing it in
the view the reason we're loading the
form helper in the view is because the
form helper is only for this view and
it's actually very rare that will be or
we won't be using the form helper on say
the other two pages so it only makes
sense to load it in this one view well
for example the URL helper in HTML help
or we'd be using in all the views okay
now the first function I want show you
are the first two is the form open in
form close basically what we do is we go
form underscore open and echo form close
one more thing we have to do is we
actually have to specify in the opening
the action of where it'll be going so in
this case we're actually going to create
another function in the site controller
called a send underscore email so that's
where that's what's been going to be
that's the location for where this form
will be sending that's what I'm trying
to mumble out okay right on so now if we
actually save this we'll test to make
sure our view is working so we'll go to
the contact page and undefined variable
data and that is because we're passing
that data variable into the site into
that this view when there's no data
variable actually mean so we'll refresh
this and if we check out the page source
you can actually see where'd that go we
can go
here's that form action and it's
actually showing the URL it's taking
this from the base URL and this from
what we specified when we Pat will be
passed into the function the method it
all is always post and then also it
closes the form that's that close form
and then this is the rest of our views
so that close form is when you go
underscore form underscore close that
that's what that function is okay the
next thing is we'll actually do like say
a label and an input so we'll go back
into the content underscore contact we
put this in between as I'm sure you
would imagine so we'll do like echo form
underscore label
this the form label function it receives
two parameters the first is the what is
actually displayed like What's in
between the label tags so in this case
would be say first name or just name and
then a space and then the second
parameter it takes is the actual what
the first one is for like in the label
tag there's a four attribute in the
opening label tag and that's what this
the second parameter is so in this case
it would just be name we'll say full
name
okay now if we save that you can
actually and will refresh check out the
page source that and then will refresh
check out the page source there you can
see now there's a label being outputted
the full name is that first is that
second thing we're put we're passing in
second parameter and the first parameter
is what goes in between the label tags
just like that so that's working next we
won't next thing we want to do oh and of
course you can see right here it's
actually showing up which is perfect and
actually we want to do is the form input
form underscore input okay
now the form input function actually
receives one parameter and that is a
array what's in this array is will
actually create that right now data is
equal to array
and in here is all the attributes of
this form input form input immediately
specifies the type as text and
everything else we include in the array
that we pass interview into the function
so in this case the name of this text
would be full name the ID would be the
exact same just copy that and paste it
I'm too lazy
of course we're failing being lazy so I
have to do even more work and then the
value in this case we're just gonna
leave this blank but we will come back
to this and I'll show you how to how
this is actually very useful and we use
another function with the with the form
validation library but we're not there
yet so now if we refresh this or save it
we'll go to our our contact view save it
and there we go we actually have our
input and we'll check out the page
source and now we have that input tag
type is equal to text name full name all
these the first like I said that type
equals text is automatic in the form
underscore form underscore input and
then the rest
are the attributes that we specified in
the array that we passed in call data
okay so the next thing we want to do
I mean well do this for like save the
rest of the form will do like one more
for the email address because we'll be
needing that so what I'm gonna do is
copy this and paste it this one will be
for email and then the name will be copy
this the name will be email
I knew the email value value will be
blank for now and that I'm sure you can
imagine what it'll do the next thing
we'll do will be that the message and
for this one we want to do a text field
so echo form underscore text field I'm
sure you guys are catching on to how
this thing works now and it actually
works identically to how how inputs work
as well
in this case we will create another data
array we'll actually just copy this one
because it'll be it'll work pretty much
the exact same way and we'll try some
data and then the name will be message
ID will be message and we also want to
label for that too so we'll just copy
this one right here I'll be this again
and then message
so now if we save it and refresh our
view we have a problem and oh of course
is because text field should be text
area I've been saved a field what we
actually want is the text area obviously
so we'll save this refresh this and
there we go we got renamed email and
message at this point let's do some
quick little styling I figured out a
trick before this to do the least amount
of the least amount of actual
programming or styling just for the sake
of shortness of this video so we'll go
into our Styles here in the root
application of our the root folder of
our application go to the Styles folder
styles like CSS as we've set up earlier
and we're actually gonna create a new
give specifier called contact it'll
contain all of this except for the width
is going to be 170 instead of a thousand
and this is just like a quick little
kind of I'll show you we just need to
make sure that up here the div instead
of content just contact save it and then
I am now it actually looks half-decent
okay the next thing right is the submit
button so we'll go back into our con
our contact view and right before we
close it we want to do a form underscore
submit which is the last function I'll
show you this receives two parameters
the first is the name of it which will
be contact submit and the second is
what's the actual value in a in a submit
tag so with what actually shows up on
the web so in this case we'll just do
sin save it view it and of course you
have to echo that you have to spell echo
write save it and there we go now we
have our function and it is even calling
to the send email function in the site
if I click Submit you can see send
underscore email so that's where it's
submitting the form to and I think
that's it for this video next video I'll
be showing you guys how to actually
validate this data sent to the send
email function so stay tuned for that
