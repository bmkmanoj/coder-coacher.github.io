completely from scratch at the moment I
just have an empty directory called PHP
poll so if you're following along you
might want to create something a little
bit similar but in this video we're
going to focus just on the database just
so we can understand the relationships
between the different tables because
what we are going to be doing is storing
things in different tables and then
pulling all the information together
using MySQL joins it so obviously the
first thing to do so create a database
table for users so I'm gonna go ahead
and create a user's table here you can
obviously use anything to manage your
database I'm using sequel pro for OSX
but you can use something like PHP
myadmin if you're used to that or vicita
on the command line if that's your
preferred option either way the
structure here we're gonna have an ID
and the username this is fairly
straightforward and the username is
going to be a VAR char and let's just
say this is a 20 characters long for the
ID by the way if you are creating this
with another database administration or
a graphical user interface you're gonna
want this to be obviously an integer
you're gonna run this unsigned because
obviously we're not going below zero we
want a primary key on this and more
importantly we want an auto increment so
when we start to add fields in here
you'll notice that the ID increments
obviously if you have some kind of
authentication system that's fine you
can use that otherwise if you're just
following along the video you can just
change the ID like I did in the previous
video so we now need somewhere to store
actual polls so let's create another
table here this is just going to contain
the question and the start and end date
so for the structure we have the ID
which is exactly the same as on the
users table and here we have a question
which is a text field this is just
basically going to be the question so
what do you think of the new site you
know whatever could be anything and then
we're gonna have a start and an end date
and these are just gonna be date fields
like so like that so we're gonna insert
some dates on here and then we can
control that to just show when the poll
starts and ends and this is really
useful because it means that you can
schedule a poll for the future and then
end it maybe after a week or five days
or what
you want to do so that's the poles table
but obviously we need somewhere to store
options in fact let's create some
content here first of all just so we've
got some test data so the first question
I'm going to do is what do you think of
the new website and let's go ahead and
store that and then for the starts I'm
lucky enough to be able to do now within
sequel Pro and that's going to go ahead
and add my start and end date in there
for me obviously you can just insert
this manually you might have a date
picker if you're using PHP my admin or
something like that so the second
question let's create this now
do you like polls and we'll have a
couple of options for this but obviously
for the start and end day let's just do
now and now and obviously let's adjust
the end date as well let's set this to
the tenth month and here let's set this
to the tenth month we can play around
with that later when we're testing you
know having polls show whether they're
started right so the next thing to do is
the choices table so we are going to
create a table called polls choices so
the way this is going to work is we're
going to have a key that points back to
which poll the way of referring to or a
field rather so we're going to say poll
here as a key it's a field and we're
going to have a type of int because this
is obviously going to be 1 or 2
depending on which poll we're referring
to so for the structure here we're gonna
have ID poll and the name this is the
name of the choice this could of course
to be text but probably best as of our
chars over 255 lengths far char it
really depends in fact let's do that
analysis no real need for it to be a
text field okay so we've got an ID a
pole and a name that's all we need this
pollen strip could be shortened a little
bit because it's unlikely that you can
have a length of 11 same with this ID to
be honest and same with the others but
we'll just leave them as default for now
so poll choices let's add three choices
for this poll and three choices for this
pulse-width inserting them for ID of 1
and for ID of 2 so for the poll here
we're going to say 1
and the name well what would the first
option be we're talking about whether we
like the website or not so we're gonna
say I love it
I'm gonna create another one under polar
idea of one sorry it's alright and then
we'll have another one pol idea of one I
hate it so we've got a sort of like
middle love sorry a love middle and hate
and let's go ahead and create three
options for a pole - and this is the
question do you like poles so in this
case we're going to say I love poles and
for pole - we're gonna say they're okay
when I'm in the mood and then for two
let's say I can't stand them so we've
now got three choices for pod one and
three choices for Pole - you can
obviously add more if you want or less
you can have unlimited amount of options
here really so we now need somewhere to
store which user has chosen which option
so let's create another database table
here and we're going to call this poles
answers so this is obviously gonna have
an ID field and we're gonna have a user
because we need to identify which user
has chosen which option in this case
we're gonna refer to a specific Pole
because we want to say which pole that
they've added their answer for and what
are then going to refer to the choice so
this is going to be the ID of the choice
here so it could be 1 2 3 4 5 6 so
basically we've got a pole with many
answers sorry many choices here and then
we've got the user can make many or
create many answers I guess but one per
pole which we'll be controlling later
and yeah that's pretty much it I mean
for the answers that refers again back
to the pole and answer can have one pole
and answer can have one user and an
answer can have one choice per user so
let's actually mock in fact no we won't
mock this well we'll wait to be actually
ahead and fill in the the date of this
and we'll do that via form on the
website but you should have a good idea
now of how this all fits together and
it's important to do things like this
because we do want to design things
separately so they're a little bit more
scalable so for example you might want
to see which polls a user has completed
well that's easy
under choices sorry under answers you
know that you can see which poll a user
has chosen by grabbing all of these
records by where the user is one perhaps
and then you can see which poll they've
chosen and you can even see their choice
so this might not be the best database
design but it's certainly for a very
small little application like this will
do us just fine so let's go ahead and in
the next part we're going to start to
work on the code start to output the
polls output the choices and then allow
users to make answers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
