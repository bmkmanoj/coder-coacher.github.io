loop in PHP and we're going to be
creating a little example by looping
through numbers one to ten and then
we'll also look at how this might be
useful with other data types as well so
for example looking at not just
incrementing an integer but also looking
at perhaps looping through an array and
how we might want to do that with a for
loop just as an example to show that
this doesn't just have to be as we were
explaining it initially so let's say we
want to loop through numbers one to ten
what we do well let's define our for
loop first and look at the basic syntax
and all it is is it's the for keyword
and add brackets here now inside here we
have three different expressions we've
got an assignment we've got a comparison
then we've got an increment so this
sounds a little complicated but all
we're really doing is we're defining
where we want our variable to start we
want to define the condition of the loop
so when we want this to loop and when we
don't want it to loop and then we're
going to increment that variable or we
could in fact decrement the variable
we'll look at that as well in a moment
so let us just suppose we want a
variable X and we want that to equal one
we use a semicolon after this and then
we choose the expression that we want so
we basically want to say what X is less
than or equal to ten because we're
looping through numbers one to ten then
we want to increment X so we could say X
plus plus or we could say X equals x
plus 1 it doesn't really matter now
inside of the for loop this will run ten
times now because we want to make sure
that X is less than or equal to ten
therefore for it for the first loop X
will be one the second X will be two the
third X will be three then by the time
we get to nine nine will run ten will
still run because this evaluates to true
and then afterwards it will be 11 and
therefore it will evaluate to false so
now what we can do is say echo X and
just append a break on to there and when
we refresh we see that we get numbers
one to ten output and obviously in our
source code we have this listed
separated by breaks so what happens if
we want to say count from numbers ten to
one
so let's change this around so we want
to start X at 10 we then want to say
what X is less sorry what X is greater
than or equal to 1 we want to decrement
X and then output X so it's starting at
10 now we're basically just reversing
the way that we're working now with a
for loop we don't just have to work
exclusively with numbers like this what
we could in fact do is we could create
an array of names so let's add three
names to this list now what we could do
is we could say we want X or let's just
say we want to output the names here so
let's get rid of this get rid of this so
we can still have our counter so we
could say while x equals 1 we want to
say well X is less than or equal to in
fact let's start X at 0 because we are
using obviously a 0 index array while X
is less than or equal to the count of
names now if we think about this a
little carefully count of names will
basically return 3 when in actual fact
we only want to go from 0 to 2 just
simply because we have 0 1 2 we don't
have a 0 1 2 3 so we could either say
count names minus 1 or we could say well
we could do this a little differently
but let's keep it at that for now
and then I'm going to say X plus plus
now what I can do is I'm going to echo X
just to demonstrate this and again
append a break onto the end of this and
I'm going to go ahead and refresh we get
0 1 2 now that's expected but what we
actually maybe want to do is output Alex
Billy and then Dale so what do we do
here well we know that alex is at 0
Billy is at 1 and day is 2 so all we
need to do is we need to say names and
use our array element access to say X so
for each one then we're accessing this
elements items by 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 which is Alex
and Dale so that's how we can use four
loops to just basically increment or
decrement a number but we've also looked
at a more practical example where we
might want to use a for loop to access
for example elements of an array</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
