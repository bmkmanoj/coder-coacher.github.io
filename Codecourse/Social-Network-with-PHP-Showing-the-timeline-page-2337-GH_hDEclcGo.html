line on the home page if a user is
signed in and then we can add to this we
can update our status we can view our
friends statuses and then we can reply
and like them as well so we're going to
take this part just to set up the
template and then if the user is signed
in instead of showing this welcome page
here we'll show our timeline so if we
head over to our text editor we are
going to go over to our home controller
here and we're going to create a
condition in here to return a separate
view if the user is signed in so we need
to do is a quick check here to say if or
check we want to return a different view
that view is going to be timeline index
so let's create this view then so over
under views we'll create a new folder
called timeline and we'll create a new
file in here called timeline or index
laid PHP so again we're going to copy
the template extending from the home
page and we'll get rid of this and
inside of here you'll find markup for
this in the course downloads so if we
just paste that in but just quickly
explain what this is so we have an
overall row here we have a six column
and a another row at the bottom just
here for our timeline statuses and
essentially we have a form in here
that's going to allow us to submit a new
status or update our status so if we
just refresh now you can see well we
have an auth facade error because inside
of our home controller we're using this
or facade so if we just use that there
then we should be good
and when we're signed in we see this box
here this form here that we can update
our status from of course if we go ahead
and sign out we just see the normal home
page so let's sign in and go back to our
home page one password
and in the next part we're gonna look at
how we can type a status in here hit
update status and store that status in
the database we obviously need a
migration for statuses so let's do that
next as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
