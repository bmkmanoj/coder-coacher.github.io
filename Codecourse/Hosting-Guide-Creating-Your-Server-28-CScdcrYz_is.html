then is create a droplet and a droplet
is basically just a server it's going to
be your server that you can go ahead and
connect to you can upload your files to
and it's also what we're going to be
attaching our domain name to when we get
to that part of the series so before we
get started we need to learn a little
bit about SSH keys because to connect to
our droplet we're going to be using SSH
keys and you might be thinking well why
can't I just have a password to connect
my server where's my control panel to
manage my server well it's a little bit
different with digitalocean what we're
going to be using is we're going to be
using the command line to SSH into our
server to navigate files we will be
using FTP to upload files which we'll
look at a bit later but essentially this
is the way that you want to do things
it's going to be a lot more secure than
having just some kind of root password
so there are a couple of articles on
digitalocean I already mentioned that
the community area of this is brilliant
there's an article here you can always
just search around your favorite search
engine for these we've got one here how
to use SSH keys with digital ocean
droplets and we've got another one which
specifically relates to putty which is
for Windows now I'm on a Mac so I'm
going to be using the terminals to do
this if you're also on a Mac you can use
your terminal and just basically follow
along what I do but if you are using
Windows you're going to want to go ahead
and download puttygen
and this will allow you to generate a
public and a private key now your public
key is what you're going to be adding to
your droplet so you're going to be
storing that in your droplet and that
means that when you connect your server
you'll use your private key to
authenticate and for that you'll need to
use party
if you're using Windows and you'll need
to use the actual putty file here so the
two things that you're going to need if
you are
on Windows his posse Jen and putty but
obviously everything here is covered in
this article so do go ahead and read up
on that but otherwise we'll go ahead and
just follow along here I will be
explaining what you'll need to do with
party along the way as well so the first
thing we want to do is name our droplet
so I'm just going to call this project
can be anything you want the next thing
is selecting the size of the droplet so
I'm I'm going to be choosing the
cheapest one here and you can see the
server stats just here this should be
enough for most small projects the next
thing that we're going to do is select a
region this is basically where your
server is going to be hosted so you can
choose between three New York locations
at the time of recording three Amsterdam
then we have a few other options here so
just for the sake of it I'm going to
choose London now if you are hosting and
you know that the majority of people
that are going to be visiting your site
will be in an America then you can go
ahead and choose this Europe you can
choose these I'm just going to choose
London because it's where I'm from so
we'll ignore these available settings
we're not going to be looking too much
of these because they're a little bit
complicated for a basic hosting setup
but the next thing and probably most
important is selecting an image and when
image is just basically what's going to
be installed on your server when it's
created now by default a button 2 is
selected but you can select from these
other Linux flavors as well I'm not
going to be selecting this I'm going to
be selecting applications and the reason
for this is digitalocean provides us the
ability to automatically set up Linux
obviously Apache MySQL and PHP and for
that we choose this option here so
you're going to want to go ahead and
select this option obviously if you are
working with something else you can go
ahead and choose another image but I'm
gonna be working with PHP MySQL and
Apache we're going to be looking at
connecting to MySQL we're going to be
looking at writing some PHP
and obviously this is all hosted on
Apache so let's go down and look at
adding an SSH key the first thing we
need to do is generate an SSH key on our
computer so we can go ahead and add this
and then connect with it later
so again if you're using putty you're
going to want to use party gen to
generate your public and private key and
go ahead and check out this article if
you do get stuck but I'm going to be
using this article to guide me through
this so we need to do is create the RSA
key pair and we use the SSH key Jen
command to do this so let's go ahead and
do this now I'm gonna CD over to my SSH
directory I have a few keys in here
already but let's go ahead and just
paste this in and it asks us which file
that we want to save the key in so I'm
going to call this project and we can
choose a passphrase but I'm gonna leave
this empty so I'm going to hit enter
twice and that's gone ahead and created
my public and private key so let's clear
this and do a directory listing and you
can see here we've got Project which is
our private key
we've got project Pub which is our
public key so whichever way you're
generating this on whichever operating
system or whatever software you're using
you need the contents of your public key
to go ahead and add it here so let's
click add SSH key and we want to paste
that content in here because I'm on a
Mac I can just use the cat command to
output my public key so I'm going to go
ahead and copy this here and I'm gonna
paste that just into there so you can
add a a comment or a title to this so
I'm just gonna say project so we click
add SSH key and we're done so now we can
click create droplet and that's going to
go ahead and build our server for us so
it doesn't take too long but once it is
done we can go ahead and continue with
the rest of the stuff we need to do so
once your droplet has been built you
will see a screen like this and this is
base
your control panel if you like for your
server so I'm going to take a look
around a couple other things that we can
do here
the first thing to know is the IP
address so we have this IP address here
which we can go ahead and use to access
our server we'll be looking at that in a
bit it tells us it's active and it gives
us the stats and it also tells us that
we're using Ubuntu and we have a lamp
stack so a Linux Apache MySQL PHP that
will be pre-installed for you because we
chose that image so under power we can
power off our droplet if we want make
sure you read this because some
important information here and we also
have the power cycle as well which can
basically just do a hard reset on your
server and again this can cause data
corruption so be careful here if you do
need to do any server management you
want to do through your terminal so
we've also got access we can get direct
console access here if we want to and we
can also reset our root password we
don't need to worry about these too much
because we are using SSH keys so it's
it's not that important we can also
resize our server once we've shut it
down so you can choose a larger droplet
size so we can scale it up if we get a
lot of traffic or we need more disk
space we can take snapshots of our
server as well and then we can restore
from a snapshot this is just basically
the equivalent of a backup we also have
some settings here as well so it gives
us our IP address gateway and stuff like
that and there are a few other things
here which we don't really need to worry
about too much you can obviously rename
your droplet as well which we will be
looking at a little bit later too so we
also have graphs so we have some stats
on our server as well which can be
pretty useful and finally which you're
not going to want to do at the moment at
least is destroy your droplet so that's
pretty much the control panel you can
see there's not much here if you're used
to regular hosting this is going to be a
little bit scary because you're not
going to have things like the ability to
go ahead
do all of the things you had with your
previous control panel but don't worry
we're going to be looking at the basics
when we SSH into our server and actually
go ahead and control everything from
there this is much more flexible way of
doing things so let's head over to the
next video where we're going to look at
how we can actually connect to our
server we're going to have a good look
around there I'm going to see the kind
of things that we can do here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
