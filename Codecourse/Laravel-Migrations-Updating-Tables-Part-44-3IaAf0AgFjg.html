for creating tables we need to create
them for every change we make to our
database schema and it's just ensures
that everyone is on top of all changes
made so you'll end up with a large list
of migrations but obviously it's worth
it so let's go ahead and add a couple
more fields to our articles table I'm
going to run the PHP artisan migrate
mate command again well the migrated
command through artisan this time I'm
going to call this update articles table
that's created that migration let's go
ahead and edit this so now inside of up
we're not creating this schema what
we're doing is we're adding to it so we
say schema table we choose the table
that we want to select remember this is
different for from schema create that we
used here so we do the same thing we
pass the call back in and choose T here
as the argument we can now go ahead and
just add columns so I'm going to add an
integer column called user this is
presumably the user that's posted the
article and another integer here called
rating now in down we don't want to
remove the table instead what we want to
do is the exact opposite of what we've
done up here so we still use schema
table and choose the table that we're
modifying but this time within the
callback again passing T we say T drop
column and then we choose a comma
separated list of columns that we want
to drop in this case it's user rating so
let's run this migration and we can go
over to here to describe the articles
table
you can see that user and rating have
been added with an int type let's roll
this back as well just to make sure that
this works okay and that looks like it's
been rolled back so we can check this by
describing articles and that's done so
as well and that's it we've updated a
table using a migration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
