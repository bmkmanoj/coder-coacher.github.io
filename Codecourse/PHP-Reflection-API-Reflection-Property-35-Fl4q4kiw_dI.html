looked at reflection method now we're
going to be looking at reflection
property which I'm sure you couldn't
imagine is very similar so if we just
change these variables and delete all of
this for now now what we need to do is
replace this which was the method name
here with a property name which in this
case is going to be data and I just
inserted some placeholder data so now
what we can do is we can print either
class methods to get a list and as you
can see there's not as many as with
reflection method but they're still all
very helpful nonetheless so let's play
around with this let's say echo RP get
name and we're going to get data since
that's the name of the property we're
going to skip this one because this is a
little bit more complicated but I'll
look at that later same with the same
goes with this is public obviously this
property in particular is private is
protected sorry so we're not going to
get anything here if we were to change
it to is protected we're going to get
one which means true is static obviously
that's not static but if we were to
change it like the cell refresh and we
get true let's remove that what else do
we have well that's about it that we
need to know now what we're going to
look at is how we can get the value now
you'll see that if I just get value and
would probably need to print our this
because it's actually an array we're
going to get a fatal error reflection
exception with message cannot access
non-public member acme user data which
means that the the visibility of the
property is in public so we can actually
fix this we can say our P set accessible
the true and now you'll see that we get
another error and this is because gate
value expects one parameter just like
with our reflection method we need to
pass in an object of the
that we're trying to really have
retrieve property from so let's do that
now you say whose new Acme user and
we'll just pass this in down here and
we'll just echo pre to make thin slits
on niether and as you can see we get all
of this data that we said in our user
