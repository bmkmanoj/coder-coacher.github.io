now gonna look at implementing alerts
which will happen when a user performs a
particular action we're gonna just show
little alert at the top here we're going
to keep this really simple so you can
implement a more complex solution or
something much prettier later on so to
start out then what we want to do is
have our home controller open because
we'll just go ahead and redirect the
user off somewhere in fact we could
probably do this within our routes file
so if we just open up our routes file
here we can create a test route for this
anyway under our default navigation or
our default template rather we want to
include this partial so we won't want to
create a new partial under partials
where we created our navigation I'm
gonna call this alert stop load PHP so
within here then we're going to use
blade obviously we're gonna have a blade
control structure which is an if
statement and we're checking for it if a
session has a key called info and if
that's the case we want to output some
markup with a class of an alert and
alert info so you want to write this out
this is just basic bootstrap markup you
can head over to the documentation to
find out the different classes that you
can give this to all to the appearance
I'm also going to have a roll of alert
as bootstrap recommends so now what we
do is inside of here we're gonna say
session get info so over on our base
template we can include this within our
container we don't want it to float up
by the navigation so we're going to
include templates partials alerts and if
we go ahead and refresh we obviously
won't see anything because there's no
info in our session or info key so it
doesn't show anything at the moment but
now what we can do is over in our routes
file we can just create a test route to
see how this works
so if we say alert for example we're
going to have just a callback here and
we are going to return redirect to a
route which is called hi
and we're going to say with info you
have signed up so what we'll do now is
when we go over to alert that brings us
back to the home page and it outputs
that alert
so it's as simple as that very basic but
it's enough for us to get going so we
can flash a message to a user it's also
worth noting that when we refresh this
page obviously that message will go
because it's only temporarily holding a
session</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
