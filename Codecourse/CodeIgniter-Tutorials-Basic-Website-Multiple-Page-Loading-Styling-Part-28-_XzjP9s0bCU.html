thirteen and my new series called an
introduction recording matter what I'll
be showing you guys in this video is
multiple page loading and we'll be
styling our butt-ugly website so far and
we'll create the whole the about page
too so let's get started first thing we
want to do is I'm actually going to add
a little bit more content in here just
make it look more like a website and
stuff what I'll do is go to alarm - if
some dot / Bank DK or any other lorem
ipsum generator that you prefer just
paste that into my P tags there that I
just created save it up check it out
looks good okay next thing styling for
now I'm just going to do this in the
header tag and then eventually I'll
migrate this to a external stylesheet
once I show you guys the URL helper so
um I've actually kind of pre styled this
so I kind of know how I want it to look
look still like crap but not as crappy
margin:0 0 okay
just like a light gray or something like
that you will just make sure and already
chosen font I think it's funny
Ariel you can skip this by the way if
you're not interested in styling this
this is just uh so that I don't go crazy
looking at unstyled stuff
let's take a look at that so far okay
get in there you specify a width if
we're centering it with margin Otto so
like thousand pixels wide is a pretty
good another light gray color height 15
pixels adding of 20 pixels check that
out yeah that'll be good you sneak to do
some kind of like ul
laughter Oh pick saloons start it's
getting there and then display:inline
because we want our now to look karat
absolute text editor all right let's do
like a:hover
you guys like pseudo commands however
nav merry over color green so I can't
think of any cool sweet take that up I'm
just two more things now we'll just go
content
thousand pixels
cool margin:0 auto sweet looking good
and the 400
Center it up some paddock 20 pixels
sweet and then change the color because
I would like it to be a little more
faded so it looks nice get that and like
some middle gray like that yeah so it's
a little bit more faded cool so here
will be our still but ugly but semi
functional website that felt like it
took forever to type so I'm going to
hurry up really quick to get these
multiple multiple views going we learned
how to load multiple views in the in the
first tutorials what we'll do here is
set up some controllers first of all
the about an homepage next thing I will
do is yeah I'll teach you guys the way
loading multiple views works is right
now I'm just loading this whole chunk of
HTML at the exact same time when you
load different views it's like having
different includes you can include
different types of HTML in your project
so I'll just go ahead and show you what
I'm going to do is select all of this
stuff I'm going to cut it so ctrl X I'm
going to actually go into my views here
create a new view I'll call it site
underscore header about PHP actually
I'm going to copy it so we can keep this
for reference control C and I'll just
paste that in there it's good I'll save
it up and let's keep going next if I
take the body the top part of the body
and then just the up to the nav I'll
copy this I'll create another file
called site underscoring now about PHP
I'll print up and paste that in there
save it next the content div now I'm
going to name this a little bit
differently because you're catching my
drift is the nav the header and the
footer are all going to be the same but
the content sections will be different
so content home.php
save it and then just grab the footer
and the rest of the body HTML tags copy
that and then a new file will go cite
underscore footer
dot PHP open it up paste it save it now
if I go into my site controller we know
how to load one view loading multiple
views is pretty straightforward you then
we'll go site underscore header both
sides underscore now by the way I'm just
pressing ctrl D it the command is the
exact same in PHP Edie and notepad plus
plus maybe not
whatever text editor you're using if not
you can just copy and paste the lines or
type it over whatever you want I typed
home for the home page and then it's
more site underscore footer then instead
of loading this default view I'm
actually going to load the home function
save it up and now when I go to my basic
site
it actually looks exactly the same so we
can't tell but because there's no errors
and we're actually loading this
controller we know that it works just to
test this out
why don't we copy all of this put it in
here and then just change this to
content to underscore about and we'll
actually create that right now we'll go
to the content home copy everything in
here control a/c create a new file
called Content underscore about HP paste
it in there and then we'll just change
them this content check out my awesome
business save it now if I go to the
about page the only way we can really
check that by going site slash about and
sure enough we're actually loading all
of these multiple views from the
controller and it's actually it makes a
lot more efficient so if you want to
change something like saying the header
or load another like JavaScript library
all you have to do is go into the header
file it works awesome that's it for this
