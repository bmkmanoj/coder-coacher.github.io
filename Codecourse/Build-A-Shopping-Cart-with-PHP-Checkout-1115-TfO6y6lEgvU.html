up that's the most complicated part
actually checking out is going to be
super simple and of course integrating
Braintree is gonna be even more simple
so let's start by when we press the
place order button as long as we've got
all the right information in here what
we want to do is first of all create an
order we want to create the customer and
we want to create an address and we want
to link these together the reason this
is going to be so simple is that we're
using eloquent so the relationships that
we set up are going to work really
nicely so what we want to do before we
actually focus on anything within here
or release within our order controller
we want to set up some more models so we
need a model remember to represent our
order our customer our address and
eventually our payment but we're gonna
get to that when we actually process
payments so for the models let's first
of all create an order model so let's
say order dot PHP and I guess what we
can do is just take this over from
product just so we can basically just
have the outline of it so inside of here
then let's just change this to order and
what we need to do within our order well
when we create an order we need to
define the fillable columns so otherwise
we're going to get a little error so
inside of here we wanted to find what
we're going to fill this is going to be
on hash a total whether it's paid or not
and the address ID so that's what we
need to do in here for now let's create
our other models and then we'll think
about the relationships between the
models so we have a customer model as
well so let's just create this now so
customer PHP and this will be customer
and of course the fields here that we
insert are going to be a little bit
different so this is going to be an
email and a name and if you're wondering
if you've not worked that eloquent
before the created at and updated at
dates that we have here will it
automatically be filled that's why we
create them so lastly we have a dress
model so let's just create this now and
we will set this up very quickly
so for our dress then let's just change
this over as well we have what we want
to insert an address one that's the
first address line we have an address
line two we have a city and we have a
postal code just here so we have our
models set up and we have the
relationship set up as well now what we
want to do is go and add these to our
container you don't need to do this
because technically what you can do is
create records just using the model
itself but we'll add them to our
container so we can inject them in it
might help later on but of course this
is completely optional so let's go down
and just start to add these in under
here then so we have an order class
let's just pull this in name space of it
and we will have here our container
pulling in and then we will just return
a new order so we have that available
and we can just basically copy this down
do the same for customer and address and
then we'll pull the namespaces in at the
top so this will return new customer
model and then the address will return
and a new address model let's just pull
these in up here then so use cart models
order we have used cart models customer
and we have our address so now that
we've got these in here we're gonna look
at the relationships and then when we
actually use these we'll actually see
and refer back to why we created these
relationships so if we think about our
order first of all let's just go over to
the database we know that as part of
this we have an address ID so we know
that an an address needs to be attached
to this order we know that a customer
needs to be attached to this order as
well now we're also going to have a
payment attached to this order as well
but in this case we can just leave it
just for now and the way that a payment
is attached just in case you're
wondering it's over in the payments
table we have this relating to an order
ID we don't say payment ID and here just
gonna get a little bit confusing so what
we can do them
is inside of our order model we're going
to create an eloquent relationship now
so address and this is really
straightforward we're just gonna say
this belongs to and address like so and
up here we can just use this so use cart
models address now we don't need to do
this because it's in the same folder but
I always like to pull these in anyway
just to make just to make it look like
we have it in there if you change the
namespace it'll be a little bit easier
to update so what we also have is
product related to this order now this
is slightly different because this is
going to use our intermediary table here
so the relationships gonna look slightly
different but bear with me and we'll see
how this works a bit later on so we have
products here and inside of here we're
gonna say this belongs to many and we're
gonna say it belongs to products so
basically from this orders products
table we will actually get through all
of the products attached that auto
related by ID and what we also want to
do is pull in the quantity here like so
because that's from the pivot table so
essentially this is our pivot table this
is our orders table this is our products
table but we have orders and products
related and this is how this
relationship works just here and if you
are confused about this you can read
more about this on the laravel
documentation so now that we have an
address and products attached to an
order what about the other models we've
created so what about a customer what
are the relationships we need to set up
here well if we open up our database we
know that a customer can have many
orders because on each order we have a
customer ID so inside of here we can
create an orders relationship and this
might make sense if you would have some
kind of dashboard for a user you could
list out all of their orders and the
values and you should be able to do that
by the end of the series knowing what
you know so we say has many because a
user has many orders and we just say
what a class again we can just say use
cart models order just there and over in
order as well we can just put in our
product model even though like I said we
don't need to sits in the same directory
so we now have the customer who has many
orders that's all we need to do within
there now with an address this is also
related to an order and you can update
this later so you could change this
around so you could say for example
customers and then address ID and you
could update the address ID we're gonna
keep things nice and simple because as
long as we know where to ship an order
it doesn't really matter too much and
for this we are gonna say return this
has many order class we might not end up
using this relationship but we'll see
when we actually get to creating one of
our data how easy this all fits together
so the last thing that we want to do and
actually I think that is it so we've got
our address custom an order
relationships I think that will be
enough I don't think we need to add
anything else to our product you know in
order to do this in actual fact we might
be able to relate our order that might
make a little bit more sense so we're
gonna say order and the reason we're
doing this actually is because we have a
relationship on our order to our
products we need to do a product to
order relationship as well so we're
gonna say it belongs to many order class
with that pivot table so orders products
and then in here we're gonna say with
pivot quantity okay so let's just pull
this in at the top
cart models order and I think we're
pretty much done so let us now once
we've done they're modeled well now that
we've done their models let's focus on
actually creating the order down here
now the first thing I want to do is just
generate an order ID and to do this I'm
going to be using the random bytes PHP 7
function if you're not working with PHP
7 there are other ways to do this as
well so go ahead and look these up in
the PHP manual and I'm gonna say binary
to hex
so I have a nice order half here so the
first thing that want to do is create a
customer but we only want to create a
customer if their email and name don't
match so we don't want to keep creating
customers with the same email eventually
you might want them to log in or
whatever you want to do so we're gonna
say customer and here we're gonna say
customer first or create now we don't
actually have customer injected into
here so why don't we do this now
customer like so and of course we need
to pull this up at the top as well like
that and here we're gonna say first or
create and we just need to insert the
email and the name now simple as that so
we just say email and we say request get
per am female and then we do the same
for the user's name so name like that
so what we're going to do is run this
now and test it so we're going to keep
filling this filled out but essentially
we'll you know we'll be able to see the
data in the database and in fact what we
can actually do is just comment our
validation so we can just enter anything
in here so let me enter my email address
and my name and let's click place order
so there we go
if we go over to our customers table now
you can see that we have that record in
there great so we've created a customer
now if I submit this form again notice
that this doesn't duplicate this record
that's important because we only ever
want to uniquely identify a user by
their email so now that we have a
customer let's just go and delete this
so we can see it all happening again
we need to create an address so here
we're going to say address first or
create again and of course what we need
to do is pull in our dress model here of
course you can pull this in the
constructor level or what you can do is
if you prefer you can say this customer
like so and you don't even have to pull
this in here then you can just pull it
in at the top of your file so the
address then let's just pull this in
here as well
like so and we will say address first or
create we know that we have an address
line one so this comes from request get
per am address one we have the same
thing for the address line 2 as well and
we have the city if I let's just
duplicate this down just save a bit of
time City and we have the postal code as
well so postal code done so now we can
test that this works as well and then we
can get on to creating the actual order
in the database so let's go and just
fill out the form let's just go back so
when it enter all of this information
just in here
place that order and now what we should
see is our customer and our address
great so because we have these here we
can relate the address to an order later
when we actually create the order so
let's go and create this now but what
we're going to do is we're gonna attach
this order to a customer so we don't
actually need to say something like
order create all we need to do is save
order equals customer orders create so
we're creating an order on that customer
what that will do is it will
automatically fill in the customer ID
for us so it'll automatically fill in
this and then we can relate the address
to it in a moment
so again in fact let's just keep our
customer and our address in there
because we know that all this works and
we're only gonna be creating at once
so for an order then we want to set a
hash that's just the hash that we
generated up there a minute ago
we want to set paid to false by default
and we want to set the total to this
basket subtotal and again we're gonna
hard-coded in the currency but if you in
the shipping but if you are working with
shipping in this if you decide to add it
in afterwards then you want to update
this to grab what the chosen shipping is
so now we're gonna say address which is
the address we created here order and
we're going to associate that with that
order so that's all we're doing there
so let's check this out and let's create
an order based on our form that we've
submitted I'm just going to refresh this
because I don't want to keep having to
fill in the form and it looks like we
have a problem here so let's have a look
so address order okay so if we go over
to address this has many order and in
actual fact I think what we can do is to
just to simplify this a little bit let's
go on to the address and get rid of this
relationship because we don't really
need it in there and what we can do is
just manually add the address ID in just
here so we'll just save another query we
just say address ID because this will
return either the first record based on
this data or the newly created address
and just to fix this up we need to go
over to order o we already have our
address ID in s that's fine so now let's
just submit the form again and it looks
like that
Harrow was here I should have checked
more carefully either way
we simplified the address relating and
we're now saying orders on that customer
so when I refreshed now what that will
have done is it will have created it
wouldn't have created another address
because we've already got that but it
would have created this order with the
total the address ID the customer ID and
obviously it's not paid yet so we can
mark that as paid when we have a
successful payment through Braintree ok
so once we've got to this point then we
want to save all of the product that we
have in our basket to this order
remember at the moment we've created an
order but we don't have any products
related to that order so this is
slightly different what we need to do is
save many of these but we need to grab
the quantities as well because we want
to insert these alongside these in this
pivot table so to do this then to
normally do this what we would do is say
order product save many and then we
would choose all of the items so we're
just gonna say this basket all that will
basically take all of the items from our
basket and it will insert them but then
as this one we want to insert the
quantity so let's say we had three items
in our basket with one quantity five and
three well we need some way to get these
so we're gonna create a method just down
here and this is going to be called get
quantities so all this will do is take
in a load of items it will have an empty
array of quantities just here just
change this to quantities and we will go
through each of these items might be a
slightly cleaner way to do this but
items as item and then for the
quantities we want to append on quantity
and then item quantity
in actual fact if laravel was slightly
different and I'll show you this in just
a moment we'll just return them
quantities so now we're gonna have a
list of quantities and we're gonna have
this column here with the value now the
reason that we actually have to do this
is because just here we can't do this we
can't say 1 5 &amp;amp; 3 because we don't have
a column that we're inserting into what
it actually requires is for you to say
quantity 1 and then the same thing here
as well so all we're doing is we're just
building this up like this so it can be
inserted and use this and the reason
that we do this rather than loop and
insert the quantity each time is because
we're just creating more queries then so
we want to keep this as light as
possible so now that we've got that done
then in here we just want to say this
get quantities and we want to say this
basket all now another thing to note and
I'll let you go ahead and refactor this
is that we are calling this basket all
twice here while that's doing is it's
creating two queries so remember inside
of our basket what we're actually doing
is making a database call we're only
doing one query so it's not really bad
but essentially here what we could do is
at the top of the file just say
something like all items and then set
that to this basket all and then go
ahead and pass in all items here and all
items here but I'm gonna leave it for
now and I'll let you go ahead and sort
that out and refactor that so now that
we've done this then we're essentially
done with actually creating an order
down here obviously we need to sort our
payment we need to make a charge on
Braintree and we're gonna look at event
handling as well and updating things
based on the event so let's just test
this out once more we'll leave the
customer and the address in there but
I'm gonna go ahead and get rid of this
order and what we should now see is an
order created and products related to
that order so let's refresh and it looks
like we have a problem so save many on
null and let's just have a little look
and it might be a problem that order
models so we have product here belongs
to many orders products with pivot
quantity and the reason this isn't what
thing is we're not actually returning
this so you might have noticed that as
well so let's just make sure then let's
just go and get rid of this order if
it's been created let's give this a
refresh so it looks like we have another
error unknown : quantity now the reason
that this is happening is over on our
product model what we actually need to
do up here is set the fact that we don't
insert on this so remember we are adding
this in on this model when we are you
know getting all items of our car so now
when i refresh this should be fine so
what I would have done is create two
orders now because we had a mistake at
the start so we can get rid of this
order and focus on ID of four so this
has got all the right information in
andover in orders products you can see
that order ID 4 has Product ID of 1 and
3 we had three of this item in one of
this item I'm hoping that's the case and
it's just a coincidence that these two
match up let's just go back to our cart
and it's just C so we had one of this
and three of this this
I'm guessing happens to have the ID of
one and this happens to have the ID of
three so that is a coincidence let's
just bump this up to five and go ahead
and check out so I'll just quickly enter
all this information here
and then we can go ahead and click on
place order that should have created a
new order five and in here now we have
order idea of five we have five of ID of
one and three of ID of three - yeah this
is a working so that is pretty much here
we have finished off our order
controller in terms of actually creating
the order so we're actually checking out
now creating this in the database but of
course we're not taking any payment so
in the next part we're gonna look at the
Braintree drop in UI which we saw in the
introduction video it's a really nice
way to just get a form in there have
everything validated and then of course
receive a token that from the backend we
can go ahead and charge that payment
method with so let's jump over and deal
with payments with Braintree next a big
shout out to our friends at Braintree
