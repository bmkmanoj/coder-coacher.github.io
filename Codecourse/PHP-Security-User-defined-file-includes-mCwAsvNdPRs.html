content determined by some kind of user
submitted value and by that I mean for
example I want to show the page cat and
I have a query string parameter here
cats or I can show dogs and that
basically dynamically gives me a page
based on what I have entered now there
is a massive problem with this depending
on the implementation but we're going to
look a common implementation of doing
this to dynamically show pages within
some kind of template so let's head over
to the code and we'll see how this is
currently working now at the top here
I've just got an if statement it's
checking if that show inside of the get
super global is set if it's not we just
kill the page then all we do is we plug
that value from the super global array
that gets super global and we now have
that value to show and then what we're
doing is we're creating a Content
variable we're using the PHP file get
contents function to basically go into
the content directory which is over here
and it's going to substitute in the
value provided by the user and then it's
going to append on a PHP extension so if
we for example in this case had dogs we
would end up with content slash dogs PHP
which exists here so we can then go
ahead and show it to the user
now there's a massive problem with doing
this and essentially we're going to
demonstrate how we can get access to
some kind of private file using this
method so inside of this kind of mock
application structure I have I have an
app folder which is outside of the
content directory it's important to know
and we have DB dot PHP this is just a
database connection much that you'd find
in any application and it obviously
contains sensitive information now you
might be thinking well over on index dot
PHP because I'm going into the content
directory and I'm appending on a PHP
extension here with the value that's
provided by the user there's no problem
here we're inside of the content
directory we're safe as
as I don't put anything that shouldn't
be seen in the content directory then
we're okay but that is not the case
because obviously with file get contents
it works with traversing directories as
well and that includes going back a
directory so what we can actually do
here is let's echo out or kill this show
value so you can see here that we get
dogs in fact let's do that on this so
let's substitute that in there and there
we go so you've got contents dogs PHP
now what happens if I do two dots and
back a directory and then I go into app
and I type DB not with the PHP extension
just DB what that's done is PHP will now
require in content back a directory so
if we look at our directory structure
we're coming out into this main security
directory then we're going back into the
app directory so this one and then we
are showing DB we're appending on a PHP
extension I'll assume for the case of
working with this you'll be using a PHP
extension for a database include and
there's nothing wrong with doing that
but now what we're doing is this is the
file path for including so let's get rid
of this die here and we'll see what
happens well it looks like nothing has
happened but if we go ahead and view the
page source you can actually see here
that we have a PHP tag we have that full
source code because what we're actually
doing with the Fargate content is we're
reading the contents of a file this
won't be protected your users will be
able to see or your attacker will be
able to see this content because it's
the actual contents of the file now you
might be thinking well isn't it the case
that the user could then just access
this anyway well really these kind of
files should be outside of the publicly
accessible directory but anyway even if
we were to go over to app DB dot PHP
obviously viewing the page source we
don't see anything because that file has
been compiled on the server side by PHP
and we don't actually see the contents
of the file so you might be thinking
well how can I use it maybe a different
function or a different method to
actually grow
content dynamically like this now my
strong advice would be just don't do
this asshole it's not worth risking
using any other method trying to kind of
sanitize this data in order to do this
what you're doing here is you have a
line of code which could potentially
reveal any file contents on yours on
first of all in your project let alone
your server so if you do absolutely need
to use this method I'm going to show you
a way that you can actually detect
whether you have some content in there
that is allowed which we need to keep
up-to-date however like I said I
recommend you don't do this at all so
let's take a look at how we might kind
of filter this out we know that we have
two files in here cats and dogs and what
we really need to do is go ahead and
create some kind of allowed array so if
we create an array here with cats and a
value dogs we know that the value that
the user submits so let's go back to our
show equals and we'll go ahead and put
cats in there we know that it can either
be the string cats or the string dogs so
all we need to do here is when we're
grabbing the content we just need to use
the in array function and I'm using a
ternary operator here so if it's in a
race or if show is in the allowed array
we want to grab the file contents
otherwise we just want an empty string
so that's all this line does just here
and that means that cats will work that
means that dogs will work it means that
if we provide any other characters like
a space that won't work and of course if
we do something like forward slash app
DB that again will not work we'll just
get an empty string so although this is
one way that you could filter out the
content dynamically provided by a user
in order to include a file it's always a
good idea to just not implement this at
all there are plenty of other ways to do
this including just creating a new file
to show this content using proper
templating so you don't have to get
around templating by dynamically
including content from include files and
of course you
always rooting if you're working inside
of a framework so there's a little
advice on including files based on user
provided content</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
