neat is a is the lightweight semantic
grid framework for sass so it's really
easy to use
I mean when it says semantic it's saying
that it allows you not to have you know
all of these bloated class heavy divs
wrapping everything around just to get
things lined up so the example here is
they have section aside article inside
of a section so for the section they say
include the outer container just make
that to contain a wrapper and then for
the aside make it three columns and make
the article nine columns wide so this
will be three columns that's the science
and the article and that columns line
it's pretty easy let me show you how to
install bourbon I'm gonna jump back over
to my terminal here and remember that
I'm in CSS but I've added these I've
added these really specific directories
so on a CD into zero dot plots and I'm
in plugins and I want to I want to do a
pseudo gym install great and now that
I'm in plugins I can install it so I say
neat install and when I go over to clog
ins I can see that neat is installed I
need to go into my directory and say
neat neat cool neat is really cool let's
go to back to our example and see what
we got going on here
Wow let's take a home that's house let's
take these boxes and I want to make this
the container now what we call it outer
container and then I want to take my
boxes and I want to say that they should
be
span columns let's look at the jocks
here span columns yeah they should be
span the column they should each be four
because there's 300 no there's I don't
know how many other tighter
1 2 3 4 5 let's make 4 and you can spin
column 3 because 3 times 4 is 12 and
we're up 12 concrete great so we have a
4 columns here the width in which we
could just you know put any cut type of
junk we want like you do with columns
now one of the cool things about me is
that they have this thing let's go into
settings a visual grid they have this
thing called the visual grid this is
cool well turn this on my typing true
here and when i refresh i can see that
there's this awesome visual grid that
I'm working with so if I put this
paragraph here into an outer container I
wouldn't normally do like this but
whatever I could see that it's lining up
nicely with these you know this visual
grid here and I can even take this
visual grid and make it go to the front
and change its color to light blue so
yeah that's awesome huh so it's a lot of
awesome tools built right into bourbon
neat and it helps you you know have a
nice semantic good from the get-go
without having to go into my markup look
at my markup nothing has changed it's
really semantic and easy to read
especially when you're showing it to
other people and you know you have other
developers working with you and it's a
really nice way to keep things clean and
easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
