going to be creating the database table
that stores the data for our users which
is obviously the initial step that we
take to work out which data that we want
to capture from my users the data that
we want to store and then eventually the
data that we're going to give back out
to them in this part we're just going to
be creating the users table and this is
going to store the registered accounts
later on we'll we'll add more tables
that deal with different things but in
this part we're just going to focus on
the users table itself and that will
allow us to create our overall login and
register system so I've already created
the database table and I've just called
this lr4 login on register you know you
can call your database table anything
you like usually relating to your site
in some way but I'm going to go ahead
now and create a table on this database
so I'm using phpMyAdmin which is an
interface to our MySQL server and our
databases and this is available in the
browser so you can go ahead and download
this and it's available with pre made up
packages like example WAMP anything like
that okay so let's go ahead and create
this table so I'm going to call this
users now the number of columns I know
because I've already planned this out
and it's going to be seven but if you
don't know that's fine we can just go
and put in any value here and we can add
fields as we go but I know that it's
seven so I'm going to choose seven you
can see that just down here we can all
add one or however many columns on here
so that's not a problem just pop in a
number if you're not too sure you might
choose to store more data as well than I
am
you might choose to expand your
registration page to let your users say
ask if they want to sign up for mailing
lists or you want to capture that might
want to capture their gender anything
like that okay so the first field that
we're going to create is a will be the
primary key and this will identify the
users uniquely and also provide us with
an index for our table so this is going
to be user underscore ID now the type is
going to mean in
this just means it's a whole number
we're never going to have point values
in here the others we're going to look
at our varchar' and text eventually but
for now we you know really don't worry
too much about will these mean I'll try
and explain as I go along
so if we scroll all the way along I I
stands for Auto increment you can see
that it's just popped up there's a
little tooltip we want to check this
essentially what this means is this
value will increment for every record
that we add so the first user set Alex
is one this field will automatically
inject the value one if we create
another record say Billy he'll be two
Dale three four and so on and the index
here is primary so we always have a
primary key for a table to keep an index
okay so the next one is straightforward
it's user name we obviously don't this
to be a number we don't use this to be
signing up with numbers for username so
we want a varchar which means variable
characters and we have to provide a
length here so I'm just going to go
ahead and say 32 will incorporate the
length checking into the backend of our
code eventually we also want a password
and I'm going to set this again to a
varchar' and this is going to be 32 now
we're going to we're going to be storing
this as an encrypted string so bear this
in mind will initially be using md5
which equates to a 32 character string
however long the password is of the user
so 35 and upwards
you'll be safe but this may need a bit
of tinkering around with if you're using
different encryption methods obviously
md5 isn't too secure but we're just
going to be using it for for simplicity
for now okay so we want to store the
users first name and we also want to use
this store the users last name and these
will both be variable characters again
I'm just going to set these to 32 you
might want to increase this obviously as
you go along feel free email I'm going
to set to a varchar and I'm going to set
it to a very strange number 1024 or 1025
either one is the maximum
characters for an email address I always
do this out of habit but it's entirely
up to you you can choose a shorter value
because it's unlikely to be but I always
like to just put it in that
and lastly active and this is going to
be the state of the users account
initially what we're going to do is
we're going to create the login and
register system without email activation
then we're going to go ahead and
incorporate email activation into the
backend and an ask users to activate
their account by email now when a user
initially registers this int is going to
be set to zero to mean that they haven't
activated their account so if we look at
the top you can see our table labels
here you can see that if we scroll where
is it out default here so this default
value here we can set as defined and
then choose a value and what I'm going
to do is for active I'm going to choose
as defined and zero so by default when
we insert a new record we don't need to
specify this value it will automatically
be zero and then thus requiring the user
to activate their account now we can go
ahead and change this while we're
testing it we don't actually need to you
know ask a user to activate their email
address activate via email but we can go
ahead and change this so let's go ahead
and save this table you'll see that
we've got a success oh what's happened
here okay here we are and so we've
created the the table we can seal all of
our information in here as well our
structure essentially here the Browse
tab here will allow you to browse the
data so in this case you can see a big
red cross which means that the table is
empty so it says table seems to be empty
so what we're going to do is initially
insert some dummy data into here because
we're going to be building the the login
part of the system first because it's
the easiest part to do so once we have
inserted some dummy data we can actually
log ourselves into the website and start
to play around with how it might feel
and then really the registration is an
entirely separate entity from the system
because all it involves is inserting
some data in place into this database
table so let's go ahead and insert some
some dummy data into here I've clicked
the insert tab at the top of phpMyAdmin
and I'm going to essentially just fill
this form out here you can see here that
we've got a second value but we we've
got ignore ticked and we don't actually
need to take this one into account so
I'm going to choose a username and
that's just going to be Alex
now passwords are slightly trickier one
because I'm not sure what my password is
going to be encrypted
however MySQL has a built-in md5 hashing
function so what we can actually do is
we can go ahead and type in a value here
so I'm just going to choose password as
my password and from this drop-down list
here we have a list of functions that we
can use and I'm going to choose md5 so
essentially we're saying this value is
going to be the result of the md5
function passing this value which will
give us an md5 string we'll see this in
a minute when we browse off to be
finished so first name nothing special
it's just going to be my first name and
then my last name as well I'm also going
to give my email address so I'll exit
PHP academy' dorg and active I'm going
to leave set to 0 just for now but we
can you know we can come in here any
time and go ahead and change that so I'm
going to go ahead and click go go back
to browse and you can see that I've got
user ID 1 notice that when I clicked on
insert I didn't actually enter any data
here it's automatically given me the
value of 1 I've got my username which I
provided my md5 hash password which you
can see there doesn't represent the
string password first name last name
email and active so everything's there
that we need to actually log ourselves
in create a session allow us to browse
around and actually authenticate a user
to protect protect against specific
pages so essentially we've created our
database table or our database our
database table
and we filled this in with some some
dummy data and in the next part we'll
actually look at building the site from
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
