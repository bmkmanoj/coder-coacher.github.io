mailgun account and once you've signed
in you'll see a dashboard much like this
now there's a few things that you need
from here so just to be aware of what
you need to pick out when we go through
the series you've got an API key here
and you've got a public API key here
we're gonna need both of them when we're
connecting to the API we've also got the
mailgun subdomains here and in this case
we've got a sandbox which allows us to
send 300 emails a day which should not
be used in production now if you have a
domain that you're sending email from go
ahead and hit add your domain follow the
instructions and obviously if you have
any trouble you can contact mailgun and
i'm sure they would be happy to help so
this is the point where we've got
everything we need to connect we're also
going to need to set up a mailing list
because when we come to building the
functionality here we're going to need
to have the ability to add whatever
details are entered here over into my
mailing list so let's hit mailing this
at the top and let's click create your
first mailing list now I'm gonna call
this news and you'll see that this gives
an domain and this in this case it's
just my sandbox subdomain and we can
also give this a bit of metadata this
doesn't really matter too much but I'm
just gonna say here the latest from
website okay so once you've done this
this is information you'll need this is
the alias the alias is basically what
you're going to use to deliver mail to
everyone that subscribed to this list so
you send an email one email to this news
list and anyone that's subscribed to it
will receive that email so again this is
why mailgun handles all of our all of
our email so we've now got this mailing
list set up and we can go ahead and
manage this basically if we click on it
you can see that we've got a list of
recipients we can check this and you can
check this when you're following the
series to see if when you do submit this
form that a user is actually added to
this mailing list and that's all we need
to set up for now just to make you aware
of some items that are quite useful
unsubscribes is really useful to track
anyone that has unsubscribed this I
demonstrated in the introduction video
so I'll just go ahead and delete that
one we've also got things like bounces
tracking and logs as well
logs particularly so you can see if
anything isn't delivered you can go
ahead and explore all of this
functionality but for now we've
basically created a mailing list here
and we're ready to go so over back to
the mail go in front we're going to need
the API key and the public key as well
as the subdomain to connect to the
Malkin API</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
