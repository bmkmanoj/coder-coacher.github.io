be using an external provider like
mailgun to handle sending email rather
than doing it on our server well on our
server we have very limited capacity to
first of all send emails and second of
all we don't get as much functionality
now when we go ahead and in the next
video look at setting up mailgun and
then in subsequent videos to look at
actually using the api you'll see how
simple it is and how much functionality
get out of this mailgun basically allows
you to send transactional email and mass
email so transactional email are things
like when you sign up on a website you
get an email that's because you click
the sign up button Oh
mass email is basically allowing you to
send a usually the same email with maybe
slight differences like addressing the
user by their name - lots of people a
mailgun can handle a lot of email
sending out email to a lot of people now
from your application you're going to
send when when it comes to building the
actual sending of the email
functionality we're gonna send one
request to mailgun so we make one API
call to my or gun with you know what
list we want to send to and the actual
body of the email mail gone will handle
then sending that to hundreds of
thousands of people maybe so your
application won't suffer your website
won't suffer so that's the one thing
mailgun scalable the second reason we
should probably use a service like mail
gun is because it's easier than storing
the data ourselves within this series
we're not going to touch a database
we're gonna send everything over to mail
gun to store everything for us and we
can store all sorts of information about
the user we're not limited to what we
can store and a good thing as well is
for example if the user enters their
name as Billy Garrett if we want to
retrieve the first name mail gun we'll
chop up the data for us so we can get
the users first name you can either use
this last name etc etc so there's a lot
you know there's all of this
functionality within mail gun
it's not the only provider but it's the
one I prefer and it's as you can see
here your first 10,000 emails are free
every month so if you if you're wanting
to use this but not spend any money
probably if you're not wanting to spend
any money the likelihood of you sending
on under 10,000 emails is very high so
you don't actually have to pay a lot but
there's a price calculator here as well
if you head over to male-male Ganga
confluence as pricing you can enter your
month estimated monthly volume and see
how much it will cost but it is cheap to
be honest if you if you think about the
benefit that you get from this service
so we're not affiliated with mailgun at
all but this is a really good service
and I really like using it and you'll
see when it comes to actually coding the
API is really easy to use mailgun have a
SDK for handling requests to mailgun so
that's basically what we're going to be
doing we're going to be using mailgun
and i'd highly advise you not to do this
and handle this on your server so let's
go ahead and setup mailgun how we need
it in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
