our validation and then we can apply it
to our signup form so remember we have
our signup form ready but of course at
the moment we can just hit this and it
will actually create a user without
having anything entered here and of
course we need to later look at things
like checking of an email is already in
the database and for that we can set up
custom rules so the library that we're
going to be using is respect validation
this is a really popular validation
engine and it works really nicely and we
can integrate it into slim very easily
so in this part we're gonna look at
setting the validator up so we can
actually use this on our signup and then
we'll go on to look at things like the
available email rule so we'll create a
rule for that and of course then look at
displaying errors on the form and then
also showing old output so let's just
imagine we submitted this form but got
the password a bit wrong or the email
wasn't available we might want to keep
the name in there so the user doesn't
have to keep entering it so first things
first let's install this library so we
can just head over to our terminal and
do a composer require on respect
validation and of course we'll wait for
that to download okay so now that this
is done we have it available to use in
our project but how are we gonna do this
in the nicest way possible well
essentially what we want to do is wrap
this now own class so this means we can
very easily use it from our controllers
so let's create a new folder called
validation just inside of our app
directory and inside of here let's
create a new file
this will be a validator class so we'll
call this validator PHP so let's set up
our name spacing so it's app validation
and of course we have a class validator
so what is our aim here well what we
want to do is implement some kind of
validate method which will take in our
request object it will take in a list of
rules and then it will essentially just
check if this failed and then we can
grab the errors from the
as well and this is actually really
straightforward so let's just go through
doing this now the first thing that we
need to do is just pull in the respect
validation library
this is namespaced under respect
validation validator and we're gonna
call this respect so inside of here the
first thing that we want to do is create
a validate method so into here we're
going to pass in the request remember
this is our slim request object and this
will allow us to grab the parameters
from the current request and we also
want an array of rules as well so we can
even type hint that to an array so let's
just for now do a var dump here and just
say works in fact we can kill the page
here as well so over in our container we
need to bind this on so let's just do
this somewhere around here let's let's
take a container validator and we'll
attach this to our container so here
we'll just pull in a container and here
we'll just return a new app validation
validator simple as that so let's start
to use this in our off controller so
here this is just about where we would
want to use this so we're gonna say
validation equals this validator
validate of course you can change the
names of this if you want if it helps
you out writing this a little bit
quicker and here we're going to have an
array of rules so in my case I need to
validate email name and password they
all need to be available or at least
entered and the email needs to not exist
already in the database so we'll handle
that later so we have email name and
password so how do respect validation
rules actually work well they're a
little bit different to what you may be
used to but they're not too bad so what
we want to do is at the top of here just
import our validator
again so
use respect validation validator I'm
gonna call this V just so it's a little
bit easier to use this is kind of a
standard with this library so for the
email then we're gonna say V and to do
this we'd say something like no white
space and not empty so this will just
say well for the data that's provided
for this form input we want there to be
no white space and we don't want this to
be empty so we want the same for all of
these we're just going to do this for
now just to keep things nice and simple
then we can implement our custom rule
for checking if our email is available
and of course for the name as well you
might want this to be alpha so let's
just search for some kind of alpha rule
and I think this one should work we'll
give it a go and see what we get back so
let's just say alpha okay so now that
we've got these rules in here this is
obviously going to be passed over to our
validate method so let's just check this
out and in fact what we could do is just
do a var dump on rules that makes a
little bit more sense so submit this
through and you can see here we get an
email which is now a respect validation
validating instance and the same for the
others as well so this looks a little
bit messy but essentially we just have
an array of rules that we can iterate
through for each one of these we'll
check that each of these are in fact
valid or rather they don't fail so to do
this of course all we need to do is just
go and loop through them so let's do
this now so for each rules as we want to
pick up the index of these as well and
that's just a field name so as rule so
now what we can do is we can assert that
this does not fail so we can assert that
it's true and we can pass in the actual
field because we have this in request so
now we can just say something like rule
set name and we're going to do this by
setting the name of the field here so
this is just this just helps one
back the errormsgs so we're just setting
the name then we want to assert that
this given this value that we're about
to pass in makes this rule pass so we
know that this comes from the request we
say get two per am and of course we just
pass in the name of the field there now
what we can also do we'll see later that
when we get the validation message back
we can do something like you see first
that we'll just give the field name and
upper case first character and that just
helps to make it look a little bit more
user friendly so now how do we actually
catch that something has failed well we
have something called a nested
validation exception so if we just
search for that nested validation
exception this is under here and this
will be thrown if something fails so
let's go and just pull the namespace in
so it's nested validation exception
let's just use this nested validation
exception and now what we can do is wrap
this and a try-catch so we just wrap
this like this we want to catch that
nested validation exception and we'll
call that e
and then in here what we want to do is
if this is thrown it means that one of
these rules failed when we assert it for
its truth units so in this case we just
want to append to an error list we don't
have an error list at the moment so at
the top of this we can just set a
property so this is just going to be
errors so now we can say this errors and
we can append on the exception and get
messages now let's get messages because
there might be more than one message for
each field because of course it could be
you know two different roles could be a
problem so we want to also pass the
field in there so we can keep track now
so it's a good idea to just test this
out and see what it looks like so down
here we can do a var dump on this errors
just to see what we get and we can kill
this so let's try this out of course if
we submit this it as it is we're gonna
have errors it's resubmit and saying get
error messages so
call this e so we call this e here and
it's e here so it's refresh again and
there we go so we get the email email
must not be empty remember this here is
the name of the field but we've just
capitalized the first letter and the
name name must be not empty and name
must only contain letters A to Z perfect
and password now let's just check
because I think the Alpha rule not sure
if it takes into account white space
let's just hit sign up and name name
must not contain white space so that's
obviously wrong so we can use this just
to get rid of the rules we don't need so
this should be fine now if we just
refresh it and there we go perfect so
the only two errors were left with is
the email which must not be empty and of
course the password which must not be
empty feel free to head over to the
validation github page check out all of
the available rules you might have some
very specific rules that you want to
implement now either way now that we've
done this we need a way to check here if
this fails and if it does fail we of
course want to redirect back to the
signup page so here we've done the
validation this is all pretty
straightforward
now all we want to do here is be able to
chain this on so we just want to return
this this will just return this current
object and then down here we can
implement a failed method so failed of
course you can implement a passed method
as well if you want all this is going to
do is it's going to check if the errors
are not empty like so so now that we've
done this and we've returned this here
what we can do is validation now
contains or is an instance of this class
so this object so now here we can just
say if validation failed we want to
redirect back and if we return that
redirect then this will never happen so
we know how to redirect already we've
seen this just here so we can just pop
this in here and of course the path now
is going to be or signup so it just if
this validation fails we're redirecting
back simple as that so this might seem a
little bit confusing at first
if you've not worked with respect
validation that library then this can be
a little bit overwhelming but all we're
essentially doing is looping through our
rules checking if it fails if it does
fail or appending to our error messages
and then we have this to check how many
error messages we have so now if I hit
submit or signup you can see we're just
redirected back otherwise if I fill this
in properly despite the fact this email
already exists let's just test it out
you can see when I hit sign up that goes
ahead and signs me up so we have our
basic validation in place but what about
going and displaying the errors on the
actual form because we're not displaying
the errors which is really unhelpful for
any one so we're going to cover that in
the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
