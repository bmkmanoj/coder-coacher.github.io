on creating html5 video what we're going
to be doing in this series is we're
gonna be taking a video off the internet
and we converting it into formats that
will work cross browser using inbuilt
plays that come with html5 video and
later browsers and just to give you a
brief demonstration here this is opened
in Chrome see the video plays in here
let's take a look at Firefox Safari
Internet Explorer and opera just before
I play this you'll see this PHP academy'
logo here this is a poster image one of
the things that we can do in html5 video
will talk more about that later but you
can see that before we see any part of
the video we have to see how this image
load I'll just demonstrate this now
we're also going to be creating a flash
fallback now assuming that the user is
opening the Internet using a browser
which doesn't support html5 and
specifically it's not file video if I go
into this tab here which is in Chrome
but it's an Internet Explorer emulator
for older versions we have this flash
plug-in that loads so we're going to be
making this actually in flash bob will
talk more about that as we progress
forward so I'll just quickly demonstrate
this place which obviously it does now
that all works well we've also going to
be able to do a little bit of JavaScript
here so I've got these three buttons up
here that are gonna play with the size
of the video so just to demonstrate if I
press big the video gets bigger press
small video get smaller that's normal
the video goes back to its normal size
so in the next video we're going to be
doing a little bit of resource gathering
it's not going to be overly interesting
but it does for
really part of the legwork that we're
going to need to do to make this work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
