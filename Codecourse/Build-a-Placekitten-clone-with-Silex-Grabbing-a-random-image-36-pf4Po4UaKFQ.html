going to dive into our database we're
going to create a table which will
represent each image and then from that
what we can do is extract a random row
from our database table or map that to
an image that we have in storage and
then we'll go ahead and eventually
return the actual image so now what
we're going to be doing is just looking
at how we grabbed this from the database
now the first thing that we need to do
is install dr. indiebound so let's go
over and pull this in using composer
this will just provide an
object-relational mapping that we can
use within cylex so let's require in
doctrine dibell and we all set this up
when it's finished okay so now that
that's done we need to configure this we
can do this within bootstrap app because
we need to attach this to our
application so what we're going to do is
go ahead and register this on our
application and in here we go ahead and
pull in the provider for this so it's
under cylex under provider and it's our
doctoring service provider very very
simple and then inside of this what we
want to do is go ahead and pass in some
configuration so in this case what we do
is we say DB options we can reduce some
multiple database connections in here
but of course at the moment we only need
one and we just basically provide
everything in here that we need so we
need a driver and I'm just going to be
using MySQL but you can pretty much use
anything you want so we're going to go
ahead and define that in we also need
our host which is pretty simple again
we're just working locally so we have
localhost and we have a database name
which in my case I have called place
cats so again create a database if you
haven't already we have a user so pretty
standard stuff which again is root for
me we have a password again this is root
and then we have our character encoding
as well so in this case it's utf-8 and
it's mb4 like so let's fix that up and
we're done so that is our database
configuration setup now over in our
roots we need to kind of create this out
a little bit so we can actually pass in
a width and a height so we'll set that
up now we don't really need it at the
moment because regardless of the width
and the
of the image that we're requesting we
always pull out an image at some point
we're going to cash it later but we
always need an image so I'm going to go
ahead and update the URI just for now
and I'm going to simply provide two
place holders in here so what we can now
do rather than access home which now of
course doesn't exist we go ahead and say
something like 200 x 200 or literally
any size at all this will work for any
size at all so now that we've got that
in there the other thing I want to do is
kind of make sure that a width and
height is always some kind of number and
also always a positive number which is
really important so what we're going to
do is we're going to use the assert
method here to say that we want the
width and we're going to use a regular
expression here so we're just going to
very simply say 029 and we're going to
use plus to make sure that this is
unsigned so it has to be a positive
number of course can't have an image
with a width and height that's negative
so we go ahead and use a serta gehen and
we do the same thing for height very
very simple we just pass in 0 to 9 and
again we make sure this is unsigned to a
hat and positive so give that a refresh
it works in exactly the same way but now
if we provide some city value in here
that's not a number it just doesn't
recognize the route ok so now that we've
done this we already pulled in app just
hear from the last part so we can
actually use this to go ahead and grab
that from the database because we've now
registered this on our app so this is
really really simple all we're going to
do is create a variable called image and
we're going to be kind of switching this
round in a minute because or a bit later
because we've got a couple of other
things that we want to do here but
really simply for now what we can do is
just access app DB you can go ahead and
fetch an associative array back from a
query that we give now this is really
simple we just need to select something
like a file name so I'll go ahead and
write this out before we put this into
the database just so we kind of know
what we're doing and this is maybe going
to be from an images table and that is
pretty much it so that's all we need to
do for now what we could also do at this
point is order this by random so that
kind of helps and we're going to limit
this by 1 so that would
give us a random record from this table
okay so now that we've kind of figured
out how to do this let's just do a VAR
dump on image here go ahead and kill the
page and we'll set our database up and
Gao images into a location that we can
pull them out from so the images table
as we know we're extracting from this
and we know that we have a file name
just in here this is going to be a
varchar maybe 255 it can be anything and
really what we want to do now is just
kind of map this to files that we have
on our file system so over in public i'm
going to create a folder in here may be
called the image and i'm going to go
ahead and copy over a load of images to
hear so if we come over to public i'm
just going to pull over a load of cat
images i'll leave a link to all of these
in the course download so you can go
ahead and grab these let's make sure
they're in the image directory and we
now have 1 to 10 of images perfect so
now that all we need to do is just go
and say 1 jpg and of course you could
host these elsewhere you can do really
whatever you want here but it's
generally a little easier to do this on
the file system so we can just go ahead
and duplicate these down now and make
sure we have one to 10 in here so we're
always plucking out one of these so I'll
just quickly go ahead and duplicate
these down and up back with you in just
a second okay so these are being
duplicated down now we now have 10
images in here 1.jpg through to 10.jpg
and we have them in the database as well
so now now that we're picking out a
random image we should have the ability
to map that so if we give this a refresh
we can see 5 jpg give it another refresh
we see 7 and so on and so forth this
will just pick this out in a random
order okay so now that we have done that
you pretty much have a random image that
we can do something with the next thing
that we need to do is actually respond
with our cropped image so we need to
reduce the width and the height we need
to actually return this in the response
rather than home so let's go ahead and
just revert this back let's go ahead and
stick null in there because we of course
need to change that over and we'll go
over to the next part and look at how we
use intervention image to manipulate
this image and then
spawned with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
