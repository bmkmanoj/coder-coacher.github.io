our first test this isn't actually going
to test anything but at least it's
something that we can actually run on
the command line so this is pretty
exciting if you've never written a test
before so over in the tests directory we
need to distinguish between different
types of testing now we're covering unit
testing in this series so I'm gonna
actually create a unit folder within
here just to separate all of my
different types of tests out we have
things like unit tests we have things
like acceptance tests which we're going
to cover in another series so inside of
this unit test directory I'm gonna
create our first test and this is just
gonna be called sample test dot PHP so
we obviously give this a PHP extension
it is a PHP file and inside of here we
create our class and we extend the PHP
unit framework test case so let's go
ahead and create this out and then we'll
look at how we define our tests out so
let's say sample test this needs to
extend PHP unit underscore framework
underscore test case so notice the
capitalization of everything here but
once you have this later on in the
series we're just literally going to be
copying this whole structure over now
that is as simple as it gets
let's just take a look at what happens
if we try and run our tests now so you
can see here we get a warning no tests
found in class sample tests so at least
we know that this is being run but it's
warned us that there are no tests in
here whatsoever
so let's create our first test and we'll
look at the structure of how we create a
test later on we're gonna look at a
slightly easier way to define these out
but for now let's go ahead and stick
with the convention so we're gonna say
public function we're gonna prepend any
method in here that we give which are
each of our tests so every method you
create is a separate test and we're
gonna prepend this with tests and then
we're going to give a very descriptive
name of what we are trying to test now
later on we're gonna see examples of
this but try and keep these two readable
human language describing exactly what
you're testing now in this case I'm just
going to test that the
boolean true is true so a very very
simple pointless test but it will give
us an idea so I'm gonna say true asserts
to true so that is my test name and I
just defined this out as a normal method
so let's go ahead and run this and see
what we get you can see that we actually
get an OK one test has passed but there
are no assertion so the key here then is
what is an assertion well an assertion
is just asserting that something much is
an expected value or does something you
want it to do now in our case we can
assert that the value true or the
boolean value true does assert to true
and to do this we use any of the helper
methods or assertion methods that this
class gives us so in this case we always
say this then we give the assertion that
we want so in this case assert true and
of course in this city example we're
checking that true does assert to true
so let's go over run our tests again
like so and we get ok one test one
assertion so let's make this fail and
then it will move on to looking at
actually testing some real-life stuff
we're gonna go ahead and run this now
and you can see that we get a failure so
it will give us the output here there
was one failure it will tell us the test
that we're working in and it would tell
us the actual method that we're working
in as well and it says here failed
asserting that false is true of course
that's the case because folks isn't true
and of course if what we were to say
assert false that will again pass so
that is the most basic test we can write
we're going to change this over so it
passes again but now that we've done
that this is really in terms of each
test we write as simple as the structure
gets there are other things that we can
do and will be just discussing them
throughout the course but this is now
your first test and we have all green
everything is passing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
