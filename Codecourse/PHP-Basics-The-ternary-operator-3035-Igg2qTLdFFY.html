super Global's but remember when we were
using the get super global we had the
problem that we needed to check if
something was set in case we run into
any problems so let's just take a little
example of this again and we'll see how
we can very very easily fix this with
the ternary operator so let's create a
query in here or at least add to the
query string page equals one we know
from this we could go ahead and show any
results on page one over C at the moment
it's just a small example but you would
eventually be able to do this now to
actually get around this if the page
hasn't been specified we would have to
create an if statement so let's go an
echo out dollar underscore get page and
you could of course wrap this with text
as well and we see here that we get one
now if this doesn't exist
then obviously we see an undefined index
now on a server that you upload your
website to error reporting will be
turned off or at least should be turned
off so your users won't see this however
this could go ahead and break your page
so what we want to do is check if this
is set and only do something if it is
now wouldn't it be a much better to go
ahead and set this page as a default of
page one if it wasn't supplied so by
this I mean maybe up here we could say
page equals one and then we can say down
here well if that page is set so is set
dollar underscore get page then we
overwrite that page variable with the
value that's been defined in the query
string so that would make sense now down
here if we echo out page or use page to
look up the results in our database or
something then we know that we're always
going to have a value because we're
setting it up here as a default of one
so let's go ahead and refresh now and
you can see we get one bar if we do
define out that page to say page five we
get that value as well because it's been
overwritten with this if statement block
this approach is absolutely fine but
there's a much easier way to do this and
then there's an even easier way so let's
look at both of these
okay so the first way to do this would
be to say well the page equals dollar
underscore get page but what we would do
is we would use something called a
ternary operator
now the ternary operator is essentially
an inline if statement and what I mean
by this is before this we can say is set
let's get rid of this for now dollar
underscore get page like so and then
after this we use a question mark to run
or at least assign whatever we place
here into this variable so let's go
ahead and do this and then I'll go over
it once more so dollar underscore get
page then what we do is a kind of else
we use a colon here and then we choose a
default value we know how to fault value
if a page isn't set is one so we can
just place a one there so what's
happening here then is we're saying
assign something to this page variable
we don't know what it's going to be yet
because this condition determines
whether it's this value or whether it's
this value so in actual fact what we're
saying is set page to dollar underscore
get page if this evaluates to true now
in the case that this is set in the URI
it will evaluate to true and therefore
we know this exists otherwise just set
it to one so let's go and echo out page
and see what we get so we're going to
come over refresh here and we get
exactly the same result however if I get
rid of this notice we get one so that is
basically a ternary operator now these
can get much more complicated so for
example you can go ahead and create a
new ternary inside of either of these
conditions or these these blocks if you
like but to be honest I would try and
avoid that as much as possible it's very
useful for things like this where you
just want to very quickly do something
without introducing an if statement now
there's an even easier way and as long
as you are running PHP seven then you
will be able to do this now if you need
to check if you're running PHP seven
what I'd recommend you do is go ahead
and run the PHP info function within a
file so you can just do it
here if you're following along and go
ahead and refresh the page so this will
give you an overview of your PHP
installation in our case you can see we
are running PHP version 7 so now that we
know that we are running PHP 7 we can
look at the even easier way to do this
so what we do is in here we're gonna say
dollar underscore get and then the page
as we did before but now we can use this
operator to go ahead and set a default
value much simpler than a ternary and it
looks a lot cleaner and it kind of makes
more sense so all this is saying here is
if this is set use this value otherwise
use 1 simple as that so if we go over
and we go ahead and add a page number
onto here you see that works as normal
however if I don't supply the page
number notice that it works in exactly
the same way so just remember you can
use the ternary operator for anything at
all if a check is pretty simple feel
free to add a ternary in there just to
clean up the amount of lines in your
code like I said as well if it's a more
complex check it's probably not a good
idea to use a ternary because you'll end
up with a very long line that's really
hard to read and really hard to maintain
now there's a shorthand way of doing a
ternary this isn't actually a ternary
but I'm going to show you a quick
example of something that you may want
to introduce into your code just to
clear things up so let's say we had a
balance here of zero this could be
anything bank account whatever now what
we want to do is we want to output an
available balance now in our case what
we could do is we could say something
like your available balance is and then
we could append on balance like so now
of course that's going to go ahead and
give us your available balance is 0 of
course as we already know if I was to
change that that changes that value now
what happens if I wanted to show 0 here
the actual word zero if it was in fact a
zero balance well in this case what we
would probably initially think about
doing is creating an if statement so we
would say if balance is equal to zero
then we want to set balance to
the text zero so we're now replacing
that with a string so now this would
work and it's perfectly acceptable to do
this there's nothing wrong with doing
this but this just makes it a little bit
more difficult because we've introduced
an additional three lines of code in
here so what we could do rather than
doing this is maybe create an available
balance variable and in here we could
create a very shorthand ternary now what
this is gonna be is balanced then as we
saw before our question mark and our
colon but we're gonna combine these
together this basically means is this a
false or a zero value if it is we want
to use zero like so so we're saying if
this is false zero or something like
that then we want to go and output that
so we're going to switch this variable
here over to available balance and now
if we go and refresh we get exactly the
same result and of course if we switch
this over to something like ten then it
works as normal so there you have it
that is the ternary operator and a
slight improvement over the ternary
operator when we looked at pulling in
query string values just make sure you
use it for short sharp checks and
nothing more complex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
