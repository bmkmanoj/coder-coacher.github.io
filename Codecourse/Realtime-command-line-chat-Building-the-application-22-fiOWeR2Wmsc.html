together in the last part what we didn't
do is require in the vendor autoload
folder which means everything set up
here properly but it just won't be able
to find this particular class so before
we get started I'm just gonna do a
require on vendor auto load dot PHP and
we're good to go
now what I want to start out with is how
we actually run this file now we saw in
the demo that I did something like chat
PHP now at the moment we get a
permission denied on this because it's
not an executable file so how do we
change this well at least on a UNIX
space system we say chmod plus X and
then we choose the name of the file this
will just change the permissions so now
what's going to happen is when I run
this again you can see that it works but
we get a new error and of course this is
because we're not running this with PHP
now it's entirely up to you how you
structure this but you can do that and
it works but I'd prefer to do that it's
a little bit easier so the way that we
get around this is inside of our PHP
file just at the top we say to this well
what do we want to run this file with if
it's just run on its own and to do this
we use a hash bang and then the location
to PHP and in my case it's user local
bin PHP it may be different for you but
this should work so now I can run chat
on its own and it works as normal great
ok so I'm just gonna pull this up a line
just so we don't get that space output
and we're ready to start building the
rest of the chap so before we even do
anything I want to talk about pub nobs
subscribe method and then we're gonna
take a look at a problem that this is
going to cause us so to subscribe to a
particular room we just say it's very
very simple PubNub subscribe and then we
go ahead and give the name of the room
so just to test this out we're gonna use
chat and then we have a callback just in
here and from this we get a payload
which is the payload whenever a message
is pushed to this channel so now inside
of here we can return either true or
false now
turning true will basically just allow
us to constantly poll for messages
whereas if we return false it's gonna
break out of this now it's really
important to note at this point that
this is a blocking line of code it will
block the execution of whatever we're
running and we can prove this by echoing
something just down under here just say
hello and if we go and run this in the
command like so you can see that just
nothing's happening it's just hanging so
this is blocking the execution of our
script now there's a way to get around
this in PHP and that's by creating a sub
process and that's exactly what we're
going to be doing if you think about the
way a chat application works you need to
allow the user to type at any given
point but you need to be constantly
listening for any messages that are sent
to that channel and then you need to
output them so I mean here we're going
to be outputting messages and then
somewhere up here we are going to be
allowing the user to enter but we need
to do something really odd in PHP to be
able to do this so now that we know that
that's the case let's just test this
subscribe here so all I'm gonna do is
I'm going to do a var dump on the
payloads that we get back this will just
allow us to see what kind of payload
we're working with now we can test this
from pub nobs website under their
debugger console so we're gonna do
exactly that now so if we just head over
to here and we go under the debug
console what this will allow us to do is
go ahead and enter a channel name in our
case it's chat and then we can go ahead
and add this client we don't need to
worry about the UUID so here you can see
a JSON string so in here I can say well
the body of the message is going to be
something like hello and this is what
we're going to be pushing to PubNub
whenever we write something on the
command line and this will be sent to
everyone in that channel so if I press
send this is sent and if we go over to
the command line and make sure we're
running this so like so and I hit Send
you can see in there we have that
payload and we can see a message which
is part of pub nobs
payload structure and then body which is
ours and then we have hi so that's how
we're going to be doing it the user type
something into their console this guy's
pushed up
PubNub and then it's sent to all clients
and then we can output the message
within there so pretty standard in the
way of chat so now that we know how we
can test it if you do run into any
problems make sure you use this debug
console it is very very useful so we
need to start to ask the user for their
name and all that kind of stuff bar we
want to run this as a sub process that
kind of runs in the background and then
acts whenever something comes through
because it's blocking so we do this
using the PC ntl fork function in PHP
this will fork the currently running
process now I'm not gonna go through
exactly how this works and talk about it
in length it's very complicated but you
can go ahead and read the manual we're
also gonna be using this command as well
which you can see in the example just
over here so we're going to be using
pretty much this code here so let's go
and start to do this and run this as a
sub process so we can be constantly
listening for messages without blocking
anything so we say something like PID
the process ID and we say P cntl
underscore Fork and then down here we
just basically take that code from the
PHP manual so the first thing we do is
check if the PID is minus 1 and if
that's the case we just want to exit
with the one status code that's just a
general console error and otherwise we
can say else if PID like so this is our
normal process and then otherwise this
is our child process so what we can do
is take this put it into here so we're
running this now as a sub process and in
here this is where we're asking for the
user's input like their name or not
their user name but their message so now
that we have this done let's start to
work on some of the prompts and we need
to ask the user which room they want to
connect to and who they want to connect
as so just above all of this we're going
to define out a function called connect
as the reason that we're doing this is
if the user name is already taken
need to recall this to be able to prompt
the user again for their name and when
we were working in the console generally
we would use something like F right we
would give the stream which is SD T out
and then we give the string that we want
to output so we're gonna say connect as
and now we need to actually take input
from the user and to do this we use F
gets and then we use the stream again
but this time we say
STD in now what we need to do is trim
this because it's going to contain line
breaks in it since the user presses
enter within their keyboard and we're
just returning that so this function or
purely server's prompting the user for
their name and then taking some input
and returning that so we can use the
return value of the function to set
their username so here what we do then
is we say username and then we just say
connect as and we invoke that so we can
kill the page here just to test this out
so let's echo out username and we'll see
how this works so over to the terminal
let's come out of this go back into it
and I'm gonna say Alex and there we go
you can see it's output just there great
so we've prompted the user for their
username and now we want to prompt them
to join a particular room so we're gonna
say F right and again STD out and then
we're going to say join room a colon and
then we're going to do pretty much the
same thing as we did here so we're going
to say room equals F gets STD in and
then we're just going to trim it because
again we don't want any of them line
breaks in there
so the reason we're doing this outside
of here is so that we can use them in
both this and this block because we need
to remember give the name of the room
here so we can actually replace that now
so we're subscribing to the room that
the user chooses now it really doesn't
matter what room you subscribe to you
can either subscribe to a room with
people in or if you enter a new name it
will just create a new channel so it's
entirely up to you
okay so I'm just going to move this up
here a little bit just it's a little bit
tidier so we've got the room that they
want to join then we prompt for the you
name and now what we want to do is go
ahead and just tell the user that
they're connected so we're just going to
say fwrite STD out and here we are going
to say connected to X as Y and we'll
replace these in a minute so to do this
we're just going to say username that's
what the user typed and here the room
name that they gave and what I also want
to do is just do some new lines before
and after this just so we have a little
bit of spacing so we are technically
connected because we're subscribing to
this room but of course we're not
prompting for any input and of course
we're not outputting anything so let's
just review this in the terminal just to
see how we're doing so join room I'm
just gonna say chat and I'm gonna
connect as Alex and there we go connect
it to Alex as chat wrong way around
let's go ahead and just squish these
over like so great so now that we have
this done we can start to listen for
messages and output them to the page so
under subscribe then we are going to
first of all generate a timestamp that
this was sent so we're gonna say
timestamp like so and this is just going
to be using the PHP date function I'm
gonna say DM Y and then we're gonna say
hours in 24 hour format minutes and
seconds and now what we can do is go
ahead and write anything that's sent out
so again we use F right STD out and then
the string here is going to be the
timestamp in brackets then it's going to
be the user just in here between greater
than and less than sign and then we're
going to have the message just here so
we know that when we send up the payload
we get pretty much all of this
information through now we don't know
what the user's username necessarily is
because we don't actually output that
yet we don't actually send this along so
we're gonna mock this inside of the
PubNub debug console so we're gonna say
body hi and then in here we're going to
have a username that sent this
for now we'll just say Alex so when I
send this through then we have body now
and username and if you need to remind
yourself of the payload simply do a var
dump on the payload just in here and
we'll see this so we can actually do
this now just to test it out so I'm
gonna join the room chat as me so you'll
notice that this is exited out so this
is I guess something that we're going to
need to address before this and to do
this we use the PC NT l weight function
and this weights on or returns the
status of a fourth child so this is how
we're going to be able to do this so
just in here we want to say PC and TL
weight and this gives us back a status
just in here if we if we need to use it
so now when we try and run this again
and I joined the room chat as me you can
see that this just hangs and this is
currently now running this that we can
then see this payload dump from so if we
open up our terminal and we come over to
pub nub we can go ahead and send this
across and there we go so we have an
array with message which like I said
before is part of their payload
structure then we have body and we have
username so we have the timestamp in
here we can simply put that into there
and now we need to grab the username and
the body so we can go into message and
into username so in here we just say
payload message use the name and then we
do the same thing here for the body so
we can just copy this and go ahead and
paste it in there with that body in
there great so now let's just break out
of this and go ahead and run it up again
we'll join chat as me and we'll go and
send this through like so come over here
and you can see as well as the payload
which we haven't gotten rid of yet we
have a timestamp we have the name and we
have the message great so that is pretty
much it for outputting messages there's
a couple of things that we're going to
need to do in here in a moment and
that's just because we need to deal with
things like new lines and all that
kind of thing for now that I'm just
gonna put a new line on the end of there
okay so what we need to do then is start
to ask the user for prompt and what we
can then do is publish that message and
publish the user name to the channel
which will then be output and this is
where we can start to use our other
terminal side over here so if you have a
terminal like item like I'm using that
you can split this is going to be a lot
easier otherwise just put two
side-by-side so to start to ask for
input then we're just going to say
fwrite again STD out and then in here we
are going to put just a greater than
sign just to kind of signify that we're
going to enter something and now in here
we want to continuously be asking for
input now if we would just say message
and again use trim on F gets STD in then
we are going to just run this one so we
don't want to do that we want to
constantly ask for input so a quick
trick to do this is just to say while
true and then wrap this like that now
this will hang this line here will hang
so this won't hurt go ahead and cause
some kind of infinite loop it will wait
for the message as the user types it so
to test this we can just say echo
message let's go over to the terminal
run this up go ahead and join chat and
here you can see I can just constantly
type things now at the moment we don't
see another greater than sign so what I
can do is go ahead and put this into
here let's close this off again run it
up just say hi hi hi and it works so now
that we have this done we need to
actually publish the message and then we
can test so we don't equit we want to
use PubNub but this time to publish and
not subscribe and we choose the room we
already know we have that in a variable
and then we have a payload so in here
we're going to have a body which is just
going to be the message that the user
typed let's just pull this down a little
bit and then of course the username
which we already know because the user
selected it as part of that session and
that is pretty much it so before we
actually test this
again in the command line what we really
need to think about is what's actually
happening here and is a subprocess still
running now you might run into trouble
if you're doing an e VAR dumps or
anything in here you might actually find
that this sub process is still running
and it's not being killed so I'm using
our SX so I can come over to my Activity
Monitor and I can go ahead and look this
up by its PID and I can go ahead and
kill any processes so if you look for a
process called PHP you will find that
you can just kill that if you start to
get weird output within your terminal so
just a little tip there that I run into
trouble with so we can now test this out
so I'm going to go ahead and run chat
dot PHP I'm gonna connect to any room it
really doesn't matter and give my
username over on this side I'm gonna do
the same thing I'm gonna join the same
room but with a different username and
now I can start talking so I'm gonna say
hi there we go and over here hello and
there we go so there's a couple of
things that we need to tidy up you've
probably noticed that the greater than
sign that we created here is kind of not
output again just here and it seems to
be a little bit in the way now the loads
of ways that you can do this but the way
that I managed to do this was just
fiddling around with the order of
outputting of course building something
like this in the command line isn't a
great idea it's really just for fun but
this is how we would do it so I've
pulled this outside of the while loop
and now what I'm gonna do is after I've
actually sent my message I'm going to
put this in here again bar I'm gonna
prepend this with R which will mean it
will overwrite the previous line and all
this will mean is that when we come over
here and start this back up again so
let's join chat as Alex I'm going to say
hi and if we just go and do this in
double quotes because that won't take
effect otherwise so let's cancel reopen
this hi-hi-hi and you can see that we've
kept this just in here so a little bit
of fiddling around and you can get this
working properly okay so let's start to
chat in here and we'll see any
problems that we get so I'm going to
cancel this one off I'm gonna join chat
again as Billy and I'm gonna go ahead
and say hi and you'll notice here that
we have this being output but with this
just here so what we want to say is if
the message isn't from that user that's
currently in this session we want to
overwrite the previous line and that
will get rid of this now there is one
caveat to this and it's really nothing
you can easily get around within the
command line because the command line
isn't really built for things like this
unless you're building an application in
another language so let's just tidy this
up now in here we want to go and use the
current username that we're working with
so it's in scope and in here I want a
little if statement to check when a
message comes through if the username
doesn't equal the username that we've
set so we just go ahead and grab this
from our payload again so use the name
you can even put this in a different
variable then we want to do an F write
again STD out this time and we just want
to do exactly the same thing as we did
here so we want to just say overwrite so
this means that if the message that's
come through isn't from the user that's
currently connected it will simply
overwrite the line before outputting the
message so now what we'll get is
something a little bit better so let's
join chat as Alex let's go over here and
join chat as Billy and let's start
talking so hi and I'll say hi again how
are you and you can see that what's
happening is it's overwriting the
previous line and it's moving this down
so we can continue typing now the one
problem I want to address before we go
any further and this is very difficult
to figure out and I don't think you can
actually do this is if I'm currently
typing so hi there and I'm about to
write how you and someone else writes a
message you can see that that looks as
though it's overwritten it to get around
this you can press ctrl + R and what
that will do is it will bring the line
down so you can continue to write like
so and that would just work as normal
when it will just carry on the flow so
this can be a little bit annoying but
again like
the command line in this sense isn't
built for these kind of applications but
what we're doing in anyway is pretty
cool so it doesn't really matter okay so
the last thing we want to figure out is
if a user connects with the same
username we don't wanna let them in
because this is gonna cause a little bit
of trouble so to guess around this what
we can do is we can grab the users that
are currently connected to this
application so what we want to do is
come over to pub nub because we need to
enable something to be able to do this
so if we come over to our demo project
just here come over to our demo key set
we want to enable presents so if we turn
this on and then go ahead and save this
will allow us to detect the people that
are currently connected now by default
this will be a UUID so every client that
connects to this room or channel will
have a UUID but we want to push
additional information about that user
eg their username because that's what we
want to identify users by so what we do
then is just up here we're gonna say
PubNub we are going to set the state in
that particular room and then in here we
just give the current user that's
connected like so and this means that we
now identify each user along with their
UUID with a username so what we can now
do is somewhere up here loop through
anyone that's currently connected and go
ahead and grab that information so just
to test this out we can say something
like here now PubNub here now that will
give us who's in this room at the moment
like so and this will just basically
give us all of that information so if we
do a var dump on here now like so come
back over to our terminal
connect to the chatroom maybe say Alex
and go ahead and do the same here with
Billy you can see here now I've
connected as Billy we have someone in
here already called Alex and if I
disconnect from this and connect again
in chat you can see that I get
to users just here so there's no pretty
way to do this and that's using a
framework or anything obviously we're
just messing around here so we're doing
it in one file but we want to loop
through and just check the news name
isn't taken now the username will just
have the particular user will hang
around for a while so it won't be if you
disconnect you won't be able to connect
that I'll use them again but really this
doesn't matter that much so we're going
to do a for each loop here on here now
and we can look at the payload we can
see that we've got you you IDs so we
want to go through each UUID and we'll
identify them as user and in here then
we want to check user so that's each one
of these state username so state use the
name and we want to check if this equals
the username that's been given and in
this case we would just want to do a
quick F right and just say username
taken maybe doing new line so we can do
this in double quotes so it actually
takes that into account and then we want
to say username and you probably guessed
we again invoke the connect as function
that will just block the script because
we wait for input and then it will
return that username and then we will go
on this won't quite work at the moment
and we'll see why let us go over to here
and let's connect we just fix up that
syntax error connect as say chat connect
as Alex use name taken try it again try
it again and we're in so the reason that
this doesn't work is that what we're not
doing is checking this every time we are
prompting for a username so the way to
get around this then is simply to grab
this for each loop we want to go ahead
and use this inside of here because
whenever we call this we want to re
invoke that function and up here what we
want to do is say something like
username equals and then the value of
this finally we want to return the
username so like this
so let me just tidy this up a little bit
further we need to take here now up here
so we can grab this before in here what
we want to do is use here now and let's
test this out so let's go and run this
and of course we need to ask for the
room beforehand so let's do this
just up here and we'll go and run it so
I'm going to join the room chat I'm
going to connect as Alex and I've
assigned this as a variable but it would
probably be better in this case to go
ahead and just define this as a function
then we can invoke it just in here like
so so third time lucky let's go and run
this join the room chat make sure we
update this here so connect as and we
will run this again and I'll go over
exactly what we've done here just in
case doesn't make sense so I'm gonna
connect use name taken use name take and
use name taken I can do this as many
times as I want
I've now just missed type done I've been
connected so we can do exactly the same
thing over here so let's try and connect
into chat as al X doesn't work if I try
Alex it doesn't work because we had that
one before
tries Billy that doesn't work either so
let's go and choose another one and
we're in so it just works as normal okay
so just to go over this in case it
doesn't make sense we'll run through the
whole thing just to clarify everything
so the first thing we're doing is
prompting for the room name then we're
looking up the users that are currently
connected to that room and we are then
invoking Connect as what this is doing
is its allowing us to enter a username
just here we store that username we then
go through the list of people that are
already in the room and if we have a
taken username we go ahead and run this
again so it will just keep calling this
function over and over again until this
isn't true and then we return that
username what we then do is we go and
set the state so we set at the user this
in that room that's currently connected
we go ahead and just tell the user there
we fork a process here off to another
process we fork a process to a child
process here we're constantly asking the
user for input because we always want to
allow them to enter a message and then
when they do enter a message we go ahead
and publish that message and then again
we loop again and ask them for another
message in the meantime in the child
process what we're doing is we're
subscribing to PubNub which is a
blocking method so this will just block
the execution that's why we're forking
off to a child process we are obviously
generating a timestamp and then we're
just outputting any messages that we're
getting back from that channel and then
of course we are going ahead and
overwriting the previous line if the
user name is the same so we don't get
the issue that we saw earlier and that
is pretty much it we've built a chat in
PHP on the command line very simply
using PubNub remember that this is a
real-time chat so I'd recommend going
ahead and testing it out with anyone in
the world just to see how quick this
actually is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
