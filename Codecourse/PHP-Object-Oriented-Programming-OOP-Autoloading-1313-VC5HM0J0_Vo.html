interfaces that you need to include into
your project can be a little annoying
because we basically here in the last
example created a calculator which has
required six different files to be
required and say we want to use this
again and again again we can either copy
and paste all of this which would
opportu be extremely bad practice
because if we need to change any of
these names it you know it wouldn't work
very well we'd have to go back and
change each file or what we could do is
we could copy these and we can put them
inside of initial and initialization
file so let's create that now and we'll
save this in our root directories in it
dot PHP this is a better solution but
we're still having to maintain a long
list of classes and this within a
project could easily grow to hundreds of
lines long so instead what we do is we
use the SPL autoload register and this
basically allows us as a class is
instantiated it will look this up and
require it in for us so what we can
actually do is we can get rid of all of
this because we already know that we're
naming our classes and our interface in
this case to the same class name that we
have
so basically when we instantiate a new
calculator and you add a subtractor
multiplier divider or we implement this
operator interface we know that because
the name is the same as the file name we
can autoload these so we use SPL
autoload register and inside of this we
have a closure so here as an argument we
have the class name so let's just have a
look at this let's just echo this out
and see what happens
now we are going to get some errors here
but doesn't matter so you can here see
here the first error is that a class
calculator can't be found
that's because we're not including it in
but what has happened is our also load
register has within the closure picked
up on this class name that's trying to
be included and it's a
that's it as we've done here now instead
of doing that what we might want to do
what we in fact do want to do is require
this in
so we know that our
all of our classes are within classes
and we're just going to replace the X
with the class name that we're trying to
include so as long as the classes that
you're trying to include have the same
file name this will just auto load
everything in for us so we don't need to
maintain that massive long list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
