helpful when you need to describe in
plain language what a piece of code does
now there's no need to comment
everything that's really really
important I want to get that out of the
way but just things that might help
others or yourself understand what your
code is doing now particularly when you
are learning it's really important that
you comment see when you refer back to
code you know exactly what you've done
so there are two types of commenting
within PHP there are single line
comments and there are block comments so
a single line comment looks like this
you've probably already seen me doing
the series and you just write anything
after two forward slashes and you can
see that my text editor here actually
differentiates this within color so if I
was to define a variable you can see
it's a completely different color if I
were to go ahead and place this after a
comment so if I were to say in here
define the person's name obviously you
wouldn't comment a line like this
because the variable should be
descriptive enough to distinguish what's
going on here but you kind of get the
idea
now when PHP compiles this script it
will ignore all of these comments and of
course it won't interfere with what you
are doing now what you can also do is
you can place a comment on the same line
as long as it's after what you've
written so obviously if you were to
define this comment beforehand this
would be included as part of the
comments so really important to define
after here now like I said in this case
the comment is really silly and you
wouldn't comment such an obvious line of
code but you get the idea comments can
be added above below or in line but
obviously not before so the other way to
create a common is called a block
comment and these can be useful for
different things later on when you start
looking maybe an object-oriented
programming you'll come across things
called doc blocks and these will use
multi-line block comments so these are
useful for longer more descriptive
comments and just keeping them neater
now we've already looked at functions so
let's just say we had a function here
which removed whitespace now obviously
there are
functions in PHP or that is a function
in PHP that does this we've already
learnt about that that is the trim
function but of course if you were
defining out a function and you need to
explain what it was in a couple of lines
maybe you would use a block now to do
this we use a forward slash and
asterisks now you can see already this
has commented out the entire thing
because what we need to do is we need to
end the block and you can see my text
editor has added this in for me but in
this case you were doing another
asterisks and then a forward slash so
forward slash Astrix to start and an
asterisk and a forward slash to end now
what you can do is in here you can go
ahead and say something like this
function takes a string and strips the
white space and obviously if you need to
add more text down here then now it's
obviously much easier now what you can
also do is you can indent these as well
if you want or what you can do typically
and you'll find this within dock locks
you can add asterisks is here just to
make things look a little bit cleaner so
you can see here this is much nicer way
to comment rather than doing something
like the following like so so it looks a
little bit neater
now it's entirely up to you it really
really doesn't matter but of course
that's an option if you were writing
lots of text so that's pretty much it
for comments while you're learning these
are a great way to comment any code
you've written just to remind yourself
exactly what you've done and it's also a
great way to quickly learn more about
other people's code particularly more
complex pieces of code if you at a
glance can't immediately understand what
it is and I'd recommend you use comments
throughout this series if you haven't
already just while you're writing code
down and when you refer back to it you
know exactly what you've done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
