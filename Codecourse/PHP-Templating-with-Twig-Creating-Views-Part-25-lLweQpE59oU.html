do a couple of things the first thing
that we want to do is create a new
directory inside here called views and
this will contain our templates we also
want to create our index file PHP and
the first thing inside here that we want
to do is include this autoload file that
was generated earlier by composer so
require render / autoload whp
and we've done the next thing that we
want to do is create our twig instance
so twig equals new twig environment and
this takes a loader as its first
parameter so we're just going to create
that now now there are multiple loaders
that you can use I think it's four by
default but you can also create your own
we're going to be using twig loader file
system but do check the docs
there's also twig loader string I think
there's a twig loader array as well but
anyway this class here takes one
parameter and that is the path 12 use
directory cause it's just confused so
now we can actually create a view so
we're going to say twig render hello
HTML and we're going to pass a array
we're going to create this file in just
a moment don't worry this array is the
data that we want to pass to the view so
we're going to pass the name equals
Michael age equals 52 we're also going
to create this view we're going to say
hello name you are oops
age is old so if we go back to our
browser and refresh here we're not going
to see anything because we we call this
function eight but we didn't do anything
with it this doesn't actually output our
view for is it only returns the contents
so we need to echo this out
