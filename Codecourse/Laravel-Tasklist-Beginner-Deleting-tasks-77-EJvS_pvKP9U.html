we need to find a way to delete them now
actually deleting a task using eloquent
is actually going to be very simple what
we need to do is think about a few
things along the way and these are
mainly security related so what we don't
want to do is create say an anchor in
here to go and delete now why would this
be well of course if this was a user
based task list which we'll cover in the
intermediate version of this series then
each user would own a task now if you
had a delete button maybe when you click
this it goes along to something like
tasks one maybe two delete it this would
be a problem because you can very easily
use cross-site request forgery to get
around this now i know we have
cross-site request forgery checking with
in laravel but we don't have this for
get routes because it doesn't make sense
if I were to go on here and I needed a
token it wouldn't make sense either way
let's forget about that for now we'll
implement this with best practice so to
do this then inside of our cell just
here we instead want to create a form
now we already have the route set up to
delete a task so let's just return works
here for now so we can see this when we
eventually get this working so this is
slightly different because the action
needs to be task and then the ID of the
task so let's just figure out how we
would do that first well we have URL
we've already seen using this before and
we have task and then we have forward
slash then we append on the task ID so
remember we are iterating through our
tasks so we now have the ID and we want
to set the method here to post so inside
of the form then all we need is just a
single button so we can create a button
here with a type of submit to submit
this form through we have a class here
of button and button danger do whatever
you want and in here we're just going to
write and delete so to go ahead and
submit this then let's just refresh and
let's just hit delete and just see what
happens so we get a method not allowed
HTTP exception now that's because we are
setting our method to post but we
expecting delete now of course within
some kind of API this is a lot easier
but within HTML we can't do this it just
won't work so what we need to do is look
at method spoofing and to do this we
include a field within a form hidden
field within a form which will define
out the method that we want to send this
through us so what we do is we use a
helper it's called method field and in
here we pass in the method that we want
to use in this case it's delete you
might be wondering why are we even doing
this well the reason we're doing this is
we're creating a really restful way to
interact my application this means we
have a route to get tasks this could
actually be called tasks we have post
task which we know will create a task
and we have delete task so it just makes
sense it's very clear it's very clean so
let's sir refresh here hit delete and
again we get a token mismatch exception
but at least we've got round the fact
that the method was missing we already
know how to use cross-site request
forgery tokens within our forms so we
just say cross-site request forgery
field and now when we hit delete we
should see that that works perfect so we
now have the ability to delete a task
but how do we grab a task by its ID well
there are a couple of ways to do this
and I'm going to show you one way that
you may do this and then I'm going to
show you a much easier way so if we just
do add I dumped on task and we get the
task just through here now you might
call this task ID so let's just start
out with that example and this will be
passed into this closure just here so
let's do add I dumped on task ID and
refresh hit delete and we see one for
this one we see two and so on so what we
could do is we could say task equals
task and we could say find task ID its
to add I dumped on that and see what we
get so remember here what we're doing is
using eloquent to pick things out from
our database for us let's hit delete and
we see we get a task model from that we
can delete it very easy but we can also
do things like where ID equals task ID
you can do this or omit it it's entirely
up to you but what we want to do is look
at something that's even easier now if I
go ahead and get rid of task ID change
this to be called task and do add I
dumped on task and I also type hint this
here when i refresh now we actually get
a task model so we've not done anything
in here to make this work and this is
within laravel called root model binding
so what's actually happened here is that
we've given this name task so laravel
knows that we are probably trying to
pull back a task model we've type into
this here so what's happening is when we
pass in a one or two or three or
whatever laravel will automatically look
this up in the database and this
variable here will then become that task
so we now have a task that we can do
something with and of course what we
want to do is delete that task so to
delete a task we say task delete that
will remove it from the database and
then we return and we redirect to the
home page simple as that so if we head
over to here now go over to the home
page we can start to delete a task so
when I hit hit delete on this one it
goes same with this one and then stay
with this one and we end up with no
tasks until we go and add a new one like
so so that is pretty much it we've gone
ahead and built a very simple task list
application the ability to show tasks
that we've stored obviously store tasks
without validation and of course we've
just now covered deleting tasks so if
you want to go on and do even more with
this EG work with user authentication
and tasks and also learn a lot more
about lower
well we have an intermediate course as
well on Co course calm that you can go
ahead and follow so that is basically it
we've created a task list application
the ability to obviously create a task
check with validation we've also given
the ability to list our tasks and then
finally to delete our tasks as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
