laravel as you can see in my in my
folder and everything works fine but I
want to be able to add my own classes to
my own directory and still auto load
them so I'm going to create a new folder
called Acme and inside here I'm going to
create a new class called foo and we're
going to name is faith namespace this -
Acme and then we're going to declare the
class and we'll also had a function bar
and we'll just return foo bar okay so I
forgot to our routes file and just clean
this up we could do something like this
we could do require a path Acme food the
PHP and then we could say new foo ah
and obviously echo that and we're
getting an error wrong path what does it
say okay so we need a slash there hit
refresh we get class foo not found we
didn't add the namespace okay let's add
this inside a roof
and there we go we get our fubar or what
we want to do is we want to get rid of
this and still have the our our class
work so we do this with composes
autoload so if I just go in here and I
add a comma after this class map and
then what we can do is we can say yes
our 0 and then we provide the namespace
which in this case is Acme and then we
provide the path and that that path is
just going to point to the app directory
so all we need to do now is go to our
terminal and run composer update ok so
if we go back here refresh and now our
our class works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
