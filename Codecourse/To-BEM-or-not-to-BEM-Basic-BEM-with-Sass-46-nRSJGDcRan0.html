BEM we're going to harness the power of
a CSS preprocessor if you've not worked
with sass before you can head over to
sass Lang comm and install it it works
on all operating systems and once you've
done that as long as you can run sass v
and you can see the version you are good
to go
so I'm currently within the directory
that I'm working in we're gonna create a
few files here and we're going to
compile into this app dot CSS file so
let's start by creating an assets folder
I mean in this we'd usually place all of
our scripts now styles so let's just
create a Styles folder for all of our
Styles and we're going to start by
creating our base sass file or CS CSS
file so we're gonna be working with the
scss syntax but we're gonna later on
look at using the sass syntax when we
create some mix-ins
and how this is gonna look even better
okay so we need some kind of modules or
components directory so let's create our
modules directory here and the first
module that we're going to create or
really the only module we're gonna
create to demonstrate this is a list
module so we name this with an
underscore so we can easily include it
and again we're using the S CSS syntax
okay so let's just test this out let's
just write anything in here at all so
let's just say list and we'll give this
a color of red this really doesn't
matter we're just gonna see if we can
get this to compile so inside of a PS
CSS we obviously want to import this so
we say import modules list perfect so
now to watch this we can obviously run
SAS H to find the syntax and if we
scroll up we can see here that to watch
we use the watch flag and then we give
the input name and the output name so in
our case because we have our assets
directory and then within that we have
stars and our apt is CSS file we just
run SAS watch and we go into assets we
go into styles we want to compile the
app die
CSS file and we want to put that within
CSS app dot CSS so now that is listening
for changes so whatever you make changes
to this will automatically compile so if
we look inside of here you can see that
that indeed has compiled so we are
pretty much ready to go we already have
that included over on our index.html
page so let's start to write out our
list styles let's get rid of this color
here because that doesn't really matter
and remember we had a list style type of
none so that's great we can have a
padding of zero and we can have a margin
of zero as well and let's go and write
the mark-up for this so we want an
unordered list with list items the class
here is going to be list and we need to
now work on our element selector so to
do this within sass we can obviously
just say list item if we wanted to and
of course we could then just say
something like margin bottom 10 pixels
and we could then apply this to our list
items so here list item and let's just
add an item in there or duplicate that
down and change the text great so this
should now show us our items if we just
inspect this we can see that as expected
we now have a margin on the bottom so
now that we have this how is this any
different to writing a flat CSS file
well of course it is no different but we
can actually tidy this up and we can
nest element without creating a actual
nest so really within them what we could
do is we could say list list item but of
course we're now costing the speed of
having this rendered so we want to nest
this without ending up with this let's
just take another look at our app dot
CSS file you can see that we have a
perfectly flat to file here so how can
we nest in here and keep this nice and
flat well we can use the route to do
this so let's just get rid of our list
item or we'll rewrite this out so to do
this all we do is we say ampersand we do
under
scores and we say item so now what's
going to happen is this here is going to
take the route name and place it here
and then we can write our styles as
normal so we can say margin bottom 10
pixels so taking a look out app dot CSS
file although this is indented just
within here this is actually a perfectly
flat file and we've actually made our
code look really nice within our list
because we know now that a list has an
item and of course we can add a modifier
in here as well somewhere so let's have
the modifier for our item again we can
nest this to make it look a little bit
nicer as we read down the page and all
we do is we say ampersand and then we
could say last and we can set the margin
bottom to zero great so let's just apply
this to here so list item last and now
if we just take a peek inside of our app
don't CSS file you can see that again
this is a perfectly flat file is just
being formatted like this by sass great
so that will work now and you can see
that our last does not have a margin
bottom so we've got this up and running
but really when I'm working with them
within sass I don't like the way this
looks if you're happy with this that's
fine you can go ahead and write all of
your styles like this and you're now
using the BEM methodology but your
nesting as well to improve readability
however what we're going to do next is
jump on to look at how we can use
mix-ins to make this look even better
and then finally we'll jump on to look
at the sass syntax to see how we can
make this look even better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
