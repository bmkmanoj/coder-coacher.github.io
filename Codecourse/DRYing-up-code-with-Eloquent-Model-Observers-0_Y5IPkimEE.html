projects where I have to generate data
when I actually store something within
laravel again and again and again and
this is data that comes from data I'm
already saving now that probably doesn't
make sense I'm going to give you a rough
example and then we're going to look at
how we can solve this in a few different
ways so let's say for example somewhere
in a controller and I'm just going to do
this within the roots for now I was
creating a forum topic well obviously
when we are saving something out the
envira fell either using this or using
the create method directly on a module
name we would say something like title
and then we would assign this to
whatever it's been provided when we go
ahead and create this and then alongside
a topic we might also have something
like a slug now you may know that you
can use the STR slug helper within
laravel to pass through exactly the same
thing that you're trying to store and
then in this case since we have nude up
a topic model on its own we would go
ahead and call save so either way that
you do this whether you use topic create
and then pass an array through you would
have to every time you create the topic
go ahead and pass this in manually
calling STR slug so sometimes these
things get a little bit annoying this is
a really simple example but you may have
other circumstances where you are
wanting to save something from data so
that you already have and that's why I
meant by the explanation of the star
this video so what we're going to be
doing in this part we're just going to
set up really basic functionality to
store a topic we're going to look at the
problem once again and then we're going
to look at a few solutions to get around
this so the first thing I want to do is
just come over to the projects I'm
working and I'm going to go ahead and
make a migration here or in fact what I
could do is make a model so create a
topic model and also generate a
migration alongside that so let's just
come over to this create topics table
migration go ahead and store what we
need and we're going to keep this really
really simple just for the sake of this
so I'm going to go ahead and create a
string here I'm not going to relate this
back to a user because we're just kind
of
this is an example so let's go ahead and
migrate this I'm going to come over to
EMV and just switch this over I'm
currently using Postgres
so I'm just going to switch over the
port as well here - and also the
database name as well okay so if we go
and run our migrations so PHP artisan
migrate let's go over to the database
just check this out and you can see that
we have our table in there and of course
because we generated that model we also
have this just hit - so over in routes
and we're let's actually go ahead and
store this and then we'll move on to
look at a couple of solutions so once
again you can either use topic model on
its own and use the static create method
or what I like to do is go ahead and
create a new topic explicitly and then
start to set properties on this so let's
say the title was just again hello there
and again this would come from your
request data so if you're working within
a controller you would have your request
object in here and you would obviously
pass this directly into here but just
for now we'll go ahead and hard-code it
and we would go ahead and like we've
already seen use STR slug to pass in
whatever a user has provided and then we
go ahead and we just save that out so if
we just prefix this with app just so we
don't break anything come over to the
browser
give that a refresh and over in the
database we see this here so regardless
of what you're doing this could become
not a problem but it's a lot more
convenient when you have data like this
that you need to hook into eloquent
model events you may wish to do this you
know kind of get rid of this step all
together just to make your life a lot
easier and of course there are countless
reasons why you might want to do that
and once we've finished the short series
we'll see that we can hook in any kind
of event that we want whether it's
assigning data firing a separate event
within laravel sending an email whatever
you want to do we're going to cover it
so let's jump over to the next part and
take a look at the first solution of
doing this which will help you out later
on so the first solution that we're
going to look at it's not necessarily
the best solution but it does have its
place depending on what you want to do
so what I'm going to do is hop over to
the topic model and we're going to
create a mutator and by this I mean that
with
in our model we can define out that when
we get which is an accessor or set we
can use an access or mutator so in this
case we would say well when we're
setting the title attribute on this
model we're going to get through a value
because we know that that where we're
going ahead and setting it so if I just
do a diagram point value here we know
that over here we are setting this here
now if I come over and refresh you can
see that we actually get our value
dumped out so this is basically
something you could use to hook in the
creation of a slug alongside a title now
the only problem here is that the way
that we set things is we say this
attributes we go ahead and define the
actual attribute in this case it's title
and then we set it to that value and
this is useful if you wanted to maybe
make the title all lowercase if you
wanted to change this title in some way
and of course this will work with any
attributes for your setting now the only
problem here is that we can set the slug
in here but we also have to set the
title as well so we could do something
like this we could say STR slug value so
we're taking the title slug refining it
and setting it to slug and therefore
when we save this model the attribute
will be set and that will be stored in
the database so if we just get rid of
this slug here or at least comment it
out so we can go ahead and have a look
we know that this is stored in the
database here let's get rid of this one
first of all and come over and see what
we get now so you can see that this will
have done exactly that now the reason
this is not the best solution is that we
actually have to do this as well and you
can imagine that your model if you are
doing this multiple times for different
attributes would literally get filled up
and that's not always great it looks a
little bit messy and really this kind of
thing is meant for doing this it's more
meant for just the attribute you're
setting so that's one solution and this
does have its place like I said if you
wanted to do anything with the value
that you're currently setting you could
do this and what I will also do is
probably extract this out to a trait and
use it within your topic model rather
than go ahead and define them all here I
would create a trait for this personally
just to keep things nice and tidy either
way that is the sim
this way that we could do this but not
the most clean in the next part we're
going to take a look how we can set up a
simple observer to actually do this okay
so we've established that this probably
isn't the best solution so I'm going to
go ahead and get rid of this from the
model we're not going to touch the model
at all in this case what we're going to
do is rather than do this here once
again we're going to set up an observer
for an action on a model or at least an
event on a model so if you weren't aware
that when you go ahead and new up say a
topic or use the create method eloquent
will actually find events that we can
listen to so just as a really quick
example if we go over to providers and
say app service provider under the boot
method we could actually pull in this
model and we can go ahead and observe a
particular event on this model so we
have things like creating which is while
the models being creating we have
created once it's been created we have
things like saved or saving if you were
kind of saving something out updating
updated all of that kind of stuff now in
our case when we're creating a topic
maybe we want to do something to this
topic and we know that we do want to do
that we want to go and we want to add a
slug in so in this case what we have is
a callback and in the next part we're
going to look at setting up a class for
these kind of observers to tidy things
up if you want to do lots of different
things rather than banging them all
inside of this provider now into here we
get a topic so from here if we just do a
die dump on this topic we know that when
we go and create this we should see at
this in here so let's go ahead and
refresh and you can see here we do in
fact get that topic and that means that
what we can do is we can kind of
intervene in the creation of this topic
so all that means is taking the topic
that we receive in here and doing
something with the property much better
solution we've not had to update our
model we're just creating a separate
listener for this event so now we need
to do is go ahead and say STR slug
because we have that topic in there we
can still grab the title and that is
pretty much it we're done so while this
is being created this will happen and
then when we go and save it we will have
that property in there
get rid of that line there go over to
our page give this refresh refresh the
database and you can see it's worked in
exactly the same way now this is a well
and good but sometimes if you are you
know having a lot of events here if you
have lots of models you are listening to
things on you can imagine this is going
to get pretty crazy so we're going to
quickly look at how we would create a
set provider for this which would at
least be the first step in keeping this
a little bit tidier rather than putting
everything in our app service provider
because it's highly likely that you'll
have other things inside of here as well
so what we would do is if you're not
familiar with providers and making them
you would come over here to the command
line and use artisan to make a provider
and I would call this something like
eloquent event service provider and of
course you can choose any name you want
and if things did get super crazy you
could create a separate one for each
model I wouldn't really recommend doing
that but we'll take a look in the next
part how we create that class it would
be a little bit cleaner anyway so now
that we have this we need to obviously
register this over in config app
alongside all of our other providers so
that's all the way down and just under
here let's go ahead and pull this in so
I'm going to duplicate this down and
give the name of that new service
provider so now we have a kind of
separate space to do what we've done
over here so I can take this and leave
this kind of alone and go ahead and
place it in here instead and that means
that at least we've separated it away
from everything else now still though
we're going to end up in the situation
where we have lots of different events
for lots of different models so how do
we solve that well we're going to cover
that in the next part and do pretty much
exactly the same here but with a little
bit more flexibility and make this a
little bit tidier now I've established
that this solution is a lot better but
still we already know that we're going
to run into problems later we need lots
of events for lots of models so we solve
this with model observers and we're
going to take a look behind the scenes
in laravel as well to look at kind of
how this works so when we generate an
observer we can actually do this on the
command line laravel doesn't have a
command to generate a model observer so
we have to kind of do this manually but
it's not too much
Travel because really all it is is
substituting this call back for a
particular class so in the app directory
what I would typically do and I think
this is out in the manual as well is
create an observers folder now inside of
here I would create an individual
observer for each type of model now in
this case we have a topic so we would
create a topic observer but in the case
of anything else I post a user you can
do it exactly the same thing so we won't
be covering that but once you know how
to do this you know how to do it for any
model you need so let's set up the
namespace so it's now on the app and
observers and let's go ahead and fill
this in so topic of server and we're
done so now to actually register this
observer before we create any methods on
here how do we do this
well let's go ahead and get rid of this
instead what we do is we use observe so
what we're now doing is we are replacing
this with the full class path so in this
case you can either import this at the
top or say something like app observers
and then say topic observer now if you
were going ahead and doing this for a
user you may do this following so user
and the user observer maybe you have a
post you would do exactly the same thing
you kind of get the idea the only
difference now though is that however
many we register of these in here it
really doesn't matter too much because
we're not adding all of our logic in
here as well as our individual observers
so this makes things a little bit
cleaner it's unlikely that you're going
to have hundreds of models so really
this keeps things nice and tidy so we're
at the point where we have an eloquent
event service provider completely
separate provider and now we're linking
this to a class so what do we do over in
this class well we just do the same
thing but we define these out as methods
it's as simple as that we're just
replacing the method call that we did
earlier with a class with individual
methods so in our case we would say
creating we again receive a topic into
this and we can type in this as well for
a little bit of strict checking so let's
go ahead and use app topic and then in
here we just do exactly what we want to
do but now we can do anything in
here and it doesn't really matter
because we're in a separate class so in
this case all I would want to do is say
topic and set the slug and just before
we do this let's go ahead and dine dump
on the topic just so we can see that
this does actually work so we've set
this up all looks good and we can come
over and check this out give that a
refresh and we get that topic again now
if we come over to the model that we
extend when we create any models this is
again part of the laravel framework and
we check out this observe method let's
take a look at this you can see here
that we obviously pass in that class
that we've just defined and then in this
case we are checking if the event that
we're listening on so in here we are
using get observable events so let's
just take a look at this so these are
all of the observable events within
laravel so we can use any of these if we
need to so back to the observe method in
the same class iterating through each of
them observable events if that
particular method exists on the observer
that we've created so for example if a
topic is being restored maybe so we
would have a restored method if it is
being restored but the method doesn't
exist
there's no point registering an observer
for it and we register the event just
here so again this is in the same class
so we can just come over to this and all
this is doing is at listening for
eloquent dot the name of the event and
then going ahead and running what we've
defined inside of these methods so have
a really good look through this if you
are interested in kind of diving into
the scenes behind the scenes of any of
these classes within zoravar it's always
a good idea to do either way we kind of
know how this works now if saya topic is
being created and the observe that we've
registered
exists or the method on the observer
we've registered exists then we know
we're going to run it so in this case
then let's go ahead and say topic slug
set this to STR slug passing in the
topic title it just works in exactly the
same way and we are done so now come
over here give that a refresh and I ruin
the database we get what we need so I we
finally ended up at this kind of
solution and this is the best solution
because it
allow us to write as much logic or code
in here that we need to go ahead and
separate it out from either our app
service provider or in fact this
provider here so I think for smaller
applications there's nothing wrong with
doing topic creating in here and passing
in a closure
I wouldn't say don't do that but if
things start to get a little bit crazy
break these out into observers or if
you're kind of looking ahead to the
future go ahead and create an observer
now just keep things easy to update
later on either way that is just a
really simple idea of setting a slug for
a topic every time we create it but of
course now you're free to do anything
you like and of course if you need to
remind yourselves of what is being
observed so what's being listened to all
the different events then of course you
can come over to here follow it down and
we know that we have this get observable
events methods so we can go in just open
this and check these out just here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
