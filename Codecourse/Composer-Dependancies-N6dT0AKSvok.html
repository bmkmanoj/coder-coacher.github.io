installing dependencies for your project
using composer and packages which is a
PHP package archive so the first thing
you'll need to do in order to manage
dependencies for your projects is
download composer now as stated on
composers website this isn't a package
manager it's a dependency manager
because it's installed on a per project
basis you can globally install composer
which will do your tasks that you need
to do with in your specific project but
then once you're in that project you'll
be able to create specific composer
files then the folder which people
looking at in a moment and that will
manage these dependencies you can add
the dependencies you need to require in
this case we're just going to be looking
a basic require for the dependency
phpmailer in just an example project
we're not actually doing anything with
this so I've got the folder here open in
my text editor the first thing we're
going to do is make sure that we've got
composer installed I have a terminal
open and I'm in the phpmailer directory
which I'm going to be working in let's
just run composer just to make sure that
we have this installed globally and you
can see that we have if you don't
already have compose it installed it's
fairly easy to do via the instructions
on the website for whatever operating
system you're working on so now what
we're going to do is we're going to
create a vendor folder inside of our
directory here like so that's going to
store first of all composer and second
of all how basically our dependencies
via vendors so from vendors the next
thing we need to do is we need to create
a new file and this is going to be what
we define as it for our requirements so
inside of here we create a JSON object
and we have this require object here so
if we head over to the packages website
i'm currently on phpmailer and we see
here that we need to require in this
here so this is the name of the package
and this is the name of essentially what
is the branch that you're taking it from
so if i take this and just paste it into
here i'm now going to save this file in
here as composer JSON as this is a JSON
object so once that's done what we need
to do is head over to our command line
or terminal and hit composer install and
that will go ahead and install all of
the dependencies you've listed within
your composure JSON file so now that's
done let's take a look inside of the
vendor folder here you'll notice that a
composer lock file has also been
generated so inside a vendor you can now
see we've got composer which gives our
autoloader which is really interesting
we'll look at that in a moment and we've
also got the dependency phpmailer so we
can start to use this with our project
let's say we want to use or basically
also load all of the dependencies that
our project requires this is really
straightforward all we need to do is
require in vendor forward slash autoload
PHP so if we save this in our main
directory what that's going to do is
it's going to require in composers
autoload script which as you can see is
going to get the auto is basically going
to autoload all of the dependencies that
we have installed so this is really
handy if you have quite a few
dependencies and just want to include
them into your project straightaway so
we've looked at installing composer on a
project basis creating a vendor folder
creating our composers or JSON file
which stores our dependencies and then
running the composer in stool command to
actually install our dependencies we've
also looked the Handy auto load up PHP
far that comes with composer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
