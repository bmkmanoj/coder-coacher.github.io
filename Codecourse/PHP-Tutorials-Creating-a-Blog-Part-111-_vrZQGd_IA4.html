from PHP academy' and in this tutorial
series I will guide you through how to
create a blog this is a continuation on
the my sequel series which means I will
put focus on my sequel however I'll try
to explain everything around it like the
logic I'm using a normal PHP code I will
try to explain that as well and as clear
as possible so let's start by taking a
look at the folder structure here we
have the simple directory I think I call
it simple because it's a very simple
blog doesn't matter anyway in it we have
a resources directory and we will use
this to store any files which contain
functionality so which do stuff but
don't actually output anything if that
makes sense
so here we have this in its doc PHP file
for example which we will use to
establish a database connection and
other things so basically we do not need
users to get access to this file and
that's why we use this dot HD access
file with denied from all in it this
means that users including yourself
cannot actually directly browse to any
of the files in the resources directory
so here's a quick sample of what it
looks like without any posts of course
here you can add posts or add a category
here we'll have a category list etc but
let's say we browse to your resources
directory and then go to init to PHP
forbidden this is a very useful
technique to use and I definitely
recommend using it anyway in this funk
directory we will store files which
contain functions which we are going to
use inside our PHP now these functions
range from checking if a category exists
to adding both to a database or even
just editing a post and here we have all
these files which we use for deleting
things adding things and of course index
dot PHP to display a list of posts oh by
the way this conflictive PHP file is for
setting configuration variables like
like your database credentials so let me
now quickly take you through the
database structure in the next video I
will show you how I created this
basically we have two tables categories
and posts and categories just contains
an ID which will be an integer of course
and a category name very simple category
names are generally not long so we use
24 here but I'll cover that in the next
part
and the posts table contains slightly
more fields an ID here we have the get
ID this is exactly the same as the ID
here in the categories table so we're
using the relational model here remember
that very important and then we have
title which is kind of obvious contents
which is just the the post itself
and then we have days posted which
simply is the date and time at which the
post was added to the database so that
is basically all I want to say now in
the next part we're going to start
structuring the database I'm going to
empty this and then we're going to do it
from scratch and we'll see if we can
also start some coding in the next part
but no guarantees so see you in the next
part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
