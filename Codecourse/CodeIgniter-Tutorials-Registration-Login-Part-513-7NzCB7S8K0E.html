welcome to video number five in this new
series where I'm building a login
registration system with CodeIgniter
what I want to start this video off by
talking about first is a I want to show
you how you can grab posts data from the
forum or from the function from PHP I
guess the same way that you would
normally reference like echo host I'm
sure I'm sure this looks familiar where
you would say in this case grab email
now this would actually work if I save
this and run it in the okay that's only
on login right so I'll click login
and you'll see and there you can see
it's actually submitting there you can
see it before is because it's I'm
echoing it out in the login validation
function so now we're actually in the
lock and validation function you can see
it there is a code ignitor way to do it
and that's what I want to show you how
to do essentially it does the same thing
only it's smarter then sorry it's
smarter than regular just grabbing it
order the post array because coordinator
handles it so you go this input post and
then here's where you specify which
which key in the in the post array that
you're looking for and what CodeIgniter
will actually do with this is it I
believe it escapes values if you're
working inside of a database and things
like that so you can it's the same as
the set message but set message function
in with the form validation which I'm
not sure if you're familiar with that
one I might show you in another video
but uh in this case essentially all it
does is it just grabs that post data out
of this array and so if i refresh this
you can see it it just does the same
thing twice
but for further use it as far as this
video this series is is concerned I'll
be using the post method the CodeIgniter
way of doing it and that's extremely
handy and extremely important in what
I'm talking about next which is custom
callbacks and form in the form
validation library okay so how these
work is essentially what you do is you
write callback
underscore and then the name of the of
the new callback that you're actually
going to write so in this case we're
going to say check underscore email our
will say actually validate Dan chills
cool now what this does is this will
actually tell CodeIgniter to look for in
the same controller for another function
or method called
exactly what this is right so validate
credentials is what it's going to look
for now I'm not going to actually send
or receive any variables to this to this
function because I can just grab them
straight from the post array using that
way it just showed you so what I'll do
is a I'm going to reference a I guess
the first thing I want to do is load a
model which I'm not actually going to
show you how to create this time this
load model will call this model
underscore users will say yeah oh this
underscore users can blog is what we'll
call the function so this should make
sense if you can log in then return true
else we want to this form validation set
message
validate credentials to say incorrect
use your name slash password and then
will return false and then will actually
end this else statement
cool now let me explain this a little
bit basically this function will will be
a a method in this model that we're
about to create called model users
probably in the neck in the next video
which will just evaluate if you can log
in with the current credentials it'll
take the username or I mean the email
address and the password and check the
database to see if there's anywhere
where the username and password are what
they are what the user entered now if
and if if it does find a row then it
will return true else it'll return false
which means this if statement will
either validate to be true or false
depending on what that function returns
now if it returns true then this
function is the validate credentials
method is also going to return true in
with in which case if it returns true
the form validation library will take
that and it will say ok so if this
function returns true that means that
there isn't an error that means that the
validation has been completed and there
wasn't an error thrown however if the
validate credentials function because
it's a callback if it returns false it
will know that there's an error and it
will try it and it'll actually create an
error the same way that like say the
required field throws back an error it
will it'll return an error of whatever
the message is for that function which
is why we're setting the message of
validate credentials to incorrect
username password so that it has a
message and I'll just show you how that
works really quick I guess I can't
actually show you um
I'm going to end this video in the in
the next video I'm actually going to
create this catalogue in function really
quick and then I'll show you how this
whole thing works I just want to keep
the video lengths a little bit shorter
hope you understand
anyway clean this up a little bit and
thanks for watching see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
