this video we're going to look at the
toggle function in jQuery now we've
already looked at creating a function
called hide element however what happens
if we want to hide the element that then
we show it at the moment the only thing
we have is a button to hide the
paragraph that we've created but when we
click on it again the element is already
hidden and therefore we need it to be
shown now there are a couple of ways
other than using toggle that we can
tackle this problem we could have two
buttons for example one called show and
one called hide however what we might
want to do is just have a single button
that will hide and show it depending on
its current state so let's go ahead and
get rid of this function here we'll keep
that function just for reference but
we're going to create a new function
called toggle we'll call it toggle
element so we know what we're
referencing to so we create a function
called toggle element again we're taking
the element in and we can also take the
speed now let's go and write this
function in so toggle element and we
want to again reference the paragraph so
sorry we need hash paragraph and the
speed this time when we write our
function we're not going to use the hide
function but we're going to use the
toggle function so let's again reference
element this is what's taken in from the
parameter that we give to this function
and then we say dot toggle in brackets
we can give a speed there are other
parameters you can give this so go ahead
to the jQuery website and the
documentation and you'll be able to see
these but this time what's going to
happen is let's change this value to I'd
show well let's call it toggle
when we refresh the page we can see when
we click toggle it disappears however
when we click toggle again it actually
reappears so how is toggle useful in
creating websites or you know applying
this to current content at the moment
this seems like a pretty useless example
I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna get rid
of the paragraph and I'm gonna go ahead
and get rid of the button now what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to create a couple
of div elements that are going to show
some content or contain some content
that I may want to hide or get rid of
now remember we still have our function
in here so we can make use of that and
we can give it a specific element let's
go ahead and create a hyperlink and
we'll surround that in h3 tags so we get
a large-scale text or a header and HTML
header I'm going to create a almost like
a social networking example I guess
basic info and let's go down and say you
can just copy this save a bit of time
paste that in there and let's say
contact information
okay so now what we have so a basic info
now what we have let's just refresh we
have a hyperlink basic info and contact
information now what I want to happen is
I want to be able to click on this
element here this hyperlink here and for
a list of information to drop down this
could be an HTML form or it could just
be static information the same with
contact information as well so let's go
ahead and under here create a div with
an ID that's very important because
remember to hide and and close this we
need to reference it with an ID and I'm
gonna call this basic info I'm gonna do
the same and I'm gonna copy and paste
this down here just pull this up so we
know what belongs to what and I'm gonna
call this contact in formation okay so
in here we can actually enter the
information we want so basic info name
Alex
age 21 and here we can say telephone on
two three four five six seven eight nine
and we can break down and say email Alex
PHP academy' dog okay so now we have
some information laid out for us here
however what we want to do is be able to
click this click this and to hide both
elements and then we want to reshow them
when we click it again so the first
thing we want to do is either decide
whether we want these to be shown or
hidden upon start now you can do this
using CSS you can use the visibility
option to choose hidden or or you can
leave that out for it to be shown
however I'm gonna have them default
shown now let's go ahead and give a well
we don't need an H ref we can just put a
hash in there but we need to give the a
tag an on click event because it
supports the on click event and we're
gonna do the same for the contact
information in just a moment
and in here we can actually use our
function so let's go ahead and type in
toggle element and I want to toggle
basic oh sorry hash basic info because
we're referencing the ID of this div
here and I want to do that at a speed of
500 we can do exactly the same here we
can say on click equals toggle element
again we reference a an ID which is
contact in formation you might want to
keep your variable names a bit shorter
and again with a speed of 500 now when
we refresh the page we have the same
information however when we click you
can see that that information disappears
and when we click again that information
reappears so this is a more practical
example of why you might want to use
toggle okay so what happens if we want
to hide all of our elements that we
currently have the ability to hide and
show manually now let's take a look at
our page if the user wanted to hide all
of them for example let's say you had 10
of these sections you wanted the user to
show and hide you can actually create or
rather use your existing function to
hide all of them now common sense might
say to you you want to go and create a
function called toggle or or something
like that however what we can actually
do because of the way we've created our
function instead of specifying a
particular element we can specify a set
of elements we want to hide for example
we might want to hide all div elements
and because we are using divs for each
of these we can just go ahead and use
the same function so let's just create a
link so href sorry a href equals hash as
we did here because we're not using a
link to anywhere then we say on click
equals something and the tag and here we
can say toggle or now the onclick
function is going to take the toggle
element function again we have a speed
of 500 but this time instead of putting
hash and referencing a particular
element ID we can just put div and you
can use this for all different types of
elements for example paragraphs a but in
this case it's diff
the information so let's go ahead and
refresh the page we can the same as we
did before we can hide it and show
different information however if we want
to if we sorry if we now click toggle
all you can see that it toggles the two
divs because we've referenced the actual
div so you can see that as well as it
being very powerful in terms of
animation it's also extremely flexible
so you can hide either specific elements
by referencing their name with a hash or
you can hide elements in general by just
giving the element name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
