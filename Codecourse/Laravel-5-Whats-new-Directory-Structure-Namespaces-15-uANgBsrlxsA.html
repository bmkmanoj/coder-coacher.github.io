noticed we're a big fan of laravel here
so the release of laravel 5 is very big
now in this series we're going to go
over some of the more significant
changes in laravel 5 so we're just going
to dive straight in here i have my fresh
installation of larval 5 here in my
editor and you can also see that the
default home screen or installation
screen has completely changed as well
the first thing to know is the directory
structure it's completely different
everything has been moved out of the app
directory for example the config the
database migrations and seeds our
resources such as our views in language
storage and tests the app directory has
been kept as minimal as possible the
next thing to note is that everything
inside this app directory is now named
spaced so if we go into our user model
here you'll see that we have the name
space of app and we can actually change
this to what everyone however level 5
comes with a lot of default classes
inside the app directory so as you can
imagine it's going to be really
difficult to go through all of these
individual classes and change the name
space for each of them so if we go into
our root directory inside of our
terminal what we can actually do is run
PHP artisan app name and then we can
rename this to whatever we like so let's
call this Acme for the sake of things so
there you go we get application
namespace set and if we go back to our
editor you'll see that all of these
namespaces inside the app directory has
been updated automatically which is
obviously very useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
