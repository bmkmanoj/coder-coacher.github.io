simple comparison operators within an if
statement and that's when we did
something like if some kind of variable
is equal to some value so this is an
equals comparison operator what we're
now going to look at though is logical
operators
now logical operators sound more
confusing than they actually are now
we've already seen how to create an if
statement and check if a condition is
either true or false or if that
condition evaluates to true or false but
what if we want to check multiple things
now let's take a look at again just to
recap a very basic example we know that
this block here will be run if we go
ahead and run this code because we know
that 1 or true evaluates to true now
keeping this kind of example let's make
this a little bit more interesting and
bring in the first logical operator all
this means is we can use this operator
to say well is this true so this first
statement here and is this true so we
need double and now you may see this
written as and which is perfectly fine
but generally we tend to use a double
ampersand to denote this operator so in
here let's see if this will run so let's
just go and output the word hello let's
come over give that a refresh and we see
that we get hello output so what we've
done then is place this in here to say
is this true and is this true now this
of course doesn't make sense because we
are using two true values we've
essentially hard-coded them in here
however we know that if we had some
other kind of statement in here and
another kind of statement in here then
this would work okay so let's make this
more interesting let's go ahead and set
this one to false so this has to be true
and this has to be true and you can
probably guess this isn't gonna run
because both of these need to be true to
go ahead and run this block if we run
this we see nothing now we can chain
multiple logical operators on so for
example if we were to say and true what
do you think is going to happen here so
is this true
and is this true and is this true of
course they're not all true
so we come over and we don't see
anything if we were to change this to
true this work if we were to change any
of other of these to false it still
doesn't work so basically anything we
put in here if we're using the and
operator has to be true so to put this
in another way as long as we have folks
in here somewhere and we're using the
and operator everywhere then this is
going to always this whole thing
evaluate to false so before we explore
more logical operators let's just switch
out this silly example to something that
is a little bit more real-world now
let's say that to enter website we
needed a username and we needed a
password that makes pretty much sense
well in my case I'm going to hard-code
in what I am expecting for the username
and password so I'm gonna say well when
the user enters a username I want this
to equal Alex and I want the password
that they enter to equal I love cats and
then if that's the case they are in so
we're gonna say you are in now the
username and password that they provide
would be up here so that's just a
username and I'm gonna set this to Billy
and then I'm going to set the password
here to I love cats and of course this
isn't the way that you would implement
any kind of authentication system we're
just looking at a very basic example but
here you can see what we mean we're
using two different comparisons so we're
saying the username has to equal Alex
and the password has to equal I love
cats now of course at the moment this
isn't gonna work because the username is
currently set to Billy let's refresh and
you see we don't see anything in the
browser however if we switch this over
to Alex now both of these on either side
evaluate to true and therefore because
we're using the and operator this whole
condition evaluates to true and we see
you are in okay so now let's move on to
the or logical operator this allows us
to check if any one of the values is
true so let's get rid of this example
we're gonna say again day of week and
we're gonna set this to let's say three
so let's imagine that that is a
Wednesday what we want to do is check if
the day of the week that is provided is
either 6 or 7 which would in our case be
a Saturday or a Sunday and then say the
weekend is here if it's a 6 or a 7 so in
this case we would say well if the day
of the week that we've provided is equal
to 6 and then we can either say or or we
can do a double pipe symbol for all
which is again more common day of week
is equal to 7 so if the day of the week
is equal to 6 or the day of the week is
equal to 7 then we're going to echo out
the weekend is here brilliant so if we
go into the browser and give that a
refresh we don't see anything now of
course when using an or operator here
because if we were to say if the day of
the week is 6 and the day of the week is
7 this doesn't make sense at all because
this variable at any one time can only
hold one value this would mean that the
value would have to be 6 + 7 which just
doesn't make sense so we use or here
instead okay so now if I define out a
Saturday the weekend is here if I define
out a 7 which is Sunday the weekend is
here brilliant now we've actually
already covered the next operator we're
going to look at and this is called not
now this is the exclamation mark that we
put before something and at this point
it's important to say that we can
combine and/or not operators inside of
one condition so depending on how
complex things are getting you can
combine all of these so let's take a
look at an example of this let's just go
ahead and get rid of this if statement
just so we can start again now let's say
that the day of the week is 7 and what
we're going to do is to find out if
we're working the weekend so working the
weekend and I'm going to set this to
true so we're now introducing a boolean
value okay so what we want to do is
create our if statement here and we're
going to say if the day of the week is
equal to 6 or
the day of the week is equal to seven
like so and we're not working at the
weekend then we're gonna say you have a
day off now we're gonna run this and
we're gonna see if this works so we are
working at the weekend and it's a Sunday
so we shouldn't see you have a day off
now what happens when we change this
over to six well we would expect to see
nothing because what's happening is it's
currently Saturday and we are working
the weekend so we shouldn't see that we
have a day off we don't have a day off
if we're working the weekend and it is
Saturday makes sense
give that a refresh and it now says you
have the day off so at this point it's
not working as we hoped it would the
reason for this is because of something
called operator precedence now to make
this work we need to think logically
about the way our current condition is
structured now what we're actually
saying here according to PHP is if the
day of the week is six or the day of the
week is seven and we're not working the
weekend what's not happening here is
we're not checking if the day of the
week is six and we're not working the
weekend so it's just kind of this part
here being evaluated and then this part
here being evaluated so because the day
of the week is six this is evaluated to
true and therefore were outputting you
have a day off when in actual fact if we
are working the weekend and it's
Saturday we shouldn't have a day off
so what we actually want to say is if
the day of the week is six or seven and
we're not working the weekend then run
the block so at first these might seem
like pretty similar conditions but if
you have a good think about this it will
start to make sense so to fix this up we
want to basically put the condition here
that we want to evaluate first in two
parentheses so this is saying if the day
of the week is six or the day of the
week is seven
and we're not working the weekend then
we have a day off so regardless of this
being six or seven now we should see the
same result
give that a refresh we haven't got the
day off because it's Sunday if we go
ahead and set this to 6:00 this now
works we haven't got the day off if I
was to change this to say Monday we
don't see anything if I was to change
working the weekend to false and it's
currently Saturday we now see you have
the day off same as seven we now have
the day off and if we change this to one
we don't have the day off because we're
assuming the working week is Monday to
Friday now don't worry if this is
slightly confusing at first the more you
start to play around with writing code
the sooner these kind of things will
sink in and it's really all down to what
you're trying to build so that pretty
much wraps up logical operators you can
find more information and examples of
these over on the PHP manual but pretty
much the or operator the and operator
and the not operator are really
everything you're going to need just be
wary of your parentheses and what is
checked first inside of this condition
so you don't run into any mistakes like
we've already seen just here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
