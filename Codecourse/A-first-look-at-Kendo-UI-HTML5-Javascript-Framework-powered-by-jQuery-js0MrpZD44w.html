this video I'm just going to be
reviewing kendo UI so we're going to
talk a bit about what this is and why I
found it really really useful so many of
you will know that the web has moved
forward in terms of mobile development
particularly with stuff like tablet
computers and html5 and JavaScript have
played a massive part of that in that
and there's been a massive leap in
development for non-native apps so apps
that aren't native to a particular
device so you create one website which
is accessible on a variety of devices
they scale up and down to them
particular devices and then also work on
the web as well or they can be targeted
specifically for you know tablet or
smaller devices so they feel like you're
running an actual app and that's where
kendo UI comes in to stuff so basically
it's a framework that gives you
everything that you need to build these
apps for both web and mobile and there's
also something called data vis which is
just here that we'll speak about in in a
moment
so basically kendo UI is a framework you
can download it you have a well
basically like I've said everything you
need to start creating slide sliding
actions touched basically interacting
with your app so you build it and people
can interact as they would normally an
app so they've got so many examples on
the website and good examples as well so
let's hop over to mobile because this is
a really interesting part of the
framework let's go ahead and click
launch demos and just have a look so I
really encourage you to come on here and
have a look around and it obviously will
give you the code associated with what
you're viewing as well so here you can
see I'm just literally navigating this
like I would do an app I'm obviously
using my cursor but in terms of actually
being on this device you would be using
your finger
so you've got normal things like groups
here you've got sliders that you'd
normally see just buttons in general so
you know I can use this app as I would
do a normal app and you can see here
that we've got loads of loads of widgets
and different uh you know parts of the
framework and obviously we because we're
talking cross-browser we're talking iOS
Android and Blackberry and iOS obviously
includes the iPad as well so that's
brilliant as well
now it's also worth mentioning that we
have a native feel to when we switch
between these devices so we know that as
we've seen we can you know click around
on the the iPad or the iPhone and we
have this native feel to the application
but what about when we choose Android
well we get exactly the same thing we
get a native feel to an Android
application so it feels like the user is
using an app on their phone which is you
know the overall point same with the
BlackBerry as well we get exactly the
same thing so we can choose the
BlackBerry simulator and we have again
the native feel to the application so
this is brilliant it allows the user to
access the application or your
application when you've built it and
then when they tell their friends or
they view it on a different device they
feel like it's built for that device as
well so the benefit here really is you
know rolling out one application for
multiple devices but having that native
feel now while we're talking about this
let's go ahead and look at web just
launched some demos here and have a look
around some of the demos now this is
very similar to jQuery UI but obviously
this is a lot better it's a you know
it's a more refined product so for
example we have things like the
autocomplete which is extremely popular
so when we go ahead and type something
so for example our UN we get United
Kingdom so all of these have been very
fine-tuned and you can see here we've
not just got a drop down we've got a
comma-separated list of countries so we
can choose multiple options
now these don't have a native feel per
se however the reason I brought this up
when talking about native is because we
have theme builders which are extremely
useful so here you can see that we've
got theme builders in terms of building
a different fit well we have a set set
theme so for example if this is similar
to your application theme or your
website theme you'd pick this and then
you'd start to modify it gradually so
you'd be able to modify colors and we
see everything here that you know is on
offer so it just basically allows us to
to mod everything to how we want it to
feel and look on our page so that's
extremely important and this is
extremely easy to use so not only do we
have mobile tailored to sort of native
devices we also have web which is
tailored as well and we've got so many
examples here really really good things
that we can use so for example list
views it's just a good look at this
you know like stuff like binding to
remote data when we just sort of
paginate through here
you know everything here is brilliant
and it's all it's all set up for you
straight away and this is one of the
really really brilliant things another
really good one is a window so I can
sort of drag this around we've got a
sort of a more refined feel to this
obviously can be resized obviously you
know things can be changed here but one
of the good things is about loading
contact but sorry loading content with
Ajax so we can Ajax content into this as
well as you know as well as a variety of
animation effects literally there's all
sorts here as I've said before the best
thing to do here is literally just come
and browse everything here it just makes
everything a lot easier so we've got
these lovely native fields to our
applications we've also got the native
fill to the web in terms of building
themes for that and also a wide variety
of web and mobile widgets so it's
powered by jQuery in terms of the
JavaScript side of stuff and it's so
easy to use you've also got like jQuery
UI app jQuery Mobile sorry but with
jQuery Mobile I found that a bit hard
well much
harder to use this is a lot easier to
use the slightly more boring side of
stuff we've got this data vis which does
play a really really good part in you
know what some people might need to do
and that's data visualization which is
really really hard to do and because
this is using html5 if you load this up
on a mobile device you're going to get
really really good results like
consistently across devices as well
because the majority if not you know up
to nearly 100% of devices now to buy
html5 so my suggestion would be to head
over to Cano you Icom play around
there's something else that I haven't
spoken about which is absolutely
brilliant and that is if we return here
we can go to the this dojo now basically
this allows us if we click launch to go
ahead and start to play around with
everything and we can start to you know
write markup run this and we get our
preview here absolutely brilliant
so basically you can learn this on the
fly with you know you can see your
results on the fly and this means you
don't have to download everything up but
obviously you would want to download and
and run this as well so finally in the
first half of 2013 something really
exciting is happening in terms of PHP
and that is having PHP server side
wrappers so that's something exciting to
look out for as well so it's worth
getting to know this framework and then
when that happens you know you can jump
in and start using that stuff so
basically that's kendo UI it's
definitely something to watch out for
and if you really really want to develop
applications in an absolute breeze you
know go ahead download this and start to
play around with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
