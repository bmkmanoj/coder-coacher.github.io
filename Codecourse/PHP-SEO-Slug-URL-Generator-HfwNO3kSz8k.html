slug generator or a SEO URL friendly
generator that basically allows us to
take a string like this and go ahead and
convert it to something like this
and we're looking at regular expressions
in PHP and this will basically allow us
to just quickly and efficiently remove
what we don't need and add what we need
to make it look like this so let's go
ahead and jump straight into how the
code looks okay so over to our text
editor we're now going to go ahead and
start writing the PHP that we need to
build up this functionality you can see
that I am starting out with a doctype
here and the reason this being is that I
have a child set here set on my page now
what we're going to be doing is we're
also going to be including characters
like these in our SEO URL generation and
typically this wouldn't work so we need
to go ahead and add Unicode support when
we create our regular expressions so
that's why I've created this doctype
we're going to go ahead and create the
function up here and I'm going to call
the function down here in the body and
because we've specifically defined the
child set on our page this will go ahead
and allow characters to look as they do
now we'll go ahead and take a look
towards the end of the video what
happens if you don't declare a child set
and the problem is you'll probably see
in browsers if you don't so the first
thing we really want to do here is just
at the top here go ahead and declare a
function now this can be done preferably
in an external functions file or even
better as part of a class maybe you have
a generic sort of string handling class
to your application but we'll go ahead
and just create a function here just for
simplicity so we can pass a string in
and get a string out so let's go ahead
and call this function create slug and
we need to go ahead and we'll just
define an argument here and call it slug
so there's a couple of things that we
need to do in here and we'll go ahead
and add some comments just so we know
what we need to you know do the first
thing that we need to do is basically
remove anything that isn't letters
numbers spaces or hyphens from the
original string so we need to remove
letters remove sorry anything
that isn't so we need letters removed
anything but letters removed anything
but numbers removed anything that space
is removed and anything about hyphens
removed
and the reason we're going to do this is
because we want to remove what well we
also want to after words remove things
like spaces and duplicate high hyphens
so we're going to do two regular
expressions the first one to do this and
then the second one to just clear
everything up so then we want to go
ahead and remove spaces and duplicate
hyphens because we don't want to go
ahead and include you know two or three
hyphens within a sentence if hyphens
have been included there but we then
want to do is trim the left and right
removing any leftover hyphens so for
example if you have a string like let's
just go ahead and write it down here a
string like this this isn't acceptable
so we want to go ahead and just trim so
we'll just take test here we want to go
ahead and trim this one and we want to
go ahead and trim that one so that's
what we want to do there and that is
pretty much it then we just want to
return the string so let's go ahead and
focus on this we'll leave the comments
just up here and we'll go ahead and
write all the code down here now the
first thing we want to do is go ahead
and redefine the slug variable and this
is going to basically be the first line
here remove anything that isn't letters
number spaces or hyphens so in PHP we
use preg replace or p reg standing for
Perl regular expression and we go ahead
and we pass our regular expression in
here we then choose what we want to
replace this with and in this case we're
removing so all we need to do is replace
with an empty string so then what we
want to go ahead and do is pass in the
string that we want to apply this to and
that's obviously the slug now in a
minute we're going to go ahead and look
at the this and applying a function here
to actually set the lowercase value of
this
we'll go ahead and concentrate on the
regular expression first because that's
probably the most difficult part so
let's go ahead and give out a regular
expression and name a descriptive name
I'm going to call this letters numbers
spaces and hyphens this is basically
going to remove everything that isn't a
lesser number space or -
let's go ahead and put our start and end
to our regular expression so I'm I've
chosen a forward slash and we're going
to go ahead and add Unicode support on
to the end of this so this is called a
modifier the reason why as I said at the
start of the video the reason we need to
provide support for Unicode characters
is because we're using special
characters with accents or anything like
that so within here what do we want to
do well we want to group something in
here and this means match any so
anything we put in here it's going to
match anything but we want to match not
everything but these so we go ahead and
use this modifier here so now what we go
ahead and do is we need to provide the
characters or the or the representation
of what we want to keep in this case
it's a hyphen
so we can't just add a hyphen here
unfortunately we have to do a back slash
- that just escapes this as a something
we want to use literally not as a some
kind of rule or pattern so then we also
want to remove spaces that's just sorry
anything that spaces that's just
backslash s again this is just the way
the modifier looks out then we want to
use P n for numbers and this is because
we're using Unicode support so P n will
basically represent numbers and PL you
probably guessed represents letters we
also want to add the plus modifier on
here because we want to basically
exercise this across the entire string
so now that we've done that let's go
ahead and look at testing this out so
I'm going to go ahead and copy and paste
this regular expression down here and we
remember replacing with nothing let's
just go ahead and call this function and
see where we're at at the moment so I'm
going to go ahead and echo create slug
and then I'm going to go ahead and pass
a string in so I'm going to type this is
an article title that will do for now
suppose let's go ahead and refresh and
oops we didn't return anything so let's
go ahead and return slug so we've
returned that from the function we're
echoing out the result the function here
and it doesn't absolutely nothing so the
reason it's not done anything at the
moment is because we're not actually
adding any hyphens in anywhere and we're
also not setting this to lowercase we do
need this to be a lowercase string so
what we want to go ahead and do now is
just
this out by adding a few hyphens some
extra spaces here and then go ahead and
add some maybe funny characters so let's
go ahead and look at the result of this
so perfect so what it's done is its
removed or so remove those special
characters on the end of here like all
the rubbish I just typed in we've got
this duplicate - - issue but that's fine
we can go ahead and deal with that later
so let's go ahead and do this so we've
got the multiple as in you know at the
moment we're going to remove lots of
spaces this basically means find lots of
within the string as we've already
mentioned this is lots of strict spaces
and that's why this has been removed so
that's been replaced with nothing but
now what we want to go ahead and do is
say slug preg replace again so power
regular expression again and we want to
go ahead and add a regular expression
and this time you want to replace lots
of things with hyphens and that's again
applied to the slug so let's just take a
look at what we actually need to do here
we need to replace any amount of hyphens
with one - because we don't Jupe Jupe
ago hyphens we also want to remount of
spaces replace with a hyphen as well so
let's go ahead and do that now so the
regular expression is going to look like
this and we'll go ahead and give this a
name something like spaces and duplicate
hyphens okay so the regular expression
obviously starts off with two characters
like this so I've chosen forward slash
forward slash and we want to go ahead
and group these so any of these I'm
going to again say forward slash or back
slash story - and back slash s and we
want to match any number of these so any
number of hyphens in that case it'll
remove these and any number of spaces so
that will go ahead and replace all
spaces with a hyphen and all hyphens
with a single - that's exactly what we
want we want to remove them duplicates
so if we go ahead and replace that in
there let's go ahead and echo the slug
out now and there we go so we're halfway
there the only problem is we've got a -
on the end of the string which we'll go
ahead and remove with the trim for
we also need to convert this to
lowercase because at the moment I can
you know write anything I want in
uppercase and it will remain as in that
case so what we do here is we change it
at this point here so I'm going to go
ahead and use the MB STR to lower
function now what this allows me to do
is provide a particular charset so let's
start to bring in some special
characters here and we'll go ahead and
look at how this will work
oops right so what's happened here is
the regular expressions actually
silently failed and that's because I've
not declared a char set if you can see
if I remove this or not not declared
encoding if you see I remove that we get
this added here so everything looks fine
here but when we go ahead and use
something like STR to lower this works
fine but we don't want to use STR to
lower it's not recommended that we do
use this at particularly when we're
dealing with different characters so we
want to go ahead and use MB STR to lower
and then go ahead and define the
character encoding in this case it's
utf-8 so that's going to that's going to
work now you'll see that that works I'm
refreshing and we get the same result
and everything is now lower case and
we've catered for the exact string
length the exact character encoding so
now what we want to do is finally just
go ahead and trim off the - now you
might be familiar with the PHP trim
function but what you may not know is
that you can actually define what you
want to trim from the left and the right
hand side if it was just a space you
could define it like this or like this
we're going to go ahead and choose a -
we want to remove them from the left and
the right in this case we've got one on
the right hand side so when we refresh
that then disappears so what we've now
done with a few fairly complex regular
expressions but nothing too difficult if
you're new to regular expressions these
may look quite complicated we've gone
ahead and taken a string like this a
horrible looking stream like this and
we've converted it to something that
could safely be used in a URL</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
