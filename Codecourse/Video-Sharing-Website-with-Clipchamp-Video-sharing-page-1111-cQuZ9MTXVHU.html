a page that we're going to build and
then we'll start to build out that page
we'll create the template for this and
we'll go ahead pull the data from the
database and create that html5 video
player so under the success callback all
we want to do is say window lot location
and in here this will just forward the
user off to a particular location now in
our case it will be the full path to the
URL and then we can just say video and
then here we want some kind of video
hash now we know that when we send a
request off to our back-end we get back
that hash and this data here will
represent the data that we get back from
sending this Ajax request so all we need
to do is append on data dot hash simple
as that so let's just test this out and
then we'll go ahead and build the page
that we get forwarded to obviously that
won't exist at the moment let's just
quickly upload a video here and you can
see we're redirected off to public video
and then the hash just after here like I
said it's not found but we can now focus
on building this page and pulling
everything together so let's start out
with the template so over in our views
we want to create a new file and this is
just going to be called something like
video doc twig and we can basically just
copy over the home template here because
it's going to have pretty much the same
structure so inside of here we are going
to have the video player so at the
moment is not doing anything you need to
build the route for it so down here
let's say app get and this time it's
going to be video and then it's going to
be the hash so let's create our closure
just here again without quest our
response and our arguments so why don't
we just return this view now just so we
can see that the view is at least
working let's go ahead and render that
with the response
and remember it's video dot twig and we
now see this perfect
so all that we've got left to do now is
take this hash from the arguments in
here look it up in the database send the
data through to the view and then we can
output the source because we have the
source stored in our database so up here
then let's just do a prepared statement
or create a prepared statement to pull
this out and of course we're using
prepared statements to protect against
SQL injection so all we really want is
the source so I'm gonna say select
source from the videos table where the
hash equals and then we have our hash
placeholder so here we're gonna save
video execute and in here we want to
pass in that hash that we get back so
it's from args and it's just called hash
okay so now we can send this through to
our view we can do some checking here if
you want
maybe render a 404 page but what we're
going to be doing is kind of handling
this a little bit more gracefully and
here we're gonna put a message if it
can't be found so for the third argument
of our render method on our view
dependency we want to pass in the data
we want to send through to this for you
in this case is video we want to fetch
the result and we're fetching this as an
object so we use PDS fetch object like
so so now we're technically pulling this
from the database we have that record
it's been passed through if I change
this slightly maybe I'll add an A at the
end it still works but we can handle
that within the view okay so over in our
video view then what do we want to do we
want a very simple if statement to check
if that video exists first of all PDO
would have returned a false if it can be
found so here we can just use an if
statement on video like that and then
otherwise we want to show a message so
let's just end that if there and
here let's say we couldn't find that
video so in our case this works if I add
an A on the end we couldn't find that
video so pretty straightforward we have
a valid video hash and we want to look
at outputting this in a simple video
player so let's create an html5 video
element all we want to do is pull the
source property from that video that we
got back from our database we want some
controls on there and we also want to
give this a class of video player as
well so these came with the course
download but if we just had take a look
you can see that all we're doing is
setting a width of a hundred percent
just so it sits nicely within that
container
so now we can see that we have this
video perfect
so all that's left to do now is kind of
fit this all together by going over to
our home page and uploading a new video
so let's go and do this pull this over
hit submit once that's uploaded we will
be forwarded through to that page with
the right hash and we see our newly
uploaded video that we can not only play
but go ahead and share with other people
as well so what would once be a really
complicated process has been made really
easily mainly because of the clip champ
button we've sent it off to s3 so it's
in a really nice storage area really
really straightforward and then all we
do is store that kind of metadata in our
database and we can go ahead and create
a very simple video sharing website in
not much time at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
