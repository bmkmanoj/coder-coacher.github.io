really simple blog with slim - which is
a lightweight small PHP framework so
this is going to be really useful if you
do need to build an extremely simple
blog you can go ahead and adjust it
later on to suit your needs or if you
want to get into slim and learn how
everything works so we're going to cover
most of the basics in slim we're not
going to cover everything but this
should give you a really good starting
point so let's take a look at how the
blog works again it is extremely simple
on the home page here we just have a
title with posts and we have two posts
both of which are just posts stored in
my database and these are linked to a
user ID so we're going to be doing some
manual SQL joins as well we're not going
to be using an hour I'm like eloquent
we're just going to be doing all of our
queries essentially with our controllers
so these are linked to user ID of one
and that's just an account in here so
when we click through onto these you can
see that we get more information here we
get the date output here we get the full
body of this post and obviously the post
title here may have a link to go back
home as well on here this will actually
truncate anything longer than a certain
amount of characters so it won't show
the full post here and obviously you can
change this up as well
now we're also going to be using twig
because slim comes with a really easy
package if you like where we can just
use twig as we like we can use smart
here as well but my preference is twig
so we'll be looking at doing this as
well so if you do need to learn twig as
well this is a really good thing to get
into so what we're going to do then is
we are going to start off by installing
slim and then we're just gonna get going
on building this up from scratch it's
very basic but hopefully you'll learn
quite a lot from this so we're ready to
get going you can see I have a folder
here called blog which doesn't contain
anything at the moment we are staying
entirely from scratch so the first thing
really to do is install slim and we do
this by using composer which is a pen
team manager for PHP so if you don't
already have can poser installed you can
go ahead and head over to get composer
to or to download that it works on all
operating systems so as long as you have
composer installed you can follow along
with the rest of the video so over in
slims documentation which I'd highly
recommend you check out if you do want
to do anything more than beyond the
scope of this video we have the
installation instructions here so via
composer we can just run this command
what this is going to do is it's going
to require in slim and then slim and
we're going to pull in two of
non-breaking versions incremental
versions here using this tilt so we can
either run this or we can Crower own
composer file let's go ahead and just
run this command so I'm going to pull up
my terminal and I'm currently within the
blog directory and I'm just going to go
ahead and run this make sure you have
composer installed and this is just
going to go ahead and generate your
composer JSON file so that's going to go
and add that to your composer JSON file
and download Slim so let's just give
that a moment to complete so now that
that is done we need to look at the
basics of working with slim and then
what we're going to do is we're gonna
pull in slim views as well so let's
start out then just by sort of
structuring our project in the way that
we want to work with it now when you're
using sim we don't have things like
controllers and models predefined for us
it's a very very lightweight micro
framework so we're gonna structure our
project in a sensible way so this
actually all comes together in a way
that we can separate our application
nicely so the first thing I'm going to
do then is I'm going to create a new
folder called public this is essentially
where all of your style sheets Java
Script
anything like that will go and this will
also include our index.php file as well
so when you are hosting this you're
going to want to have your web root set
to public and this is where your users
are going to hit obviously if you have a
domain they'll just go to your domain
and then this will be the web root so
what we want to do in here then
is go ahead and create a new file and we
will name this index top PHP this this
is the only file in this folder so in a
minute what we're gonna do is we're
gonna create an app folder and this is
going to contain a start file which is
going to set up slim for us pull in
anything we need add items to the
container for example our database
dependency because we do need to go
ahead and pull items in from our
database so we'll go ahead and create
that app folder now and this is also
where our roots are going to be stored
now views as well so let's create a new
file in here and we'll call this start
dot PHP so this is where all the magic
is going to happen in terms of loading
in slim so the first thing that we want
to do is actually pull in our composer
autoloader so we actually have slim
available to us when we run that
composer command earlier it's generated
our vendor folder with slim inside of
here so all of the files in here you can
go ahead and look at the source code
which I'd highly recommend you do but we
also have this auto loader so that
should go and require this in we're not
gonna be using parse we're not storing
parsing config I'm just going to go
ahead and do it like this
so we're going back a directory into the
vendor folder and then we're pulling in
Auto load so to create a new slim
application we give this a variable or
we name this using a variable and we
create a new slim instance now this is
named space so we can either say slim
slim here or you could go ahead and up
here say something like use slim slim
and then just say new slim so it's
entirely up to you the way that you do
this just for now that I'm just gonna do
this all in line just so it's a little
bit tidier so inside of here we have an
array that we can pass options to our
application we're not going to be doing
this just yet where we are going to be
using it a bit later on when we look at
the views of our application which is
just the output that the user is going
to see and we'll be pulling in twig or
Slim twig in in there so the next thing
to do is load in our database
so if
we do that does just take a look at the
structure of our database just so you
know how to go ahead and create this so
we'll start with the users table if we
just head over to the structure here
we've got an ID which is the primary key
of this table and it's an auto increment
as well so this'll increment for every
record we create so if you are creating
this from scratch go ahead and add an
auto increment we have a user name which
is a varchar' of 255 in length I've just
left these as the defaults we've allowed
an null on all of these as well
and we have a first name in her last
name it's entirely up to you what else
you include in here and then once you've
got that set up in that structure you
can go ahead and just add a record in
here and then make a note of the user ID
we're going to be manually creating the
records inside of our database so we're
not going to be giving the ability to
actually create these so inside of our
posts table then let's just take a look
at the structure again we've got an ID
which is obviously an integer it's
unsigned a primary key and we're auto
incrementing on this as well we have a
title which is a varchar of 255 again
all of these are allowing null values if
they haven't been entered we have a body
which is text so we can enter a lot more
in here that's a more suitable type of
column we have a user ID which is an
integer and we have a created which is a
timestamp so what we can do here is if
you want to change the day of this you
can just type now use the now function
that just goes ahead and gives you the
current date and time so we've now got
two posts in here go ahead and create
them if you haven't already and we've
got one user and these posts both belong
to that user so we can do a join when we
go ahead and pull in these records so to
actually connect to our database in our
application let's just pop a comment
here we're gonna use Slim's container to
add a single turn to this and we name
this within the first argument so this
is how we're going to access our
database instance and then we have a
closure just here so that's it and in
here we just return a new instance of
PDO or whatever we're using to connect
to our database I'm going to be using
PDO it's pretty straightforward nice to
use so we're going to return a new PDO
and then in here we're gonna choose that
we want a MySQL database I'm currently
using a MySQL database we choose our
host which for me is 1 to 7 or not the 1
so just a local host and we choose our
database name in this case it's Project
if we just head over to sequel Pro you
can see project up here and then we
choose our username and our password in
this case for me I'm just developing
locally its root and root so now what we
want to do then is say app run that's it
so we just say app run and now anywhere
within this as long as we've included
start file we can use app to define
routes and anything else we want to do
so we now need to look at actually
including our routes which are going to
be basically when we say well I want to
go home or I want to go to a particular
post we can do that and obviously public
now has that index file in it so we're
not doing anything in there at the
moment but that's why we're not seeing a
directory listing anymore so inside of
index dot PHP we want to require our
start file in so we'll run over this in
just a minute in case you're confused
but let's go through the journey of
hitting public and then going through
don't worry about this too much just yet
we'll fix this up in a moment so over in
our public directory then we are hitting
app start PHP or including that rather
requiring it in in start dot PHP we're
pulling in our auto loader so we can use
slim which we've created under this app
variable we've gone ahead and created a
container item which is our database and
we've just returned a connection to our
database we'll see how we use this later
and then we've said app run now let's
take a look at a very very simple route
within slim just so we can get the idea
of this and we'll get rid of this 404
error so what we do is we say app so
this can be anywhere in our project
we'll be including a routes file in a
minute which will hold all of our routes
and we say get so we're using a get
request to this URL in this case I'm
just going to do a forward slash because
that's just our public or root directory
just showing our homepage maybe and then
in here we have a closure so anything we
want to do on that page we write in here
so what we can do is we can also say use
app which means what we can now use Slim
within this which is really important
we'll see in a moment I'm not going to
include that just yet we'll just create
a very basic example of outputting hello
and if we head over to our browser and
refresh you can see we see hello there
so that is our first route we're
defining where we want the user to land
to be able to see this and that's done
and obviously we can change this as well
so you can have /home and if we did
forward slash home we don't get anything
found now the reason for this is what's
actually happening here is we don't have
an HT access file to deal with anything
after this being passed into our index
dot PHP file so what we need to do is in
public create a new HT access file if
you're using nginx this is going to be
slightly different by i'm using apache
so i'm gonna create my htaccess file
just there and let me just spell that
correctly
htaccess and inside of here I'm not
going to go through this because it's
not entirely relevant but you can find
snippets like this online all we're
doing here is we're just routing
everything through to index dot PHP
that's it and that way Slim's going to
be able to pick up the fact that you're
on a particular URL and then go ahead
and route you in the right place so when
I hit enter now we get hello so as long
as you have your htaccess file in place
I'll just bring that up again so you can
go ahead and copy that and you have your
index dot PHP file just in here with
including your start which we have
everything here then you're really just
good to go remember we have our database
connection as well so I'm going to get
rid of this root here because we don't
really want to clutter this file with
all of our roots what we're going to do
is inside of our app directory here
we're going to create a routes folder
and inside of here we can then
subcategory based on which pages this is
for so in the root of this directory I'm
going to create a new home dot PHP file
and this is
just going to contain the root for our
homepage so let's go ahead and do pretty
much exactly what we did a minute ago so
that say root gets forward slash that's
just our root directory and then it's
just echo out home just as an example so
obviously if we're doing things like
creating a new folder for posts and
create a new folder for admin or
moderation or whatever else you have
within your application this is going to
get a little bit messy so we need to
basically find a single file to include
all of these routes and if this doesn't
make sense just yet it will become clear
a little bit later so just bear with
this so inside of the app directory not
the root directory I'm going to create a
new file that's going to require in all
the routes for my application so I'm
going to call this route stop PHP and
I'm going to go ahead and define where
which files I want to include in so I'm
going to require in routes home PHP so
we're inside of the and it's just close
off this we're inside of the app
directory wherever we include this
routes file it's going to include routes
home and then we can go ahead and pull
in posts as well if we want to so where
do we include this routes file
well we include it pretty much where we
just created our test route a minute ago
so let's just require in routes dot PHP
so now we shouldn't see any difference
as long as we're on our home page here
we just see home so now we've got a nice
way to include all all of the routes
within our application so this file can
get pretty long but we're defining or
splitting up all of our routes within
these different fold these different
files and folders so what we want to do
now then is look at on our home page
showing all of the posts within our data
within our database and then just
outputting them to the user and this is
going to bring us over to working with
twig as our template engine to actually
show them on the page and if you've not
used twig before don't worry too much
it's pretty straightforward to pick up
but it gives a really nice way of
actually working with view
so let's start doing something useful
then and actually grabbing our posts
from within this route and then what
we'll do is we'll slowly work our way
into actually displaying these on the
home page to a user
so we've already defined this route but
there's something else I'd like to add
to this and this is giving this route
and name and the reason this is useful
is because when we are using twig the
package for Slim that allows us to work
with twig gives us functions like URL
for which will generate a URL by giving
the name of a route and this is really
handy because it means that if you
change for example this - home you don't
have to go through all of your
application and update every single URL
that you're pointing for and this will
become a lot clearer later so bear with
me if this doesn't make too much sense
at the moment so after this then all we
do is we use the name method to give
this a name and we just passed whatever
we want to call this route in here so
home makes sense for just a forward
slash so inside of here then we do need
to use remember app DB this is the
singleton that we attach to our
container so we need to go ahead up here
and say use app remember that's our
variable that we have here so we can
actually access DB from app okay so over
in home then let's go ahead and pull in
all of our posts so we're going to
assign something to posts we're gonna
say app DB now all the PDO functionality
that we would normally expect is within
this DB instance within our container so
we can just say something like query and
then we can go ahead and pass some SQL
in pull out the records and just display
them in the view so in here we're gonna
select let's just go down post dot star
so everything from posts and we'll go
ahead and we'll leave it that just for
now and we'll select that from posts and
we're going to left join the users table
because remember we are storing a user
ID here
and we have our users table just here
and we're going to do that on the posts
user ID equaling the users
I D that just means that this matches up
to this ID here so we're just linking
that in so immediately after this we'll
go ahead and fetch all records and we'll
go ahead and fetch these as an
associative array so we use PDO fetch
our sock for associative and let's just
go and do a var dump on posts and then
let's just kill the page there so now we
see this so we've got first post you can
see here and second post here so it
looks a little bit messy just at the
moment but we'll go ahead and actually
do something useful with this as well so
what we want to do then is where we have
our user ID we actually want to select
our author's name so just to do this we
want to concatenate Alex and Garrett
together so the first and last name we
want to output that something like as
author so what we do here is we use the
my SQL concat function and we say users
dot first name and then we choose comma
separated list of what we want to
concatenate so last names this is the
first name of the user then a space and
then the surname of the user and then
we're going to call that as author so
this is what we're calling the variable
so we'll just put that on the nos in
uppercase sorry okay so now we pretty
much have everything we need if we
refresh now you can see author is now
Alex Garrett or whichever user is so now
what we want to do is actually dive into
views now there's a couple of things
that we need to take into account here
over on our start file we are not doing
or we're not defining where our views
are kept and we haven't even created a
folder to take care of our views yet so
let's just start to do this and see what
happens so inside of my app folder I'm
going to create a new folder called
views and this is going to store all of
our views so again I'm going to create a
new file in here and I'm going to call
this home dot PHP and this is my home
view so let's go over to our route for
our home and we'll just
render out a view as we normally would
so we'll just say app render home dot
PHP and then in here we as a second
argument we can pass an array of data we
want to send to that view so in this
case I'm going to say posts and assign
the posts we just grabbed to that
variable which will become available in
this home dot PHP view and the only
problem here is we need to do well
initially we might need to go ahead and
say go back a directory into this
directory and find home dot PHP because
this wig sorry slim doesn't know where
this is so if we do refresh now we're
going to get an application error and
the message here is view cannot render
home dot PHP because the templates not
exist so what we want to do then is
inside of our start file we want to
define where our views are kept it's
down here let's just create a comment
for views and we want to say view equals
app view and then from this variable
just here we can start adding any
options we want to so we're going to
save you set templates directory and
then we can define that so it's back a
directory app and views and that's
pretty much it so we now have set our
template directory now when i refresh we
see home view so we're now rendering
that home view here from this route here
using this so that's how we do views but
we don't really want to go ahead and use
things like for each posts as post it's
gonna get a little bit messy I want to
go ahead and use tweak for this so we
need to install slim views and it's just
as easy as installing slim because it's
all pulled through using composer so
let's go ahead and run this command here
or we could add it manually to our
composer lot JSON file if we wanted to
but let's go ahead and run this so let's
just paste that in and hit enter and
that's going to go ahead and pull this
pull this down so now
this is being pulled down we see a
message here slim view suggests
installing smarty and swig all this
means is either or that you want to use
and we're working with twig here so we
need to install twig so all we do is we
go ahead and say composer and store
sorry composer require twig and we'll
let that finish and there we go
so now we have slim which we've already
installed we know this
we've got slim views and we've got twig
as well so we can use slim views as a
helper within slim to go ahead and
render twig templates so nothing's going
to have actually changed here because we
haven't defined that we want to use our
twig extension so we need to do this
within our start file here now remember
earlier I said we can pass options
through to slim when we instantiate it
and what we're gonna do now is we're
going to choose what we want to use for
our views so this is within slim views
and it's just tweaked and that's pretty
much it but now what we want to do is we
want to go ahead and define the posit
extensions and this is under view that
we created earlier in order to see our
templates directory so we need to do say
view parser extensions and then we go
ahead and assign an array to this and in
this case we're gonna pass in a new
instance of slim views twig extension
that's pretty much it so now when i
refresh nothing has changed
still but what this actually means is
now we can use twig within our templates
so let's just start then by building up
our home page and listing through the
posts that we have and just outputting
them to the user and then we'll look at
creating our post show page to actually
show the post and we'll hook these up
with the URLs and everything else we
need to do so let's create a header here
and just write posts in here
and now we're gonna start getting into
some of the twig templating so what we
want to do is we use here a curly
bracket and we use a percentage sign
much like you'd use a starting and
ending PHP tag so we're gonna say if
posts is empty already looks nicer than
a horrible standard if statement we're
gonna do something in there and then
what we want to do is say else and then
down here we want to end that if
statement so if posts is empty we are
just gonna output a paragraph saying no
posts yet we won't actually see this
because we already have some posts in
our database but otherwise we want to
loop through these so let's go ahead and
say for post in posts all that means is
it's this is similar to a for each all
we're doing is saying for each posts and
we're calling that post so we now have
access inside of this control structure
to go ahead and output our post so let's
just start with an easy one we'll say
post title so to output we use curly
braces like this so we say post title
and when we go and refresh we see this
her first post second post that's just
pretty much what we are pulling through
from our database and what's really nice
about twig is that we get this dot
notation so instead of having to do post
title because this is an array or a
collection of arrays we don't have to do
this so we can just say post title much
easier so let's create a div just with
the class of posts we're not attaching
these Styles here we'll go ahead and
create a header in here we'll create an
anchor and then within here we'll write
our post title so we have the following
and the user is going to be able to
click on that and down here we'll have
our post body so let's go ahead and say
host body and what gonna do here is
we're going to limit this to 50
characters so we use these square
brackets we use a codon and then the
amount of characters we want to truncate
it to and then we'll have another div
with a class of author again you can
star this if you want and
we'll say bye and then we also post to
author remember that's the concatenated
two columns we did earlier so now that
we've done this let's just take a look
at this and it's looking pretty good we
can go ahead and click on these they
don't go anywhere at the moment but we
now have a list of our posts so we've
already learned quite a bit about the
slim framework in terms of just the way
it works we've learnt how we do
something in here pass it to a view
we've also named this route which is
gonna really be really important when we
generate the URL to go back again but
now what we want to do is we want to
create a new route within posts and this
is going to be our show route to be able
to show a post so let's create a new
file just in here and we'll save this as
show dot php' and this is going to be
app yet and then we'll go ahead and
choose a name for this and we'll say
posts and now what we want to do is be
able to pass in a variable to this and
then access it so we can go ahead and
look into our database what post we want
to actually output so in this case it's
post ID I'll just call this again we
have our closure just here and we want
to use ah so we can get access to our
container to go ahead and query our
database and the only difference here is
how do we pick up this variable that's
posted via the URL all we do is we add
it to here as an argument and then we
have access to this inside of here so if
I just echo post ID from in here we'll
see how this works so at the moment we
don't have links for these we're gonna
add these in a little bit later but now
what I can do is say post one or post
two when I hit this we get not found so
let's have a look of course so we
haven't included it in our routes file
suppose hey routes posts showed up PHP
remember that's routes post show and
when we refresh we get one we had two on
the end we get two so we now have access
to this variable so now what we can do
let's just close these off since we
don't need them at the moment ears we
can hit our database
in that particular record and then we
can go ahead and output it to the user
we're going to be repeating a little bit
of the querying that we did earlier this
is why I would recommend you eventually
use an object relational mapper like
eloquent or really anything else but we
are repeating a little bit here just to
warn you this probably isn't the best
approach so we're gonna say post I'm
going to assign to this app DB prepare
we're gonna use a prepared statement
here now because remember we're taking
an ID from the URL we don't have just
plunk out into a query without escaping
it properly so we're going to use a
prepared statement so we're going to
select again a similar deal we're gonna
select posts dot star we're going to
concatenate together the user first name
with a space and users dot last name and
we're going to call that author and
we're gonna select all this from posts
but then we're going to join in join on
our users table so we're going to do a
left join on users and that's going to
be on the posts user ID being the same
as how users to ID but now we need a
where clause because we want to only
pick out the post that the users defined
in the URL so I'm gonna say where posts
dot ID equals and then we're gonna give
a placeholder just here now this isn't
the same as what we've done up here so
don't confuse this and this all this is
is a PDO placeholder which we can go
ahead and pass in in just a moment when
we execute this which we're going to do
just now so gonna say post execute and
we pass in a list of things to bind here
cerise a post ID so this is relating to
this remember not this and we're gonna
pass in the post ID that we get from the
URL so all it's doing is basically
selecting a post whichever whichever
post the users defined in the URL
so now what we want to do is so post I'm
going to reassign fetching this I'm
gonna fetch this again as an associative
array now what happens if the post isn't
found now at the moment what we could do
is do a var dump on post and then just
kill the page and we can see that if we
say post one we get that first post post
two we get that second post but if it
isn't found so for example post three it
looks like we've got all false on this
post variable so we can actually go
ahead and use this to output a 404 if
that post isn't found so we need here is
an if statement to say if not post we're
gonna use slims not found method which
is going to go ahead and render a 404
error so now we can go ahead and render
a view which doesn't exist at the moment
but we'll create it so I'm gonna say
it's going to be in views and then a
posts folder and then it's going to be
showed up PHP and what do we want to
pass through to this or you want to pass
our post in and that's going to be the
post just here so if it's not found we
don't get any further than this
otherwise we just render this posts show
view so let's go ahead and in our views
folder create a posts folder create a
new file in here called show dot PHP and
then we'll just say show post for now so
again a refresh in here we didn't get
anything but if we do post one show post
post to show posts so we need to build
up this page as well so let's build up
our view for showing a particular post
this is really easy so remember we
already have this post variable sent
through to this view so we really need
to do is create say an h1 and output
post title and a paragraph
output post body and then we have our
author container again and we're just
gonna say bye and we'll so post to
author and then we can say on and we can
maybe output the created dates a post
are created and then when we go ahead
and refresh we see this so we can go
back again or back to home we can click
on second post well we can't actually
click on it other moments we'd have the
URLs in place but we can go to the
second post that's the first post etc so
let's start just tying up the rest of
the functionality and what we need to do
is link our post here to our actual
first post page and what we also need to
do is on this page we need to link back
home now if you're observant you would
have known that I didn't give this a
name I didn't give this root name so we
actually need to do that so down here
again we use the name method and we say
post so that's it
so now that we've got this here we can
from our home page so let's just close
all of these off and get in shape of
this so in our home view we can update
our href attribute on our anchor to
point to that post and then on our show
page we can create an anchor up here to
say back home we can do the same here to
go back to the home page so let's start
with our homepage which is listing all
of our posts now to do this we need to
use the URL for helper so I'm outputting
something here so I'm using two curly
brackets either side we have this URL
for helper here which allows us to
define building up a URL for a
particular named root so in this case
it's posts show remember that root here
as posts dot shows its name so we can go
ahead and do this but that's not gonna
be enough because what's gonna happen
here is when I click on this it's going
through and giving us the place holding
in the URL that we defined with now
posts show root
we need to pass here some options to
this so it knows what to replace within
that placeholder it's been here we can
say post id and this is going to be post
to ID it's all we're doing is we're
saying URL for the first argument being
the name of the route the second being
this object with the name of the
placeholder here and then the value of
the place hold it here so remember for
each loop in this this is going to be 1
and then for the second it's going to be
2 or whatever ID you're using so now
when we refresh we can click on this and
go through to the first post we can
click on this and go to the second post
easy as that and you've probably already
worked out the over on our show page
it's just going to be even easier here
because we were only going to one route
or just a static route with no
placeholders being passed in so we just
say URL for home that's it so when i
refresh and I click back home that takes
me back and I can just now navigate
around so that is pretty much it for our
final product we've learned a little bit
about slim and how it works a really
good way to structure your application
to keep your routes which are
essentially here acting as controllers
to your application and then we've
looked at installing twigs so we can
actually render this an output using
twig which is I'm sure you'll agree a
little bit cleaner than just using PHP
tags and that is pretty much it the only
thing really to say is that what we've
been doing inside of here using these
queries is a little bit verbose it's a
little bit annoying it can't be updated
easily we've replicated our SQL query
pretty much exactly through both of
these so I recommend you go ahead and
check out using an ORM like eloquent
which is really good and it can be
easily integrated into your slim
application this just means you can
start to introduce models to your
application as well if you are psr-4
autoloading within composer this makes
it really easy to just easy just pull in
models and go ahead and do whatever you
need with them in this case post
being model and we'd be sorted for both
of these we wouldn't have to replicate
the code like it is but that's a little
bit advanced this was a video just to
introduce you into slim getting it
installed installing twig and creating a
very basic blog application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
