some of the elements of the upload
button including the circle to signify
that a image is actually uploading and
you can find a load more about this over
on the documentation if you just head
over and go under the cookbook section
under visual tweaks and you can find out
how to do this here so let's start with
the button color so we go ahead and just
inspect this element we can find pretty
much everything we need in here that we
can actually style so for example the
actual button itself how do we do this
well here you can see that this has
selected the button we have a couple of
classes on here and the one that we want
to style is upload care widget button
open if we just go ahead and grab this
class we're just going to do the styling
at the top here just to make things a
little simpler but of course you'd want
to do this in an external style sheet we
can literally just target this and then
change things like the border the
background color really whatever you
want to do so in our case let's just go
and set the background color to say a
slate gray of course you can do whatever
you want so now you can see we have a
different color of course you can just
play around with this in the browser as
well if you want to this will inherit
your site's font as well so you can see
at the moment is just a really bad
default browser fun of course whichever
Funt you're pulling in for your body
this is going to inherit from it so
there's a ton of things that we can do
here as well so what we can also do is
style the drag-and-drop display so you
can see here that as I drag a file into
my browser we get this drop a file here
so how do we go ahead and star this well
if we just have a look just around here
you can see if we just searched around
you'll find the drag and drop area now
of course by default this is a display
of none so we can just uncheck this and
you can see here that we have the drag
and drop area so this MIT now makes it
easy to just go ahead and start it so
what I'd recommend you do is just fiddle
around
the styles so for example if you wanted
say in a white background and you wanted
the border to be solid for example
obviously that looks bad but you get the
picture all you need to then do is grab
the class name pull it over into your
style sheet and go ahead and start to
modify it so let's say we wanted the
border width here to be three pixels
instead of the default one pixel well of
course now what's going to happen is we
have that new style in there so it's all
about kind of finding what you want to
style and then just applying them styles
okay so we're going to look at the
circle now when we drag a file over here
you can see that we get that kind of
circle and by default it's just that
kind of yellowy orange color so what we
want to do is style this circle again
how are we going to do this without
actually seeing in the browser well of
course if we just have a look in here we
have upload care widget circle canvas
now if we go ahead and look at this you
can see we have a color that's that kind
of mustardy color I spoke about earlier
and we have a border color as well so
what does that actually mean well of
course let's go ahead and uncheck this
you can see this circle here now the
color here is the color of the fill so
the fill of this I think we could
probably and the border color is the
background that might seem a little bit
weird but this is just the way the
elements rendered to make a lot easier
so all we really need to do then is just
grab this we don't need the canvas part
on here what we can now do though is
grab the color so we can change the
color so in this case let's go for white
and then let's say well we want the
border color here to be black so we're
going to have a white fill on a black
background so now when I go ahead and
upload this you can see we get a
completely different effect so really
straightforward it's so easy to style
this kind of stuff and like I said there
is a section in the manual for visual
tweaks so you
go ahead and check out how to do this
and it gives you a few examples as well
as well as things like an image preview
when you upload and you've got the CSS
here the JavaScript and the HTML sample
here as well as the result okay so that
pretty much covers it for styling the
more interesting thing that we want to
take a look at is the content delivery
network which we've already touched on
but we're going to look at some of the
options that we can pass through to the
URL in order to do some things like
resize scale to change the quality as
well I'm also going to look at what we
use on code course to resize an avatar
that's been uploaded so let's jump over
there and take a look at how we do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
