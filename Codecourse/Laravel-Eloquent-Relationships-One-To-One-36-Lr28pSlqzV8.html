relationship but what about the has one
relationship want to demonstrate this
I'm going to create a new table and I'm
going to call this addresses and this
will have a user ID and it will have a
country and let's leave it at that
obviously if this was an actual website
we'd have things like street name and
County or state things like that but
this is just a demonstration so not to
worry so I'm going to add my country
which is United Kingdom and I'm also
going to add Alex's country which is
United Kingdom as well but because just
to demonstrate this I'm going to change
that to United States what I want to do
is replace all of this lower absent text
with their country so back in my editor
what I'm going to do is first create a
new model called
address the PHP so class address extends
eloquent and now I'm going to get rid of
all of this and now what we want to do
is go to our user model and make sure
that we can actually grab the user's
address it's a public function address
and this time if you think about it the
user doesn't have many addresses he just
has one or in most cases at least so
instead of saying has many like we did
last time we're going to say has one and
again we're going to whoops has one and
again we're going to reference the model
so back in here I'm going to get rid of
that second paragraph I'm going to say
address and that should probably be a
strong tag and then what we're going to
do is echo user address country and
we'll change that to country just to be
a bit more explicit so back in the
browser hit refresh and there we have it
on Alex's profile we have country United
States which we set in the database just
now and if we go back to my profile
country United Kingdom perfect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
