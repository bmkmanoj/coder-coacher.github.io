gonna look at how we can make these test
methods a little bit cleaner a little
bit easier to read and this is just how
I prefer to do things so at the moment
we know that we have to prefix all of
our tests with the keyword test makes
sense so we know that it's a test and of
course what you can do within tests if
you wanted to is create an entirely
different method so you could create
something like get user model and you
could call that from within any of your
tests so it just works like a normal
class now we're gonna look in the next
part how we can use the setup method
within PHP and it's a new upper you user
for us before we call each test but for
now we're really just concerned about
the way that these look and about the
way that they actually read now we know
that for each test this should very
nicely describe how or what's going on
in this particular test so in this case
then wouldn't it be much nicer if we
could say something like that we can get
the first name like so to me because
it's unseparated by underscores it just
looks a lot nicer I can read this a lot
better than I can any of these other
methods so this is all well and good but
this test won't actually be run now we
can prove this by killing the page here
and just outputting anything and going
ahead and running our tests once again
and you can see here that this
confidently we know now has not been run
now that's because we haven't prefixed
it with tests now what we could do is
prefix this with tests but I find it a
lot easier to create a doc block for
this so what I can do here is I can say
and test or at sign sorry test and that
is it now that we've done this this will
actually be included in our tests so we
can define lots of different things out
within dot blocks before our tests if we
wanted to adjust certain settings for
certain tests that we're building we can
do that as well there's a lot of
information about that in PHP unit it's
unlikely that you're always going to
need to do that but in this case I'm
just saying this is a test and now I
have to find my own way of writing this
out so let's go over run this again and
we can see that now instead
six Tests we get seven tests and eleven
assertions this is now being run with
our new structure so we can do this for
all of them are not going to I'll let
you decide what's best for you I'm not
saying that this is the best way to do
it it just really depends on how you
feel comfortable writing these out
obviously who we here we have the
addition of an adopt lock so for some
people I know that I've spoken to this
is a little bit Messier but it's
entirely up to you so now that we've
done that we're going to quickly move on
to the next part and look at how we can
clear up the newing up of a user model
using the PHP unit setup method and
we'll talk a little bit about how this
is working behind the scenes and it may
be something that you want to use going
forward so let's move on to that and
then later we're going to look at
testing some more mini projects and
things will start to get a little bit
more interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
