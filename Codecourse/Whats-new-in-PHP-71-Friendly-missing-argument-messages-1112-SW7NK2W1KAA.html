almost didn't cover it but I think it
makes sense to look at the kind of
different error messages that have
changed within PHP as well now to take
an example of this we're first of all
going to hop over to PHP 7 and we're
just going to build out a really simple
method within a user class let's say we
had an avatar and inside of this we
could specify a size now in here we
might return say some kind of avatar
from wherever and we may have the size
appended on to the query string like so
so let's go ahead and you up this user
so it's create a new instance of this
and go ahead and echo out user avatar
but we're not going to provide that size
value so let's go over to PHP 7 give
that a refresh and we can see missing
argument 14 user-avatar called in blah
blah blah the usual stuff now the change
in PHP 7.1 if we just copy this over to
lv m makes a little bit more sense if we
just give this a refresh you can see
here uncaught argument count error too
few arguments to function user-avatar 0
past now interestingly what we can do is
change this over so the error actually
changes so if we go ahead and set maybe
a default let's say the default avatar
is default.jpg let's look at how the
error changes when we refresh so you can
see here at too few arguments 0 passed
in and at least one expected so it's
really just improving the way that this
report so and at least one expected
whereas if we take this back over to PHP
7 you can see that the error message is
a little less friendly so again we're
saying missing argument for one it's not
giving us that additional information
like it is here at least one expected so
again this is a really simple one but I
think it makes sense to output much
nicer error messages particularly as PHP
has a reputation for outfitting error
messages that don't always make that
much sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
