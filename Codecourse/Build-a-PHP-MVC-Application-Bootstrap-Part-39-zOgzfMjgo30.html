our application I am currently in the
public directory which is where we've
discussed users will land there's
nothing in here at the moment let's
create a new file in here I'm going to
call this index.php so let's just save
that out as index.php and this is where
you're obviously users will land on
because I have this set as a index file
so now what's going to happen is within
here we want to require in the
initialization file and the
initialization file is basically stored
within an app and you don't really need
this but it's nice to separate it and
the initialization file will requiring
all the core components that you need so
let's do a require once on app in it whp
and i'll see we've done double dot there
just to go back a directory because
we're in public we need to come out of
here into app and then we need to call
the in it up PHP file not at the moment
this obviously doesn't exist we get a
warning here so let's create this inside
of here and we will call this init dot
PHP for initialization so we now need to
require in the two core files basically
all the to talk core classes that we're
going to be using and that is within the
core directory so let's create these two
core files and I'll explain a little bit
about what these do
the first one is app PHP so this is a
class we won't actually define this just
yet
but this is going to be what you call a
new instance of in fact let's just
define this out and within init we want
to require this in so let's do a require
once on this and it's obviously within
the core directory so we say core app
dot PHP so now within index what we can
do is we can say app is new app or we
don't really need to define brackets
because there's no parameters to pass
through so this now is cool
is basically creating a new app instance
and this is where we were the reason we
don't need to create lots of different
files so say if you had a know a contact
page you wouldn't go ahead and create a
new file in here in public and call it
contact PHP you'd handle that within
your controllers so onto controllers we
also need a new file which is going to
be our controller core and this is going
to allow us to access methods like view
and model to load in models and render
views so let's call this class
controller so let's save this inside of
our core directory so we've now got app
and controller perfect so let's just
require this in as well there we are so
now with bootstrap because we've created
a new application instant so this is
instantiating the app class that we've
created this that's now creating an
object
we'll go ahead and in here create like a
construct function which will do things
when we load this up and controller is
going to you know do things like models
and views and things like that but now
this is working so when we refresh
everything should be okay
perfect so just testing this out then if
we create a construct method in here and
we just echo something out there we are
we can now see that that should work
perfect so we've actually successfully
bootstrap now this is all working and we
can now move on to actually route things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
