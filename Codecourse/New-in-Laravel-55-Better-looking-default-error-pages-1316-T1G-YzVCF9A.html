went wrong or something can be found we
saw a pretty ugly error page that's all
changed in laravel 5.5 where if we go
ahead and say render out a view that
doesn't exist here we will get a much
nicer looking error page now in this
case we don't because we are currently
in local development and of course we
would expect to see works which we've
already covered in this series now the
only difference is if we go over to our
EMV farm we switch our environment over
to production and we go ahead and turn
app to bug off of course this doesn't
make a difference but this does we will
see the following so it looks a lot
nicer and this is still customizable and
we've covered that in co course before
as well but for a just a generic
application if something goes wrong this
now looks a little bit better and it's
the same if something doesn't exist as
well so for example if we go ahead and
choose a page that doesn't exist we see
a much nicer page here as well now this
also applies to if you're using root
model binding at a particular model
can't be found either by its primary key
or the key that you specify so for
example if we were to say user equals
and go ahead and use user to find a
particular record this isn't gonna work
because we are just gonna see a null
value here we just pull the namespace in
for this if we just died dump on user
very quickly you get a null for this
value but if you use something like find
or fail this is gonna go ahead and give
you the same error so sorry the page
you're looking for could not be found
and it's the same if you would say where
ID is 10,000 and then first or fail
you're gonna see exactly the same thing
because this method will throw a not
found HTTP exception now like I said the
same thing happens if you were to use
root model binding to pull a user in so
let's say you had a users end point and
you were pulling in a user model in this
case by its primary key and you were
accepting a user in here this is also
going to fail if it can't be found so if
we had over to users and again ten
thousand we're gonna get exactly the
same problem
if of course we pluck one out that does
exist we don't see that error so really
really simple here it's just changed
InDesign switching this out for a custom
page works in the same way it has done
as always but at least if you don't want
to do that you have a nicer looking page
if something goes wrong or something
can't be found</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
