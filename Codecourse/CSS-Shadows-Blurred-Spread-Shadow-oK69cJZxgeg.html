looking at applying a box shadow to a
rectangular or square element on our
page and we're going to be focusing on
the blur radius and spread radius
attributes for box-shadow we're going to
be doing this in a way that we can reuse
the shadow anywhere else on the page by
targeting a class and we're going to end
up with something like this where we
have an element here and we have this
nice shadow underneath it so let's start
looking at some code for this here's the
HTML structure that I'll be using and
this is basically just a simple html5
structure and that will use for any any
document really thought we will develop
these days key thing to note is this
link here which links to our style
sheets which is right here in which is
where I'm going to be applying the box
shadow later on so the first thing to do
is just add a div and we'll use this as
the box and we'll start this up and
provide the shadow to this element so
I'm going to give it a class of shadow 2
and that is all the market will need now
let's do some styling so we get to
remove and the default margin on the
page and provide a background color of a
slightly gray color and then get to
style up the divot self and before
applying the shadow to it so just
starting up the dev I'm going to give it
a color a white color and I'm going to
give it a width of 400 pixels a height
of 200 pixels and some padding some
margin
so margin and I'm going to float it left
so let's see what that looks like on
page a moment we just have our element
with no shadow now to apply the shadow
so I need to target the shadow to class
with this selector here and now I can
apply the box shadow now in this case
we're going to provide five and five
attributes to box shadow the first one
is going to be the X offset which in
this case I'm going to provide zero
pixels the second one is going to be the
Y offset which is going to be 20 pixels
so what that means is the shadow is
going to prude 0 pixels to left the
right of the element but 20 pixels below
it and then I'm going to provide a blur
radius and a spread radius and a color
so I'm just going to apply the color now
and show you what that looks like and
then add the blur radius and spread
radius in afterwards so here I am adding
a color with a red green blue alpha
value and let's look at what this looks
like on the page there you are as a
solid shadow underneath the Box doesn't
like regular the moment at the moment
doesn't even really look much like
shadow so let's start off by adding a
blur radius now the blur radius controls
how big and light the shadow will be on
the page so if I give a high value you
will have a big and light shadow if I
give a low value or no value then
they'll it will be a solid shadow so
let's provide 10 pixels as the blur
radius and see what that looks like on
the page you can see there it starts to
look like a shadow now it's it's much
more light around the edges the shadow
and looks much more attractive and
that's player radius you can play around
with that and get a feel for how that
works the final thing we're going to add
is a spread radius now the spread radius
expands or shrinks the entire shadow so
if I give a positive value in there like
10 pixels and see what happens you can
see this the shadows expanded massively
but that doesn't look very effective
like that so let's go back to it and
give it a negative value which will
shrink the shadow see what that looks
like on the page and there we are we've
got a nice subtle shadow under
the box bring it out of the page and
looking quite attractive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
