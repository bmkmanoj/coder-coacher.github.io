applications if you have some kind of
authentication but in this video we're
going to take a look at building a very
small helper class that allows you to
easily hash passwords and also check if
a hashed password matches a password
that you use a give perhaps when they
log in so we're going to take a look
first of all how this actually works and
then we're going to go ahead and build
that class so you can start using it I'm
going to be using the PHP password
hashing API which we've previously
covered I'm not going to go into too
much of the theory in this video we're
just gonna look at how we can build this
very small helper just to help us along
the way so the first thing then is
actually hashing a password how do we
use this helper to easily hash a
password well let's go ahead and echo
the result out of hash create this is
how we create and let's say we have some
kind of password within here this is
obviously going to be a user submitted
password perhaps when they register for
your site and in this case what we're
gonna get out is a long hash this
includes things like the salt and the
algorithm that's used etc etc and that's
just part of the PHP hashing API we'll
take a look more into that in a moment
now when a user already has a password
so for example they've submitted a
password to login that maybe equals cats
we can go ahead and check this against a
previous hash so let's go ahead and just
copy this and paste it into here in a
moment all we're gonna do is do a var
dump on hash check the first argument is
going to be the password the hash and
then it's going to be the values of cats
so when we go ahead and refresh we see
false that's because I've got these
mixed up so let's just go ahead and just
switch these around so it's the plain
text password first then the hash
password so this will exist in your
database somewhere go ahead and refresh
and there we go we get true so that's
just comparing these if we change this
value will obviously get a false so
let's go ahead and start to build this
small helper that allow you to easily
hash and check passwords so the first
thing we want to do
then is go ahead and create this class
file so I'm gonna call this hash top PHP
I'm just putting it inside of my root
directory but obviously depending on
your application you can go ahead and
place it where it makes sense
and I'm going to be namespacing this
under project helpers obviously
depending again on your application
structure with your autoloading your
namespace might be different or you can
just omit the namespace all together it
really doesn't matter so the class is
going to be called hash we don't need to
instantiate this class meaning we don't
need to create an object from it because
we're using static methods in here just
to make things a little bit easier to
work with so we're gonna have two static
methods so the first one is going to be
to create the password and this is going
to take in a plaintext password so we
can return the hashed password and then
we're gonna have a method to check the
password which as we saw in the example
involves path passing in a password and
then the password hash stored in your
database or wherever so what we need to
do now then is we're going to focus on
the create first so we need to load this
in to our index file so we can load in
hash PHP unless you're Auto loading and
we're gonna say something like hash
create and then type in a password here
so let's go ahead and echo this out and
inside of here we need to return
something so as I mentioned before we're
using the PHP password hashing API which
just gives us a really nice way to hash
passwords as securely as possible we can
choose the cost which is basically how
much processing happens in order to
calculate the hash the higher the cost
the longer it's going to take and the
algorithm as well the hashing algorithm
so we're going to return password hash
the first argument is the plaintext
password you want to hash the second is
the algorithm in this case we're going
to go with decrypt so it's saying be
crypt and then we have an array of
options
so the cost here is going to be say ten
you can fiddle around with this value
just really depending on the hardware
that you're using so now that we've got
that let's go ahead and check this out
when we refresh we see hash not found
obviously we have a namespace here so
you can either say echo project helpers
hash or you can go ahead and import this
at the top like so use that and when we
refresh there we go so there is our
hashed password that's how create now we
need to go ahead and be able to check
this so if you are following along leave
this up or just copy it so you're ready
to paste it in just a moment and for the
checking we use the password hashing API
again to verify the password so the
password verify and this is extremely
simple all we do is we pass in the plain
text password and the hash and this will
return a boolean obviously either true
or false depending on that was verified
correctly or not
so inside of index dot PHP then this
time we need to do a var dump because we
can't echo out the value of a boolean so
we're gonna say var dump hash check
we're gonna enter the plain text
password in this case it'll be cats and
then the hash we can go ahead and
refresh the page and we see true that
means that the password matches and
again as per the example at the start of
the video if it's wrong we get a false
so there now you have your very own
small helper to create and check hashed
passwords</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
