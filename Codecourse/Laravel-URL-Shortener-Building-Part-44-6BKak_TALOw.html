set up our roots our model for our links
table and also our link controller and
we'll just define the method so that
we're going to use here so inside of
roots we're going to need two additional
routes we'll need one which is a post
route so we'll be sending post data
through to this and that's mate this is
going to make a you know a short URL so
in here we pass an array and we need to
give this an alias I'm going to call
this make and we're going to use the
link controller and we're going to use
the method make will be creating this
link controller in a minute it company
doesn't exist so we also need another
route which is get you may have guessed
this is to get a short URL by a code so
let me copy and paste this too and share
it with someone this will then get the
code find the URL associated with it and
it will go ahead and redirect so I'm
just gonna put a place hold it in there
for a variable in this case it's a code
and we'll be passing that through to our
link controller and we're going to call
this get as it's alias and we'll say
that uses and we'll use the link
controller but this time we'll use the
get method within there so let's create
our link controller so inside of
controllers we create a new file and we
define a class called a link controller
and we extend the base controller so
let's save this as link controller dot
PHP we need to define what fillable
fields we have in here so we know that
we want to using la Ravel's
functionality oh sorry we don't we need
to do that in the model so for this one
we need to find the methods my mistake
so public function make as we've already
seen we want to make a URL with this and
we also want yet as well
now we've yet this requires a code as
you saw we passed this through as the
placeholder here and there it is so
we'll leave these alone for now
our model which was I was mistakenly
talking about a moment ago so we're
going to call this link doc PHP so is
just basically links but a singular
version and this is how la Ravel's
eloquent ORM deals with pluralization in
tables you can call this whatever you
want as long as you specify which table
you're referring to but we're not gonna
be doing that here because links and
Link make sense so this is going to be a
class of link and it's going to extend
eloquent and that means that we can use
things like the create mouth of the
update method the wear method or the
useful functionality and as I mentioned
earlier we need to define which fields
here are fillable in this case it's a
comma separated array of fields so we
want the URL to be fillable and we want
the code to be fillable and that's it so
that's all we need to do in this model
so we've now got our MVC structure set
up so we've got our routes which passed
through to our link controller and
inside of the link controller we're
going to make use of the link model so
let's start to test these out so inside
of the link controller let's echo out
input yet URL so using the input helper
here and inside of home dot blade dot
PHP remember early we didn't fill this
action in and that's because we didn't
have an action to go through to this
would have errored inside of routes now
though we have a route to make the URL
and this is called make so we can say
URL action make so when we enter a URL
here you can see that we'll go through
to make and we've already output the
contents of this URL within the input so
I mean we see we get whatever we typed
in here so now that we've done that
that's useful we know that we can start
to do whatever we need to do inside of
the link controller so let's start to
build up this make method the first
thing that we want to do is validate we
want to make sure that this URL value
it exists and we also want to make sure
it's a URL we could go as far as
actually defining that it's a maximum of
255 characters as defined in our schema
so let's do this now we create a new
variable called validator and we use the
validate tour mate method now this takes
two parameters the first one is the
input in this case it's all of the input
the second is an array with key value
pairs the key here is going to be the
name of the field ie URL so we can say
URL now we define the properties that
help validate this so we want this to be
required and we want this to be a URL
and we want this to be a maximum of 255
obviously depending on your needs or
whatever you can change this so we now
use the fails method to check if the
validations fails we say validator fails
if it does fail we want to redirect back
to the index page with the errors and
display them otherwise we want to go
ahead and actually generate everything
as normal so in here we return and we do
a redirect back to the home action that
was defined in our routes file here so
as home and we want to send this back
with input so we can output this inside
of a value attribute in the input field
and we also want to send back errors and
we use the validator in here to define
which errors because you may have
multiple validator instances now
otherwise I'm just gonna echo okay here
just to signify that this works we'll
test this out in just a moment so now we
need to create an if statement down here
to actually check whether there are any
errors so let's create an if statement
with the blade syntax and we'll also end
that so
we use this errors variable that's now
available to us as we pass this back to
this on the redirect so we check if the
URL is contained within these errors now
if it is we want to generate a paragraph
and we want to output something and that
is errors first this will just get the
first error so the user will have to
keep correcting themselves and this will
be URL so now what we also want to do is
inside of this input here at the end we
also want to check if input old exists
for the URL so we create a ternary
operator and we say input old URL so if
that's the case we can then say let's
just do this in single quotes value is
and we can catenate on here input old
URL and otherwise nothing now this might
look a bit confusing let's just get rid
of these brackets because they're not
really required we're checking if input
old for URL which means whatever is
passed back because we've given this
with input so that will parse all that
back so if any old input exists let's
put that back in there and we'll also
escape this as well and otherwise
nothing so that's that so now what
should happen is if we mistakenly put a
wrong URL in here it will warn us but
what we want to do is I'm going to
inspect this and change the type back to
text don't make that little shorter to
be validated well
CSS selected that but let's shorten this
and it says the URL format is invalid
which is perfectly true and it also puts
the old input back in there for us so
we've done that we know that that works
let's go ahead and focus on other things
so echo okay otherwise let's test this
out and then we are so we get okay so we
know that this is working now so if
everything is okay we want to start to
generate what we need
store a couple of variables first though
the URL is going to be input yet URL
this'll obviously just be the URL and
we're gonna set code to null because
we're gonna be generating or storing a
value in this variable based on either
whether it exists or when we generate a
new code so let's check now if a URL
already exists in our table so at the
moment if I select everything from links
there's nothing in there so at the
moment any URL that we enter will not
exist but we use the link model remember
the thing we created here this now has
eloquent functionality so we can do
things like where URL equals URL which
is obviously this here the database
escaping will all take place here that's
why we don't need to sanitize anything
here so now we want to check if it does
exist so we say if exists count which is
the count of records based on this query
here is one this exists otherwise does
not exist so let's create a record after
we just do this so let's type in shorten
does not exist we know that that doesn't
exist but now let's insert into links
URL code and we will insert and we'll
just put the coders one two three four
okay so that's inserted that
so we've now if we select everything
from links we've got a record in here
with the code as Google one two three
and the URLs Google Doc code or UK so if
we put this into here now that exists so
in the case that a particular record
exists all we need to do is set the code
to the exists that we've got here then
we need to access
the first element in this case I'll only
be one her only ever storing one
instance of a URL and we want to get the
code from that
so now code if we echo this and we paste
in that same URL we'll bring back the
code so we can just pass that on to the
user we don't need to generate a new
code now now otherwise we actually do
need to generate a new code this is
slightly more complicated
now the steps that we take to do this
are we create a record first with no
code then if that was successful we want
to base convert the ID from base-10 to
base-2 six so lower case and new and
numbers nought to nine and we then want
to update that record with this new code
so we're printing we're doing one to two
queries here but it doesn't work within
three queries and total we're checking
than creating bar you know this is this
probably isn't the best way to do things
you could probably generate a really
cool code a unique code from something
but for now this you know will do you
you'll end up with on your first record
you'll end up with the unique code as
one and when you get sort of record a
hundred million then you'll start to get
more interesting short URLs but at the
end of the day this is a short URL
generator we want short generate short
urls we're doing this so let's go ahead
and do this so created we're gonna store
a variable here so we can check it
worked we're gonna use the link model
again and the create method the eloquent
gives us and in here we're gonna pass an
array in with the fields that we want to
populate in this case it's just URL and
we know the URL what we can now do is
check if that created value worked so if
if that if this actually creates it then
that's cool we can generate a code and
like I said we use base convert here now
this allows us to enter a specific
number so 1 2 3 all the way up to
whatever the base from and the base to
so the base form is 10 and the base 2 is
going to just be 36
so where do we get this number from or
we want to get the ID of the created
record so created ID it's as simple as
that now that we've got the code we want
to update the record that we created up
here with this new code because at the
moment what's going to happen is it's
going to create the record with no code
then it will create a code but it won't
do anything we need to update this so
we're gonna say updated is linked in
fact we don't actually need to do
updated we can just say linked they are
sorry where so we didn't in a deal where
Clause hip we're gonna say we're ID is
equal to the newly created ID as we used
here so we want to update the contents
of this passing an array in to tell us
what we want to update in this case it's
the code and we want to set that to the
code variable we generated here now the
reason we created this code none up here
is this is this has set this code value
this has set this code value so if there
is no code then we want to not do
anything so we only want down here now
this is outside of the if here we want
to say if code then redirect home now
that's going to be with a message saying
you know this worked this worked here's
your link but if not we want to define
the default behavior down here so we
want to redirect to home with a global
message saying this went wrong something
went wrong tribe in so let's test this
out but we'll fit in this redirection
first so let's return redirect here and
we want to say to the user this is done
now we've generated a code whether it's
by inserting and updating a record or
retrieving an existing one so we want to
say redirect to home
and we want ups we want this to be with
global data if you're not sure that this
global data is basically what we're
doing is passing a session here that
we're gonna pick up using session get
and we'll see this on the home in a
minute once we've done these messages
we'll go back and modify this page to
output these global messages we're
passing back through so here we'll say
all done here is your short URL so we'll
define an anchor here and we want the
href and the contents of this to be
exactly the same so we want these to be
and basically using the URL helper we
want to go through to the get page or
the get route that we created this
passing in the code because that's what
we want to output to the user and this
means we don't have to start typing HTTP
blah blah blah ourselves and if you
switch domains this will automatically
keep updated so in here we want to
concatenate on here URL to an action and
this action is yet to remember we named
our route yet here for this get code
thing and we then subsequently pass in
the code because we have a placeholder
here for a variable in in there and we
want to do the same for the actual
contents of the link as well the display
for the link so we do exactly the same
thing here we say URL action to the get
route and there to the code that should
pass that back through but how do we
pick up this global message well this is
really easy inside of home blade PHP we
want to say if oops if and we will end
that if there so we want to check for a
session call global and if that if that
does exist we can create paragraph tags
and then output this
to the user so in this case it's search
and yet so he using has to check if it
exists and we're saying yet to get it
and this is called global so this one
just just run through this if we're a
little bit confused we know that we're
validating stuff otherwise what we're
doing we're checking if the URL exists
in the database if it does we're just
retaining the code or setting the code
to that code which will later deal with
here otherwise we are creating a blank
record or a record with just the URL
then if that works for generating a code
you didn't base convert convert this to
different a different base then we are
updating the record we just created with
this generated code if either methods
work we're gonna redirect global with
the link this will now be in the
database and otherwise if something
unexpected happens we're just gonna say
something went wrong try again
so let's just check this out make sure
we've made no mistakes along the way so
over to the public directory let's and
google doc code at UK now remember this
already exists here so what we should
get is we should receive a URL back with
this code inside of that generated URL
so we click shorten and it works so
here's your short URL there it is with
Google 1 2 3 let's enter a URL now that
doesn't exist here so we say Co course
comm and click shorten there we go so
this is the base convert taking action
where we see here we've got 2 if we look
in the database you can see that we've
got 2 for the ID there for ace 10
convert to base 36 for 2 is just 2 now
I'm not saying this is the correct way
to do things but if you do want to
change this so it does generate slightly
longer URLs you can alter your table so
we say alter table links and we want to
change the auto increment to a larger
number I'm gonna change this to 100
million or billion whatever
so now when I generate a URL this time
we'll go for google.com we get a
slightly longer more still unique value
here so like I've said there are
probably better ways to generate these
longer URLs but this way for now we'll
certainly do so we've got an ID of 100
million and this code which is the base
converted from ten to thirty six so now
that we've done this the only thing left
to do is clicking on this should take us
through to google.com in this case it
doesn't so we need to define the other
where is it linked where you need to
define the other method get' so we
passed a code through into here so let's
test this out by echoing code when i
refresh it says one in whatever so we
know that this is replicating this so
quite simply what we really need to do
is look this up in our database now if
we look this up in our database and it
exists we can grab the URL and we can
redirect that user to the URL so we need
to create a variable here called link
this will be linked where when we use
the where Clause be using eloquent where
code is equal to the code that's been
passed in so now we can create an if
statement to say if link count we can
even combine our chat that against one
we want to return a redirect to we're
using two now because we're not doing
this to an action inside our application
this is the natural URL and we can say
link we use the first method to get the
first record in this case there's only
one anyway and we grab the URL from that
so we're basically redirect into a URL
now if that's not the case let's put a
fallback down here we want to redirect
to home so we say redirect action home
so
let's test this out so when I go back
and I click on in fact let's run this
whole through thing again
so we'll say www.google.com you K that's
got this unique identifier here when I
click it that just takes us through to
Google straight forward and that's
pretty much it so we've looked at the
ability to enter into a URL we've looked
at validation generating this storing
inside of our database making sure that
we're not storing too many records were
only storing one record for each URL
we're defining it an unique identifier
based on the ID inside of the database
and then we are redirecting a user to
that once it's been copied and pasted
wherever to anyone needing to access
that URL and that is basically it we've
created a URL shortener with laravel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
