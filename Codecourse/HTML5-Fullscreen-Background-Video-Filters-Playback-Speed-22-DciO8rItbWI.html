image fallback frif our html5 player
isn't supported what we're now going to
look at is using filters to change the
background video of course with CSS we
can change any element and apply filters
to it so we're gonna be looking at gray
scale and sepia as well we're also then
gonna look at the playback rate so we're
gonna slow this video down and of course
if you want to speed it up you could do
that too the concepts the same so over
in our text editor then let's first of
all look at filters there are plenty of
filters to choose from but I'm just
gonna demo a couple of them just so you
know you can apply these filters to your
video I'm going to use the WebKit prefix
here and the property name is filter so
here I can define what the filter I want
to apply to this so for example I could
apply
greyscale and I choose a percentage here
now I can duplicate this down and then
also include the non vendor prefix
property as well now obviously you'd
imagine that is going to give me a
hundred percent greyscale on this so
there's no color in here but of course
you can change this value and play
around with it so for example we could
choose 50% to give us off half-and-half
effect this actually looks quite nice
rather than the full color in my opinion
we've also got things like sepia like I
said see we can change the CPA amount on
here so again I've got 50% on there you
can crank that up so this can be applied
to our video so go ahead and and check
out what you can and can't do with
filters and see if you can apply
something cool onto your background
video now second of all we're going to
go on to look at the playback speed of
this video so remember in the last part
we gave this video an ID eg video so we
can target that CSS with JavaScript
sorry now we're not going to use jQuery
if you are using jQuery you can of
course make use of this but there's no
point here because we're only doing one
very small thing so let's open and close
a script tag down here this would
obviously be better in an external
javascript file
always load at the bottom of your page
rather than doing it on page so what we
first of all want to do is determine how
we can change the playback speed so
there'd be a property on this video
element so I'm gonna temporarily just
create a variable here called video and
this is obviously going to be document
and we use the get element by ID method
to select this video by ID
we know that the ID is PG video so we
can just type in PG video there so with
that and then going to explore what I
can actually do with this so I'm going
to just bring up my developer console
here and we know that we've now got a
variable called video so if I type video
in my console that gives me back the
element that's selected by this document
get element by ID BG video here so now
that we've got this let me just switch
exclusively to my console we now know
that we can do video dot and then
something so here we can do things like
playback or just type play and see what
comes up so it's a really good way to
sort of experiment with doing this so we
can do things like pause for example so
if we were to run sorry run this method
you can see that the video here is now
paused it's no longer playing and then
we can again use the play method to play
this so you can you can play around in
the console and control this but what
I'm interested in is the playback rate
playback rate so I can change this
playback rate by assigning of an integer
to this or it actually it can be like
1.5 so it can be a float so let's say
1.5 and let's take a look at it's quite
hard to see here because of my
resolution but you can generally see now
that that video is now sped up of course
we could do something silly and speed
this up to 5 times or even just do a
hundred and see how fast she can type so
if you wanted maybe this to just be a
little bit slower a little bit more
casual as your users into your website
I've changed that to 0.8 now but the
point is that you can do this on your
page here so we don't
need to assign this to a global variable
there's no need we can just use get
element by ID and then do dot playback
rate like that and then we can assign
that a value so point a and then that's
obviously going to just slow down and
permanently when you use as land on your
page this will be a playback rate of
point eight so 80% of its normal speed
so that's how we change filter effects
on our video and also how we change the
playback rate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
