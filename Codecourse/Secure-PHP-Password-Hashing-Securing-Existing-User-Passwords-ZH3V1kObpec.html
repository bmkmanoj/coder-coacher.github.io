and change the algorithm that you're
using currently in your database for
example you might be using md5 SH one SH
256 and you might want to go ahead and
implement one of the hashing methods
that we've used in this series so you
just want to generate your password
password hash in the future but current
users that are in your system you
obviously need to allow them to still
log in so what we can do is behind the
scenes we can actually change the hash
of their password without them even
knowing it so they go ahead they log in
as normal things are verified with the
current algorithm you're using for
example if you're using md5 you'd do an
md5 hash of the password that the user
has supplied then go on to actually
change the hash and then subsequently
when they log in the next time it will
still work so we're going to look at a
simple structure that you may want to
use to implement this functionality now
this would obviously depend on how your
systems currently set up but hopefully
the code that we're going to write in
this part of these series will give you
a good idea of how you should be you
know approaching the situation if you
want to go ahead and change the hashing
algorithm you use and we're just going
to be using the password hash and the
password verify as well as a new
function that will introduce called the
pop called password needs rehash so
let's go ahead and over to our code
which is completely empty at the moment
and look at what we might need to do
here so what I'm going to do is first of
all I'm going to generate a password
that a user may may or may not have
stored so for example if my password to
log into the system was password if we
head over to our browser this will be
the hash used in the database so I'm
going to call this stored password so
just imagine that this is the value
stored in the database table I'm going
to create another variable just here
called supplied password and this is
going to be the plaintext password that
we're going to be using to demonstrate
here because we're going to have to
supply this value over and over again
and this would probably be some kind of
post value so for example dollar
underscore post
password but for now we'll just go ahead
and just put a string of password okay
so what we need to do is first of all
introduce this password needs rehash
function and what this is going to do is
it's going to check against the options
that you provide whether or not a
password meets the requirements of the
hash or not that you expecting to
generate so remember we looked at
password hash this generated a hash with
the specific algorithm and we chose
Blowfish in the last part and we
provided some options and we chose a
cost of 12 and you can obviously vary
these as you want so let's go ahead and
create an if statement and go ahead and
use this password and need to rehash
function so the first thing we're
checking is if it needs a rehash and we
obviously need to supply the stored
password of the user so within this
you'd go ahead and supply the users
stored password and you need to provide
the options that you're expecting to see
of this password so we grab the user's
password from the database we know that
they use your idea of 10 or 100 or
whatever and we go ahead and provide the
algorithm we're expecting to see here
and in this case it's going to be bcrypt
now I'm going to go ahead and create a
variable up here for the options that we
saw in the last part of the series just
basically so I'm going to be providing
these twice so I need to go ahead and
just store them in a way that I'd have
to keep repeating myself so I'm going to
choose a cost of 12 so I'm expecting to
see or check a password with Blowfish
algorithm bcrypt and the options that
I've provided up here so what we also
need to do at the same time is check
that the current password so assuming
this fails or sorry assuming this
returns true it means that the password
does need rehashing what we also need to
do is check if the md5 of the supplied
password is equal to the stored password
so what we're doing is we're saying does
the password need rehashing if it does
that means it's still an md5 hash so
what we then do is
check that the user supplied the correct
password if both of these are true then
what do we need to do well the first
thing we need to do is store the new
password and then sign the user in so to
store the new password all we need to do
is change stored password - password
hash as we've already seen the supplied
password password bcrypt
and then the options so that's gone
ahead and store the new password in real
life you'd go ahead and you'd actually
query your database to actually insert
this or sorry rather update this value
where the user equals two or ten or
hundred or whatever and then you go
ahead and just provide the ability to
sign the user in so I'm going to go
ahead and just echo something out just
so you can see that this has worked so
I'm going to say you're in and with a
changed password hash just so we know
which options been hit here so in this
case we'd expect to see this run and
this run as well because the password
does need rehashing it's currently md5
and the md5 hash of password does equal
this so we've done the sort of login
check as well here so let's go over to
the browser double sorry refresh here
and it says you're in and with a change
password hash so what we can now do to
prove that is go ahead and just echo out
stored password down here and we may
want to just pop a break before that and
there we go so you're in and with the
change password hash and now this will
be stored in the database at the moment
it's just updated it's variable that's
just because we're using this an example
now we do need an else here because if
the password doesn't need rehashing an
md5 of the supplied password doesn't
equal the stored password that means
that the user has already logged in and
this has already run so the stored
password has been updated so in this
case we would just go ahead and create a
new if statement to verify the password
once again and we do this using the
password verify function providing the
supplied password
users typed into a form and compared it
to the value stored in the database if
that's the case then sign the user in
and we'll just go ahead and say you're
in nothing's been changed they've just
the password just been verified
otherwise incorrect details so we can
just go ahead and echo try again so
let's go ahead and just run this once
more once more that's not going to
affect anything because we're already
providing the correct password let's go
ahead and just copy this and let's say
we've already logged in the new password
will be stored in the database so we're
imagining this variable it's our
database value and we're supplying the
password of password so let's provide
this first refresh and it says you're in
now this regardless has been echoed out
just because we're echoing out the
current hash but this just means that
the users been signed in successfully
comparing the string password with a new
hash here if I go ahead and change this
to password 1-2-3 and hit refresh it
says try again so the user has
incorrectly supplied a password so this
could probably be structured a little
bit better depending on how your
application works and how you need to
handle erroring and stuff like that but
basically that's the fundamentals of
using the password needs hash function
to check if a password in your database
or stored wherever needs rehashing then
you can go ahead and use the algorithm
of your choice so in this case we've
chosen Blowfish to go ahead and update
the hashing algorithm for passwords
stored in your database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
