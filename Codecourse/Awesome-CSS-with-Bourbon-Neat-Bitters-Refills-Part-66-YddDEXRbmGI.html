something called refills refills are a
little different than bourbon bitters in
the in the patent the way that they are
you know thought out navigation patterns
okay so how we're gonna use those let's
just close the majority of these things
here I'd get rid of these boxes and go
into our home sizes get it all this
stuff okay now these patterns so let me
show you what I'm talking about
we're gonna go into our body and I'm
just gonna copy the code and paste now I
need to style it so I'm gonna this is
gonna be a module new file new top now
dot CSS and in them ended modules
directory I'm going to say at import top
yeah now when I go to my rendered file I
should have this beautiful navigation
across the top awesome
there's a little problem here and that
is actually because bourbon was just
updated and this needs not to be 0 needs
to be Auto I know that because I messed
around with a little bit earlier bourbon
used to allow you to use that position
mix in and say if you wanted it to be
skipped or auto you would write 0 now
you have to write out Auto explicitly so
now and refresh them that will be where
it should be what that means is that the
refill just needs to catch up with the
the newest version of bourbon which came
out just last week so it's not it's not
a big it's not a big worry just recently
so the next module only grabbed from
refills is going to be this cool hero
unit look at the code here copy it put
it into my index on HTML copy the code
mark copy the Styles module called hero
hero dot CSS and import hero into into
my directory navigation hero and save so
when I go back to my example I'm gonna
have this really nice hero unit and
again look at I have the defaults that
that I put in bitters are flowing
throughout and I have a amount of space
type in my hero that's pretty cool now
these are really really easy to change
this is the icon here I can go into hero
unit and I want to kind of change this
background out it so here's the
background I have this cool like balloon
thingy put that in and easily update
there you go so nice let's see what else
we got
ooh these are really nice these are good
for sales copy copy the mark now again
this is just the pattern that we're
falling and all these things are so are
you know easily editable copy the
styling I want to create a new module
and I call these like bullet points TOI
points and import the points
and then let me check it out there we go
okay so and we noticed that we have we
don't have you know the pleasing margins
that we were hoping to have
automatically and even though these
points are responsive they're just kind
of like I don't know they don't look
that great right by default because they
that they're crashing right here up
against this this other module and you
know what at first you're like oh did it
work automatically but anything you know
that's actually that's actually
preferable because you can never tell
where you're gonna put these modules I
mean what if this showed up inside of a
you know like a like a over lay modal or
something you know and you need though
you need a lot of the margins to be a
little bit different so that that's good
but we do need to go in and kind of
carve out the place for them now this is
different than them modules I wouldn't
go in to edit the modules of points
directly I would go into the layout that
this page is in so this is the home page
I'll go back into that layout SAS and
deal with these and and uh it's like
what are these guys called unit called
bullets or something yeah bullets is the
class oops I went to copy and paste it
so home I'm gonna say bullets padding
fifty and say 100 zero
so they have a nice padding from the top
but also we're kind of like crashing
right here where I don't think we should
now this is where I would use meat and I
would say you're gonna be an outer
continue now and that's just making the
max with 960 and it could be centered
with margins so that's why I use padding
right here not margin because I wanted
to make sure that I was going to have
the ability to to Center these guys with
a outer container cool and that's all we
need to do to fix that out and it's
layout contextualized actually it should
be a something like that home dot
bullets and then on your home you know
HTML you would say class home then you
would start your home you'd scope all of
these styles into home oh this is when
you're thinking big though so it does
matter whatever cool next one is an
article oh these are cool I like this a
lot because you can go in and choose
what style of articles now these are
gonna be scoped these styles and such
are gonna be scoped to the article
itself which is really handy because
even though I've said that I want my
site to be mono styled I can you know
I'm gonna choose and choose the slab I
can have you know whatever styles are
attached to this article itself so I'm
going to show the code grab the mark-up
here and throw that in my index.html
file and grab the Styles and I'm gonna
make a new module called
article called article dot CSS and
that's gonna have my article in it and I
need to again import that into my
modules directory
let's take a look and here's my article
heading cool it's dialed just how I
would like it it's it's really
beautifully styled but it's not it's not
a centered in the cut it's not but it's
not styled in the context of the layout
so this layout is home so I go back to
my homes dialing in and say article yeah
you are gonna be a was it called an
outer container and all your children
are gonna be a they're gonna spam
columns and let's say eight columns and
let's move you guys ship with a shift to
columns she goes nice centered how does
that look well it looks good that's
really great
okay let's go refill there's a lot of
other things let's give a few cards
these are cool comment styles comment
modules tabs goodness tables all these
are awesome vertical tabs um wow that's
cool these are cool oh it's even cooler
yeah let's grab this show the code copy
the mark-up put it my index and these
are all like you know all the content
and these icons these are all customer
as well I want to call this module grid
a square it's pretty good great items
good items good items oh dear
grid items
that's CSS okay and I'm going to throw
that in my directory and save what have
we here
I'm assuming it's gonna be full with
okay cool yeah that's really great it's
full width though and I did like the
look of it being um you know kind of not
post I guess you'd say what is this
coffee it's called good items good items
liens in the context of my layout I'm
gonna say that good Adam lines you need
to be an outer container
cool nice nice nice now you can change
all these content you can change the
width and the spans of both these of
these grids this is cool article gets a
little close there no that's okay
all right let's close this up let's put
a footer here oh there's the footer show
the code copy the markup
and after my gridlines put my footer
module create a new module called footer
dot s CSS and copy it looks good good
footer and directory oops and we should
be good with the footer cool so I'm
gonna say those great items in my home
they need a little space below so
padding 100 pixels ooh the margin bottom
that that revealed this lying there but
I don't want so margin bottom we'll take
that that's just because of the way the
bits anyway
cool so this is this is a pretty good
start to a good looking website and that
was all done just using real refills I
didn't you know really design or code
any of this markup and the cool thing is
that it's all customizable really simply
put and all of the things I wanted and
none of the things I did not want which
is not an option when you're when you're
working with bootstrap or foundation I
think that if you start using bourbon
right away you'll enjoy it just as much
as I do so thank you so much to come for
