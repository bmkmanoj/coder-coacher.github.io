learning get by using github to host our
repository for us if you're new to get
this might sound a little confusing so
let's clear things up it is version
control software that lets you make
changes to your project quickly and
easily this gives you the benefit of
being able to roll back changes branch
off from your main code to develop
without risking messing everything up it
allows teams to all contribute to one
project without getting tangled up in
the codebase and possibly overwrite or
lose someone else's changes now overall
you should be using it if you're serious
about the project that you're working on
now github on the other hand is one of
many hosted repository services your
code will be hosted on their servers and
this will allow any number of developers
either on your team or if your
repository is public we should talk
about later allow them to pull down
changes from the server push up or pull
down the code from the server and push
changes up and get hub makes this really
easy basically because you don't have to
set the server up from yourself which
can be really tricky if you're just
starting out the benefit of github is
also what they call social coding I
spoke a little bit about that a moment
ago if you opted to open-source your
project which is basically turning your
project or your project repository into
a public repository you'll expose your
code to a lot of people and this means
that others can download they can use
the code they can contribute to your
project with pull requests which we'll
learn about later and what we then get
on the command line so you can get to
grips with the fundamentals and this
isn't an advanced get guide we're not
going to be covering everything at all
but you'll find this comfortable if you
have no idea of what git is or if you're
very new to it so this is a very much a
beginners course so make sure you signed
up a get up first at the time of
recording is free to sign up as long as
you're only hosting public repositories
if you want private repositories you
will have to pay so that's all you need
to follow the tutorial and after you've
got two groups of the basics you might
want to use a different
service like it bucket which is free at
the time of recording to host private
repositories so let's go ahead and
create an open-source project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
