solid which is the interface segregation
principle now this is similar to the
Liskov substitution principle Uncle Bob
describes it as classes that implement
interfaces should not be forced to
implement method methods that they don't
use which is pretty simple explanation
so here I have parrot which if we take a
look at implements bird interface and
I'm calling bird fly which is just this
method here and because we're
implementing bird interface if we take a
look this contains the fly method
therefore it is absolutely mandatory
that this class contains fly otherwise
our code is going to crash and we're
going to get an error which you probably
know by now so what if we want to create
a new bird let's create a new file we'll
call it penguin whp
we're going to say class penguin
implements what was it bird
interface now if we look in our browser
which we don't want to do but if we were
to look in our browser and execute this
code
oops we'll probably have to change this
first we're going to get an error as
you'd expect and that's because we don't
have this fly method so a penguin in
reality is a bird but it doesn't fly so
because of that we're not going to use
this method at all now looking at
looking back at the explanation Uncle
Bob is basically saying that if we
implement an interface it should not be
forced to implement a method that they
don't use so penguin is not going to use
fly since a penguin doesn't fly
therefore we don't implement both
interface that's all it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
