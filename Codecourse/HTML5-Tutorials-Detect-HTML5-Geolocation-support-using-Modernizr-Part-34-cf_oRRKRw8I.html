video is we're going to use modernizr to
detect html5 geolocation support if it
is available we're going to go ahead and
do our things otherwise what we're gonna
do is we are going to say to the user
sorry your browser doesn't support your
location now in the next video what
we're actually going to look at is we're
going to look at using geo position j/s
which allows us across all browsers to
grab the user's location stuff like
BlackBerry's you know any device old
versions of ie etc so what we're gonna
do here is just detect and show an error
in the next video use geo position as
our sort of sole means of detecting the
user's location it's very very similar
to the way it works our natively which
is good because then we you know we
don't have to change much we don't have
to learn anything else so what I've done
here is I have customized a version of
moderniser
- just for the geolocation API under
misc so what I'm going to do is click
generate which I've done and here is the
code so let's go ahead and just
highlight all this and copy this at the
moment I just have my window open here
but in my code I'm gonna go ahead and
create a new file and I'm gonna go ahead
and save this in a JavaScript folder and
I'm gonna call this modern eyes dot j s
and I said okay s cool so I've saved
this here let's go ahead and close this
and let's go ahead and load this in down
here in fact let's load this here so I'm
gonna say script script and the source
for this is going to be jeaious modern
eyes yes perfect so let's go ahead and
just refresh the page make sure we've
got no errors in the console the only
thing that we've got here is it's
talking about an unsafe JavaScript
attempts within within the frame like
blah blah blah things that would usually
get in this case so now we want to use
modernizr to detect so I'm going to say
if something else do something else and
that is going to be else do what we
would normally
expect to do but if moderniser dot
geolocation and that's about it so
modernize Agito geolocation so if this
returns true sorry if not modernized
geolocation we're going to alert
geolocation not supported so let's go
ahead and refresh the page I'm going to
go ahead and click on get location works
so the code here has been executed so
this hasn't been executed let's go ahead
and load up like ie 7 or 8 or something
so let's pull this across so I've opened
the developer tools and I've turned the
browser mode to ie 7 let's pop back to
our Chrome window and then back over to
our internet explorer window and we'll
go ahead and post this in and we get the
error message geolocation or supported
perfect so what we can do is we can tell
our users if geolocation is not
supported and then we can do something
you know fancy or you know just tell
them to to go away if we don't support
it so that's one way of doing it in the
next video we're going to look at using
geo position to actually detect the
user's location whatever the browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
