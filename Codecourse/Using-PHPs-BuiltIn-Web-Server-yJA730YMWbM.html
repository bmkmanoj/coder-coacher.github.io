built-in web server as of version 5.4
and of course this doesn't mean that you
can use it to host your site but it's
really useful for development and
testing and in this video we'll be
taking a look exactly how to use it so
let's start off in our terminal I'm
currently within the directory that I'm
going to be working with you'll
obviously need PHP installed on your
machine and like I said you'll need
version 5.4 greater you can check your
PHP version by running PHP and then
supplying the V option here and you can
see I'm running PHP 5.5 now let's take a
look at some of the options by running
PHP and then the help command the
options that we're interested in here
are s and T now s lets you define the
address and ports that you want your
server to run on so for example
localhost and then you can choose a port
name or port number rather and then this
can be accessed in your browser as you
would normally with an apache or nginx
server the T option is optional
ah this allows you to define the path of
the web route if you're not already in
the directory that you want to run it
from when you run the command we'll be
looking at in a moment so I'm currently
in the directory I want to run as the
web route so I can leave the T option
out but go ahead and use this option if
you need and specify the path to the
route that you want to serve so let's
run our web server on localhost or
rather 127.0.0.1 and we will run it on
port 1 337 so all we do is pour PHP
capsule s option we give the host and
then a colon and then the port we want
to run it on and hit enter and it is
easy as that we now have a server
running so to test this out then within
this directory PHP project I'm going to
create a new file and this is just going
to be a PHP info file so I'm going to
call that PHP
froak PHP and I'm going to call the PHP
info function to give us information
about our PHP installation so let's head
over to the address here so we know it's
one to seven dot dot dot one and that's
on port 1 3 3 7 you can see here we get
a not found error because we're
currently accessing the root directory
which at the moment doesn't have an
index dot PHP fast it's not going to be
served so we need to manually hit
phpinfo dot php' so we now see this file
and if we pull up our terminal you'll
notice that we see outfit here including
the file being accessed the status code
so let's just quickly mess up this file
and see what happens you can see here at
the moment we're getting a 200 we had a
404 before etc etc but if we just say
rights oops in here which is obviously
invalid code when we refresh this we
obviously get a parse error but we
actually see that reflected in our
terminal as well what was he still
getting a 200 but we can see this error
here and it gives us the debugging info
as well so on line 3 now let's go and
make things look a little bit nicer by
adding some color to our output just to
make it easier to look at while we are
developing so we can do this with the
command line interface CLI server dot
color directive so let's stop our server
from running and we'll create this file
somewhere in this directory so this can
be obviously anywhere on your machine
and we're going to call this PHP CLI
which stands for command line interface
server and this is an ini file so I'm
going to save that out in there and we
can now change that CLI server color
directive that I just spoke about a
minute ago so we can say CLI server dot
color and we can assign that the value
on and all this is going to do is it's
going to enable colors in our console
when we actually running so we'll get
different colors for errors success etc
so back over to the command line
then let's restart our server so we're
just gonna say PHP s 1 2 7 or not but 1
same port that we had before this time
we're gonna pass the configuration
option and we're gonna pass in that PHP
CLI server die and I fart we created so
now what's going to happen then is when
we access this file we're obviously
getting an error here and inside of the
terminal you can see this is now
highlighted in red which is pretty
useful just to scan down it's a little
bit easier to look at and if we were to
go ahead and just put this far back to
its original state well we could just
echo something out why not then when we
refresh here we obviously see that and
then in our terminal we see green if we
access a file that can't be found so for
example at the moment just a root
directory there's no index dot PHP file
in there you can see that we get this
yellow color just here so nicely
highlighting the important parts of our
output here so that is pretty much it
for running PHP 'z built-in web server
obviously it doesn't do that much but
it's great for quickly developing on the
go just without having to set up our own
server on our machine now this obviously
isn't recommended for a production
environment it's best to leave this up
to Apache or nginx or any other web
server you're using but what about
databases well if you do need database
support and you have MySQL installed on
your system you can connect to it
directly with PHP just the usual way you
would specifying all the hosts details
of course you could even use something
like MySQL Lite if you don't have
anything else installed
obviously that's functionality that's
built right into PHP so next time you're
quickly developing on the go this might
just help you out it's always good to
know it's there just in case you ever
need it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
