future and watching this at the moment
there's an app called Pokemon Go which
is become increasingly popular and from
this I thought why not just build and
animated poker ball completely with CSS
and that's exactly what we're going to
be doing in this series
so everything's can be pure CSS we're
gonna be introducing some things as well
that you may not have heard of like
native CSS variables which are really
exciting we're going to be using the
calc function and of course we're gonna
look at animating this as well so we're
gonna be building up some keyframes and
using CSS is animation features so
regardless of write that you actually
want to build a poker ball or not we're
going to look at some things that might
help you out in front end development so
let's jump over and start to build this
out so we are going to start out with
the styling obviously and we will get to
the animation shortly after that now the
key thing here and the reason that we're
using native CSS variables is because we
want to be able to change say the size
of the border and have that reflect the
inner border just here as well around
this Center now I'm going to be using
this for reference just because I like
the colors just a less saturated red and
you can see here that the border width
here is the same size as this border
here so that's the kind of thing that
we're going for and of course we'll deal
with the inner part in a minute and
we're gonna be using a double border to
achieve this now this isn't perfect by
any means it's a bit of fun I can't
actually get this working properly in
Firefox and Safari it works the
animations work but for some reason the
center part
just isn't positioned correctly and I
suspect that's either due to the calc
implementation or the variable
implementation so if you can go ahead
and fix them up in Firefox and Safari
that would be awesome go ahead and let
me know once you've done that so let's
start from scratch and start to build
this out and we'll start to animate it
after that so the first thing I want to
do is just create a little container and
I'm gonna be doing all of my styling in
line just on the top of the page here of
course feel free to create a separate
star she normally what I would do for
this is you
a preprocessor like sass but of course
we're just having a little bit of fun
and of course looking and native CSS
variables which are really interesting
so I'm gonna start by creating a
container this is just going to contain
the whole purpose of this is really just
to give a margin on the top so let's go
ahead and do that and into here we will
crown our container and while we're at
it we'll create the pokeball div with
the class of pokeball so we're going to
start with the pokeball get the border
sorted out get the background sorted out
we're going to be using a gradient for
that and then we'll start to fill in the
middle pieces as well
so to start this out then let's create
our pokeball selector and I want to set
box sizing to board of box this just
means that the padding and the border
don't interfere with the size of this it
will just make it a little bit easier
for us later on and now I'm gonna start
to define out some native CSS variables
that we can use to control the size of
this so I'm gonna start by creating one
called pokeballs size and I'm gonna set
this to 250 pixels so you can see here
that we define these much like a CSS
property we just use two dashes and
we'll see how we use these in just a bit
and then I want a poker ball inner size
this is just going to be the size of the
inside ring not the white part but
basically just this dark part here and
then from that we'll calculate how big
this should be cuz do you want this
section here to be the same width as the
border so the next thing is just the
border site is so pokeball border size
we want to be able to control that as
well and for now we'll set this to 10 or
20 pixels so now let's start to create
the border this is simple but we need to
introduce a variable here so we used the
VAR function like this and then we pass
in the variable that we want to use in
this case is the border size and we just
carry on normal like we defined normal
CSS properties so we have a color just
here which is 2 6 to 1 to 2 that's just
like a dark color and we want to find
out our width and height as well
obviously we know that we've already
defined this is poker ball size and
we're going to do the same for the
height because obviously we want it to
be equal and because this is a
rounded shape we want to set the border
radius to 100% so if we just check this
out in the browser there we go that's
what we've got so far
the last thing I'm just going to do is
set the margin to zero Auto just so it's
just nicely in the middle of the page
okay so for the background then we need
to use a gradient now that might seem a
little bit odd but what we can actually
do is define very harsh gradients and
this means that we basically end up with
just three colors in here so we need to
define this out here pretty
straightforward we set a background we
use linear gradient like so we define as
the first argument the degree that we
want it to sit at so in this case it
will be something like 150 degrees of
course you can modify this and then we
have a color in here which is that red
color so this is BA 0 C 2 F and we start
this at 0% like that so notice when i
refresh nothing happens we haven't got
any gradient going on in the moment so
next we want to duplicate this down and
we want to set this to about 44% and
I've already played around with these
figures and 44 for the red to end and
the black to star works quite nicely and
now duplicating this down we need the
same color as we used as the border for
starting at 44%
so that will start a 44% and it will end
at 56% and then from 56% we want white
and then to end naturally it would be a
hundred percent so this goes from red up
to 44 percent black from 44 to 56 and
then from 56 a hundred and because we
have these at the same values we don't
get any actual gradient we just get a
solid color like this so that's how
we're achieving our background so now
that we have this last thing I just want
to do is set a position of relative and
we are done so we need to think about
the center thing here so this is this
black bit just in here so how would we
define this out well rather than
creating a new element we're going to
use before and after
pseudo elements and these two elements
one is going to be for this cent a bit
here and one is going to be for this
white thing in here which we're going to
use a double border for we actually need
to create some kind of common stars
between these because they're gonna
share stars so in this case we're gonna
have a polka ball before and polka ball
after now when we define out a pseudo
element it needs to have a space in here
within double-quotes we can put text in
here but in our case we don't need to
and we want to set the border radius to
a hundred percent because these two
elements are naturally going to need to
be rounded we're gonna set a display of
block and most importantly we have a
position of absolute because we need to
be able to place this where we want
inside of here and I'm actually gonna
cut this border size down a little bit
as well there you go okay so to start
with we're gonna do the Polka ball
before so polka ball before and in here
we need to give a width a height the
left and top position and a background
color so let's start just by defining
out any background color just so you can
very clearly see where this is
positioned and inside of the main Polka
ball class here I want to define a
variable which represents the diameter
of the inner black circle so in here I'm
just gonna say before diameter like so
and this is just going to be the inner
size variable that we've created here so
of course we don't need to create
another variable for this but it helps
just if we need it to do anything else
with this it's got its own value so in
here then we want to set the width to
before diameter and likewise we want to
set the height to before diameter so we
now have the following now positioning
this is a little bit trickier and of
course when it comes down to the inner
one because we want the border to be the
same here and here it gets even more
tricky so this is the easy part we want
to set the left and the top values so
how would we work this out well if we
think about it all we need to do is
subtract the radius of it to set it into
the right position but for that to work
we need to assume that we have a
50% on the top and left like so so that
will do this so it's not in the center
but you can see where we're going with
this it's too far across this way and
it's too far down so if we take the
radius and subtract it we end up with a
centered circle so to do this we use the
CSS calc function and we want to from 50
subtract the diameter divided by 2 which
is the radius so we're gonna save our
before diameter divided by 2 and we can
just duplicate this line down and switch
over to left as well and that is it we
are done so we now have a centered
circle now we can just change the
background color over so we're going to
grab the border color that we had
earlier and set this to the background
color for this and we are done there we
go looking good already now after so
this is the after pseudo-element
this is going to be a little bit
trickier so the width and this is going
to be the after diameter which we
haven't defined but there's a little bit
more calculation to do here and I'll try
my best to explain this as we go along
so we want an after diameter like so now
this is going to be the result of the
before diameter so the outer circle that
we have in the middle - the border size
x 3 now I'm going to refer back to this
later and we can see why this is working
but essentially it's to do with the
border that we're going to give the
inner element so we'll do this now and
then we can work out how it works in
just a moment so we're gonna take the
boat before diameter we're gonna
subtract and we're going to put this
into brackets var and that is the polka
ball border size and then we are going
to multiply this by 3 so we'll come back
to this in a minute what we're really
interested in here is the width the
height which we've just worked out so we
can quickly define this in so far after
diameter and we can do the same thing
for the height as well and we're just
going to give this a background of let's
just say yellow just so we can see it
properly so there we go it's just
hovering around
just up here so that looks like it would
be a good fit for inside of there and it
actually is but we'll come back to that
in a minute
so now the even more difficult part is
the left and the top so we did this
before but now what we want to do is a
similar thing we want to take 50% and we
want to subtract and before we were
taking the radius by dividing the
diameter by 2 now what we want to do is
inside of here take the diameter so I'm
going to put this in as inside of a
another pair of parentheses so the after
diameter divided by 2 and we want to
then add on the boarder size so if that
doesn't make sense let's just do the
left which is going to be the same and
I'll try and explain this so let's just
take a look at it and you can see that
this is just about where we want it
remember we haven't defined the border
yet which is going to take up the rest
of the space so if we think about it we
have got a 10 pixel border size now for
the after diameter we're taking the
before diameter and we're subtracting
the border size times 3 now if we look
at defining a border you'll see how
these work so that's a double and we
will take the border size so poke all
border size and we will give this a
color let's say blue see if that there
we go so in fact let's make this a
little bit more say green maybe let's
zoom in so you can see here that what's
happened is the border here is defined
not only on the inside but the outside
as well so if we just come over to this
after pseudo-element pull it in that
let's push this over to the side you can
see here that we have the part here you
can see that we've got a 50 by 50 pixel
width but notice we have a 10 pixel
border on either side now what we want
to do is subtract the border on each
side but then we want room for this
around here so if you think about it
multiply by 3 because we've got room for
it here but then
this outer border we're gonna set to the
same color as this which will create the
same sizes outside here so now what we
can do is start to set these up so I'm
gonna set the background color of this
to white so you can see here now when I
set the border color here which is a
double border to black remember we've
got a temp ik so board adjust here we've
got ten pixels x two here that's why we
multiplied the and subtracted three
times of it because we've got one two
and then three so hopefully that makes
sense if it doesn't build it anyway and
they just play around with it afterwards
play around with the values and you'll
see so I'm gonna change the border size
and there we go so let's just zoom out
of here and zoom back into this one okay
so there is our local ball the good
thing now is that if I wanted to say
increase the size of the actual polka
ball nothing really changes this Hill
keeps up with it the same with the inner
size as well so if I set that to 100 the
middle moves with it if I go and change
the border size to 20 you can see that
this moves in with it as well so
everything stays in place when I
initially built this I didn't take this
into account and it's pretty awkward if
you want to change the size of it or
customize it in any way it's going to be
really difficult to do so let's just
return it back to say 250 90 and I think
that looks quite nice okay so maybe
change that that's waiting actually
there we go okay so onto the animation
what we want to do is create a hook on
the pokeball just here so we want to say
something like poker ball animated and
this will mean that when we have this
class attached it will actually animate
so the first thing then is just at the
top here I'm gonna say pokeball animated
and we're gonna set up some basic
animation properties and then we will
actually create the keyframes for this
animation so for the animation duration
we want to set this to one second if you
want it to go back and forth faster then
feel free to change this we want a fill
mode in here set to both we want an
iterate
encount we want this to be infinite so
iteration count to be infinite and we
want an animation name but we don't
actually have any keyframes just yet
algebra fact let's just take this down
to the bottom here so it's out of the
way so for the keyframes then we define
this using keyframes like this and then
we give it a name and inside of here we
just say well from a percentage to a
percentage what do we want to do to that
element and then in here this will work
so we can say now animation name shake
like so now the only thing with this is
I'm not using vendor prefixes as with
anything else I'm doing it will still
work in other browsers but of course if
you want to support older browsers then
you're going to want to change this
around so from we want to say transform
none so we don't want to transform
anything initially then we want to
define out what we want this to do at
the 20% mark now we're gonna use
transform we're going to translate this
3d like so we have an X like this we
have a Y and a Z value and then we want
to also rotate it using the rotate 3d
function as well and here we're gonna
say X Y and we are going to say 1 and
minus 10 degrees like so now this is
pretty much all we need to do we're
going to just to find out 40 50 60 % and
then we are pretty much done and we're
just going to change these around a
little bit more so if we just take a
look at that now you can see it just
flicks over to the side like so rotates
and also translates which basically just
means to move it across and that's
pretty much it so this does actually
look alright but we want to just add a
couple of more percentage marks here so
for 40% let's just say well we want this
to be 20% and then we want it to be a
rotation of 5 degrees so you can imagine
what this would do it just pulls it at
40% right the way back so it's just
pushing it over there and then we can
just add more just to make this a little
bit nice
so we're gonna say 50% we will do this
again to minus 10% so it's actually
shaking now it's going back and forward
we're setting
- and positive values here so let's set
this back to minus 10 degrees there we
go it's already starting to shake but we
need to just go and define say one more
just to make it a little bit smoother
60% we are going to say we want this to
be 10% and we want this to be 5 degrees
and then we're gonna say to transform no
and there we go so we now have a nice
shake pretty smooth and of course this
is gonna be infinite because that is how
we set it and that is pretty much it
although this is a very silly thing to
do I hope you learnt something about
first of all native CSS variables which
are really exciting the calc function if
you didn't know what it was about and of
course just general CSS stuff as well
it's all really in here linear gradients
as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
