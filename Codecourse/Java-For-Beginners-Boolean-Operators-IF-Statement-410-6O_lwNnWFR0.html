this Java series for beginners in this
video we're going to be looking at
boolean expressions and how we can use
them to manipulate our code do different
stuff depending on different outcomes so
first let's learn the syntax behind
boolean expressions in the last video I
briefly showed you the boolean variable
type which looks like this and this
value here is either a true or a false
value and let's look at the way we can
initialize this value here so if I make
a boolean variable called a and then we
could set it equal to something this
equal doesn't have to be true or false
it can be any expression involving
another boolean or a mathematical
expression that will produce a true or
false answer basically so I'm going to
show you all the different operators we
can use first of all for this I'll put
them in comments up here for
mathematical operations the most obvious
ones we can do are equal to we can do
greater than we can do less than or you
can do not equal to and these are the
mathematical ones we can do and I'll put
in the comments here how we represent
these in terms of the syntax so when
we're checking if something is equal to
we simply use a double equals like this
you may have seen this in other
programming languages or not you'll
notice it's pretty similar to when we
put a single equal sign but don't get
confused the single equal sign means
assign the right-hand value to the
left-hand variable if we put a double
equals it changes from assigning the
value to checking the value so that's
just one thing to be aware of so we have
the double equals for checking if one
statement on the left is equal to the
other statement on the right we have
greater than which looks pretty much the
same we use the greater than symbol and
there's also you can also have greater
than or equal to I'll just put
brackets there actually that might get
confusing I'll just go ahead and add a
whole new comment so we have greater
than we have less than they look as
normal as you normally would in
mathematics then we have greater than
equal to and we have less than if I can
spell equal two there we go
and let me just tap these out so we can
see them easily
okay so greater than equal to we use the
greater than symbol and then simply the
equal symbol like this this checks if
the statement on the left is greater
than or equal to the statement on the
right less than or equal to we use much
the same except obviously the less than
symbol and then we have not equal to
which we represent with an exclamation
mark
anam equals so we have the equal to a
checker which is the double equal sign
we have greater than and less than which
are look more or less the same as they
normally would we have greater than or
equal to which are pretty
self-explanatory same with less than
equal to and then we have the not equal
to which is the exclamation mark and the
equals so with all of these different
operators we can basically make
equations and then assign it to a
boolean variable and the equation has we
have to make sure it either returns a
true or false value and as you can
pretty much see using any of each of
these it will always return a true or
false value
so if checking if something is equal to
something else that will either return
true or false it will be equal to or it
won't be equal to for greater than the
number will either be greater than or
not greater than a or turn true or false
and the same for everything down here so
let's go ahead and set up a system out
print line
and let's go ahead and put our value a
in here so we're going to print out
either true or false depending what this
is so let's go ahead and use some of the
operators here so we can say if 2 is
equal to 2 like so and that may look
kind of hard to read you can always add
brackets around it if it's if it makes
it easier for you to read I will
actually keep those there just because
it makes it easier you can always use
brackets in Java to make your code more
readable for you can use them for
mathematical equations but bear in mind
brackets will make a difference in terms
of the mathematics that you're doing so
obviously operations in brackets will
always be done first and then the ones
afterwards the ones outside the brackets
will be done there so we have a boolean
variable called a and we're setting it
equal to we're setting the value on the
right equal to the variable on the left
and the value on the right here is equal
to whether 2 is equal to 2 I hope that
makes sense so obviously 2 is equal to 2
this statement here is going to return
true and store it in the variable a so
when we print this out here we're going
to see true so you can see we have true
here if we change this value to 3 for
example is 2 equal to 3
obviously that is false so we can see
false is returned and that's pretty
self-explanatory we can do this with
every other operator I'll just do quick
demonstrations so if 2 is greater than 3
obviously false if 2 is less than 3
obviously that's true and same with less
than equal to that will obviously return
true as well if 2 is not equal to 3 that
is true so we're going to return true so
you can see how we can use all these
operators here to create true false
statements and then we can store them
inside variables here so how can we
actually use these boolean variables
once we've got them so we can make
things called if statements and if
statements are the one of the most
fundamental things you'll be using in
any programming and it's basically a
statement that says if a condition is
true do this piece of code and then
later on we'll look at else statements
where if it's not true we can do a
different piece of code so the syntax in
Java for if statements is very simple
you simply write the word if you can see
it highlights in blue it's a built in
Java keyword then you can open normal
brackets parenthesis like so and then we
will open and close the spoke brackets
much like the ones we use for this main
method here and much like the ones we
use for the class it's these same spike
rackets so this is what the ax statement
looks like obviously we haven't actually
put a condition in yet so if I just tap
this in so we've basically going to have
if condition is true we're gonna do this
code here and obviously this isn't a
comment which is why you're seeing the
errors and I'll actually comment this
out here just so you can see the syntax
for it and I'll leave these comments up
here just so you can reference them so
this is the syntax for the if statement
if a condition is true then do this code
here and if the condition isn't true
simply the code inside these brackets
won't be run so let's go ahead and do
probably the most basic what we can do
we could say if true system dot out dot
print line a condition is true now
obviously if we run this we're going to
see this statement here because we've
put if true so Java is saying if the
statement inside if the condition inside
the if statement is true then do the
code inside the brackets here obviously
true is true so we're going to see this
here if we go ahead and write false if
false we can run this and we won't see
anything because the condition is not
true the conditions false so
the stuff inside here will not be run
now the the things you put inside the
condition in these brackets the
condition it can be as much or as little
code as you need so you can either use a
preset boolean value for example a like
so you can put the value of a in here
you can not just set a to true you can
set it equal to mathematical equations
like we've done so if 11 minus 1 is
equal to 10 for example this isn't this
equation here is either going to return
true or false we're saying if 11 minus 1
is equal to 10 bear in mind we're using
the double equals not the single equals
because we're checking if 11 minus 1 is
equal to 10 we're not assigning this
Vout we're not assigning this here to
this value here so if we run this we'll
see we get it
condition is true we can also just write
this statement directly in to the if
statement we don't need to have a sort
of helper variable like this although it
is this is easier to read in your code
but it doesn't have to be so we can say
if 11 minus 1 equals 10 like so and we
could do any amount of equations in here
so hopefully everything in this video
makes sense in the next video we're
going to be going over more in depth how
you can use the if statement and we'll
also be looking at a few more boolean
operators</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
