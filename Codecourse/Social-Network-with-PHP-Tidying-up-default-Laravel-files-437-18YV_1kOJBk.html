default layer of our installation what
I'm not going to be doing is using the
default controllers that we get for
authentication we're going to be
building these from scratch these are
useful if you're just quickly getting
into an application but we want to kind
of take this step by step so there's a
few things we will need to tidy up the
first thing is we're going to remove
this auth or these both these orth
controllers so I'm going to delete both
of these here and the next thing I want
to get rid of are the migrations that
handle migrating the database table for
the users so under database and
migrations there's two migrations here
one for the users table and one for the
password resets table so I'm going to
delete both of these files from here the
next thing we're going to get rid of is
under the resources folder we have these
assets that are included by default this
default SAS access CSS file we don't
really want this if you do want to do
some sass or less on the front-end you
can go ahead and set this up later
create your own gulp file and all that
kind of stuff and we do have a gulp file
here which by default uses elixir you
don't necessarily have to use a lick so
you can use your own gold file but we're
not going to be using this either so I'm
just going to get rid of that for now so
the next thing we'll get rid of is under
views we have this default welcome which
is the page that you can see just here
and we don't want that either so I'm
going to go ahead and get rid of that
just delete that and if you wanted to
under views and errors you can change
this 503 page I'm gonna be leaving that
there I'll let you go ahead and change
that if you want to later on we are
going to be implementing our own custom
404 error page but this is for if you
bring your app down it's just gonna give
you a be right back page which is just
the default styling so now we've tied it
up out default laravel installation we
can see that now this is actually going
to break because we don't have the
welcome view that we just deleted so
we're going to start off by creating a
home controller and we're going to build
our navigation at the top using
bootstrap as our front-end framework</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
