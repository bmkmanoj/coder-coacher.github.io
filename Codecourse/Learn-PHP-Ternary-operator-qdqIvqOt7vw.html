ternary operator in PHP and how it
provides a lot cleaner syntax to us
instead of using an if statement if an
if statement isn't required so we'll
jump in and actually take a look at a
quick example and we might want to check
that something's true and return a value
or we might want to you know do
something entirely else we might want to
echo something based on the fact that a
value equals another value so I'm just
gonna say admin equals true and we'll
use this as the basis for what we output
to the page now traditionally with an if
statement we say if and else and we say
if admin but if admin it was true with
type checking echo you are an admin
otherwise echo you are not an admin so
we already know how this works we've
seen it by looking at if statements
already in this case it says you are an
admin and if we change this to false
then this expression will obviously not
evaluate to true and therefore we see
this part of the else block now this is
a little complicated for the fact that
we're just outputting
something based on the fact that a
variable is either true or false so how
can we improve this what we can actually
change this 1 2 3 4 5 lion piece of code
to one single line and when you do that
using a ternary operator so the first
thing that we do is we assign the value
of the ternary operation to a variable
we output it anything that really works
in relatively the same way the the the
benefit of this is obviously that we
only need to do this on one line and use
echo or Sutton assignment once so this
looks slightly confusing but you know
once you use this it makes it saves a
lot of time it looks cleaner and it's
easier to read so I'm gonna say echo and
I'm gonna put brackets here straight
after echo now this is a little weird
but this is the same as the brackets in
an if statement so in this case we can
power
the expression that we want to evaluate
to true folks in here so I'm gonna say
if admin is equal to true
now what happens now do we use curly
braces this looks a bit strange well we
don't we use a question mark now this is
basically the equivalent of saying run
this if this expression evaluates to
true so in this case I'm just going to
use single quotes now why am i using
single quotes here to say you are an
admin well think of it this way if we
get rid of this check this is perfectly
valid syntax so all we're doing is we're
saying if this is true this should be
what comes after echo basically now for
an else we use a colon so here we can
say you are not an admin so this is
basically the equivalent to the if
statement that we created a moment ago
but it's all in one line so when i
refresh hits as your non admin and then
when I change this to true and we go
ahead and refresh the page it says you
are an admin so we've done this
effectively in in you know in one line
now we can get a little bit more
complicated than this so other than the
complicated expressions that we could
come out with and place inside of our
brackets we can actually perform other
other ternary operations inside of these
blocks so for example if I was to say
moderator equals true and let's just
assume that to be a moderator you have
to be an admin as well so what we could
do is we can say you're an admin and
then we can go ahead and concatenate on
another string and check whether this
there a moderator as well so I'm going
to go ahead and I'm going to just for
simplicity wrap this in brackets and
then I'm going to go ahead and I'm going
to say
moderator true and we'll just say you
are also a moderator and then we'll say
otherwise
in fact we'll just leave it at that more
limp use an empty string so this is
starting to look a little bit
complicated so probably not recommended
for one single line because we're
stretching a little fine it just
decreases the readability and
understandability of this code so what
we're basically doing here is we're just
saying is this user and admin yes you
are an admin so we basically output
everything or we run everything here we
automatically output this single this
this string here in single quotes but
then we concatenate on this string if
this is true or empty string if it's not
true so in this case what's going to
happen is when i refresh you're also
moderator oh we need to get rid of that
and place that in bracket sorry
so we're outputting this and then we're
concatenating on the check here so let's
go ahead and just rerun that there we go
so you are an admin you are also a
moderator what we can then do is if
we're not a moderator that would just
remove that and if we're not an admin
even if we are a moderator which doesn't
make sense or in this case doesn't make
sense it just says you are not an admin
so that's the ternary operator we've
looked at a slightly more complicated
example in terms of putting another
ternary operation inside the first
result of this or the true block of this
of this ternary operator but for small
things like if we just revert to our
previous example like this you are not
an admin this makes a lot more sense
because if you're just trying to quickly
output something to a page based on the
result of something it just means that
you don't have to use an if statement
where it's not necessary</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
