welcome to this video which is you know
kind of a tip video on the difference
between single and double quotation
marks in PHP now often when I'm helping
people I come across people that have
confused about you know the use of
single and double quotation marks
particularly when using variables things
like that so I'm just going to you know
create well essentially go over the
difference between single and quotation
single and double quotation marks in PHP
and the different ways that we can use
them and not the correct and the wrong
ways but you know the ways that have
been often tested to be faster of course
when you program things are about
readability and how you can read code
and how other people can read code but
it's often good to adhere to one
standard you know so if you have say two
or three people working on a project
everyone adheres to the same standard
really when you're writing code you know
with something as simple as single and
quote double quotation marks the speed
difference is often you know irrelevant
it doesn't really matter but this is
just a quick video to go over some of
the ways that we can you know sort of
make this a lot easier for ourselves
okay so my way of doing things is when I
go ahead and say echo something out if
it's just plain text I will always use
single quotation marks so for example if
I was to say echo hello world I've only
used text I'm using single quotation
marks nothing in this needs to be
escaped so there's no additional say
hello world even though that doesn't
make sense
usually I'd have to escape that
character there however there's nothing
within this that needs to be taken into
account so when i refresh my browser i
just let's get rid of that s it doesn't
make sense when i refresh
got hello world so you know really this
is what I would do now let's say we had
a variable so name equals Alex and again
quite funny but notice I've used single
quotation marks around here because I'm
just including plain text nothing else
now if I was to say hello name this
wouldn't actually work when we refresh
in the browser we get the actual
representation of what we've what we
want to replace so you know we want to
replace this here with the variable that
we've defined up here however we're not
we're not getting that now the one way
to do it would be to use double
quotation marks now using double
quotation marks has been proved in some
cases to be slower it works
it replaces the name here with the name
life defined here however the the other
way to do this would be to use single
quotation marks but go ahead and use
multiple parameters now I say multiple
parameters because a lot of people have
not understood that the the echo
language construct can take multiple
parameters it almost acts as as a
function so if I if for example I was to
keep in single quotation marks but a
table let's let's write it from the
beginning it's going to make it a lot
easier so I'm going to say hello then I
want a comma a space and then I want to
concatenate on the name now I can
obviously use a dot so I could say name
so I'm using a full stop there this
would work however we are unnecessarily
concatenated let's go ahead and
concatenate another string on which is
an exclamation mark so we're now
unnecessary concatenating we don't need
to concatenate when we use echo we can
use commas instead so essentially what
this is here is an argument or a
parameter that we've passed through to
echo this is another parameter that
we've passed through
and this is another promise that we've
passed through so if for example we were
to do this you know it doesn't work
that's because echo is not a function
however it acts like a function in the
fact that we can pass multiple values
using a comma separated list now if for
example we were going to say sentence
equals or is it sentence
I think it's answer never mind if I was
to say sentence equals hello name now
you'll notice that this doesn't work so
let's go ahead and echo out sentence I'm
that's annoying me that I might so if i
refresh you'll notice that we've got a
problem here well you know what can the
problem be all we've done is replaced
the echo with a variable surely that
would work we'll actually know we would
have to come in and we'd have to
concatenate this as well what sorry
instead that's because we're not using
echo directly we're concatenated this
this will now be this string with Alex
replaced in there and then we're just
echoing that out so when we refresh we
have this sentence echoed out so you
know you can see the difference between
these methods of course we could go in
and use double quotation marks which is
seemed to be you know slightly heavier
on processing some people might not
worry about that which is fair enough
you might not have that much output in
your code in which case it wouldn't
matter but you know the most important
thing here is not I'm saying to you this
methods correct or another method is
incorrect the only thing I would point
out is that concatenated an echo is
probably not recommended everyone's done
it but the correct way would be if we
were to echo something out of course
concatenation does work but the correct
way would be to use a comma separated
list of values however we have different
standards of Co
style which are all you know not arguing
against each other but they're all
maintaining that their standard looks
the best performs the best in an actual
fact the only thing that matters that is
that you perform to a particular
standard especially if you're working in
a group of people even to people if you
were to come in and you were to write
this and then another person was to come
in and do something like this you can
see how it you know it does look a mess
even these couple of lines do you know
look a mess we're not doing the same
thing we've used double quotes here and
then concatenate an echo we're here
we're using single and passing through a
comma-separated value and really you're
not you're not adhering to one style of
coding so my recommendation would be
when you start a project even you're
even yourself within multiple files keep
the same standard of writing code and
get you used to doing that if someone
then says to you use single quotes
instead you know you can either choose
to ignore their advice or take their
advice but the main thing is to stick to
one coding style and you know really
this tips just been about using single
and double quotation marks there are a
variety of other coding standards you
can adhere to for example a moment ago
when I used concatenation you saw that I
used a space in-between as opposed to
using no spaces this is part of the Zen
coding standard and it just increases
readability we can easily see that
that's hello name then an exclamation
mark if we had say lots of other
concatenation and this for example it's
a variable instead of an echo output we
you know that the readability does
increase so that's just a quick tip on
single and double quotation marks and
how they
can be used as I said there's no right
way but as long as you adhere to a
coding style and you know you stick to
it
then that's the main thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
