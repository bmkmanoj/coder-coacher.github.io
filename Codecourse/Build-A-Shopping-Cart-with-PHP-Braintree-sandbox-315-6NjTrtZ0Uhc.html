important that we get our sandbox set up
so we can actually process payments when
we get to the checkout stage and I'm
going to walk you through the sandbox
exactly what you can find there I'm also
going to look at where we're going to
find out API keys which is really
important because obviously what we're
going to need to do is use them to
process payments so if we just head over
to the Braintree website so if you just
head over to Braintree payments comm
you'll see here the ability to try the
sandbox so what you're going to want to
do is sign up for this the sandbox is
essentially just replication of what you
would find in a normal production
environment on Braintree but of course
what you're not doing is taking actual
payments you can see everything that
you'll be able to do you can see your
payments coming in we already saw this
in the introduction video but it's
important that you get this set up so
you're ready to go so once you are
signed up for the sandbox you will see
something like this obviously with no
actual payments process just yet if you
already have a Braintree sandbox that's
great you can just go ahead and sign in
so on here we obviously just have a
graph with the sales volume over a
30-day period but of course as we've
already seen what we can do is we can
drive into the transactions now in here
you can filter by lots of different
types so if you're seeing any
unsuccessful payments you can just come
in here and filter by what you need and
of course what you can also do is filter
by a specific creation range and what's
really good as well you have different
fields that you can filter by here as
well really powerful search
functionality so generally you can just
find whatever you need so if we just
dive into the payment we made at the
start we can go ahead and click on the
ID just here of course at a glance here
we can just see all the information
about that particular payment and there
are a couple of options here so we have
lots of transaction information here we
can see the merchant reviews which we'll
spoke about speak about in a minute and
of course we have the amount as well we
have the fact that it's submitted for
settlement it will go through the
process of being submitted for
settlement it will then settle and then
it will be in a settled state and you
can see here we get other information
that's really useful the card that's
being used etc so how about we talk
about the merchant account
and also the API credentials as well
there's a ton of other stuff you can do
in here as well including over in the
vault if you're creating customers
subscriptions if you eventually want to
do subscription payments but you know I
let you go through and just see all of
this stuff for yourself so over in
account under my user you'll find your
API keys that you'll need to use so if
you just scroll down you'll see here API
keys tokenization and encryption keys if
you just click on here you will see your
API keys just here so you should have
one set up already if you don't go ahead
and click generate new API key and that
will create one for you so we have our
public key we have our private key which
is hidden by default but we can click
view and this will go ahead and show it
to us and we also see the merchant ID
that we're using and of course the
environment as well now when we set this
up on our shopping cart we'll actually
specify that this is going to be the
sandbox environment these products
shouldn't credentials won't work in
production so you can see some code
examples here as well so if you want to
just switch over to PHP you can see how
you actually set up your configuration
and of course what we're going to be
doing is exactly this will refer back to
this a bit later
now you also under settings and
processing have lots of different things
you can do so familiarize yourself with
this the different types of payments we
can accept so Apple pay PayPal which of
course is enabled by default in the
sandbox we saw it in introduction and
down here you will see a list of your
merchant accounts so here we have Co
cost GBP which is the default merchant
account and this is the one that we're
going to be using to process test
payments when it comes over to the
production side of things this will be a
slightly of ancestor but it's a very
similar deal the sandbox is literally
just a replication of production and as
long as you know what merchant account
is we're just processing now in GBP as
the currency these are the payment types
we accept pretty straightforward so the
most important thing about all of this
is just having a really good look around
and just familiarizing yourself with
things otherwise head over to account my
user come down to your API keys and of
course we'll use these later on when we
actually start to process payments
so a big shout-out to our friends at
Braintree payments for supporting code
course why make payment integration more
difficult than it has to be brain trees
full stack payment platform lets you
accept nearly any type of payment on any
device with a simple integration it's
flexible to your systems needs and
supports most programming languages so
whether you're using Java PHP Ruby or
Python it will always find a client or
server side SDK available for your
integration Braintree makes payment and
your job a lot easier you can learn more
