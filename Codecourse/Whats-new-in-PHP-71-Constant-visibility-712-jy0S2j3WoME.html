entirely necessary but it is a nice
addition and this is constant visibility
types now we know that if we have say
some kind of class and i'm going to call
this an alcoholic product we may in here
have a constant to find out maybe the VA
tier 8 so in this case it may be fifty
percent now if we need to have some
other class maybe beer and this extends
an alcoholic product and I know this is
a silly example but kind of bear with me
we're going to go ahead and create a new
product just here and this is just going
to be a veer now in this case what we
can actually do is directly access the
products v80 by using the scope
resolution operator on this constant so
if we go over to the browser we see 50
now we may not want to do this let's say
this was something that we only wanted
to output in some kind of formatted way
we might have something like get dat
label which went ahead and returned the
VAT just in here but then also may be
appended on a percentage so this might
be something that you would want to do
and of course you would do this by
calling down here echo product and then
get dat label so if we just go ahead and
refresh here and just fix this up like
that we see the following so the problem
here is then that we have the visibility
of this always on public now what we can
actually do in PHP 7.1 is as we can with
normal properties so any kind of
property that we define inside of a
class we know that we can use protected
we can use public or we can use private
well we can do that with Constance now
just by simply prepending with whichever
visibility we won so in this case we
might say that it's protected maybe we
want to access it within here or we just
didn't want it to be accessed outside of
this class so now if we try and access
this directly we get cannot access
protected constant that and of course we
can still use this because it's only
protected so really this is just about
adding something in here that allows you
to control the visibility if you were to
say private we know that we cannot
access this within beer if it's
protected
we know that we can access it within
here and of course if it's public we
know we can access it within here here
and also outside of here as well so
really just about the visibility of this
a nice small addition but helps you kind
of clear things up so it makes sense so
in this case I would probably go ahead
and set this to protected and then just
use any guetta I'd set for this value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
