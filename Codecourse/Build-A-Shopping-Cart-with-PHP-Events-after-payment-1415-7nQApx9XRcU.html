we need to do after we've made a
successful payment with Braintree and
that is just do things like mark the
orders pays we need to update the stock
levels for the products that we already
have in the products table we need to
empty the users basket and then if the
payment was declined we can record that
as a failed payment so let's start to
think about how we're gonna do this and
the first thing we're gonna do is set up
a payment model so remember over in our
database here we have a payments table
this has the order ID that this relates
to in our database we have a failed
whether it failed or not we have a
transaction ID and it created out an
update to that date so let's create a
model in here then this is our payment
model and we can go and just pull this
over as a kind of structure and we'll
just update everything that we need to
be able to be filled so we change the
name of the model we can get rid of this
here and what we need to do is change
this to allow failed to be entered and
we also want to be able to insert the
transaction ID and that is it so let's
add this to our container just so we
have it available so let's go and just
copy this down go ahead and add this in
like so return a new payment model and
then we'll just pull this in at the top
so everything works perfect so that's
how payment model set up we can worry
about that in a minute but what we need
to do is set up something that doesn't
allow us to enter loads and loads of
code within here so we're going to set
up event handling now we're going to do
this by ourselves because it's not very
tricky so we're gonna start by creating
a base event class from this we can have
as many events as we want in our case we
just have one event this is order was
created now as part of that we're gonna
have lots of different handlers in
separate classes because what we want is
for each of these classes to only be
responsible for one thing so it just
helps to keep things nice and tidy
so we have our Braintree
payment here we can check whether this
was successful down here in a moment but
let's just start to set up our event and
our handlers so instead of app I'm gonna
create a vent folder and inside of here
I'm going to create a base event so we
can extend this when we want to create
any other events so the namespace for
this will be caught event and we'll call
this events actually so let's just
rename this folder and now we have if we
just close this off so we can reopen it
a class of event so the way this is
going to work then is we're going to be
able to attach handlers to a specific
event so let's say we have an order was
created event which is exactly what
we're doing so order was created dot PHP
so this is going to be obviously under
cart events and the class here is order
was created and that is going to extend
our base event so over an event then
once we have an order was created event
we need to be able to attach handlers
now these handlers are going to be
things like empty basket and do things
like mark and order is paid and all that
kind of stuff so we need a way to store
these handlers to then run them after we
have attached them so we have a handler
just heal rather handlers just here and
here we're gonna have an attach method
this will allow us to attach an array of
handlers or a single handler so why
don't we just look at our handlers first
of all and then we'll kind of make this
work so we can just see how it works so
inside of handlers then let's create a
contracts folder and this is basically
going to be a handler contract which
will allow us or make us implement a
specific method because we're going to
be calling that from our event class
so again if this is confusing it will
make a lot more sense when we actually
get down to using this you'll see how it
all works so this is going to be our
handler interface so in here let's just
give this a name space so it's under
cart
handlers and contracts so this is an
interface and it's our handler interface
so what methods what's our handle
interface have well it has a handle
method like so and into this we receive
an event and that's all we need to do
for that so why don't we just set up a
handler just to test that this works so
let's create an empty basket handler
that's pretty straightforward so empty
basket so we just name it exactly what
it's actually doing and what this is
going to do is implement that handler
interface so let's start with our
namespace and this is just cart handlers
and the class is empty basket
so this implements our handler interface
so let's pull our hand it interface in
so use cut handlers contracts that's how
handler interface so now we have to
implement a handle method and we accept
through here an event so what we'll do
for now is we'll just kill this and we
will say empty basket just so we know
that this works so once we create or at
least instantiate our order was created
event we can attach our empty basket
handler and then when we run this it
will do everything that's attached to it
so inside of our base event then how do
we actually attach a handler well the
first thing to do is check if this is an
array so if this handlers that's passed
in happens to be an array we can loop
through the handlers that we're
attaching to the
event so we say for each handlers as
handler now we can do a check-in here to
say if it's not an instance of our
handler interface so we can go and just
pull that up in here so use cut handlers
contracts handler interface if it's not
an instance of that it means that we
don't have a handle method on it so we
don't want to attach it now otherwise we
want to say this handlers and then
attach that handler so now outside of
this for each we just want to return and
then down here this point means that
this isn't an array because it's outside
of our if statement so in that case it's
just a normal handler so in here we can
just say handlers like this and of
course what we can do down here is say
if handlers instance of handler
interface or rather if it's not an
instance of that we can just return so
essentially what we're doing is we are
attaching handlers to this event either
by passing an array in or a single
handler now we need down here a dispatch
method so let's create a dispatch method
and in here we just want to loop through
all of our handlers so this handlers as
handler and then we want to say handler
handle and then past this event in so
this might seem complicated but we're
going to jump straight over to our order
controller and actually use this now so
the first thing we want to do is create
a order was created event so let's do
that now so event equals new cart events
order was created now we then can attach
our handlers so we can say event
attached and we can pass an array of
handlers now we know that we have a
handler which is cart handlers empty
basket and now what we can do is down
here we can say event dispatch so we
have an event we have a handler for this
event we can add multiple handlers in
here which we will be doing and then
adding Morand here and then when we
dispatch we should see this die here so
let's test this out and if anything goes
wrong we can fix this up so let's just
quickly fill this in
and let's go on a down payment
information in here so expiry CVV and
our postal code and let's go ahead and
place this order so we get handle it
interface not found in our empty basket
that's absolutely fine so what we do is
we can just grab car handlers contracts
oh and it looks like it's already there
so we just misspelled this farming so
handler interface and that should be
fine so let's refresh and there we go so
we get a dump with empty basket so let's
leave this browser as is we can just
keep refreshing we have all the formal
information in there already so
hopefully that makes a little bit more
sense and we can have multiple handlers
in here to do different jobs so what we
actually need then is all of the other
handlers so we'll outline these first of
all what we'll do instead is we will do
a var dump within each of these just so
we can see that these are working and
then we will hook these up and do what
they're supposed to do so the next
handler we want to create is to mark the
order as paid so let's just copy this
over create a new file and this is going
to be to mark order paid like so and
we're just saying here mark
order paid I'll do the same here mark
order paid and we can do the rest of
them now so we have two payment ones
which is recording a successful payment
I'm recording a failed payment so in
here we can create this so record failed
payment
and then in here we'll just write record
failed payment and we could do the same
thing then for recording a successful
payment so record successful payment
like so I will just change this as well
great so we have one more to create
which is updating the stock of the items
that we've checked out with so let's
create a new handler
our last handler and that is updating or
rather update stock now hopefully you
can see the benefit we have a lot of
things to do here and if we were doing
these all within the controller and not
having separate classes to handle these
it will get really messy so let's just
close all of these off and we will go
back over to our order controller and
down here we will attach the relevant
event handlers so we don't want to
attach all of these because obviously we
have things like recalling a failed
payment which we don't always want to do
but down here we want to do at least
updating stock we want to mark the order
as paid and we want to record a
successful payment now we're gonna look
at our result back from Braintree and if
it's the case that this happens to fail
remember earlier we look to the response
here we can say result success and if
that wasn't a success what we can then
do is say event attached and we can
attach a new record unsuccessful payment
or record failed payment and then we can
immediately dispatch this because we
don't add any more in we don't empty the
basket we don't update the stock mark
the order has paid or record a
successful payment and if we do happen
to have a failed payment we just
in the same response with redirect and
we will redirect back to the order index
page so we just do what we already know
we just use our Rooter to grab half
order index so we'll force this to fail
in a minute just so we can see that this
works but otherwise we attach these
events so empty in the basket updating
stock and all that stuff and then we
dispatch and just down here we're gonna
die in fact we can just leave that as it
is and just see a white screen okay so
now what we should see is empty basket
update stock market has paid and records
successful payment when we go ahead and
refresh this page and it looks like I've
called this failed full payment so let's
get rid of this and of course this isn't
gonna work at the moment because what's
going to happen is we've already
basically used this token so what we're
gonna have to do is just go back which
makes sense we're not going to keep
charging the user we're gonna go and
just I'm just gonna fill these details
in again
and once again we'll come over here into
our payment details and we should as
long as we've not made any errors on our
end see them dumped out so we empty the
basket we update the stock we mark the
orders paid and we record the successful
payment great so now let's just force
this to fail in fact it will fail the
next time around it should at least
because we don't want to keep charging
that so we redirected back you see so we
want to in that case record a failed
payment if the users card was declined
and then otherwise we'll just do these
so let's start with the kind of
successful ones so emptying the basket
updating the stock to be able to do
these things we need to pass into our
event some dependencies so we need to
take in the order that the user has
created so that's the order we know that
we this comes right here and we also
need to pass in the current basket so we
just say this basket and that's it so
now we can go over to our order was
created event and we can create a
constructor in here and we can take into
this an order and the basket and we can
type the Hindi's if we want so we could
say order and we could say we want this
to be an instance of basket and up here
we can just say use cart models order
and use cart
basket basket that just means that you
know that you're getting them through
and then we're gonna say this order
equals order and we'll do exactly the
same thing for V basket so now up here
we wanted to find public order and
public basket so we can access them
within our event handlers now how do we
access them within our event handlers
we'll remember when we call dispatch we
call the handle method on each handler
passing through the event now I know
this is this and we're currently an
event but because this is a subclass it
will pass through the order was created
event so let's go through these one by
one and just update them and then we can
go
and test them so for emptying the basket
then this is just a case of saying event
basket because we now have on here that
public basket property and we just say
clear that will empty the basket of
course we no longer on the items in
there the user has checked out so that's
that one done the next one is marking
the order as paid so for this one we
just say event order update so this is
now our model paid true done so that was
easy and you can see this is nice
because we're separating out this
functionality into small pieces and they
only have one responsibility it's easy
to know where to come when you want to
update these so to record a failed
payment them well what we actually need
to do is do something like this so we
need to say event or dust that order
model and then we need to say payment
create so we're creating now a payment
record and we want to say failed true
now what's gonna happen here is it's
gonna fail this is isn't gonna work
because we don't have a payment
relationship on our order model so we
can very quickly update this now in our
models so let's go over to order and we
need to down here say payment and we
just returned this has one payment like
so we can go and pull this up here even
though we know that we don't necessarily
need to do that so there we go that's
our relationship done and now if there
was a failed payment for any reason
we're now updating or we're creating a
payment record remember in here from
that order and that will automatically
populate the order ID and it'll set this
to true so now that we've done that we
can move on to a successful payment so
if we have a successful payment what we
want to do is say event order and then
we say payment create and then into this
we know that failed is going to be false
we know that we have a success
for payment and we want to insert the
Braintree transaction ID so where did
this come from well what we need to do
is go over to back over to our order
controller and we need to when we
actually create this record successful
payment we want to take the response
from Braintree grab the transaction
object and grab the ID from it so now
into successful payment we actually have
this property so we can create a
constructor for this and this will take
in the transaction ID you could also
pass the whole transaction in if you
wanted if you wanted to store anything
else from the Braintree transaction
result but for now we'll just stick with
the ID so we're gonna say this
transaction ID transaction ID and then
up here we can have a protected
transaction ID so now we can just say in
here this transaction ID
simple as that so we now lastly have
update stock so we need to update the
stock for all of our items that the user
has purchased so what we're going to do
is we're going to loop on this and we
are going to say for each event basket
all as product now what we're doing
technically here is creating a query for
each loop now there's nothing
necessarily wrong with this just
basically decrementing the stock but you
might find a better way to do this so go
ahead and maybe have a look around
either way what we're doing is we're
taking each of them products from our
bar skier and we're saying decrement the
stock and we're saying product quantity
because we want to decrease the stock by
the amount of quantity we have for that
particular product and that's all we're
doing here okay
so now that we've got all of our
handlers set up let's just close
everything off except our order
controller and just make sure this is a
working
so let's just go and type in some card
details again in fact let's go from
through the whole kind of flow I think
this is probably better so let's get rid
of these I suppose and it's go over and
add maybe one of these let's just check
the stock levels as well I think to test
this out it's probably good to just set
ten for each of these just so we know
how many we're decrementing by so let's
have two of these and we will have maybe
four of these and then we'll have a few
of these why not and then we will check
out go ahead and into my details
and then obviously into our payment
information and now when we hit place
order this will love this to be a
successful payment we should see okay so
we've got an undefined index default and
I know the reason this has happened I'm
guessing it's because we've emptied the
basket before we've done everything else
emptying the basket should come last
because obviously once we have emptied
the basket we don't have any products in
there to go ahead and do anything like
updating the stock with so let's think
about this we need to mark the order as
paid record a successful payment update
the stock and empty the basket okay so
let's go back then and you see we have
no item from the basket now let me just
go through and add some of these and
then we'll catch up on the order form
okay so I have some items in here then
let's just check out stock levels I
don't think these will have been reduced
note they're still all at ten so let's
go and check out and I'm going to go
into my details again
and we're going into our payment
information
so I expiry and now what we should see
is all of them event in the right order
obviously we're not claiming our basket
we now see a blank page which is fine
because we're not actually doing
anything
eventually what we'll do is redirect to
the order summary page which ruling in
the next part but now we should see over
in orders the last order we created with
this one here 7450 and we see it's be
marked as paid which is good we see our
orders attached so 14 so I had one of
them four of them and two of them and
over in payments we say that we have a
successful payment this is for this one
here this is the transaction ID and then
of course over in products we see this
stock reduced we've got a four reduced
here one reduced stock here and two
reduced stock it so that is it
everything is working and although that
was again a little bit of setup you can
use this event handler anywhere you want
so just create a new event past anything
you need through to it and then of
course you can attach any of your
handlers and then go ahead and dispatch
that so let's just finally look at what
happens when we don't have a successful
payment so what I'm gonna do is just
replace this with one so this will
always run and let me go back and just
fill this out again we'll just add one
item here now just to make this a little
bit quicker I'm gonna go and fill my
details out
and
and enter some payment details in here
again and it's going to place the order
so this shouldn't purposely make it fail
now and you can see that we redirected
back so we'd have to enter payment
details again of course like I said you
can show a flash message here if you
want to integrate that we have a series
on that as well so now that we have made
this foul let's just undo that so we
don't forget and over in payments you
can now see we have a failed payment and
I've just noticed that we didn't allow
them now on the transaction ID so oh we
did so you could enter null in there so
what you could do is part of your we
just go over to our handlers record
failed payment in here you could say
transaction ID null or what you could do
is set this to a default in here in your
database as null might make sense rather
than having to enter in here as well so
there we go that is our event handling
after we have created a order after
we've taken payment we just duel them
things just to set things up we've done
this in a nice clean way that doesn't
get in the way in our controller it
means we don't have loads of code
hanging around in here if you want to
update the way that the either of these
work you just go over and update your
event center thanks to Braintree
payments for supporting code course why
make payment integration more difficult
than it has to be brain trees for stack
payment platform allows you to accept
nearly any type of payment on any device
with a simple integration it's flexible
and supports most programming languages
so with SDKs for net nodejs
Java Perl Python and Ruby you'll always
have a client and server-side solution
for your integration Braintree makes
payments and your job a lot easier
