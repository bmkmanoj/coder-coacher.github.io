going to look at the switch statement
and more look at the syntax and how this
is used now this is similar to an if
statement in the sense that it will work
in exactly the same way we can pass in a
value and check this against other
values but there are fundamental
differences really because the way it's
laid out makes it more appropriate for
different types of checking so for
example in the previous video we looked
at if statements switch statements in
that case would not be appropriate
however if we have perhaps a couple of
actions that we know that we want to
look out for a couple of values that we
know we want to look out for the switch
statement can work with us nicely so
let's go ahead and just create a little
example application and this will
involve taking a name it will be taking
do we want this name to be uppercase or
lowercase and then we're going to use a
switch statement to determine which one
that we want to do so do we want to
convert this name to all uppercase
characters or all lowercase characters
and what we're then going to do is by
default just return the name as it's
provided so we're going to use a couple
of functions now as well that they're
available to us in PHP so let's go ahead
and define a name so I'm just gonna pop
Alex and I'm gonna say action equals
either upper or lower so this could be
upper or lower that's basically how it
could look so instead of doing an if
statement if action equals upper what
we're gonna do is we're gonna use a
switch because this makes it a little
easier to work out what's going on so a
switch looks like this we use the switch
key word we use brackets to basically
pass in which variable that we want to
switch so we want to switch action
because we want to determine whether
action is upper or whether action is
lower and you'll also notice that this
makes it really easy to read the way
that we're gonna lay lay this out so we
have different cases so we have a case
with a potential value so in this case
we want to say case something so in this
case it would be upper then we want to
come down a couple of lines after we use
a colon
here not a semicolon and we want to
break so this is really the same as if
action equals upper whereas this is the
case and this is the break but obviously
it's not an if statement and we use this
because it looks a little neater so in
this case what we want to do is we want
to say well what do we want to do in
case upper we want to go ahead and set
name equal to STR to upper which is a
PHP function name now we come down to
the the line off to the last break and
we say case lower and then we break
again and we do exactly the same thing
here
whereas we take the name and we say name
equals STR to lower now we can have a
default so we could say something like
default and then break in actual fact
what we'll do is we will create a new
variable called name changed and that's
going to be just an empty string so in
this case we'll say name changed equals
STR to lower name changed equals STR to
upper and by default what we want to do
is we want to say name changed equals
just the name so we're not doing
anything so now what we're gonna say is
we're gonna say echo name changed so
what's gonna happen here is we well as
we scan down we can see that we either
take a case of upper or lower and by
default we don't do anything so we can
clearly see what we're doing here so
what we can do is we'll say action
equals upper for now when we go ahead
and refresh our page you see that we get
an uppercase version of our name whereas
if we change this to lower when we hit
the switch will take the action it will
see that the case is lower and we'll say
well it will see that the the value of
this variable is lower and then it will
basically set the strings case to lower
case so there we go we see Alex and then
obviously by default if we don't provide
anything so
if this is just an empty string for
example it's something other than up or
lower then we just get the original
value back for the name so as you can
see this is a little bit of a nicer way
to layout an if statement if you find if
statements are not required then a
switch might be what you need to just a
bit more effectively lay out the logic
of checking whatever you need to check</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
