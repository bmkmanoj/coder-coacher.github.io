elasticsearch on a digital ocean droplet
so whether or not you use digital ocean
already we're going to go from start to
finish and then in the end of the
tutorial we're just going to test a
request to our server so the first thing
we want to do is actually create a
droplet so I'm just going to create a
droplet with the name of es we can just
choose some standard options here it
doesn't really matter we're going to
choose an abundant and then I'm going to
hit create droplet so I haven't
protected this with SSH but my root
password is going to be emailed to me so
once this is up and running we can go
ahead and SSH over to the server okay so
now that's done let's SSH over to our
server I'm going to SSH using the root
account which has been generated for us
and let's go ahead and grab the password
for this and just pop that in there okay
so it's asking to change the root
password so let's just do that there we
go
okay so the first thing that we need to
do is we need to update apt so we're
going to do apt-get update and once
that's done we need to install Java
Runtime because elasticsearch depends on
this so the first thing we need to do is
add a repository that contains the Java
Runtime so we're going to say sudo apt
add repository PPA web update team Java
and one that's the once that's done
we're then gonna update again okay so
now that's done we can actually run the
installer for Java 7
so obviously it's Oracle Java 7 and
installer there we go let's hit yes to
continue and then we're going to hit OK
here to accept the license and then hit
yes right so now that's done that was a
little bit complicated but we can test
that we're
running Java just by typing Java and
version and you can see if I just clear
that and run it again where we get our
Java version back so we know that we
have our dependencies installed now
we're going to go and install
elasticsearch so heading over to
elasticsearch org slash download we have
the debian package this is what we want
so I'm going to copy the link address
for this and then I'm going to go ahead
and back in here I'm going to just do a
double you get on that dress so that's
going to pull that and download that
file for me and because this is a debian
package what we can now do is say d he
kg which stands for debian package and
we can install what we've just
downloaded so in this case I'm going to
just copy this here and then I'm going
to paste it there and there we go that
looks like it's done so this will
automatically start up whenever you
start your server there's an
initialization created for this but
let's take a look at where elasticsearch
has been installed it does actually tell
us just here so if we just copy and
paste this we can just CD over to that
directory there we go
it's delisting here you can see all the
normal things here now in the bin folder
for binaries you can see that we've got
elastic search and we've also got plugin
which allows us to install elastic
search plug-ins if we need to now the
most important thing now is actually
running elastic search so I'm just going
to run elastic search and that will just
start up as normal as if you are sort of
running it on local so now we can
actually head over to something like
postman and or really just in your
browser it doesn't really matter if you
just want to test this but I'm going to
send a request to this on port 9 200
which is the port that elasticsearch
runs on and there we go we get back the
status or the information or the meta
whatever you want to call it of the
server or the elastic search build your
configuration files are located if we
just come out of elastic search here are
located in etc elastic
search see them here you can modify what
if you want here is normal and then just
restart elasticsearch now bear in mind
that you will need to protect this
server against public access when you're
using it and their variety ways of doing
this so go ahead and look this up and
decide which is the best method for you
I'm not going to cover this in this
video but here we've covered installing
