with PHP or any other language you
usually think well maybe I could use
regular expressions for this
well actually PHP gives us a function
that allows us to take a URL and split
it up into parts that you can see in
front of you right now so we've got the
scheme host port path query and a
fragment which is basically anything
after the hash in a URL so we're going
to look at how we can do this really
easily with PHP for getting regular
expressions and just making this just
simple to do okay so we're going to
start with creating a URL so I'm
basically just going to create a
variable here that's going to hold a URL
it will be basically anything that you
would usually put into an address bar so
I'm going to put an HTTP colon forward
slash forward slash dub-dub code course
comm there you go so let's start with
this very very basic example and you
could use this in any application really
if you need to take a URL from a user
you may need to analyze different parts
of it and this is where this is really
useful so I'm going to create another
variable called past URL and this is
going to be using the pars underscore
URL function built into PHP and then
we're going to pass in the URL we want
to pass simple as that let's go ahead
and just echo out within pre tags just
so this looks a little bit nicer and
we're going to concatenate but we're
going to output print R on the URL and
we'll just pop true in there so we then
get this now if we enter past URL it
makes a lot more sense so here we get an
array back so we can use this as we
normally would an array you could change
it to an object if you wanted to but
we've basically got the scheme and the
host so this will this is automatically
detected that we have an HTTP and scheme
and we've said HTTP forward slash
forwards totem forward slash forward
slash if this was FTP you can imagine it
would do exactly the same thing and
detect that it was FTP so let's add a
few more parts to this URL just to see
what we can do for this let's say we had
a port here and this does support
username passwords in line but I don't
think that
massively important is not a it's not
great so we're just going to stick with
ports and then the rest of the things so
we've got say port nine two hundred that
will then split this and say well this
is being accessed to port nine 200 and
what we have is a path so any path that
you add it doesn't matter
this won't specifically split this path
up for you but you could go ahead and do
that with explode or something like that
so let's say for example tutorials slash
tutorial one and then if we take a look
at that that will give us that whole
path here now if again like I said you
want to split this up further you could
go ahead and do something like path
equals explode and then you could pass
in a forward slash because we have
forward slashes in there and then you
could enter the past URL path and then
from that we would get if we just do a
quick print our on path and just comment
this out you'll see we get the following
so you've got nothing here you would
need to do a little bit of adjustment
here but you've got tutorials tutorial
one so that's just a little bit of a
sidetrack just to see how we would do
that but let's get back to this we've
got that path now but what about our
query string now obviously our query
string is anything that we send via the
URL which can be picked up on the server
so for example we have a question mark
which starts off how query string we
could say something like pretty equals
true and I don't know number equals one
it you know it doesn't really matter
what we do here and then you can see
here that we have that query output for
us so you can see here how easy this is
we don't really even need to think about
it it just does it for us and gives us
the result and finally less commonly
used would be something like the the
hash at the end of a URL usually used
within applications to point you up and
down I hardly used for things like hash
bang links using JavaScript which you'll
see isn't good solution so we've got our
fragment here which just says top so
that's another introduction to using the
parse URL function within PHP and just
how easy it is to split up a long
complicated URL into smaller parts so
you can do what you want with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
