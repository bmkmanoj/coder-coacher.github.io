a new carbon instance and set a date
that we want to use as a carbon object
we're going to go ahead and dive into
formatting which is probably what you're
going to use the most since you're going
to be outputting dates to a user or
doing something else with them so let's
create a new carbon object here I'm
going to go ahead and pass in a date for
so for the sake of this will just say
minus two days so if we want to format
this in a particular way we can use a
variety of methods that exists within
carbon to do this and there are a lot of
them will take a brief look at some of
them you can go ahead and check out the
carbon documentation if you need to know
more and lastly we're going to look at a
very very helpful method which is
extremely popular which is a human
readable date and that will look
something like two days ago or five
weeks ago or one year ago something like
that so to start with in let's take a
look at something like a date string so
for this we can go ahead and echo these
out because they're a string we don't
need to do a VAR dump on them so we're
going to say C and then we're going to
use a method on this new object we've
created so for example we could say to
date string all that's going to do is
it's going to take the date that we saw
earlier in that carbon object and it's
going to give us back a date string so
let's take a look at the result of this
and you can see we've got a date string
there so a nicely formatted data string
as we really expect so we have other
methods so for example let's think of an
interesting one what we could say to
time string as well so we can go ahead
and grab the time like so or we can go
ahead and say to date time string which
will give us a formatted time and date
like so so there are others so there are
like very very specific date so for
example to RSS string that look like
that we also have things
like to Adam string so something like
that so there are a variety of ways we
can output this depending on our needs
now more useful if you want to specify
some kind of global structure to the
dates that you output you can just use
the format method and this is going to
take one argument which is going to be
the format in the style of PHP's date
formatting of how you want to output so
for example if we wanted to output the
date we could use d m why and that's
going to go ahead and take the date that
we have and it's going to output in the
format we specify and if you are
struggling to work out how we output
these in a specific format like this you
can go ahead and read up on the PHP
manual exactly which characters are
available for you so you can format the
date pretty much how you want so let's
go ahead and just have a look at this so
we see 12 a-12 April 2015 so there are
obviously unlimited ways you can go
ahead and output dates in this and this
really helps because what we can do is
somewhere in our application we can
specify the date string so just as a
very rough example we could say date
format and we could just paste that in
there and then we go ahead and pass that
into it so this will be some kind of
property on your object maybe or just
some global setting somewhere and we can
just pass this in to here and it works
in exactly the same way so probably one
of the more useful options or methods to
output in terms of a human readable date
is if for humans so let's just get rid
of this variable we created a minute ago
so diff for humans will be the
difference between the current date and
the date that we've specified here so in
this case we know that this is going to
say something like two days ago but if
we go ahead and look
this you can see two days ago if we were
to have posted something say a couple of
hours ago we could say minus two hours
go ahead and refresh and that's two
hours ago this time he'll this date and
time here will obviously come from your
database somewhere if you're posting
something that stores a date so you
could wrap that within this carbon
object and then go ahead and output it
appropriately so that's just to look at
how we can form updates which again is
really really useful and handy to know
and this just allows us to format things
in the way we want out put them to users
or store them somewhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
