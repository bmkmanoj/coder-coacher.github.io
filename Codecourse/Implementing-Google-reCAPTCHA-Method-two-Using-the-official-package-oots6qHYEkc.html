download the package via composer to
actually do the check this does provide
a more elegant way to actually perform
the check so the first thing that we're
going to do is set up the client-side if
you haven't seen the last part already
we're gonna redo this and then what
we're going to do is implement the
backend because what we do is we require
a token to be sent to the backend to
check and we're going to be using the
recapture library to do this so first
thing is first then we already have our
application set up we need to start at
step one which is the client-side
integration so this will get our
recapture form or our recapture widget
as part of our form so the first thing
to do is download the JavaScript this
template you can find as part of the
course download so if you don't already
have it download this and it will be
index.php
and this just is a form as you can see
here with bootstrap loaded in obviously
you can just go ahead and implement this
on your own form so we want to pull in
this JavaScript library so we just
basically paste this down here just at
the end of our body and the next step
then is to place the widget where you
want it to be seen and this includes a
data attribute which is our public key
so we're going to copy this I'm gonna
paste it just after this first form
field like that
so it's just after the email address and
before the submit button and I'm gonna
go ahead and I'm just going to add a few
styles up here or one style which is a
margin bottom of 10 pixels and that just
spaces things out a little bit so now
what we want to do then is because we're
submitting this to just signup PHP of
course this could be a route if you're
using a framework or a Rooter we need to
create this file so let's go and create
signup PHP and what we're gonna do in
here is we're gonna check the contents
of the post superglobal array so if I
hit sign up now you can see that as well
as email we actually now get this G
reCAPTCHA
sponsor property at the moment that's
empty because we didn't actually do
anything here but if we were to check
this and we were to go ahead and select
all images with street signs what I'll
do and I failed it so with ice-cream
that looks like ice cream to me that
doesn't there we go
so when I hit sign up you can see that
we get this really long string and what
we're gonna be doing this with this is
passing it through to the Google
reCAPTCHA API and the package allows us
to easily do this so the first step then
is to go ahead and actually download the
package so if I head over to the Google
reCAPTCHA github page you can see that
we can just require this in with
composer I'm gonna go ahead and open my
terminal and within this recapture
folder that's the folder on what
currently working within and I'm just
gonna paste that in and that will go
ahead and download that and now that
that's done what we're going to do is
kind of setup our application so we have
a bootstrap file because what we're
going to need to do is instantiate this
reCAPTCHA library so I'm going to create
a new folder called app under recapture
and in here I'm gonna create a file
called bootstrap dot PHP and in here I'm
gonna require in composers autoloader
and then down here will instantiate the
reCAPTCHA library in a moment so in sign
up why actually want to do now is
require in bootstrap dot PHP and let's
get rid of this via dump over in
bootstrap we actually want to create a
new instance of recapture parse in our
private key and then we'll be ready to
fire requests off to the API so I'm
going to call this recapture and it's a
new instance of recapture
and recapture so this is the class name
and this namespace under recapture so
you can poppy use statement up here if
you want but we'll leave it like this
for now and then here is our private key
so if we head over to recapture we can
see our private key here or our secret
then I paste this in and we're now ready
to fire requests off perfect so now that
we've done that on any page that we want
to validate this we can just use the
functionality required or included in
this library so I'm gonna say response
equals I'm gonna say re capture verify
so into here now we pass in a required
option which is the response we get
through from the forum and the second
option which is optional or the second
parameter which is optional is the IP
address of the user I'm not going to
include this but you can go ahead and
put this in if you want to so remember
when we did a var dump on the post
superglobal earlier we got this G
recapture response and then in here you
can go ahead and enter your users IP
address however you are doing that but
I'm going to get rid of that just for
now so now that we've done that then we
can use the methods that are available
so we can say if not so if this is false
is success so if this is failed we can
go ahead and use this handy get error
codes method and we can do a var dump on
errors now in this case what you'd want
to do is inspect the errors determine
the type of error and you want would
want to redirect the user back and say
to them sorry you failed please try
again or please fill out the CAPTCHA so
otherwise down here we would register
the user so in our case then what's
going to happen is if we do fail it or
if something goes horribly wrong which
and someone doesn't fill it out we're
gonna just var dump the errors here so
let's
go and try this out see if it works oh
I'm not going into the email address
it's not really important I'm gonna hit
sign up and you can see here that we
have an array those are the errors that
we're doing a var dump on and we have
missing input response so if your array
contains this you can shoot the user
back and say please fill out the CAPTCHA
if we go ahead and successfully pass it
so let's select all of this food what is
that I think that's okay yeah so we hit
sign up we see an empty page because
this has evaluated to false because we
do have success and then down here you
would go and register your user and do
whatever you wanted to do so that is how
we implement Google reCAPTCHA using the
Google reCAPTCHA library available on
github and it really is that simple to
do and now you can protect against
automated form submission</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
