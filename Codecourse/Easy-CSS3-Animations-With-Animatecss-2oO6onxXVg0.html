simple CSS animations in this video and
we're going to look at how to do things
like this and how to do other effects so
for example if we wanted to fade this in
etc really really easy and there are
plenty of effects that you can grab from
the animator CSS library you can see
them here as well so before you get
started head over to animate dot CSS and
we'll take a really quick look at how
powerful this is using CSS animation CSS
transitions and we'll look at including
it onto a page and if you're very new to
CSS or very new to this we'll look at
also pulling in something like jQuery so
we can dynamically add classes for
example when someone hits a button or
does something on the page you could
then animate something off the back of
that so let's go ahead and get this
installed or copied over to our working
directory and we'll look at how this
works so the first thing that you're
going to want to do is download animate
dot CSS fairly straightforward you can
either hit this link here or if we check
it out on github there is the option for
a custom build using grunt installing
and using grunts beyond the scope of
this video but if you do want to keep
this file as small as possible for
example if you don't need all of these
animations which I'm sure on a project
you wouldn't need all of these
animations you can use grint grunt
custom build you can pick apart the CSS
file yourself for a custom build but
obviously this is a much quicker option
to do that so otherwise we get some
basic usage instructions here but we're
just going to have a look at this very
very quickly so I've got animate dot CSS
inside of a CSS directory in the
directory I'm currently working in I've
also got an index 2.html file with a
basic document layout here nothing
special at all well link in our animate
dot CSS file and we'll link in our main
dot CSS file in a moment this is the
page that we're going to be working on
so really importantly I'm going to bring
up my chrome development tools so i can
use the console and i can inspect things
on here as
well just to look at generally what's
what's happening here just so we can
understand how this works and inside of
my inside of my index HTML page I want
to include in these two CSS files main
dot CSS at the moments blank this is
where we're going to be creating a
little box that we can test animation on
so to link in animate dot CSS it's in
the CSS directory and it's called
animate dot CSS and let's do the same
thing here for our custom style sheet as
well so first of all let's dive into
animate dot CSS and see how this works
and basically what we've got is we've
got this class called animated which
always needs to be included on the
elements that you want to animate that
just sets things up here and you know
basically you know sets things up and
down here then you can see that we've
got some some keyframes here for
different effects and we've got a bounce
here and down here we've got the
basically the standard properties that
we would add on the bounce class and
that uses the animation here so
essentially we've got the key frame set
up here which defines how this moves and
then down here what we're doing when we
add this bounce class we are then
actually making use of this this
predefined keyframe up that we've done
up here or not we've done but the author
of this library is done so there's quite
a lot in here you can take a look at
highly suggest you do take a look
through the code just to understand each
of these however at this point you can
see that there is a lot of code in here
so we've got over 3,000 lines worth of
code and this is really gonna slow down
downloading this if someone's on a
slower connection so I highly recommend
that you only use the animations that
you need if you don't need animations at
all that's fine but you probably
wouldn't be watching this video if you
didn't so take a look through the
animated or CSS file really good to have
a look at now what we're going to do is
we're going to build an element on the
page which we're going to add some of
these classes to just so we can see how
this works so let's create a class div
with a class of box we're not going to
put anything in this but we're going to
add some basic style
to it just here so I'm going to add a
background color to this and I'm going
to choose cornflower blue which really
nice blue color and I'm going to add a
height here as well of a hundred pixels
and a width here of a hundred pixels and
I'm going to give this a margin of say I
know sixty pixels just to bring it away
from the edge of the page so we can we
can see how some of these work okay so
let's take a look at the basic usage of
this then we've already got a class on
this element so if for example we wanted
this to fade in we can say animated fade
in so yeah we've got like a basic fade
in effect this might be quite useful
doesn't probably warrant pulling in the
whole library for a fade in effect
because it's quite easy to do just
normally without building in the library
like this but then we have more more
interesting like hinge which is quite a
nice effect really depends on how you
need to use this kind of thing but it
really brings to life elements in the
sense that this really looks like
something that would be created with a
flash animation her years ago so it's
really great that we can do this now
within the browser do things like this
within the browser just means that you
can add that extra special effect to
your to your site if it's needed which
is the key point here but yeah it's
really simple to do and you know you're
doing this all with CSS there's no
JavaScript involved here at all saying
that if you do need some kind of trigger
for this it probably might be worthwhile
using javascript if you needed to
animate something when something reacts
now I'm not saying include jquery on
your page just to do link clicks you can
do this so much easily just without a
library like jquery being pulled in but
if you're using jquery on your site
already maybe you're you know using it
quite extensively then this might
warrant just pulling this in and using
it so for those of you that are
beginning with web development let's
take a look at how we might pull in
jquery to be able to say click a link
and animate something so I've created a
script
the bottom on my page here just before
the ending body tag and what we're gonna
do is I'm going to pull jquery over from
google hosted libraries it's basically
just Google CDN way of hosting library
so it's downloaded a lot quicker and
cash for most users so this basically
means serve over HTTP and HTTPS but for
the purpose of being on local i'm just
going to change this to http so over on
our page now we'll have jquery loaded
let's go ahead and just remove the
classes on here and i'm going to be
working in the console just down here so
i'm going to make this a little bit
bigger and i'm going to type in some
javascript here just to add the classes
to this and all tap to animate it then
we'll look at just clicking a link to
animate something so we use our jQuery
selector and obviously that's box and
then we can use the add class method to
add a space separated list of classes
that we want to add to this so I'm going
to add animated and then hinge so once
we do that that'll add that this will
return the element to us here but now
you can see that that that that's
animated so fairly straightforward now
this would normally be done in a
separate file but I'm just going to do
some on page JavaScript just down here
and I'm going to target something that I
want to click in order to add this anime
effect so let's create an anchor down
here and I'm just going to call this
animate and let's give this a hash as
its href element and let's have a class
on here so animate me for example so
down here what we can do is we can
target that with our jQuery selector so
animate me and we're going to say on
click and then we have a closure just
here and then within this what we can
then do is we can say something like
this dot and then we can add our class
so we can say add class this obviously
refers to this here so we add class
animated hinge like so really easy
straightforward if you know jquery this
will be easy for you so when I click
animate that will then and for some
strange reason I added this
on the actual animate link itself so I
want to change this to box there we go
really easy looks cool and if you are
using jQuery on your page then you can
just easily hook this up with the really
straightforward functionality of
building things here and there we go
you've got CSS animations on user
interaction so that is basically the
animate CSS library there's so much you
can do here and obviously the front page
of this gives you a really good demo
here you can just click whatever you
want and just preview each of these and
the names given here are the names you
need to use so for example if you did
won't flip out x all you would have to
do here is change this to flip out X
like so head back to your page and there
we go done so that is animate dot CSS
really really cool library go ahead and
check it out and download it remember to
do a custom build if you're not going to
be using all of the transitions and
animations on there because it really is
going to be a waste downloading all of
that and again make sure you don't
include jquery just to trigger these
animations you can do that just as
easily with raw JavaScript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
