building a site structure like this with
foundations grid system a foundation is
a CSS framework but I often take the
grid system out of it for personal
projects just because I really like it
and I'm going to show you how you can
include the bare-bones of foundation
this does include some other elements as
well like typography and visibility
classes for example but we're going to
basically take foundation put it in a
page and build something like this and
this is actually responsive as well so
if I pull this in you can see that I
have if we just pull this away you can
see what they've got the left and the
right here sort of stay in this position
until they get to there they drop down
whereas this one and two here stays in
this three drops down the article
obviously responds in nicely because
it's just paragraphs with text and then
we've got all of these down here as well
but we'll be looking at how you can
essentially customize this so you can do
whatever you want with it it's extremely
flexible and it's really nice to work
with and very easy to work with once you
have used it so let's take a look at the
code now we're also going to look at
what we need to download in terms of
foundation to get started okay so the
first thing you're going to need to do
is actually download foundation so if
you hit the download foundation button
over on foundation fellows herb comm
we're going to choose the essential
package so this is a light a simple
lighter version includes typography the
grid which is what we're going to focus
on buttons revealing interchange with
your JavaScript we're not going to be
including that so essentially all we're
getting is the typography the grid and
the buttons and you may as well you may
well find these useful if you are going
to find other elements of the foundation
framework useful then just download
everything but please be aware you are
adding more and more CSS and potentially
JavaScript and this will have an impact
on page performance particularly on
lower bandwidth users so we're going to
download the essential package and we're
going to get started in my text
editor I've included normalized CSS I've
included foundation MnDOT CSS the
minified version of the framework and
I've also included a custom style sheet
as well now this is basically for
testing it's all recommend doing this at
all basically what I'm saying is I want
all elements except the body and the
HTML element to have a box sizing a
border box and I want the border to be
one pixel - that's basically what you
saw earlier when you saw - lines around
everything and the reason I'm doing this
is because it makes it much easier to
teach how this works when you can
actually see the elements you're dealing
with and if you're a beginner I would
highly recommend you do this now the
columns I've also set to have a minimum
height of a hundred pixels this is just
so they don't look flat and it just
gives a sort of wider or longer
structure to the page just so we can
sort of again for testing reasons just
see what we're doing better but I have
these stars set here which we're going
to be marking up soon and these will be
relevant when we come to them so I will
refer back to them so the index page
then a basic document markup the
relevant style sheets linked in the rest
of what you would normally expect from a
document so let's get started on
building the header of the website so
we're going to create a header element
here an html5 element and we're going to
give this an ID just so I can
specifically refer to it so site header
just because header can exist in
articles or in other elements so we
don't want to confuse things now we're
going to utilize foundations row and
then the columns what we want to define
and we're going to look at very basic
example of columns here and I'll talk a
little bit about how a sort of column
system works and obviously this is not
hacky that CSS doesn't deal with layouts
well at least not not at the time of
recording support for things like
flexbox is not widely implemented so I'm
going to create a div with a class of
row basically so a div with the class of
row this basically means a row of
columns you know table has a row of
it's a it's a well-known concept we
understand what this means now in a
bridge system typically you have 12
columns you don't have to you can have
any amount of columns but columns are
basically if you think about them as let
me just bring up my browser invisible
lines down the page that basically
separate the entire page out to 12
columns and 12 is a nice number because
6 goes into 12 4 goes into 12 2 goes
into 12 so you can you can sort of chop
your page up if you like into nice
sections and if you have say something
that you want to be a side by you could
have that as a 3 column and then you
could have the rest of the content as a
9 which obviously adds up to 12 and we
will be doing this in this video so I'm
going to create a a div with a class of
large 12 columns so large - twelve
columns and this is telling foundation
or utilizing what has foundation what
foundation gives us that we want a
twelve column element essentially so I'm
going to say site header and put
anything in there so let's take a look
all this well this gives us there we go
so let's inspect this and we'll take a
look so the row here let's take a look
at some of the properties of this we've
got a width of a hundred percent a
margin left of auto and imagine right of
also which basically centers an element
and then we've got a maximum width sixty
two point five M so this isn't actually
a hundred percent element you can see
that by the orange on the outside the
blue is where this sits and you can
change this I'm gonna leave it by
default for now now inside of this we've
got this large twelve columns again
we've got a mean height on there which
we applied to it but you can see if we
just scroll down but some of the
properties we've got a little bit of
padding on the left a little bit of pad
padding on the right and this floats
left now that's really important because
when we start to use a six and A six
byte by the side of each other that
would essentially be half of these so if
we had a six column would be here better
six column would be here
then that would need to be floated
otherwise they would sit underneath each
other naturally and because divs are
block level elements they would span
100% of the width of whatever the parent
container is so we've got our site
header that's going to remain as a large
12 columns in actual fact this whole
thing doesn't really need to be here but
what we want to do is we want to sort of
constrain everything within a row and
that's what I'm going to be doing in the
rest of the video
so we've got our site header styles and
they are here we've got a margin bottom
of 20 pixels and a padding of 20 pixels
as well if I'd to get rid of that you
would see the following so that's why
I've done so just it pulls it out a
little bit
but now what we're going to do is focus
on the rest of the page structure so
we're going to create a wrapper so this
wrapper is going to be nothing more than
something that contains the entire page
and that doesn't include the footer
we'll be creating the footer outside of
this wrapper as well and you can see
I've got a star here of a margin bottom
of 20 these don't really matter you can
get rid of these and obviously we're
using these for testing so inside of the
wrapper I want to create as I've just
described a 6 and a 6 side-by-side so I
want a 6 column a 6 column obviously 6
and 6 is 12 we're using a 12 column grid
so it makes sense so we'll go ahead and
create a class of a div with the class
of row as we did before but this time
what we're going to do inside here is
we're going to create a large six
columns like so and then we'll do that
twice so we've got two six columns so if
I was to say left here and in here I was
to say right we can see that that gives
us the following so we've got a 6 and a
6 adding up to 12
very very basic here so when I pull this
in you'll notice that as soon as it sort
of gets to the point where it breaks
this breakpoint here this is actually
collapsing down you might not want this
these might have images in your you
might have a sort of low resolution
image in here
and that's going to stretch that image
and really things I'm going to look very
nice so what we can actually do is we
can apply additional classes here large
I haven't even explained basically means
on a large screen or a large viewport
this is going to be six columns however
what happens if on a medium we also want
that to be six columns well we can
define as many of these as we want so
medium six we can do small extra small
as well so let's take a look at what
happens now that we've applied these
medium if we just pull this down medium
six and medium six that's going to say
what as well as on a large layout when I
hit this breakpoint there we go I won
that two stairs a six and you can see
that staying as a six as we pull this in
though we can see we get to a breakpoint
just about here where that then goes
down to just as it normally would as
normal behavior so that's a little bit
of theory about sort of how a grid
system generally works like I said you
don't have to have a twelve column but
in this case we we do okay so down here
then I want to create a basically where
I can describe inside of here I want to
have one two three so you probably
already guess what I'm going to do I'm
going to create a row and then going to
create a large four column div like so
and I'm going to duplicate that down
twice like this so we have one we have
two here and we have three so let's take
a look at how this looks it looks as bit
expect we've got one two and three but
obviously now we've got the same problem
when we pull this in it's just basically
you know coming down like this we might
not want that so what we're going to do
now is we look at slightly different
technique and we're going to have one
and two stay as six but then we're going
to have three just act as normal act
does it normally would so let's take a
look at how we might be how we might
do this well on a medium screen let's
say we or a medium viewport rather let's
say we want these to be force and we
also want this third one to be four as
well so we can do that and we get the
same result as we did above it's a
sensible size to keep them like this
because there's not much different in
the widths but now when this comes down
to a small we want one and two to be six
columns so all we do is we say small six
and small six you can imagine that
applying this to your own project is
going to give you loads of flexibility
in terms of how you lay your pages out
it really wants you've learned the
theory of a collar of columns it doesn't
take too much to just switch things
around exactly how you need them so now
let's take a look at maybe a slightly
more complicated example it's not much
more complicated but it's more
applicable to perhaps a website that
you're building we're going to have down
here a sidebar and then we're going to
have a main content area and then within
that main content area we're going to
have another row at the bottom which is
going to house things like related
content or additional news or whatever
you want to call it so as you'd expect
down here we're going to have a row
within this what we're going to have
this time is we sort of judge how big we
want the the column to be it might take
a little while for you to get used to
this but I'm basically going to have an
aside element and this is going to be a
large three like so so in here this is
going to be our sidebar now down here
we're going to have maybe a large nine
and that's going to be our article area
will and our article and some dummy data
in there in a moment so we've basically
said well I think that a3 is going to be
about the right size for my sidebar so
when i refresh it looks like this
probably is about the right size for my
sidebar so inside of here let's just
create this article and let's maybe
create a h3 and that's right in here and
article doesn't really matter what we do
oops so now what we can do is just
generate some text maybe and we'll have
maybe three of them and that should be
it so that should give us enough room to
play around cool so we've got three
paragraphs of lorem ipsum let's now down
here as I mentioned earlier create
another row
so we're basically nesting rows now and
you can nest rows really as far as you
want it doesn't really matter but
obviously be wary that the more you nest
the more ridiculous your layout is going
to get because it's just going to get
too nitty-gritty
the websites that you're building is
probably too complicated if you need to
nest maybe more than three levels so
let's create this row down here then
let's go ahead and create a large six
and next to that we'll have another
large six and again with columns there
we go
so in here then we'd have something like
related and then down here maybe we
would have something like latest news it
can be really anything it doesn't matter
and you can see how easy that is
it's just nested the content in and
notice that although when we've created
this article the grid lines the text up
right to the edge when we come down even
though this container is slightly bigger
it's still lining up the text for us
everything really just looks really nice
and lined up it's it's you know it just
works off off of the shelf with
foundation so let's focus now on the
footer which really doesn't have much
more than we've already dealt with so we
created this wrapper here remember so
let's just collapse that and down here
we'll create a footer when let's give
this an ID of site footer even though we
haven't applied any particular stars to
it
let's crown row as normal and let's
create a large six maybe and next to
that let's create a large six as well
and you can maybe just as a little
example you can go off and create
something a little bit more complicated
you might have a large six but then you
might have a nested row in there
and you might have maybe a couple of
elements in that in fact we can do that
now so we would essentially create a new
row and we would create maybe another
large six and obviously duplicate that
down so we can say left right so we
would get something like the following
there we go we've got a left footer you
can maybe put a little bit about the
website in there and then here you might
have two columns of links perhaps so
when we pull this in we haven't actually
looked at this yet but the articles I
mentioned at the start of the video
responds nicely it's just text related
latest news left footer left and right
we might want these left and right to
stay as normal so as we've already
learned we would say medium six and
small six and we would do exactly the
same thing down here so we'd say medium
six and small six and there we go
looking good so if you want to use
foundation in your project there's
nothing wrong with just downloading the
bare bones of it like we've said just
download the essential you can even go
into the non minified source code and
rip out the buttons if you didn't need
them I suggest you keep the typography
that's just really preference so we've
created a very basic layout pretty
quickly and you can see how good this
would be for things like rapid
prototyping but this code is perfectly
acceptable to use in production while
we're waiting for things like flexbox to
become well supported these do add
weight to your page yes but you can see
the benefit of using them for your users
we have a fully responsive website here
it's going to look great on other
devices and it was very very quick to do
so that's just an introduction to
foundation's grid system this I guess
applies to all grid systems but
personally I find that foundations works
really really well
I like the syntax it's fast and we get
really good results with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
