a laravel application and you're using
homestead for example you'll need to
expose your project at some point
somewhere across the internet and this
could be for a variety of reasons it
could be that you want to just share the
URL with someone to preview your project
or usually you'll find that you'll want
to use something like a web hook and
test a web hook hitting your application
now the only other way to do this is to
start to expose ports on your local
machine which obviously is not a good
idea it's not a secure way to do this so
we're gonna be looking at using in grop
to expose our local server but via
Homestead so usually an grok works
really nicely out of the box but for
Homestead there's a little bit more
setup so if you're already using in grok
that's great if you're not go ahead and
sign up and download this and we're
going to start to walk through how we
get this exposed so I have an grok just
stored within my home directory just
here and I can go ahead and run this
just to make sure everything is good so
usually what we would expect to do is
something like in grok HTTP and then we
would say well we're working on port
8000 so we would just use the port 8000
now this would typically work if you
were working with say a local Apache
server or a local nginx server but in
this case it doesn't work announced
because with homestead we have names for
each of our projects and it's just not
going to work this way so instead what
we need to do is make a few changes to
our Laur of our homestead configuration
so to do this I'm just going to hop over
to the dot homestead directory and I'm
going to open up homestead Yamal in
sublime so this is the mapping here for
the some project app that I currently
have open just here and you can see that
this just points to a larva installation
so what we actually need to do is create
another mapping just here and it's
pretty much the same but it's some
project in grok i oh so now we want to
map this to the same directory so we can
just go and
all this and we want to map it to this
directory here perfect so this is all we
need to do but obviously we need to go
ahead and provision our machine so I'm
going to go back a directory and into
the normal homestead directory and I'm
gonna run a vagrant provision on this
and wait for this to finish so now that
that's done then I'm just gonna come
back to my local directory my home
directory and I'm gonna run in grok
again but this time if we just run it I
want to use the sub domain option so we
run in grok HTTP we go ahead and provide
a sub domain just here and that sub
domain is going to be the name of your
project so in this case it's some
project and then we give the port so in
our case again it's still put 8000 so
when I run this now again this opens up
a secure tunnel for us and I can go
ahead and paste this into here and
you'll see that I get that project and
just to prove that this is all working
we can maybe head over to the routes far
and maybe just return something like oh
hi and we can go back preview this and
everything is working nicely so now you
can very quickly boot this up when you
want to test a web hook maybe you're
working with cat laravel cashier and
you're working with Braintree and you
want to test a Braintree web hook to
make sure say a users subscription is
canceled this is perfect you can now do
this and when you don't want to you just
go ahead and close this off and that is
it that's how we set up a secure tunnel
to our homestead project using n grok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
