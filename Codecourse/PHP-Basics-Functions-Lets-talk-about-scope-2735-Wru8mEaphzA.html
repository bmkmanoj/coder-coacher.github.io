functions in PHP we need to talk about
scopes now a scope in PHP refers to the
visibility of variables in certain
places and this can actually be quite
confusing at first so let's continue on
with the examples our functions since
functions have their own scope now just
imagine that we had some kind of
configuration stored in an array within
our application let's say that we had a
delimiter or some kind of separator as
we saw earlier when we were looking at
that full name function now we may store
a separate two here so it's accessible
in anywhere in our code just so it's a
little bit easier to find now if we were
to have a full name function and we've
already seen the example of this and we
were accepting in a first name and we
were accepting in a last name and we
were doing exactly what we were doing
earlier by going ahead and outputting
our first name a space or at least the
separator that we're gonna add in in a
moment and then the last name we know
that this just goes ahead and return so
let's just go ahead and echo out full
name let's pass in a first name and
let's go ahead and pass in a last name
as well so oh it's the browser we see
Alex Kara as we have seen before now the
reason that you might add something in
configuration to our project like I said
so we can reuse it over and over again
if we had another function that did a
similar thing and we always wanted a
space as a separator then it's a lot
more convenient to store it in one place
that means that if we wanted to update
all separators it would be much easier
to do either way this means that we can
now use config separator within our
function so let's try and do this and
then we'll see what goes wrong here so
let's go ahead and say config and then
in here let's say separator so it seems
pretty straightforward let's go and
refresh and now we see we get an
undefined variable config
now we do have a variable called config
and we're calling this correctly so why
are we seeing this error so the reason
for this is that config
can't be found within the scope of this
function since the function has its own
scope anything that we create inside of
here
won't be available outside and vice
versa so just as an example if I was to
write greeting for example or anything
and just say hello let's just get rid of
this for now just so we can see that
this works like so when we go ahead and
run this it works as normal but you may
expect me to be able to say echo
greeting and this work
well actually we still get an undefined
variable so we can't access anything
inside of here outside of it and we
can't access anything outside of here
inside of it and there's a good reason
for this because if you are creating
local variables in here you wouldn't
want them to interfere with anything
else
okay so let's bring back this config
that we put in here earlier so remember
it's config separator and we'll see how
we can get around this problem now
there's a couple of ways to get around
this the first way would be to do the
following inside of our function we say
global config what this will do is it
will bring this variable here and any of
the values that we have stored in here
inside of the scope of this function so
now if we refresh you see that we get
the result we need and if we change this
over to an underscore
you can see that's proof that's worked
so the other way to do this would be
every time you use the function you
actually pass the config in now this
isn't a great solution because it means
that you are passing things in and
really it's a little bit more difficult
to use the function so we could do this
and of course what's happening now is
we're taking this variable which is
outside of the function using it here
and then it's being placed inside of the
function and we can use it so again we
get the result that we need now there's
another and a much better way to bring
something into the scope of a function
so let's go ahead and get rid of this
example because this is an ideal and
let's take a look at how we do this now
this is to use the use keyword and
inside of brackets here we go ahead and
basically tell this function what we
want to bring inside of here
in terms of scope so this is a lot
better and if you had other variables
that you wanted to bring in you can go
ahead and come and separate them here as
well and this is a lot more convenient
it's a lot cleaner and it means that we
don't have to use the global keyword in
here or go ahead and pass them in now
the way that we've defined this function
au this isn't actually gonna work at the
moment if we give this a refresh you can
see we have unexpected use now the
reason for this is that when we define
out a function like this it's a little
bit more different than when we assign
it to a variable remember earlier we
created a full name variable and we
assigned it the value of a function like
so so this now will work if we call it
in the right way and we can now use use
config to bring that inside of the scope
here so you can see so if we just add a
semicolon on the end of there and give
that a refresh you can see we see the
right result so these things can get a
little bit confusing but there's a good
reason why we don't bring things
automatically into the scope of
functions that is because if we were
like I said earlier creating variables
inside of here then they could conflict
with variables outside so always
remember that functions have their own
scope and there are lots of different
ways that we can bring variables into a
function either by using that global
keyword or using the used keyword if we
define out a function like this so
that's pretty much it for scope just
remember if you have any problems with
this kind of thing then your variable is
most likely not in scope so go ahead and
take a look at how you are pulling them
in and of course go ahead and use any
other methods that we've covered to go
ahead and do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
