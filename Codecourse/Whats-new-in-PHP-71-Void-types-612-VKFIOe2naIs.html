values but we can actually use void
return now to typecast that something
should not return a value so a good
example of this is if we had maybe some
service maybe we had a class that dealt
with any kind of service maybe we wanted
to at some point maybe within the
constructor go ahead and register at
what we needed so let's create a method
just here to demonstrate this called
register service this would literally
just boot everything up and it probably
wouldn't return anything so we would
just register the service here this
could be anything it really doesn't
matter now if inside of the constructor
as soon as we create a new instance of
this we wanted to register the service
we don't expect this to return anything
now this isn't a massive problem but it
kind of adds into the strict writing of
code so you kind of know what's going on
now if I boot up a service here let's go
ahead and inside or register a service
just echo something out just so we know
that this is working if we come over to
the browser and give that a refresh we
see that value so what happens if I want
to explicitly say well this register
service method should never return
anything there's no need for it to
return a value well quite simply using
the colon or price that we saw earlier
we can pass in void instead now this
will work we don't see any errors and
this is going ahead and registering a
service doing whatever it needs to do
but if for at some point later on we
actually return a value so let's say we
return true here or return something
else then we actually see an error a
void function must not return a value so
again this isn't entirely necessary bar
just by adding in void the end here
we're saying to whoever's maybe going to
be working with our code or even
ourselves later on down the line this
should never return anything there's no
need for it to return anything we're not
using the value anywhere so it's just a
little helpful type hint there for a
void return just to make sure that this
doesn't return anything and if it does
it will go ahead and break so again not
really entirely necessary for all
applications however it is a very
useful addition to aid in the strip
typing of code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
