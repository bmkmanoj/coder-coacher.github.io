really tricky but within laravel is
really simple to do this so in this part
we're going to look at submitting this
form we're going to fix up the
cross-site request forgery error we're
going to add validation and if a user
doesn't fill this in or if it doesn't
meet any of the other requirements that
we're going to set we're going to
redirect back and we're going to show an
error message now in the intermediate
version of this series we're going to
look at actually adding the message
under here but for now we're going to
keep things simple and just create a
list of errors at the top so to get
started then we need to fix up our cross
site request forgery error and all this
involved is adding in a token in our
forum which will mean that we know the
user who is submitting this form is that
user if you need more information about
cross-site request forgery we have a
course on that and the PHP security
series so go ahead and check that out
either now or later so the first thing
we want to do then is update our form so
to do this within the form within
laravel we can use the cross-site
request forgery field function now we
can also use the cross-site request
forgery token if we just take a look at
this you can see that gives us out a
token but of course that would involve
placing this into a field ourselves we
can use this helper to actually create
that for us and you can view the page
source just here and you will see that's
created and a hidden input type with the
name of underscore token and a value so
larva has the concept of middleware
which will allow you to set things up to
be checked before you actually hit your
application and in this case we do
actually have cross-site request forgery
middleware and now under HTTP and
middleware you can see verify cross-site
request forgery token and this extends
the base verifier which will just verify
everything you can go ahead and take a
look at that if you want to either way
now what's going to happen is we know
that we're submitting this through to
our task route we know that the method
is post and therefore this method here
will be picked up so we can just return
works just to see if this works come
over submit the form and there we go so
this is how we're going to be creating
our task but we first want to deal with
validation which is the whole point of
this part so how do we do this well
there are a couple of ways to do this
but since we're in roots we're going to
create a validated instance passing in
all of our rules passing in all of our
data and then we will check how to see
if this has failed so I'm going to start
by creating a validator instance like so
and this is just validator we use a
static make method and then into this we
pass in all of our request data here and
then all of our rules just here now we
don't have any of our request data so
I'm just going to comment this out we're
going to look at how we get this now by
request data I mean anything that's
given to this request so to do this we
type int request and we just call this
what everyone now if we do a diet and
dump on request which will just kill the
page and dump the contents of this we
will see that when we type something in
here like a learn laravel and we hit add
task we get this request just here so in
actual fact we just need to import this
at the top so la Ravel's request is
under illuminate HTTP and request we
head over and refresh again you can see
that we now get all of this data so what
we're essentially after then is
something like request parameters you
can see that we get the token through
there and we also get the name in and
from this what we can do is we can say
something like request name and this
will give us the value we've passed in
so it's a lot easier than using the PHP
superglobal for post or get or anything
like that so without validator then we
obviously need to take in all of our
request data so we can say something
like request all which will part give us
all of the data we've submitted through
the form and now we want to create our
rules and we do this within an array so
we only have one field here but of
course if you had more you could enter
more rules in here in this case we're
going to say name we're going to say
this is required we're going to separate
each of our rules by a pipe symbol and
we're going to say that we
on this to be a max of 255 now the
reason for that is that when we created
out by migration this created a length
of 255 so it would truncate if it were
any longer so it's good idea to include
these anyway so let's do a dye dump on
validator and let's just see what this
gives us so let's just refresh again and
there we go and you can see that this
just allows us to basically what we have
all of our data in here we have some
methods on our validator as well which
will allow us to check if this failed or
not so we want to then actually check if
this failed on up so to do this we can
use the fails method on our new
validator instance so we just say if
validator fails we want to do something
in here now otherwise down here we want
to create our task which will be looking
at in the next part so if our validation
does fail what do we do well we want to
return we always do this within a
controller method or a route we want to
redirect somewhere so we could do this
to the just a home page we want to
redirect with input so with any previous
input that we've given we want to
redirect with errors and the errors that
we want to give our just the validated
instance and lavo is clever enough to
then allow us to loop through these
errors so we're going to fail this we're
going to take a look at what happens and
then we're going to output our errors so
let's just refresh again and if we go
and add a task here you can see that
we're redirected back whereas if i type
in something and hit add task we get a
blank page because this at this point is
hitting just down here so we need to
work out how we actually display our
errors then so to do this we're going to
do this just above the form and we're
going to do this in a partial this is
going to be a new view but we're going
to include this from in here so within
views we're going to create a new folder
called common and inside of this we're
going to create a new file called errors
dot blades PHP so I'm just going to type
in errors head over to the index page
and I'm going to include common errors
because it's likely that we'll have
another
form somewhere else within our
application and in that case we can just
include this in so let's just refresh
and we will see if we just go back a
page that we have that errors just up
there now obviously what we want to do
is only display errors if there are
errors which makes complete sense but
how do we even check in fact how to even
get our errors well we have a variable
that's passed to every view called
errors now this will either be no errors
at all or it will have errors so to
check we can use an if statement within
blade so this is just the syntax for an
if statement and we end the if just like
that and in here we can do a count on
the errors and we want to make sure
that's greater than zero so we're going
to say has errors and this is just
enough now to check that this works I'm
going to refresh the page and hit add
task and we see has errors now if i type
in something valid like learn lauraville
we see nothing we go through to that
route again so now we can actually start
to loop through the errors that we have
so again i'm going to use bootstrap
styling i'm going to create a div for
the class of alert and this will be
alert Danger this will just create a red
box and I'm going to create an unordered
list and now for each of them errors so
we use a for each with in laravel we're
going to say for each errors all so we
want to grab all of the errors for each
loop we're going to call that error and
we can end our for each just down there
and instead of here we just create a
list item and this will just output a
unordered list of our errors so we can
just write error just in there and that
is it so now we can go and hit add task
we see we get a list of errors perfect
if we were to type in something really
long here so let's just type load of
rubbish and we'll go and paste it all in
hit add task and there we go so the name
must not be greater than 25 255
characters we're never going to see both
these errors because we have filled it
in if it's greater than 255 so hopefully
that makes sense so now that we've done
validation we need to move on to adding
at our
and of course that comes after our
validation just here and it becomes what
we do after this that long as this
hasn't failed because at this point
we're returning so we're never going to
reach this point so let's go over to the
next part then and look at creating out
tasks in our database which is really
straightforward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
