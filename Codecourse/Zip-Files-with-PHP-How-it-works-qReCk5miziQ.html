look at how we can zip files up using
PHP I'm not gonna be doing is creating a
class called zipper which allows us to
wrap existing functionality in PHP and
make it a lot easier to use so we'll be
creating this reusable class that we can
go ahead and use and this sort of wraps
the functionality kotomi within PHP
called zip archive and be looking at
that within the class but let's take a
look at how this works in terms of what
we're gonna build by the end of this
video so I think I've required in the
class file you can see here that's
within the classes folder I've got a
index dot PHP file that I'm working on
here a classes folder with the actual
class in and I've got a few files here
as well so I've got one two and three so
I'm gonna be going ahead and adding them
to a zip file
choosing which files I want to put into
the zip file and then storing that far
so let's go ahead and use will say
zipper equals new zipper so we
instantiate the class that we've created
then we go ahead and we say zipper add
now we can use this multiple times or we
can provide an array of functional or
files that we want to add into this so
let's go ahead and add this singularly
so we'll just use a string and we'll say
files /one txt it's a meaning within the
files folder this one dot txt file and
these look just basically like this
they've just got some text within them
okay so what we'll do now is we'll go
ahead and we'll say zipper add and we'll
look at how we can actually insert an
array here so an array can just contain
multiple values within this as well so
we could say files forward slash two dot
txt and then files forward slash three
dot txt and we could of course put this
in here as well but that will work it
will merge them all together in one set
of files that we want to store so what
we can now do is we can go ahead and use
the store method to store this in a
particular location so in this case I'm
going to go ahead and I'm going to save
files forward slash
dot zip so that now we'll store these
files that I've chosen in a zip file in
this location so if we go over to the
browser now and refresh you don't see
anything on the screen however if we go
back to our text editor and choose open
within files you see whether we've got
this new zip file here we just drag this
into here you can see that when I double
click on this I've got a folder called
files within here so that's basically
mimicked the fact that I chose these
files from within a folder called files
so it basically keeps your directory
structure with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
