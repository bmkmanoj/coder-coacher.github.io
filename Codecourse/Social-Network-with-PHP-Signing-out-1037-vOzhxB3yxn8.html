because all we really need to do is just
sign the user out and redirect them back
to the home page of course we do need to
hook up how sign out menu item to the
right place as well so over to our auth
controller then let's implement this
method which will allow us to sign out
then we'll create the route for that as
well so to do this we're just going to
have a public function which is just
going to be get sign out and inside of
here all we do is we use our author
facade that we imported up here earlier
and we just say auth logout and then we
redirect the user off to somewhere so
obviously you can decide where you want
to do this to and I'm just going to
redirect the user to the home route and
you can flash a message there if you
really want to it's entirely up to you
so over on routes then let's implement
our route to do this so I'm just going
to copy and paste an existing route just
to save a little bit of time and this is
going to be sign out we're going to
target out sign out method and we're
going to call this Orthodox sign out so
let's head over to our templates under
our navigation so when the user is
signed in remember we have this sign out
link here so we can say route or sign
out simple as that we're currently
signed in when we hit sign out we're
redirected back to the home page and we
see that standard navigation where we
don't have any of the options for a
signed in user</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
