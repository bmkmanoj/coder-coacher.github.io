style so it can be shifted over we need
to go ahead and do two more things here
the first is a tiny little bit of
JavaScript which is basically just going
to when we click toggle toggle this menu
open-class on the body look that we've
seen activate the menu on the left hand
side so that's the first thing we want
to go ahead and do and we'll actually
see that then working the next thing we
then want to go ahead and do is apply
some transitions to the menu side and
the menu either body and this will then
basically slide this in as the class is
toggled so we don't actually need to do
any animating using JavaScript
so the first thing that we want to go
ahead and do to get the JavaScript
working is at the end of our body we
want to go ahead and include jQuery
we're gonna be using jQuery just for
simplicity but you can go ahead and
write the JavaScript yourself or use
another library so the source we're
gonna go ahead and take from Google
hosted libraries just so it's nice and
fast so if you head over to Google
hosted libraries click jQuery and go
ahead and copy and paste the source here
that will allow you to have your copy of
jQuery served via Google CDN and I'm
gonna go ahead and just put HTTP in
front of that the next thing that we're
gonna do if we just turn word wrap off
is we're going to go ahead and write
within this page and this probably
should sit within an external script on
your site but for now we're just gonna
put it in the body so if you can see
what we're doing we want to go ahead and
first of all create a function that's
going to execute when we run the page
that's fairly straightforward so if I do
a console log here I have run that we'll
just run that code so if we head over to
the console I have run and what we now
want to do is assuming that you've
included jQuery which we've done I'm
going to go ahead and gonna create a
variable called body which is going to
use a jQuery selector to select the body
element of the page that's fairly
straightforward what we now want to do
is add an event handler on the menu
toggle and
which remember we gave a class of menu
toggle here so we want to create a again
use a selector so menu toggle we want to
say wine so we're gonna use the bind
method and we're gonna bind the click
event so when we click that item a
function will be run so we have a
closure here and let's go ahead and
console.log this out clicked just so we
know that this works we're binding the
click event so when this toggle is
clicked you can see that we have clicked
returned in the console here so that we
know that that's working and what we're
now going to do is basically just use
the toggle class method on our earlier
selector body so we're using the body
variable here dot toggle class and then
we specify the name of the class which
is menu open so remember that when we
want to hide hide the menu we get rid of
menu open and we want to show the menu
we add the menu open class so that's all
without CSS stars so once we toggle it
that's fine we will talk about that
we'll just switch it on and off
basically or remove it and add it and
then we want to go ahead and just return
false so now this functionality should
work if we go ahead and actually click
toggle you can see that this actually
does activate our menu and all of this
is obviously being being done with CSS
so we're just adding a class which then
shows and hides the relevant content so
now it's the fun part where we go ahead
and add the CSS transitions and this is
all done with CSS there's no need to do
this with JavaScript animation if if
this isn't supported in an older browser
it will just look like we've just seen
it in here won't we won't get the
animation but it will still work so
we're not relying as heavily on
JavaScript here to create a a nicer
solution so we want to go ahead and
apply the the transition to both the
menu sides so that's going to slide out
and menu now remember the menu class is
effectively the body so we want the body
to also animate itself when it moves to
the right as well as when the menu
slides to the right as well so to use a
to create a transition very
using the shorthand transition property
we go ahead and we supply the property
that we want to animate effectively and
that's left so that's the property that
we want to animate we then go ahead and
choose the times this is no point two
seconds or we could do 200 milliseconds
it doesn't matter so I'll just choose
200 seconds here and then I'm gonna go
ahead and I'm gonna use ease too just
for the sort of transition type so this
will work but we rely on the WebKit and
Moz vendor prefixes as well so we need
to go ahead and apply these like that so
what's now going to happen is menu site
now has this transition on the Left
property and menu on the Left property
and because we're changing the left
property that's where the transition
will come into play
so now when we go ahead and we toggle
this you can see that it slides in and
out nicely so obviously when a user
comes to your website you'll want to
remove the menu item class and that will
give this view and then when we go ahead
and click on toggle that just opens the
menu and we can go ahead and close the
menu as well
so we've got a nice CSS transition
solution with very very little
JavaScript and heavily relying on our
CSS to make this slide-out menu</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
