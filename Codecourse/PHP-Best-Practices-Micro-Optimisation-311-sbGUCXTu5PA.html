about micro optimization now if you're
not familiar with that term it's
basically when somebody says do that
this way because that way is slower and
sometimes that's fine sometimes the
difference in time is significantly
large but most of the time it's seeming
like zero point zero zero zero zero zero
zero zero zero zero nine seconds so it's
really not worth the hassle at all now
one example I have of this is I have an
array here with a note containing
numbers from 1 to 10 and I'm looping
through them with a for each group
echoing out the number and the line
break so if we just comment this out go
to a browser and refresh we get exactly
what we'd expect now when I was first
learning PHP I was very easily
influenced because I didn't have much
experience I didn't have much knowledge
and this one developer told me that I
should never ever ever use a for each
loop because for loops like this a much
faster apparently now I don't know if
follow to fasten for each loops to be
frank I don't really care I'm not going
to spend the time to benchmark this and
test this because there's really no
point even if a for loop is faster than
a for each loop the difference is going
to be so minuscule that's not going to
make a difference to our to our users
and this let's face it this is just
awkward to type out another example is
quotes now if we have something like
this name equals Terry let's just remove
this I've always done
concatenation like this
that's always her wife concatenated
variables and this is actually a pretty
common one people will often tell you
that instead of using single quotes you
should be using double quotes like this
to be honest that's just difficult to
type for me I'm used to this and again
the difference is going to be so small
it's not worth the hassle so the moral
of this lesson is do what you want when
it comes to micro optimizations it's
just 100 percent personal preference so
you can use for loops for each loops
single quotes double quotes you can do
what you like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
