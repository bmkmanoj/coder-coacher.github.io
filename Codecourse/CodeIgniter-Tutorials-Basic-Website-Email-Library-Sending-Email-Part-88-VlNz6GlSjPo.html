video number 19 in my video series
called introduction to coded matter
we'll be showing you guys in this video
is the email library we're going to take
our application that we've built so far
so far we're using the form helper the
form library and now we'll be using the
email library using getting this form to
send an email to a premade email address
that I've actually created specifically
for this video so why don't we get
started first of all I'll mention that I
actually did make some changes to this I
uploaded the entire project to my web
server and then I've actually like moved
the URL and everything from above what
you can see just protect myself and
things like that so it won't make any
difference as far as learning the email
library another thing I want to note is
a is that I won't be showing this video
how to set up email in the PHP
initialization files that's something
you'll have to figure out by yourself
this is only assuming that you have
emails already set up to work and they
are initialized with your PHP ini file
which they are on my server so now
that's all the way why don't we get
started the first thing we want to do is
load the email library so though this
load
library email and the next thing we want
to do is we can actually just go right
into some of these functions will go
this email and then from is an important
reform this is actually there's from
there's two so we'll do two as well and
that's it for now from well actually it
receives two parameters the first one is
which email and what and the name of the
person who owns that email so in this
case we can actually go this set I'm
square root value which is a form
validation function that will output
whatever they submitted for full name
e-mail message so in this case it'll be
full name a full name just like that
actually the email address or the email
instead because the first parameter is
the email the second parameter is the
name so for the name we'll we'll do the
same thing
we'll set underscore value and the
parameter for the text for this one will
just be full names we'll just copy and
paste that I am lazy and then two will
be actually the email address that I
created for this which is PHP CAD test
at gmail.com
okay now there's the subject so this
email subject and for this we can just
put something like a message from forum
or something like that for from our
forum the next one why don't we do the
message yeah the actual body of the
email so this one is just message that's
the function and it also receives one
parameter typically and it is set
underscore value whatever we typed in
for that message in the message checked
area this is of course it's not going to
look that great you know it won't be
styled very well but I'm only going to
be showing you the basics of the email
library maybe later on I'll we'll get
into some more details or some more like
for example configuration options things
like that or even styling eels but for
now this is all we'll do and then after
that this email sent okay and one more
thing I want to actually do is we're
going to echo out of the whatever this
function returns it will be this email
print underscore debugger think this
word it's yet
okay and what this will do is if there's
an error from from coding matter or from
this library it'll actually show us a
bunch of the metadata that's being sent
along it'll actually give us kind of
like keep us up to up-to-date with
what's going on so why don't we check
that out first thing we'll do is we'll
actually make this we'll fill this out
so our email for this in this case will
be like yay at gmail.com the message
will be hello from the forum send the
email has been successfully sent and you
can actually see right here that is
showing us all of the metadata that's
being sent along with the email and
giving us this this message of saying
you're met your message has been
successfully sent using the following
protocol mail so it's you actually using
PHP mail bytecode it matters of course
configuring and setting all that stuff
up for us why don't we go ahead and
check this our mom already logged in and
that email has been delivered hello from
the forum it's been sent from yeah at
gmail.com but it may have been sent from
there according to gmail and yeah that's
actually it for this video
basically we usually never want to have
that in there but I usually just keep it
there and comment it out in case I do
have problems so we can save that again
where we send another one go back to the
contact form Ryan
Brian at email comm another message this
will be without with that print
underscore debugger turned off go send
email has been successfully sent because
all of our conditions are obviously
meant from the form validation email has
been sent when we check that out
sure enough there's that another message
Brian at gmail.com and that is awesome
that's how easy it is to send email with
a with coding matter of course you don't
of course I'm not teaching you how to
configure PHP to send email I'm only
teaching you how to use the email
library encoding better so thanks for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
