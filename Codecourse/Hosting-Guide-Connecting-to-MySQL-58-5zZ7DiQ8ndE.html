our MySQL server within our droplet and
we can do this in a couple of ways or a
few ways the first way we're going to
look at is doing this within the
terminal and the second way we're going
to look at doing this is with a MySQL
client like sequel pro now this is a
really good option because you can have
this as a native application on your
computer and you can go ahead and just
connect and manage your database this
way it avoids the need to have to use
something like PHP myadmin
which we will be looking at in the next
video I would highly recommend you do it
this way it just means you don't have to
upload PHP myadmin to your server to
actually manage your database so if you
are using windows there are alternative
solutions to sequel pro which is an OSX
only piece of software so there's one
called high D SQL which pretty much does
exactly the same thing as sequel pro so
you can go ahead and download that
install that and you can connect pretty
much how I'm going to so the first thing
that we want to do then is SSH into our
server remember we use SSH command we
choose our project private key and we
hook up to our server however you're
doing this with you doing it through
putty or whatever it doesn't really
matter so remember we get this message
our MySQL user's password is this when
we ran the MySQL secure installation
command earlier in the series you might
have changed your root password in which
case you're going to want to use that
but I didn't so I'm going to use this
one and just a word of warning you're
not always going to want to connect
using your root account you might want
to go ahead and look up how you can
create additional MySQL users with very
specific permissions and that means that
you're securing the account you're
connecting to
by not allowing certain operations like
dropping entire tables the root account
pretty much has all privileges so to go
ahead and do this then we're going to
use the MySQL command
or the MySQL manager within our terminal
we're gonna go ahead and choose the user
by using the u option and we're gonna
choose or user the P option to say that
we want to provide a password and now we
just paste that password in and we're
into our MySQL monitor so from here we
can do things like show up databases you
see we have three at the moment we can
go ahead and create a base uh base if we
want to we can create tables on that
database we can update it if you're used
to using SQL in a terminal to do things
like this this will be the perfect way
for you to do it so you have free reign
over whatever you want to do within here
we're not gonna looking into this too
much we're gonna go straight over to
using sequel Pro to connect with our
private key so we want to keep known at
this password because we're going to
have to enter it here
so you need to choose your SSH option so
you need to be able to SSH into this and
we have quite a few options here but
they're all pretty standard so the first
thing is the MySQL host we know that
this is just going to be our IP address
so let's go ahead and paste this in here
a username for our MySQL server is root
and remember we have our mysql password
here so I'm going to copy this and I'm
going to paste that into there we don't
need to choose the database that we'll
just flicked you straight over to your
database and the port we don't need to
change it's going to be three three zero
six standard mysql port so the ssh host
is the same as the mysql host the ssh
user is root now this isn't the same as
our mysql user this is just basically
our servers user and we now need to
change out or choose rather our SSH
password so in my case I'm going to hit
this key and I can go ahead and choose
project my private key so I click on
this and that's pretty much it
so I'm going to go ahead and hit test
connection you can see that's tested and
we have a connection succeeded
I'm gonna save these I currently have
this stored in a favorite just over here
and I'm gonna hit connect and that's
gonna basically connect me to my SQL
MySQL server so now within here you
pretty much can do what you want we see
them three tables that we saw earlier
when we were connecting with in our
terminal we can go ahead and add a new
database so we could create a project
database we can go ahead and add tables
here so we can add the users table for
example and we go ahead and modify the
structure of it we can do pretty much
whatever we want over here so now
obviously these changes are going to be
reflected so if we just show databases
in here we have that project so if we
use project we can go ahead and show
tables and there we go so it's pretty
much you know exactly the same thing but
there we have the ability to connect to
our server via a MySQL client and we've
also looked at doing this within our
terminal now in the next video although
I don't entirely advise it we're gonna
look at how we can use PHP myadmin
on our server to manage our database if
we want or databases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
