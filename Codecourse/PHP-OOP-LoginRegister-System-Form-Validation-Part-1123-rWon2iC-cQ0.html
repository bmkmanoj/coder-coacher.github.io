validation functionality and to make
this a little bit more relevant to what
we're actually doing we're going to be
building the register page at the same
time now this isn't actually going to
register a user but what it's going to
do is we're going to include the form
and we're actually going to validate
each of these form fields and then if we
pass the validation we'll just we'll
leave this block empty so we can come
back to it at a later time the main
point here is to build a validation
class that we can use on any of our
pages so for when the users changing the
password updating their profile
information and even logging into the
fields on the login page but the
registration form provides us the
ability to include required fields it
provides us the ability to include
fields that shouldn't or should match so
the password and the secondary entry of
the password just to make sure the user
hasn't made a mistake and also it gives
us the ability to check a unique value
as well we'll we'll be baking this into
our validation class so it all works
really really well and just you know
it's just makes development a lot better
so this validation class again can be
used outside of this log in register
application so by building it you're
building up a toolkit worth of worth of
code that you can just reuse again so
the first thing that I want to do is go
ahead and build the register form so on
the register dot PHP page that we've got
open here let's go ahead and start
building up our form so this isn't
anything too complicated
we'll just include the basic
functionality that we need so let's go
ahead and open and close our form the
action is going to be left empty that
will just submit back to this page and
we'll then go ahead and set the method
to post so what we need well we're going
to in creating in case each of the
fields in a div wrapper I'm going to
give this a class of field you don't
really need to do this this is just a
better way to break up your form fields
because we might need to apply styling
to each of these at some point
but let's go ahead and create some
labels so the first thing that we're
going to do is create a label for the
username and we'll go ahead and create
the input field as well so input for
user name and label user name so now we
need to create the actual input itself
so this is going to be a type of text
the name of this is going to be user
name so the name that we pick up in PHP
when we read it we also need an ID the
reason being is that we've said label
for username so we need an ID just in
here and the value is going to actually
be the previous value that was supplied
by the user but for this we're going to
need to use our input class which we're
going to look at a bit later on so we'll
go ahead and and we'll complete this
functionality of it later I'm also going
to set auto complete off so we didn't
get suggestions boss up for us so that's
the one of the fields let's go ahead and
create create some more so this is going
to be the password so that is going to
be the label and we obviously name our
input here type of password okay so the
name here is going to be password again
and then obviously the ID is going to be
password so you can make use of the
label functionality by the way if we
were to open this in in our browser this
basically allows us to click on password
click on these labels and that will
automatically allow us to have that that
field sort of highlighted ready for
input so the part of the past but again
is going to be exactly the same as this
it will just be very slightly different
you'll be password again oops sorry I've
class across the field field this will
be password again choose a password will
just say repeat
or enter your password again and the
type will be password name will be
password again and ID will be password
again as well and we'll also have the
ability to enter the user's name so
let's go ahead and do that so let's just
copy and paste these to save a little
bit of time because it's just a very
repetitive so input for name type equals
text name equals name and ID equals name
as well so the last thing we want to do
is go ahead and create a submit button
and the value of register perfect so
that's going to submit our form at the
moment it doesn't do anything because we
we don't have any PHP code at the top of
the page to actually do anything so what
we're going to be doing is we're going
to be first of all at the top of our at
the top of our page checking whether the
input actually exists or not
and then we're going to create the
validation class as well so part of this
it's important that we actually build
our input class which is very very
straightforward so we're going to be
building our input class as well and
because what we're going to be doing is
passed the input to this validator
checking it and also we're going to be
our basically outputting the old values
like I said here as well so for example
we could do the same for this so value
equals this so if some validation errors
did occur we want to give the user their
data back so they don't have to
constantly be typing the data in the
form so let's go ahead and quickly focus
on the input class this is fairly
straightforward the first thing we want
to do is a method that checks if any
data actually exists so if input has
been provided or not and the second
method is again going to be a static
method that's just basically going to
retrieve an item so let's go ahead and
define this this will be class
input
and we don't need any properties but the
first function we need or method that we
need is a static method and that exists
now we need to define the type of data
that we want so this will either be get
or post and I'm going to say type I'm
going to set this a default of post so
if we don't define get specifically it
will it will check if post data has been
has been provided or not then going to
go ahead and switch on the type so we're
going to switch on type and we're going
to check a few cases so the cases are
obviously going to be post and get and
we'll also have a default here as well
and that will be to return false because
we want to assume that we should always
get data so in here we're going to
perform a ternary operator and we're
just going to say if not empty dollar
underscore post echo true that's so it
returned true otherwise return false and
we do exactly the same thing for here as
well and that will just be using get now
this might look a little bit confusing
you know on first glance but let's just
take a look at how we might use this on
our page and obviously to make use of
our our class that we've just built
we're going to need to require in our
core in it to file that's because we
have our autoloader everything in there
quick if statement input exists we
already know that we are automatically
resolving to post data so we don't
really need to define post in here like
that we can just leave that empty I'm
just just going to set echo submitted so
what this is now going to do is allow us
to detect if this form has been
submitted
oops a little syntax over there let's go
ahead there we are mr. semicolon so now
what's going to happen is when we click
register we get this submitted message
so we've created a really quick and easy
way to check if if data has been
submitted here or not it doesn't
of what data has been submitted because
at the end of the day we're going to be
doing that in our validation class which
is the whole point of doing this so
we're going to be working with the
validation class in just a moment after
we've defined another method here so
this is going to be again a static
method this is going to be get and we're
going to define in here which item we
want to get so this is going to be the
same as saying echo dollar underscore
post username so it'll be exactly the
same as doing that but in this case
we'll be saying input get username so
that's how we want is this to work so a
couple of if statements so or one if
stinking with an else we're going to say
if it's set dollar underscore post item
so we're checking for post data first if
that if that's available we're going to
return that item otherwise if is set
dollar underscore get item then we want
to do exactly the same as we did here
but that will be forget data now by
default we want to return an empty
string and that's really important
because if this data doesn't exist we
still want to return something back if
we don't return something back then this
would you know we can have problems here
we want to always assume that this data
is available but if not we just return
the empty string it's as simple as that
so that's why this is not going to error
or return anything wrong when we just
simply refresh the page like this oh yes
okay let's check there's just a syntax
error here so out there we go my mistake
so providing that you've actually
remembered to declare that it's a method
when we click register now nothing
happens and that's because this user
name isn't isn't available if I was to
type Alex in here and click register
though and we should get this returned
oh sorry we're not actually echoing
anything out our way so we're let's just
echo this out obviously so if I type in
or press register nothing happens
Alex Reggie
Alex appears so we now have the ability
to grab data that we need for me the the
post or get global alright so that's not
what we want to do we want to actually
validate data so we've done our input
class let's get rid of that validation
class now is important so what we
actually let's take a look at how we
actually might want to use this so let's
go ahead and say validate equals new
validate so we want to create a new
instance of this by instantiating the
class we've got a new object now we can
actually perform validation so I'm going
to say validation equals validate check
and I want to check a particular set of
data against certain conditions and in
this case I want to check post so I then
want to create an array that this array
is going to contain all the rules that
we're going to include in our validation
so it basically be the field name of the
data that we've included in our form and
it will then be things like whether this
is required the minimum value it can be
the maximum value can be whether it's
unique or not etc etc etc so in this
case we have four fields that we need to
validate and these will all be arrays as
well because we're going to define
within the array the rules so let's just
create all of these first before we do
anything else so we password password
again and the full name of the user so
for the username let's define what rules
we might want to pass through remember
we've not actually written any of this
validation code yet we're just writing
how we want to be able to use this so
then we can then retrospectively go back
build this object and allow this to
actually function as we as we want so we
want this to be required so we so
required true we want a minimum value
for the username of two characters we
want a maximum value remember in our
database we set this to 20 so we're
going to say we want it to be a maximum
of 20 characters and we want this to be
oops we want this to be unique now what
do we mean by unique well um to to avoid
us having to create an additional query
somewhere inside of this code we might
just want to say we want this to be
unique to the users table okay so that's
that's that's all we want to do we just
want it to be unique to the users table
we don't want to have to perform
additional queries so by doing this we
expect that the value of username here
to be looked up and automatically check
if it's if it's err if it exists or not
in that table and that will be
determined by the name we give it here
so this name must match the field name
so this name must match the field name
in the database that could of course be
changed if you needed a bit more
flexibility or to make this look a bit
different perhaps you don't want to
reveal the the field names in your
database that such that you find for now
we'll be doing it this way but it's just
as easily changed so let's go ahead and
fill in the rules for the the other
other fields so we want this to be
required true we obviously want all of
these values to be required now this is
a this is a minimum of six say there's
not a lot of security going on here as
such we're just saying we want it to be
at least six characters just so it's a
little bit more secure than it might be
if they were to type a as a password you
could of course an include additional
functionality say a strength meter or
something like that and that could be
baked into this validation class as well
now password again this is obviously
required but this is slightly different
because we want this to match password
so we could just say well matches
password so we want this password again
to match the password field so we can
define that as well again we've not
written any of this functionality but
this is ideally how we want it we want
it to function so name is going to be
required and we want a minimum of two we
also want a maximum of I think it was 50
we defined in our database yes
so we want the the name to be maximum of
50 so that is it that's what we want to
actually happen with inside of our
inside of our validation class that's
how we want things to work now how do we
want to actually detect if this has
passed or not well and a little if
statement would be nice to say if
validation passed register user
otherwise we won't want to output errors
okay
so this is what we want to happen we
want to check the VelaShape validation
has passed or not which means all of
these conditions that we've defined it
we met now this might seem like the the
validation class is going to be very
very very complicated in actual fact
it's not going to be that complicated so
let's go ahead and just start building
this now so the class is going to be
called validate as we've already seen
and in terms of properties we want to
detect whether it's been passed or not
we want to check if there have been any
errors and store these errors so we can
output them and we also need the ability
to create an instance of our database so
we'll be doing that within the construct
function so when we construct the
validator we we set this instance of our
database and obviously that's only going
to be because we're using the singleton
pattern for our database class if the
connections already been made to the
database otherwise it will just return
the instance of it so we need three
private properties passed and that's can
be false by default we want to assume
that it's not past we have errors equals
and that's going to be an array and we
have DB equals null it's just going to
be nothing so in terms of our
constructor we have a public function
construct this will be called when the
database the validate class is
instantiated and we just want to set DB
to DB get instance and we have one main
complicated method and that's the check
method which we've already seen here so
let's go ahead and just define that so
public function check
now what do we want to pass in here
where we want to pass in the data that
we want to loop through and check and an
array of rules so we want to say source
and items that's going to be an array
and we'll set that by default an array
just so we don't get any errors inside
of our inside of our for each loop which
we're going to build now so the main
idea here is to list through the items
that we've defined so the rules that
we've defined and then for each of them
we want to then list through the rules
inside of them check it against the
source that we've provided and then and
then add to the errors as we go so it's
set it seems complicated but in actual
fact if you look at it very carefully it
does make a lot of sense so what do we
actually want to loop through well we
want to loop through the items that
we've that we've defined so these are
basically all of the items this this
this and this these are all the items
that we want to check so for each items
as item rules now the reason that we're
doing this is item is then this a
username password password again the
name and rules will be the array that
governs the rules and for that
particular item now what we want to do
is also loop through them set of rules
so we want to say for each so we have a
nested for each we want to say for each
rules as raw roll value so to make this
a little bit easier to grasp let's go
ahead and just echo out some some you
know some data so let's go ahead and say
item has a item
just take a look at this so item yeah so
we're going to say item rule must be
rule value and what this is going to do
is it's going to make it a little bit
easier for us to list through and see
how this is working of course if it
looks a little confusing so when we
register okay
I'm validate PHP so that looks like out
okay so we've called this validation dot
PHP so let's just change that to
validate PHP remember because of our
auto loader it's going to load in the
absolute name of this so when we refresh
we see username required must be one
username min must be this basically just
means true so take that as true use them
in must be two username max must be
twenty blob of last we've listed all our
rules we now know that we have access to
each of the rules based on each field
inside of here so let's go ahead and
grab the value of each of these items so
the value is going to be the source so
get poked get or post and that's going
to be item so now what we have is the
value of each one that we've passed in
so let's just say we let's just so we
have in here Alex our swerd password and
name up Alex we need to change this
label I've just realized we get all of
the values listed out here for each for
each loop so that's exactly what we want
let's just quickly amend this I didn't
notice this before so your name perfect
okay so now that we've got the value
what do we want to do or the first thing
we want to do is check if it's required
or not if the if the value is missing
there's no point going to actually
validate anything else
if we don't enter a username there's no
point checking whether it exists in the
database or not there's no point
checking the minimum
maximum values so the first thing to do
is to check whether actually exists
so if rule is equal to required so if
we're we're defining the date something
has to be required and it's empty then
we've got a problem so what we're going
to do is we're going to create another
method called
add error fact this will be a private
method and this is just going to add a
an error to the errors away so let's say
this errors equals error and the error
will be passed into this like that
so if rule is required and the value is
empty then we want to go ahead and say
this add error item is required so we
can just say with double quotes I guess
item is required now the only problem
with this validator class it's something
you might want to go ahead and adjust is
that item is now going to equal the
field name of that value so you might
want to add perhaps some the ability to
define in your validator class up here
the name that should be displayed so
perhaps you could say something like
name equals username and then we could
pull that name from it but for now we
just can use the field name it's just
something to think about and that
probably you know enhance learning of
working with things like this so
otherwise what do we want to do well
let's go ahead and just test this error
functionality first so what we want to
do is we want to create another method
and this is going to be a public one
called errors which is going to return
the list of errors that we have fairly
straightforward we just want to say
return this errors and that's it so
inside of our code here if we pass we
can just say
past otherwise we want to output errors
now you're probably thinking well we
don't have a way to find if this is
passed or not so public function passed
and we want to return you've probably
guessed it this past which up here is
false and this is always going to be
false because we're not actually doing
anything in here to say otherwise so
what we want to do is we want to have a
quick check when we're done looping
through and validating everything and we
want to check if our errors array is
empty or not or we could say this Harris
so if our errors array is empty as
returned by our errors function we want
to say this past is true because we'd
haven't stored any errors and then we
want to go ahead and return this so we
can chain on things like past so let's
go ahead and check this now
otherwise we'll print our validation
errors okay so let's go ahead and check
this
let's hit register can't use method
return value in right context let's just
check what's happened there line 26 so
line 26 here if empty this errors
of course okay so we're just going to
use the property instead because what
we're doing here is we're returning
something and then using it inside of
empty which we're not allowed to do so
we'll just check the the actual array
that we store up here which is I guess
that makes sense
so let's just refresh the page and we'll
click register
you can see here that we're now returned
with an array of errors which is
essentially what we've set out to do and
we've got user name is required password
is required password again is required
and name is required if I enter user
name and click register we only get
three errors perfect now the only
problem here is that we aren't being
returned with the the past data that
we've used so if I was to enter a
username and my name but I forgot
somehow to enter a password you know we
get our errors back but these two are
missing so let's just go ahead and just
fill that in now it just save a little
bit of time so inside of value here what
we can do is we can just basically
because we're always going to be
outputting an empty string if this data
doesn't exist we can just open some PHP
tags and echo out input get username
okay so we can do this and we can do
exactly the same thing for the name as
well now there's one thing left to do
here and if your security savvy would
have known what we need to do is call
our escape function just to sanitize
that data and so it doesn't interfere
with our form and when we refresh there
we go so our data is back again so we
can now go oh yeah sorry the passwords
required I'll then I'll go ahead and
enter an account password and obviously
we're going to be looping through this
and outputting it in a in a much nicer
way but for now we'll just leave it as
it is so if it passes we we just echo
out passed and I guess we didn't test
that so let's just enter password and
password click register and it says
passed perfect so what we now need to do
is actually fill in the ability to to
actually define the rules that we've
created so
we've created some rules here or define
the rules that we want required we know
works but we now want to focus on the
things like min Max and stuff like that
so what we want to do is inside validate
we want to switch the rule so we want to
use switch statement we want to switch
the rule that we want and I guess here
we will just want to say if not empty
value so we want to switch the rule and
we want a case for each of the rules
that we've already defined so the first
one is min what would just say the first
one is minute doesn't really matter what
order we put them in then we'll say max
matches and unique so min max matches
and unique it doesn't need to be done
this way as a switch but it just makes
it a little bit more modular and just
looks bit easier on the eye and it's
easier to keep track of so for the
minimum value what do we want to do well
we want to check that the string length
of the value is less than the rule value
that we've defined so the string value
at the string length of the value of the
this value is less than the rule value
that's defined so a little if statement
if string length of value and we should
probably go ahead and trim this just so
we don't end up with any white space so
if the string length of the value is
less than raw value what do we want to
do well we want to add an error so we
want to say this add error as we did
with the with the required field and we
want to say let's put this is double
quotes we want to say item must be a
minimum of raw value characters there we
are so that's how error let's go ahead
and test these out as we go just so we
we know where we're at so I'm going to
say username is
a register user name must be a minimum
of two characters Alex
register and that error goes so we know
that that works now and that will
obviously be the same for each field
because we're looping for each field so
for the maximum one it's pretty much the
same so we can just copy and paste this
just to save a little bit of time
instead it's going to be the opposite
way round for the operand we're going to
say greater than instead and in this
time we're going to say a maximum of
rule value characters and in this case
remember the user name is a maximum of
20 so if I was to just type Alex and
just copy and paste this a few times
register user name must be a maximum of
20 characters so we can go ahead and
amend that to Alex hit register and that
error goes as well so we've now done the
min and max let's go ahead and do the
matches so this is for the passwords it
doesn't have to be for passwords we
might just be checking a capture value
or anything really but we want to check
if the value is not equal to the source
rule value so if value as we've already
checked here we use string length in
this case we don't need to use string
length if the value is not equal to the
source so remember the the post or
anything like that rule value now why
are we using source when we've already
looping through the items well we're
checking another value so for each loop
we're not going to be we're not going to
have that value available to us in this
loop so we need to refer back to post or
get whatever it is check the rule value
and then see whether that's available or
not because the rule value refers to
another fields value basically of
another fields identifier so if that
doesn't equal that means that something
must match so we say this add error
and in here again in double quotes we
want to say rule value must match item
so let's go and check this out
let's hit register all of the fields are
required let's fill in our name sensibly
and we'll say password in here but I'll
go ahead and type in password 1 in here
and click register password must match
password again so that works so now is
the slightly more tricky unique value
which isn't really that difficult
because all we're actually doing is
using the database Val database wrapper
that we've already created and we're
going to use the get method on that so
if we cast our mind back to when we
created the database wrapper we're going
to create a check by using this DB
remember up here we got the instance of
the of the database that we're working
with the database connection working
with and store it inside DB so this DB
that we didn't really have to do this
but I guess it's entirely up to you get
so we want to get something we want to
get from the particular table basically
so we want to make sure it's unique to
users so we want to say get and that
will be the rule value so we want to say
rule value and in here we have an array
so remember here just for an example
we'd say username equals Alex but of
course we don't want to say this because
that would mean that we only are
checking these values instead we want to
replace them with the item that we're
checking and the value that we've been
defined with the actual data that's been
entered by the user then what we want to
do is we want to say if check and we use
our database method count to find out
how many results have been returned
if there is a count a positive count
that means that this value does exist in
the database and therefore that item
already exists so we want to just say
something like this ad error and again
sorry double quotes item already exists
and that's it
so obviously with item we're outputting
the rule value in the item each time so
what we might want to do is for each of
the items we might want to say item
equals escape item just so we are
outputting a sanitizing that some click
register they're all required let's go
ahead and type in Alex password password
and Alex Garrett so these all are valid
when I hit register though okay let's
just check what's going on here this DB
okay let's just have a look here so
let's see so we're constructing aah
that's why construct lovely okay so a
little bit of a spelling mistake there
meant that our database handler wasn't
available to us let's go ahead and just
enter this data again so password
password and my full name register
username already exists if I was to type
in something like Billy and enter a
password and the password is correct
when I register we get wish oh yes sorry
we've already got Billy in there and we
let's check so we got Billy Dale and
Ashley and password and password click
register passed so all of our rules have
now passed now these are all the rules
we need but you might need different
rules for your different your
applications so it really depends
entirely on on your use so let's wrap
things up quickly
and all of our validator class is done
now but all we want to do is output our
errors in a certain way if if we don't
pass so
basically all we're going to do is we're
going to say for each validation errors
as error and then all we're going to do
is just echo error and then a line break
so you can do this in whatever way you
want so the mark-up does come out a
little bit nicer but for now we're just
going to do this because we're learning
about this system and we're learning
about object-oriented programming we're
not to you know interested in in MVC or
correct markup or anything like that so
there's our validation class we can
validate anything we like now by using
this validation class defining rules
checking if the validations passed we
can do something based on that so that
is basically a validation class and we
can use that now wherever we want in our
application we don't need to talk about
it we know the syntax and it's going to
save us a lot of time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
