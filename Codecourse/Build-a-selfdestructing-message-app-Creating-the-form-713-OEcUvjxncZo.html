to enter an email address and a message
and then hit a send button so to do this
within bootstrap we can create a div
with a class of row this will allow us
to create columns and this is part of
the bootstrap grid system if you're not
familiar with a grid system we
essentially have 12 different columns
and we can for different device sizes
give a specific amount of columns now in
my case what I'm going to do is create a
six column on a medium width screen so
we can do this just here so it's just a
deal for the class of Col hyphen md6 and
i'm just going to enter form in here so
we can just see what this looks like so
you can see here it doesn't look too
much different but if we inspect this
within the chrome developer tools you
can see that this is now half the width
so it's six columns obviously half of 12
but what I want to do is I want this
whole thing to sit in the center so to
do this I can actually offset it so we
just say coal md offset 3 so now you'll
see that that is now in the center so
the blue section is actually where that
container is ok so now that we have this
we can actually inside of here create a
panel so a panel just gives us this
element you can slightly PAP see a
border around here but we can give this
different styles and in my case I'm just
going to say panel default so in here
now we have this panel and you can see
it's just slightly darker background a
little bit of drop shadow and a border
ok so inside of here then we want to say
panel body and then our form will go in
here so let's just preview this again
you can see all that's done this is
given a little bit of padding so now
let's build up how form we have a forum
with an action going to
killer root for now I'm going to set
this to hash because we don't know what
that route is cold so we can't build
this up and the method is obviously
going to be post so let's just turn
autocomplete 'off as well you don't
really need to do this and now we're
going to create a class a div with a
class reform group and inside of here we
can create a label and an input so the
label here is going to be for email and
we're going to say send to and down here
we're going to have an input with the
type of text the name of this is going
to be email and the idea is going to be
email natural fact we can set this to
email so we have some front-end
validation on this as well so we need to
give this a class so it looks nicer form
control and also going to set a
placeholder in here as well we can just
say someone at domain.com just give the
user an example of what they should type
in so if we refresh you can see that
we've got a fairly nice-lookin form it's
just standard bootstrap styles but it
looks a lot nicer than what we would
work with if we didn't have a framework
pulled in so we need to do now then is
outside of this form group create a new
form group and this is for the message
so we say form group and inside of here
we create another label this is for
message and in here we say message and
then down here we create a text area so
the name of this is just going to be
message this is just how we pick it out
with PHP the ID is going to be message
the colds we can keep it 30 and the
roads we can keep it 10 you can
obviously adjust that or use CSS to
change it and that is pretty much it we
do need to remember our form control
class as well so it looks a bit nicer so
we now have this we can just close this
off ok so now last but not least is our
send button so we just have a button
here we're going to give this a class of
BTN and then in here we're going to say
send that this is just a bootstrap start
button
refresh we now have that so we can type
in an email here remember because we're
using some front and validation by
setting the type to email we get this
popping up here just telling us that we
need to include a valid email and then
we can go ahead and write a message hit
Send at the moment obviously it does
nothing because we don't have a route to
find to actually store the message but
we're going to be going on to do that a
bit later so we now have our form we're
almost ready to start submitting data
through to our database and then firing
off an email but we don't actually have
a database table set up so let's jump
over to the next part where we're going
to set that up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
