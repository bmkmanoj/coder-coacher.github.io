form in that's gonna allow the user to
enter their credit card details and
actually join and become a subscriber
we've already looked at how we can force
the user to be a subscribed user but
we're gonna do it properly now viola our
cashier so what we need to do first of
all is really create the route that's
gonna allow the user to join so under
routes what we need to do is we need to
make sure use it isn't subscribed before
they actually decide they want to
subscribe so imagine yourself in the
situation where you are a subscribed
user you don't want to be able to access
this join page so let's go ahead and
create a group and what we're gonna do
is before we're gonna check if the user
is not subscribes now we haven't created
this filter yet so we'll do that in just
a moment let's just define the closure
here so what we need to do is we need to
define the not subscribed filter we're
also going to just we're also going to
define the subscribed filter as well so
just down here let's go ahead and add
these in so now our cashier actually
gives these to us on their github page
but let's type these out so I'm gonna
say filter subscribes so we're going to
create a subscribed one then a not
subscribed one so down here what we want
to do is we want to check in here if off
check and off
user is not subscribed then we want to
do something so in this case what I'm
gonna do is just redirect just pull this
down want to redirect home natural fact
will redirect to subscription and we
want to redirect with a message saying
you need to be subscribed to do that so
what this is going to do is if the user
isn't subscribed it's going to redirect
them and we can just as easily do the
opposite to this which is not subscribed
and we can just remove this here
so if the user is subscribed and they're
trying to access an area that they don't
need to like the join page we will just
redirect them back to subscription with
no message now we implement this notice
a bit later on so under our routes now
we now need to define the join post and
join get root so let's define this out
here okay so inside of here we want to
call this something so I'm gonna call
this subscription join and I'm gonna use
our subscription controller and you
probably guessed it's going to be yet
join so we can duplicate this down
because we need a post for this as well
we need to be able to post this data
what we can do is we can get rid of as
and we can change this to post and then
we can change this method that we're
accessing to post join it's inside our
subscription controller down here we're
gonna create yet join which is just
gonna be the page the user lands on and
then we can create post join which is
going to be the user the page that the
user submitted the form to
so under get join we want to just return
a view so this will be subscription join
so let's create that view now so under
subscription and you file and we'll call
that join blade of PHP and we'll do
exactly the same thing as we did in
index so we'll pretty much just copy all
of this paste that in there and just get
rid of that now what we do need to do is
we do need to implement some scripts
here so we remember we yielded in some
scripts inside of our template just down
here and the scripts we need basically
come from stripe and this is the stripe
j/s library that allows us to do things
like process payments and connect
basically connect to their API so let's
add some script tags just in here and
that is the URL you can find that on
their website but it's basically just an
HTTP link to just a stripe TOCOM slash
version 2 now we also want to include
our custom stripe JavaScript as well so
we use the asset helper here to include
j/s stripe jus now we've not created
this year so under public let's create a
new folder called j/s and in here let's
create a new file called stripe j/s like
so then we're going to implement a very
custom solution here because we want to
do things very specifically we're not
going to be using the stripe button that
allows you to just click and process a
payment because we want this to be as
custom as possible really we don't want
the user to know that we're using stripe
you might not care but in this case
we're going to implement a very custom
solution so let's build up the form and
then we'll look at the JavaScript to
actually handle the form so the form
here we know this is going to submit
through to the subscription join so we
say URL action
subscription join and the method here is
going to be post so inside of here then
we can just create all of the labels
that we need and then we can just post
this through to remember this here now
what we also need to do is look into
security here so I'm gonna say before
cross-site request forgery so we're
going to add some cross-site request
forgery protection to when we submit
this form so what we can then do inside
of join is we can add a token so form
token so let's just check everything so
far we haven't got a link to this so
that's just up there our index page so
I'm gonna say join Now links through to
URL use the action method and this will
link through to subscription join and
there we go we hit that and then we go
through to that subscription join page
and you can see that that's loading in
the Striped javascript library down here
and our custom stripe javascript file as
well which we're going to build on later
so inside of join now let's actually
print out our form so that's correct a
div for the class of row here and inside
of this will create a div with a class
of large six and that's just append
columns onto there this is basically
just Foundation's markup and it's set
and the classes that it uses so you
don't really have to do this at all so
in here this is gonna be the area where
we choose a plan and the second area or
the other half of the area is where we
enter our card details so let's just
preview this in the browser like so and
there we go so we've got the ability to
choose a plan here and enter card
details here so I'm the choose plan
let's create a label here and inside of
here let's say chosen plan now we can
come down and we can create a select
element it's important we give this a
name because we need to pick this
up from within our controller and we
have a couple of options in here and
these are just going to be the options
that we have created within stripe so
the first one is gonna have value of
small and here will say small and then
we'll give the price so we can say $5 a
month and this one here is going to be
large or big or whatever record it large
that's $10 a month so you can pick that
up when we submit it by either the fact
that the value is small or large so
inside of card details now we basically
want to I'm gonna build this here but
then we're gonna extract it into a
partial file and the reason that we're
gonna do that is because we need this
also on the update card view and we
don't want to duplicate the mark-up
because they've if there are any changes
that's going to be really really
annoying so the first thing we want is
the ability to enter a card number so
we'll create a label here and we'll say
card number and in here we'll have an
input type of text now what we do is we
have these data attributes that allow
stripe to fetch this data and this is
really important that you don't give
these name attributes and the reason for
that is that if this data does if the
any of your JavaScript fails and you do
actually post this data to your server
it could technically be stored on your
server so what we want to do is we only
want to provide data attributes that
will mean that when we submit it through
we're not actually passing data to our
server so this is data this data
attribute is called number now we also
then down here want another row and you
can mark this up however you want this
is just you know rough marking things up
and inside of here we're gonna have
let's just pull this down a little bit
gonna have a class of large four columns
so the first one is going to be the
expiry month so in here this is going to
be Spira month and in here we're gonna
have an input type of text again and
again we're adding this stripe attribute
here which is exp month and we can
pretty much just duplicate this three
times and just change what we need so
you've got expiry month expiry year and
again this changes like that and then
under here it's the CVC
so that's just the code typically found
on the back or the front of the card if
it's an American Express so we've now
got this in here let's just preview what
this is looking like there we go so
we've got out the ability to choose a
small or a large plan enter a card
number expiry month expiry year and CBC
and just down here below here we want to
include our button that allows us to
submit the form so we're gonna say
button we're gonna give this a class of
button just to utilize some of the
front-end styles of foundation and this
is going to recall make payment now it's
this lot here that we want to take and
put into a partial so I'm gonna take
that and I'm gonna include subscription
dot partials card so under subscription
let's create a new folder called
partials and inside of here let's create
a new file called card blade dot PHP and
paste that in and in fact I need to
rename this file to underscore card so
we still get the same result here but
we've got our button there as well now
so now what we ready to do is actually
fill in this form and start to actually
process payments and then we're going to
look at the token that stripe generates
for us so what we need to do is inside
of stripe
jas we need to target this forum somehow
and then actually process it rather than
actually submit this straightaway so
we're gonna add an ID to this called
subscription form or whatever your
whatever you want to call it
subscription form sit inside of stripe
j/s now we need to start writing out the
JavaScript code we need to process this
so I'm gonna say documents ready and
what we're gonna do is we need to set
the stripe public key or the publishable
key so we can access the stripe library
like this you'll notice that if I just
get rid of this and I into stripe down
here you can see that we've got things
like set publishable key and a variety
of other functionality as well from the
stripe library that we loaded in so
we're gonna say stripe dot set
publishable key and in here we need to
paste in that publishable key remember
we're working on a test environment so
if we just grab this here and paste it
in you may need to do a little bit of
tweaking inside of laravel to change
this over from your config but I'm just
gonna leave this as it is for now I'll
let you decide how you want to handle
that so we want to now because we're
using jQuery we can pretty much write
this out really really quickly
we'll say not premium subscription form
button now on a click of that button we
want to go ahead and run this callback
now we're gonna set a couple of
variables the first one is the form
itself so we're just gonna sort of
self-identify that form even though we
already selected it above so we're going
to say subscription form we also have a
submit button because what we want to do
is we want to do things like disable the
submit button and add a little message
in there we're gonna say form dot find
button be careful if you have any other
buttons on your form otherwise this will
interfere and then we also want submit
initial
texts and that's just basically the
submit forms text in its initial state
and that just basically means that if we
do change the text on here we don't need
to update that inside of our library and
it also means we can have different
texts as well that doesn't make sense
don't worry we'll have a look at that in
a moment so submit we want to change the
attribute and we want to set basically
the disabled attribute to disabled so
let's just check so far if this is a
working so when I hit this that should
disable and it has you can see I can't
click it or do anything with it at the
moment but what we now want to do is we
want to change the text so I'm gonna say
text just one moment so now what's going
to happen is when we hit that it says
just one moment perfect and that will be
the case while we are processing the
next code that we're gonna write we're
gonna say stripe dot card dot create
token now what this is gonna do is it's
gonna take our form and it's gonna
generate a token from this so all we do
is we provide the form and the stripe
library does the rest it picks up them
data attributes that we created earlier
and it will do everything that we need
to do and we have a callback here and
inside of here we have the status and
the response so what we can do is we can
we can check these in here I'm gonna
store a variable up Hickel token first
that we're going to actually assign our
token to so in here what we can do is we
can say if response dot error so if
there's been an error for whatever
reason we're gonna say form dot find now
we're gonna find a class called stripe
errors and we're gonna set the errors
that have been returned from stripe in
their response dot error dot message now
we don't have this at the moment so
inside of our partial we're gonna create
a div up here
with a class of stripe errors we're
gonna say panel and we're gonna say hide
so panel is a foundation a component if
you like and hide will just hide this so
at the moment when we hit enter on this
we don't see it at all I'll just get rid
of that to show you what it will look
like so I'll just put boots in there for
now just as an example and you'll see it
looks like that so what it's actually
gonna happen then is if we put that back
in there what's gonna happen is we're
then going to from here show that so for
example if we don't enter anything
it adds the message in there and then
shows this so we're doing this all with
JavaScript now what we also want to do
at this point is allow the user to
correct their errors so for example if I
didn't type anything in and I hit made
payment
I can't submit the form again so we need
to revert this so we're gonna say submit
don't remove attribute and then we're
gonna say disable so we remove the
disabled attribute and then we're gonna
say submit dot text we know the initial
text because we stored it up here so we
can basically just pop that in there now
otherwise we want to get the token so
let's do a console log on response to ID
and I'm gonna type in a valid credit
card here so 4 - 4 - and that 4 times is
a test Visa card so I'm going to enter a
valid expiry month and no valid expiry
year these need to be valid and a CBC
and I'm gonna hit make payment that's
checking the console you can see that we
get this token that's the token that we
use on the PHP side to actually charge
the users card and subscribe them to the
the subscription they've chosen so
instead of console logging it which is
useless I'm going to set the token
variable that I created up here to the
response ID like so and then I'm gonna
say form dot append now this is really
important because we need some way to
actually sub
this token through to our PHP page so
all we do is we append on create a value
that we create so in here we just create
a select like this and we say input type
hidden' name token and then we could
just say value equals but we can use
jQuery to help us out in this one dot
Val token and then what we want to do is
submit the form so let's just check out
how this works because it can get a
little bit confusing I'm gonna type in a
valid expiry and credit card number in
CBC hit make payment that submits the
form we go through to the post version
of join we check the network tab here
and we scroll up you can see the under
our form data we've got the token here
this token is the cross-site request
forgery protection with laravel so don't
confuse the two but this token here is
our stripe token so we now have access
to this within PHP so let's take a look
at actually echoing that on that page
just so we're very very clear it's so
under our subscription controller once
we post join if we do an echo on input
get token you'll see
that we get that token so now what we
can do is actually use stripes punch
laravel cashes functionality to actually
join us up to the chosen plan remember
as well as submitting this form we have
the plan as well so let's just check
this one as well so we can say plan and
there we go so we've chosen small in
this case
so let's actually create the
functionality now to charge the users
client card and subscribe them to this
plan now laravel cashier makes this
extremely easy to do all we need to do
is access the currently logged in user
remember we stored this up here and we
need to say subscription now in this
case we're just gonna pass in input yet
plan that bear in mind I'm just blindly
passing this in you might want to do
some validation in here to check that
the plan does exist but if this plan
doesn't exist things will fail you might
also want to try and catch errors that
might occur because of this for example
a user's card may be declined or
something like that so this obviously
will still not work if the users what if
the user's card is declined but it's
nice to report back at you an error I'm
just going to do this just literally to
you know explain the cashier
functionality we'll be here all day if
we start trying to catch every possible
error so now what we're going to do is
we're going to chain on the create
method and this goes ahead and takes the
token of the users card that's been
generated by stripe so I'm going to say
input get token and then I'm gonna pass
an array of details I want to store on
strike so this is obviously very limited
but in this case I'm gonna choose to
store the users email so I'm gonna say
this user email and that's it now let's
go ahead and just redirect I'm going to
redirect back to
the subscription page and we're gonna
redirect with the notice and that notice
is going to be you are now subscribes
thanks so we need to set up this notice
functionality so let's do that really
quickly here it won't take a moment
so under template I'm gonna create a new
folder in here called partials and under
here I'm gonna create a new file called
notice blade dot PHP the inside of here
I'm gonna do a quick if statement to say
if session has notice then I'm gonna
create a div with a class of alert box
and inside of here I'm going to output
that notice that we get from stored in
the session so like so so now that's
needs to be including in our main
template so we can include this just up
here like so so now let's test out the
ability to actually into my card details
and sign up just to confirm under stripe
you can see that I don't have any
customers yet once we've entered our
details I will then become a customer
remember we've got a couple of plans and
there are a couple of payments I've
already made on this account but we'll
see this 8 pound 76 jump up when we make
a payment here so let's do this now
under here let's enter our details and
it's hit make payment and there we go
we've been redirected with the alert
that we've just created as part of the
template partials and you'll notice the
message on the main subscription page
has now been changed to tell me that I
am subscribed so let's take a look over
in stripe at customers that just give
this a refresh and you can see that that
custom has been created you can see The
Associated charges here you can refund
you can see that my cards been stored
securely on stripe and it
also says that I have an active
subscription to the smaller plan and
gives me a host of other information as
well so that's basically how we sign a
user up to a subscription we next need
to look actually canceling a
subscription</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
