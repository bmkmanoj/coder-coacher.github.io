nice update to creating custom blade
directives and this is essentially just
assuming an if statement now if you're
not sure what custom blade directives
are we're gonna take a look at that in
this part as well so you'll learn
something new before you understand the
changes to this but essentially what
these are is a really nice way to create
a kind of wrapper in your template as to
what you want to show now just to
demonstrate this we've got a default
laravel set up just here and I'm gonna
go ahead and register an account so I
can kind of get into my account area and
of course we see the navigation just up
here now for example if a user is an
admin you're gonna want to show an admin
link inside of the navigation so let's
come over try and use a model and let's
create a little method in here which we
would conveniently use to check if a
user was an admin and I'm just gonna
hard code this in but of course you
would have your logic in here to check
that we have a course on roles and
permissions as well if you do want to
implement that kind of functionality so
of course what we would do is over in
app Blake PHP where all of the
navigation lives we would add this in
just around here now it's really
important to note that yest has been
available since laravel 5.4 so you can
actually use guests to check if your
users signed out rather than using
something like at if auth check equals
false or whatever so that's a really
really useful thing and this is exactly
what we're going to be creating with our
custom blade directive so inside of here
what we would do if we wanted to check
for use of as an admin we would create a
blade if statement and go ahead and end
that and we would use maybe auth user in
here or you can go ahead and use the
auth helper like this tidy up to you and
you would use is admin and this is a
really simple thing so an if statement
here isn't too much but if anything got
a little bit more complicated than that
of course you're gonna want to extract
this out to a custom blade directive so
in this case we want to show an admin
link inside of here if that user is an
admin and of course because we've
hard-coded that in we see that link in
there if we go and just get
rid of this by setting this to false we
don't see that anymore so how would we
go ahead and create a custom play
directive for this for example
admin and then end admin that would look
a little bit cleaner and it makes a
little bit more sense now at the moment
we're just gonna see admin and end admin
it doesn't really work because we don't
have our custom directive in there let's
build this out in the traditional way so
we can see how these work if you're new
to them and then we'll look at the new
addition to laravel 5.5 so the first
thing I want to do is create a service
providers to hold all of my custom blade
directives what I usually do is go ahead
and make a service provider called blade
service provider and I put anything
custom to do with blade inside of there
so let's go and open this up we'll go
ahead and register it so let's pull this
open head over to our config apt file
and come down to where our service
providers are registered go ahead and
duplicate this one down and we'll switch
this over to blade service provider so
how do we create a custom directive to
essentially achieve what we've just done
here well it's pretty straightforward we
just used the blade facade to go ahead
and register a directive so we need to
make sure that we pull in the facade
namespace just here
and we basically give the start and end
tag so in this case we would have an
admin we would have a call back in here
and now we basically just return what
we'd want to see on the page now because
blade works with normal PHP tags what we
would have to do in here is just return
an opening PHP tag a closing PHP tag and
if statement inside of here a kind of
shorthand if statement and then we would
just do what we normally would in here
so we can use or check we can use the
earth helper if we want it to be a
little bit cleaner and then inside of
here we can say and if if auth user is
admin then we can go ahead and show
something that we want now the only
problem with the directive method is we
have to separately register an end admin
or end whatever you're doing and this
will involve just using again the
shorthand PHP syntax for ending an if
statement inside of a template so this
will go ahead and work
now if we just head over to the browser
and give this a refresh you can see that
we're seeing exactly what we saw before
if we come over to user and set this to
false this is just going to work in
exactly the same way so it's a lot nicer
to have to do this because we can
extract out any kind of logic we want
and just have a really simple directive
in here however this is a little bit
messy we're having to define out the
start and the end on their own and we
have to implement this kind of complex
template logic if you had anything more
complicated than this things would start
to get a little bit messy so let's go
ahead and scrap all of this and look at
the new addition to laravel 5.5 and this
is still using the blade facade but this
time we have an if method now this
allows us to say well we just wanted to
find out admin which is going to assume
that we're automatically going to
register an end admin tag and then in
here we can just return without
outputting any kind of custom PHP tags
the logic that we originally put in
there so in this case I can just say if
all check and Earth user is admin like
so and that is pretty much all we need
to do so a massive improvement on how
this works you can see we don't see any
errors we don't teeny markup output or
anything like that and if we head over
to user here and switch this over to
true you can see that that just works in
exactly the same way now much the same
as normal blade directives where we had
to register these out separately as
we've just seen we can also pass
arguments through to this as well so for
something like checking if a user is an
admin of course what we're doing here is
assuming that it's the currently signed
in user what happens if we had some kind
of template in here which was an admin
panel and we wanted to show a user down
here but we wanted to show if they were
say an admin or a moderator we want to
show a completely separate section so
basically what we want to do is using
first of all this change we want to make
this a little bit more flexible and give
ourselves a little bit more control so
what we're going to do is we're going to
remove this and we're going to assume
that we're passing through a user into
here and we're gonna pass that user in
and by default
gonna have that set to null what we can
now do is go ahead and say well in this
case I want to check if user is null
then I just want to return false now in
this case that would assume that the
user that's been passed in either hasn't
been passed in or the user is not
available or the users just not signed
in so in this case then over in app
toledo PHP we would go ahead and pass in
the current user like so and then we now
have the flexibility to pass in any
other user to this method if we give
that a refresh you can see it works in
exactly the same way and once again if
we just switch this over to false you
can see there that it's working
perfectly so this is absolutely fine but
you cannot achieve even more flexibility
with this if you wanted to in this case
we can say well we're still checking if
that user hasn't been passed in but
we're also saying and auth check is
available then we can go ahead and
assign user to that user like so this
basically means if the user hasn't been
passed in but the user is signed in we
assign the user that's currently signed
in what we can now do down here is go
ahead and check if there is no user
returned false either the user isn't
signed in or the user doesn't exist and
we can do exactly the same thing down
here so all this is done now is give
them us the ability to use admin which
will by default use the currently signed
in user like so or we can go ahead and
now pass in a user so as an example if
you were building out some kind of admin
panel panel and you wanted to show some
kind of logic based on a user's
condition what you can now do is just
pass that user into here and that's just
gonna work in exactly the same way so
just to demonstrate this we could go
ahead and say app user find one and that
would work in exactly the same way so if
we give that a refresh you can see it
works so there's a lot you can do with
this another really useful example of
using this is if we are on a production
environment or a local environment so
what you can actually do is go ahead and
create a blade directive to maybe show
some kind of debug information if you're
on a local machine but not show it if
you're on a production
machine and this is a really useful one
so we could say it's create a tag called
EMV inside of here we can take in the
environment that we want to use and we
can return app environment passing in
that environment and that will show
something if we have or if we're on in a
particular environment so let's say for
example if we are on the local
environment well we want to go ahead and
show something in here so in this case
let's just go ahead and make this really
simple and assume we had some kind of
debug link through to something on our
local machine and you can see that we do
get that if we were to go and change our
environment here over to production of
course we're not going to see that so
there's a huge amount of things that you
can do with this it's a lot easier it's
a lot tidier particularly if you're
registering lots of these now of course
the directive method as we saw earlier
it's still useful but if you just need
an if statement like this it just makes
things a lot cleaner and a lot easier to
maintain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
