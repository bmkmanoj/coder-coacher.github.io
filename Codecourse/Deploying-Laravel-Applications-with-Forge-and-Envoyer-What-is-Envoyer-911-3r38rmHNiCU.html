series to deploy our project and
basically take our code from github
place it onto our server but why do we
need to use envoy to do this we spoke
earlier about forges ability to deploy
code directly from our github project if
we link our account up which is great
for most people this is enough however
envoy offers zero downtime deployment
and I guess this concept probably needs
some explaining so zero downtime
basically works by deploying everything
required for your application to a
different directory on the server so it
won't basically overwrite your files
just yet and then what it will do is
once every step of the deployment stage
is successful it's symlinks over the
directory to the new project or the new
deployed files and this means that along
the way that you're deploying if
something fails so for example if your
project files are copied over you then
need to run say migrations you might
need to run composer to install any new
packages you've used and if something
goes wrong along that way your site
probably will break and you'll have to
go through some kind of complex
procedure to roll everything back now it
is common for things to go wrong after
you add more to your project and some of
these things are out of control so in
the past I've deployed and I've seen
errors downloading dependencies which
would have brought basically broke my
entire deployment process and because
I'm code course calm we use envoy to
deploy it meant that when this did
happen everything just stayed at it was
now we'll be looking a little bit later
more in detail about how this works and
which kind of folders that envoy creates
in your server but basically just using
on voyeur you can have pretty much zero
downtime deployment now not only this is
really easy to control things like
environmental variables that get loaded
into laravel for configuration and we
also have features on envoy like
heartbeats which let you monitor parts
of your application to make sure
everything is working and you have
complete flexibility over how your
application is deployed and the steps
that you deploy in so you can add on
things as it grows now of course you're
going to be paying extra for this
service but I really think it's worth it
and we're going to be looking at how we
can sell pour envoyer to deploy
everything that we have now get our
project in the next part and you'll just
see how easy it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
