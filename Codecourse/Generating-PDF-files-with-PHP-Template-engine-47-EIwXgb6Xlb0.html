before we get started we need to sort
Twigg out so we need a class which we
can use to render views so our view
remember is in here we need to be able
to render this with variables that we
pass in and this is pretty
straightforward but what we do need to
do is we need to require in Twix so all
we do to do this is over in our terminal
we want to require or composer require
twig slash Twix now go ahead and
download twig for us so now that's
downloaded twig is automatically
available to us because we've used
composer you can see that in the vendor
folder just here so it's already
included we just need to create a kind
of helper class to create a new twig
instance and then go ahead and render a
view so to do this under the code course
directory we want to create a new folder
called views and then inside of here we
want to create a new file called view
PHP this isn't the best solution if
you're working within some kind of
framework this is gonna be a lot easier
not nicer but since we don't have
natively any good templating languages
or engines this is going to be a lot
better so we need to namespace this so
it can be psr-4 Auto loaded
we're names facing it under code course
views the class name is view so inside
of here we're gonna have a constructor
and all this is going to do is
instantiate Twigg so we're going to say
this twig equals new twig environment
and inside of here we pass the twig load
a file system instance and we pass in
the directory of our views that's just
views so we just pass that in there so
again because these don't exist under
the co course views namespace you need
to use each of these up here and there
we go so when we create a new or you use
this class we're gonna have a new
instance of twig to work with so I'm
gonna create a twig property up here
because remember assigning this here and
we now need a method to basically load a
view so we're gonna have a method called
load this is gonna take in a view which
remember is essentially just an HTML
file I'm gonna have an array of data
that we want to pass to that so to do
this we're just gonna return this twig
we're gonna use the render method we're
gonna pass in view I'm gonna pass in
data so like I said this isn't an ideal
solution but this allows us to easily
get going with what we need to do again
you can replace this with any way the
you are rendering views it doesn't
really matter so we can actually test
this out by heading over to our index
dot PHP file just going to instantiate
this and get rid of this for now cuz we
don't have that anymore and we can save
you load invoice PHP and we can go ahead
and check out the result of this that we
need to echo this out and you can see
there that we actually get our view so
if for example we want to replace this
variable here all we need to do is we
need to go in to our view we need to
output something within twig I'm just
going to call this invoice or we could
call that
number I suppose and once we've done
that you can see that doesn't show
anything at the moment but when we go
over to here and we pass an array of
options in so for example number though
the numbers that's replaced in so you
can kind of see how this functionality
reflects what we saw originally where we
load in something we want to render as a
PDF and we pass in data so we know that
this functionality works now and we can
get on with building the actual capture
class which we're going to be doing in
the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
