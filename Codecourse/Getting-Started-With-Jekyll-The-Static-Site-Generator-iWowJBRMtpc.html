month my name is Travis Nielsen and I
want to make babies with you baby babies
with websites little websites I make
websites ah for the past few weeks on my
channel called dev tips we've been
building a series of videos called how
to make a website from start to finish
and I really tried to give everybody
like a seat at the table as we've gone
through the whole creative process
starting with like discovery and
ideation we talked about empathy and
organization we talked about doing
sketchings and wireframes and last video
we did was even a little bit of visual
design but I've tried to time this
particular video for today so that you
guys and girls of PHP academy' get the
first technical lesson of this series
and I'm really excited to share it you
don't need to watch any of those other
videos to understand what we're doing
today today stands on its own but if you
did want a little bit more context
there's a link in the description below
to a playlist that we've been building
and that's that so today we're looking
at setting up our development
environment where we're building a one
page a single page portfolio for an
artist it could be a you know a
photographer a designer or a composer
doesn't matter it's a single page
portfolio type of website
it's always important to match the needs
of the project with the capabilities of
the platform so for this project I've
chosen to use the static site generator
called Jekyll if you're not familiar
with Jekyll or things like it let me
explain some of the fundamental
principles involved here here's how it
works
you make a template you make content you
run Jekyll and you get a whole side of
individual static HTML pages after you
get the static pages you can just upload
them to any basic server out there and
bada bing you get a website this is
really awesome and exciting for a few
reasons number one because your server
doesn't need to talk to a database upon
page requests it's a lot faster number
two because there is no database your
site will be a lot more secure there's
no way to hack it now and also because
there's no database there's less parts
fewer parts means fewer things that can
go wrong so that means less maintenance
fewer parts to maintain also means
there's fewer things to pay for
so if Jekyll is actually a very cheap
way of maintaining a website in fact
Jekyll websites are hosted for free on
the very fast and very reliable github
servers as github pages and finally
Jekyll is blog aware meaning you can
write your content in markdown so for
bloggers and markdown enthusiasts this
is awesome for more information about
the extended uses of Jekyll I recommend
you listen to episode number 54 of the
next web podcast
where Jen Simmons discusses the topic
with yuen-han and Dave Cole who
successfully used Jekyll to power the
American President Barack Obama's
campaign website last term so it's a
very interesting podcast the link is
also in the description down below check
that out
Jekel is a ruby app that you install on
your system it just received a big
version update and so now it's running
on version 2 on Jekyll's website there's
some really fast and easy instructions
on how to get started so we're just
going to follow these right here and set
up our first Jekyll Jekyll site so the
first thing we need to do is install
Jekyll some say sudo gem install Jekyll
great now the Jekyll is installed we can
just check Jekyll to make sure we're up
to the latest version so you do that
type by typing Jekyll - should be and it
will tell us we're on version 2.0 point
3 great ok the next step is checking
here the QuickStart instructions to
start a new Jekyll project we will CD
into our desktop here I want to put it
for now and now that I'm on my desktop I
can write Jekyll new portfolio now
portfolio is the name of the project now
it's created a new project on my desktop
called portfolio so if I look right here
I have the project sitting there great
so I also want to CD into the project ok
now that I'm inside of my project folder
I can write Jekyll serve and now Jekyll
is running and it's working it's
compiling the all those files we talked
about earlier into a workable site
structure and it also set up a server
here and that's going to be at port 4000
so if I go over to my browser and I type
localhost 4000 now we have our Jekyll
site up and running and we can see this
Jekyll theme which is the default theme
honestly it's quite nice but there are
tons of free jekyll themes out there and
some of them are quite nice also
so now that we have our Jekyll site up
and running like the work is nearly done
but let's take a tour of our Jekyll
projects we can get familiar with how
this thing kind of works and how its
organized I'll drag my project into my
code editor and we'll be able to take a
look at it okay the first and probably
the most important file in the Jekyll
structure is this configure yml this
configure Yambol document so um it has a
bunch of the settings in this case we're
talking about the title that your email
you can write a description there's
different settings that you can write
here where you want your server to be
like I think over here to the
configuration page here's all the
configuration settings for this config
yamo so an example is if I wanted let's
say my port to be something out
something else other than for $4,000
right port 8080 or something like that
and now when I would restart my server
let's do that right now let's say
command quick command or target control
C let's get control C to quit and then
restart our server and we notice that
now we're on port 8080 so let's go over
to port 8080 and now our site's working
there but it's not working at 4,000
anymore okay so there's a lot of
different configuration settings and the
documentation on Jekyll's website is
really easy to understand and a lot of
really cool things you can do but let's
move on after you have looked at the
configuration file there's a lot of
important folder structures to
understand with Jekyll so let's start
with the site the site folder is one of
the more important ones and it will be
automatically generated by Jekyll this
is not something that you need to
manipulate yourself at all in fact you
shouldn't touch it because what happens
is when Jekyll runs it will take all of
the the
content your pages and your templates
and your includes and your posts and it
will render them as they should be found
and stick them inside of the start of
the site folder so the site folder is a
rendered version of all of your pages
and here is this is your blog so this
will create that URL look at that URL
see how that the all these folders come
up this is how Jekyll works these are
rendered fully fully realized HTML pages
they're not a template talking to the
server on for requests or sorry on page
requests so all of this happens when
Jekyll is running and not only does it
create these pages but it also moves all
of your assets all of your images and
your JavaScript and your CSS will move
into the site folder so you don't have
to touch it but understand that the site
folder is what is the final output is
the product of Jekyll's work now the
layout folder is another important one
this one this one will include your your
main templates so the default template
here includes the structure and just a
normal generalized page and then when
you get into specifics so another page
would be the the post you know this one
will make allotments for that the day
that it was published the metadata here
if there's an author you know what is
the the post title whereas the default
post doesn't have any of that stuff it
just says what's the content supposed to
be - spit it out into this wrapping
class of a div right here now those are
the layouts you'll notice that they're
using a bunch of includes here so if you
want to write nice modular code then you
would put your includes in the
underscored include folder so your head
is all right here you don't have to
write it twice it's just there and you
can include it into all of your files or
into your main template and then your
subsequent files would just you know
inherit that and your individual blog
entries will all be contained in the
under
or posts folder so this folder right
here and let me show you how its named
you name it the the date that it's
published and the title of it and then
Jekyll when it's ran it will put it in
the right directory like we looked at
before right so all of your posts would
just fill up this folder right here and
then the output would be they would be
placed in the right folder structure for
the output and you can use that
configure EML to say if you want to have
your permalinks by date or just by name
or by category there's a lot of
different options there so it's all very
clean and organized I really like it now
up here at the top of every content page
not necessarily layouts and templates
but the content pages will all have this
block of text above it and this is
called frontmatter this area is really
powerful when it comes to templating the
templating engine that is Jekyll all
these little things are they I mean
there's there's a few standard ones like
date and title right that you can use
that are very common but they can be
called anything and then just pulled out
anywhere in the template so I'll often
make a special class name that I'll
stick into the body tag of the page and
then when I'm you know writing a post or
writing a page I'll call the alright
here like I'll do this body - class and
then and then when I'm writing this one
I'll say welcome I'll say post welcome
so that way it's a special class hook in
the body tag if I need to do any special
styling for that specific post or page
so here in this post we can see that the
frontmatter variable of the title is
declared here and then in a posts
template let's run over there in the
post template it's calling it right here
so it at what we wrote is just going to
be pulled into the h1 right there and so
and also lower in this template we can
see here that the variables are involved
in logic so you know if this page has a
day
then print the date if this page has an
author then print the author's name and
you know that's when you end your
different and you can you can nest your
logic here as well into this whole block
you can make these animal variables
anything you want they can even include
like HTML markup so you can like start
inserting HTML into different pages
dynamically based on the content that of
the of the post or page so that can be
really convenient and you can get kind
of clever with that new to Jekyll 2 is
the ability to compile sass so let me
show you how to get that running that's
pretty exciting for me you run over to
the CSS folder and let's just create
let's just change this into sass and
then you need to go eat in the top of
your sass file you need to put a llamo
header doesn't need to be full of
anything just just need to be there and
then as soon as you save it you have to
run Jekyll again so we quit Jekyll and
then run it again actually let me quit
it again I want to show you a trick I
can run Jekyll if I put - - watch it
will watch my code and if there's any
changes then it will output a new
version of Jekyll so let me save here
and then you see how it just triggered
Jekyll again so that sass changes are
running and inside of my site I'll have
main CSS cool so so Jekyll now converts
into sass which is really exciting when
we used to have to run sass in the
terminal in parallel with Jekyll Jekyll
also does CoffeeScript if you're into
that alright that's it for our tour of
the Jekyll static site generator hope
you enjoyed this video next week we're
going to jump into using Jekyll and
start developing the project that we've
been working on for the past two or
three weeks over on dev
tips for more about the project that we
set up for today take a look at this
playlist here too for all the videos
that we've created up to this point and
after we complete the project I'll be
giving away the site for free to use for
yourself
so keep on peeking back on dev tips and
checking out the progress there also if
you want to hear me talk a little bit
more about Jekyll um a while ago I did a
collaboration with my friend Jonathan on
a site that I use Jekyll to build and
John had a bad time John hates Jekyll so
last week I visited John and I talked
with him about Jekyll and see if I could
help him to be converted over to the
house of village echo lovers to see how
that went click this box right here and
there's also a link in the description
of the video down below thank you so
much for watching this video and a big
THANK YOU and much respect goes to Alex
of PHP academy' who keeps on letting me
post these videos here keep on hacking
guys thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
