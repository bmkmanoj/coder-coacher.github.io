application using the register details
that we've given we want to be able to
allow the user to log out at the moment
it's just an empty page now this is
extremely easy because at the moment at
least without the Remember Me
functionality it's just the act of
deleting a particular session so let's
just jump over to our user class and
let's create another public function or
public method and we'll call this logout
so what we're gonna all we're going to
do here this is extremely
straightforward is use our session
helper and we're going to delete the
session this session name as we've
defined and stored up here okay in
session name so now that that's you know
complete we want to go ahead and
actually build the logout page again
fairly straightforward if we just open
that here and we go ahead and require in
core in it dot PHP so we need to create
a new user object to make use of the
functionality inside of our user class
and we then just say user logout you
could check if the user was signed in
before they hit this page and it doesn't
really matter because all we're doing is
deleting a session and also then going
to redirect to the index dot PHP file
using our redirect helper so what we can
now do is click logout and we're logged
out again we can go ahead and log back
in and just do exactly the same thing so
logging out is extremely simple we just
create a little helper there but we're
gonna need to amend this functionality
when we introduce the remember me
ability so when we login we can check a
little checkbox to say and we want to we
want to remember me so the login
functionality will be slightly different
because we'll be dealing with cookies as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
