difference between two days but what
about when we want to compare two days
this is equally as important and this is
extremely easy so let's go and just
start up a couple of new date/time
instances we'll pass some dates and
times in and then we'll go ahead and
compare them so let's start with just
creating a new date/time instance here
and we'll directly pass into this a date
and we can again pass it in in any kind
of format we've already seen the human
readable version in this case it's just
going to be any old date and we're going
to do this
twelve O'Clock specifically so now what
we can do is just go ahead and duplicate
this down we'll maybe call this date two
and then we'll just change the date
around a little bit so let's say zero
one and we'll just get rid of the time
for this one so now the goal is to say
well which date is bigger or is date
bigger than day two or greater than they
two rather so in this case what we can
actually do obviously we're going to use
an if statement for this we are going to
say date greater than date two and that
is it so here we can say yes or whatever
you want to do in this case in this
block now we know that this is greater
than date two because this is the 25th
of December and this is the first of
December and we see yes now obviously if
we were to just switch this around and
say well is date less than day two then
we obviously don't see that block run
and of course you can use greater than
equal to you can use less than and equal
to or any other operators with
comparison now what about when we want
to check specific parts of the date so
for example let's just go and check this
one here so we'll just get rid of the
other one and I want to say is the year
here greater or say less than 2017-2018
or is the month or is the day anything
like that so the way that we do this
because we can't do something like echo
date D for example and go ahead and
actually get the date out what we need
to do is say format and
format the year so in this case we get
if we just go and fix that up we get the
following you get 2016 so with this what
we can do is we can say if this and we
can check if this is maybe less than
2017 and then go ahead and just echo
something out so we'll just say yes like
so now the best thing to do here is when
you're working with something like this
go ahead and cast it to an integer this
makes the comparison a little bit better
in terms of just knowing exactly what it
is because here were obviously using an
integer and of course we see exactly the
same result so is comparing two dates
you can just use standard PHP comparison
operators if you want to extract part of
the date out and go ahead and check it
you just format it as per the formatting
that we've already looked at and then go
ahead and compare it to whichever value
you want and of course with this as well
it makes it easy to go ahead and use a
equals comparison so we can say does
this equal say 2016 you could either do
this in a string or as a number and in
this case we could get rid of the
typecasting and of course we see yes
because it is and of course if we change
that around we don't see that block run
so really that is pretty much it in
terms of comparing dates either to dates
or specific parts of the day and of
course you can do this with times as
well you just format this in a slightly
different way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
