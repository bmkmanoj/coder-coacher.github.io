codes within your application really
easily I'm going to show you a package
that we can download that allows us to
do this and we're also going to be
creating a file specifically that allows
us to specify the text that we want the
or URL specify the size of the QR code
and padding if we need it so you can see
an example here of a QR code this is
currently linking to Google if you've
got a QR code reader go ahead and scan
this and you'll see the Google URL
appear let's take a look inside of our
text editor here and see how this
actually works so QR code dot PHP is a
father I've created over here this uses
the library that we're going to be
putting down with composer and I'll show
you how to do that as well and it allows
us to define the text that we want to
include so in this case it's Google
Dakota UK it allows us to define a size
and we can also do things like add a
little bit of padding if we need it but
the reason I've created it this way is
because then wherever we are in our
application we can generate an image
using this URL it gives us an almost API
to generate a QR code directly within
our application so in this video we're
specifically going to be pulling the
package down that we need and then
creating this QR code or PHP file that
you can use like this really really
easily doesn't cause a lot of mess and
promotes code reuse so let's go ahead
and look at how we can build something
like this okay so we're going to start
completely from scratch if you are
trying to integrate this into your
current application is really
straightforward it's not going to make
much difference at all because
everything's really clean and tidy now
in my browser at the moment I obviously
don't have an index file or anything
like that we'll be creating that in just
a moment now we're going to be using
this package to generate our QR codes
it's Android QR code so we're going to
be pulling this down using composer as a
dependency in our project now if you
want to use composer I would highly
recommend it it works for all operating
systems and it's basically a dependency
manager for you
so if you haven't got this already go
ahead and download that and make sure
you can access it on the command line
like the following if you don't want to
use composer that's fine you can go
ahead and hit download zip to pull in
the files that you need and then you can
manually include the class and then do
things like that to follow best practice
I'm going to use composer to pull this
down so the first thing that we need to
do is actually find this package and
basically pull this package and put it
into a composer JSON file so on the
command line here we've got a couple of
options we can search for packages we
already know the name of the package is
Android slash QR code but we can also
show information about packages and this
allows me to pull in a version that I
want so if you do want to search for
packages you can use composer search and
then do something like Android that's
going to give you a list of packages to
match in this case we know this is the
one that we need so we can copy this and
we can say composer show paste that in
and that's going to give us version
information so you can see here we've
got versions up here we don't really
want to pull dev master or the
development here let's say we put in 1.3
star just so we know which sort of
version we're working with and any
increments on this we can we can pull in
so we can either do this manually from
our composers or JSON files we can
create one here let's do this and we're
going to save this as composer JSON and
this will allow us to update and install
our dependencies from the command line
so we want to require this in as a
dependency and we can go ahead and paste
in the package name in this case we know
that it is android QR code so we paste
this in here and then within here we
define a version which we said 1.3 dot
star so over on the command line now
we're going to run composer install and
that's going to install that for us
really really straightforward and if you
ever have a new
version of this released you can just do
a composer update and pull down the
latest version so if you have manually
downloaded this you're going to want to
put it in some kind of folder and then
require it in to the QR code HP file
that we're going to create in my case I
already have the auto load generated by
composer so I can just pull that in and
it will pull all of my project
dependencies in much easier so let's
create this QR code or PHP file QR code
PHP and first of all let's require in
vendor also load book PHP so we now have
the QR code library pulled in so we know
that we can start to use that so within
this specific QR code dot PHP file we're
going to be working to generate a QR
code and then we'll apply the options
that we need to be able to use this
within an HTML file or anywhere else on
our project so the first thing that we
need to do then is go ahead and create a
new instance of the QR code class and we
can do this save it in a variable called
QR now it's names based on the Android
QR code so at the top of your project
you can either say use in droid QR code
like that or you can say new Android QR
code and then the name of the class so
we'll do that for now since this file is
pretty basic live depending on how
you're working you might want to do that
instead
so like the following so now that we've
got that we can go ahead and actually
start to use some of the methods that
are available on this to generate for us
and this is really straightforward so
there's a method called set text which
allows us to obviously set the text for
this QR code this could of course be a
URL so we could do something like google
code UK or we could go in here and we
could just type a name in or something
anything that we want a message to our
users let's leave this as a URL for now
what we can then do is go ahead and set
the size using the set size method so
for this it can be something like 200
which is about right sort of normal size
and that's fine what we can then do is
set the padding on this so the padding
around the outside so let's set that for
unknown ten for now now the last thing
that we need to call is the render
method which will actually output the
image data for this QR code so you can
use render like that you don't need to
echo out it will just do it for you so
this is all well and good but it's not
going to quite work as we expect let's
check this out in the browser so you can
see here that this is actually
outputting the image data rather than an
actual image and this is really
important because when we come to
include QR code dot PHP within an image
element in HTML this isn't going to work
properly otherwise so what we can
actually do here is use the header
function in PHP to set the content type
so we say header content type image
slash PNG that's going to alter the
content type of this page and that will
be rendered as an actual image and
there's our QR code so again you can go
ahead and scan this if you didn't scan
the one at the start of the video and
you can see that this now works
obviously if you're following along
generate your own text and if this scan
so it's all well and good doing this but
what happens if say we have some kind of
page like index.html we have some kind
of document layout here and we want to
include an image on here with a QR code
let's just set a title here so I'm going
to say here is your QR code now there
are a couple of ways that we could do
this if this was a PHP file we could of
course call this that every time we want
to generate a QR code so we could do
something like the following but this is
really messy it's horrible the fact that
you have to keep calling this
not to mention if you change the library
or package that you use to generate QR
codes say you want to switch this out
with another one then it's not going to
work quite right because you're going to
have to go back and modify all of your
code so we're going to turn this file
into a dynamic QR code generator so to
do that let's go ahead and define how we
want this to look so I'm going to create
an image tag here the alt will just say
QR code and the source is going to be QR
code PHP we're going to say text equals
and let's give a URL here and we're
going to say we want the size to be 200
and we'll also specify the padding so
let's say we want of having of 10 so
this is how we want this to work we can
just use this anywhere we want then and
will automatically receive a generated
QR code now inside of here we need to
make adjustments to allow for a text
size and padding to be passed in as a
yet variable and we can access that
using the get super global so what's
required here well the text is required
and then we're going to set some
defaults for size and padding so if
they're not provided will automatically
default to say 200 and maybe like zero
padding or something so we can modify
this file let's just start up here we
can create an if statement to check if
dollar underscore get so they get super
global text is set now only if that's
set we want to generate a QR code
because otherwise it's pretty pointless
so now only if that is set do we do all
of this what we can now do is up here
set our defaults so we can say size
equals and then we can give it a default
value here so say 200 we can do the same
for padding as well we'll set that to 10
but we want to replace this size
variable value if the size and padding
values are included in the get request
so all we can do here is say is set
other underscore get size if that is set
we want to access that key otherwise set
this to 200 s this is a ternary operator
it's basically saying set something in
this size variable so if size is set we
want that to be the size otherwise we
want that to be 200 and you could of
course just pass that to an integer if
you wanted it doesn't really matter so
we're going to do exactly the same for
this here so if the padding is set we
want that to be the padding otherwise 10
so regardless of whether size and
padding are available they will have
values otherwise they'll be the values
that have been defined so now what we
can do is we can pass in here yet text
in here we can pass in the size and in
here we can pass in the padding and
that's it so now when we go over to
index to HTML and we access this file
we're just replacing what we've passed
in here into these methods so over on
our index dot HTML file or if we just
hit the URL like this there is our QR
code and we can go ahead and we can
modify this directly form the URL here
and we can choose the size let's say we
want that to be 300 and that regenerates
it for us so now you can go ahead and
use this URL anywhere within your
application to generate a QR code as you
please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
