show you how to implement a tab feature
on your website what we are looking to
achieve is something like what we have
on the screen here which is where you
have a number of titles at the top of
your screen and then some content in a
box beneath those titles and when you
click on different title to the one
selected you get some new content
appearing in the books beneath so the
first thing I need to do is have a HTML
file CSS and JavaScript file and I want
to link between each of those so if I
want to attach these styles I'll need a
link element like this and use it to
point to the star sheet so I'll need rel
of star sheet tribute in that link
element and an href of tabs dot CSS to
point to the CSS file the file taps what
CSS is in the same folder as my HTML
file so all I need to do is type the
name of the file because that's that's
the relative path the next thing I'll
need to do is attach the script the
JavaScript so I need a script tag at the
bottom and I won't need any of this I
won't need this type here well well then
what I will need to do is provide a path
to that farm which again is just tabs J
s because all my files are saved in the
same folder now to attach job jQuery for
those of you that don't know that the
easiest thing to do is probably just to
go to Google hosted libraries which is
this page here click on jQuery and then
just copy this snippet of code here and
then just take that directly into your
HTML file so that's what I'm going to do
you can of course just download jQuery
from the official site and save that
locally and point to it but I think this
is probably the easiest way of doing it
and definitely the easiest way to
demonstrate it so the first thing we'll
want is a div that is just going to
contain a contain the entire feature and
I'm going to so I'm going to create that
give it a class of tabs
and so that we know this is the tab
feature and close that off and the next
thing I want to do is to mark up titles
now the titles are going to simply be an
unordered list and list items we then
within that unordered list
so let's write our unordered list and a
list item title will lead a anchor
inside each of these and we'll give the
anchors an href that is unique to the
title and the reason we want a unique
href
they said that later on in our
JavaScript we can distinguish between
the different titles that we've clicked
on so there we are that's a list item
that's going to represent a title how we
want three of those so I'm just going to
copy that three times and type in some
names tennis first one wash sacré one
and hockey in the third and now as I
said we need it's important to have a
different age ref each title to
distinguish between each title so there
we are now the next thing we'll need is
a div to contain the content and so the
text in this case the corresponds to
each title so we'll need three of these
I'm just going to mark one up and then
copy it three times
so if we have div below and give this a
class of tab because this is an
individual tab content section and then
need another class which matches up to
one of the classes of so it matches up
to the eight ref of one of the titles so
tab one for example and then we'll need
three of those one per title and it's
important to change this class here so
that it matches up with one of the
titles
there we go and obviously we want some
something inside our divs in this case
I'm just going to put some text in a
paragraph you can have anything inside
your your tabs really but I'm just going
to have paragraphs
for the purpose of demonstration because
it's the easiest probably the easiest
thing to have in there and so inside the
paragraph tags there will want some some
text so I'm just going to copy over this
Latin that I've got saved just as an
example but yeah it can it can be
anything really in there you can be as
creative as you like with this
copy over this final chunk of text there
okay and that's all the markup we'll
need so let's see I'll save that let's
see what that looks like on the page now
here we go
doesn't look like much right now but it
will do once we've started to apply some
styles okay so let's start with the
styling the first thing we need to do is
give the asset entire asset or width of
50% the reason I want to do that it's
just so that doesn't stretch across the
entire page just make sure that it
stretches across half the page and with
this with this talking you through the
styling I'm going to have the browser on
the left hand side of the page like this
and then the text editor on the right
hand side of the page and this will
allow me to share the changes that I
make as I make them so the first thing
I'm going to do now is line up these
titles alongside each other at the
moment their rendering underneath each
other which isn't what we want I want
them next to each other so let's lay
them left and there you go you can see
they're starting to line up alongside
each other but that's not what we want
with sorry this isn't what we want with
the text lining up next to it so we can
deflate that like that left as well so
I'm going to slate the text with tabs
div and flow that left as well
there we go and it starts styling the
titles a little bit so we want to get
rid of the bullet points and to do that
we'll need a selector for the unordered
list itself just etabs our list and use
a list style type of none I would get
rid of the bullet points and let's get
rid of the underlining as well so to do
that we'll need to target the anchor
because the underlining is a default
default styling for the anchor and
that'll need a text-decoration:none okay
okay and you can see that these titles
rendering strongly away from the side of
the screen and that's because there's
some default styling on the unordered
list itself and we want to get rid of
that so let's do padding left and zero
and that's gonna move it over but we
obviously want to space it out as well
so I'm going to put a padding on the
list items say here let's apply padding
10 pixels sorry 5 pixels
ten pixels and I've used the shorthand
for padding here and if you give it to
values padding the first value will be
the padding for the top and the bottom
of the element that you're applying that
padding t and the second value of either
the padding for the left and the right
so there you can see they're nicely
spaced out but let's let's move the
content away from the side of the screen
as well so let's get valid padding let's
give it a zero top and bottom and then
ten left and right there we go so that's
starting to look a bit better but let's
let's also apply a border on everything
because if you look at the final example
got some borders let's put a border on
our divs save id border one pixel solid
ccc that'll put a border on divs and
border here takes three parameters so
the first parameter is the size of the
border second parameter is the style so
it's going to have the solid line and
the third one is the color so there you
can see it's a border on that div but we
also want a border on our um titles
that's for that same border and the list
items at the top there we go but you can
see in certain areas you've got a double
a double sized border there says doubly
as big that's because we have the border
that's applied to the div and to the
Unruh the list combining to double the
size so we're going to remove some of
the the some of the border and some of
those borders that double up celestia
border bottom zero on those list items
that reeves the border the bottom there
and let Steve border left of zero on
those lifts at list items
but you can see that we have the edge of
our titles now without any border so
we're gonna have order left of one pixel
solid SECC on yon old list and at the
moment there's there's no border
appearing and that's because the
unordered list doesn't actually have any
content inside it because our list items
are floating so if we do an
overflow:hidden on our unordered list
that'll now clear that float and we can
see that there's a star on the left or
these of the titles but there's also
some gap disappeared now here and that's
because there's a default styling on the
other don't the unordered list so let's
give that margin zero to get rid of that
to false styling and they are we are
we're starting to look good a few final
things to do let's put the let's change
the color of the Yankers
to black does that blues a little bit
ugly which is a default again and let's
put it had these as uppercase it takes
to transform uppercase there we go
and that's taking a bit better the final
thing we want to do if the styling is
apply some stylings and the default
setting of the tabs so let's by default
have 10 is selected and show you the 10s
content so I'm going to go back to my
HTML
and I'm going to give a selected class
to the tennis best items of a given
class because selected like that and
then I want to target that give it a
background so I D tabs slip the whole
thing then unordered lists and list
items but only the one with the selected
sorry with the selected class and then D
background CCC there's a background on
tennis and by default we only want to
show you the text corresponding to
tennis so I'm going to hide all of the
container divs by default but then show
the one for tennis like so
over our fresh there we go that's what
we want by default so the final thing to
do now is apply the JavaScript now the
first thing to do with our JavaScript is
to create a selector for the element
that we've clicked on or sorry for the
title element so that when we click on a
different title element our JavaScript
will run a function so let's select and
select our titles and we're going to use
this selector to get those titles so
that when I click on an anchor within a
list item within an unordered list it is
a direct descendant of my tabs feature
then apply the on function and the on
function is a jQuery function that takes
two parameters the first one being an
event which is a click so this this will
run when I click and the second one
being a function to actually to do
something and now I'm going to write an
anonymous function and fill that up with
all the logic that I need so I'm going
to write a console log in here just to
just to show that this is working let's
the console of the test
refresh and so what I'm hoping to see is
that a test that we log to the console
of each time I click and you title and
that is happening great so we've got our
setup there and now what I want to do is
get rid of that console log and with our
JavaScript we're going to navigate the
Dom tree to to do all of our logic so
what I mean by that is if I open up the
console and show you the elements when I
click on
a title I'm going to navigate back to my
tabs that contains everything and then
search within that tabs for the day of
containing the content that corresponds
to the tab that I've clicked on so the
title that I've clicked on and the
reason we're going to do it this way is
because if I had a number of these tab
features on my website if I wasn't
navigating the Dom tree like this and
just selecting a class with sorry an
element with this class then there's a
chance the the two tab features could
interfere with each other by clicking on
one then I'll change the content and the
other which isn't what we want so
they're going to navigate the Dom tree
carefully so the first thing we're going
to do is write down all the elements
that I'm going to need and select all of
those straightaway so the first thing in
ideas have a very rule called that which
is going to be the element that we've
clicked on and you can select the
element you've clicked on just by doing
this the next thing we're going to want
it's a variable tabs which is going to
be the the element it contains all of
the the other elements so the tab
feature itself and to do that I'm going
to have to go that's actually the third
parent of the element they've clicked on
so I'm going to write parent three times
and that'll give me available it
corresponds to the entire feature and
the next thing I'm going to do is get
the value of the href of the attribute
that I've sorry of the element that I've
clicked on and to do that I'm going to
use this select it here in fact actually
let's go to full screen for the rest of
this JavaScript
so let me write on this selector and
then talk you through it
now what we've done here is we've
selected the attribute of the value of
the href attribute that we've clicked on
and then we're going to trim it so that
we only have the value from the from
after the hash so if we look at our HTML
see we have a hash there this is the
this length that we've written here is
going to remove that hash and select
everything after it which is exactly
what we want and the final thing I'm
going to do is define a variable called
items which is going to correspond to
the title elements so unordered list
lists items within our element within
our entire tab feature okay so we've got
all the we've got a reference to all the
elements that we'll need so now let's
start applying some logic so on the
click the first thing you want to do is
change the background of the element
that we've clicked on so say we click on
a new tab then we want to give that the
dark background and remove the dark
background from the tab that was
previously showing say we use our our
reference to the title element Andry
remove the class of selected from all of
those first of all and then we find the
one that we've clicked on and add the
class to it I've selected say let's let
me write out the selector to do that and
then talk through it
all right so what this is doing is
finding the item or the title that has
an anchor of hash and then the target
value that we clicked on so that's the
href of the target that we've clicked on
then we go to its parent so we get out
of the list item we go to the sorry we
get out of the the anchor we go to the
list item and then we add the class
selector to that and obviously the
selected class comes with the style
which is back a gray background
which is what we want the next thing we
need to do is hide the content and that
was previously showing and add the
content for the new title that we've
clicked on so again to do this which is
show first of all we're going to show
all the content so target all the tabs
so target all the the divs containing
the text and show them all but then
we're going to hide the content for the
tab that corresponds to the titles we
haven't clicked on so let's do that now
I'll write up a selector and then talk
through it
so what we've done with this selector
here is we've found the the tabs that
don't have the value of the href of the
title that you've clicked on in their
class and then we've hidden those so if
I save this go back to my page refresh
you can see this working very nicely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
