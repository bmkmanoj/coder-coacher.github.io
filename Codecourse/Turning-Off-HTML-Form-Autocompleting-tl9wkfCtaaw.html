forms you don't want things that have
been previously typed in similarly named
fields to be available so for example in
here with an email address as soon as I
start typing later that I've submitted
previously on a form filled with the
same name comes available on some
browsers this will be turned off if
you're using HTTPS for security reasons
obviously for things like credit card
numbers and other information that might
be secure however in this case we are
not really on HTTPS and doesn't remake
sense so what we're going to do is we're
going to use the auto complete attribute
and we're going to set these two this
two off obviously this can be set to on
what we're going to choose off in this
case so now what's going to happen is
when i refresh and I start typing
something you can see that we don't get
results that have previously been tight
now if you have multiple elements it
could get slightly annoying and also a
complete waste of space to write
autocomplete 'off for both of these
elements so what we can actually do is
we can apply this just once on the
parent form and that's going to turn off
also complete for all fields within that
form</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
