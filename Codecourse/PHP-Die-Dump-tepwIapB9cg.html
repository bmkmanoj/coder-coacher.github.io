talk about dyeing and dumping basically
what we're doing here is we're killing
the rest of the page this is really
useful for development we're gonna kill
the rest of the page and we're gonna
output the content of a specific
variable telling us what that variable
or object is in a human friendly way so
let's take a look at a quick example
let's create an array here and let's
maybe add an item's element to this and
pull this down and let's add some more
items in here so let's pull this down
actually threads and nuts okay so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use var dump
which is what we're gonna be looking at
and I'm gonna pass in this array now we
know this is an array but if it's if
this data is coming from an API or a
class that you're using you may not know
that it isn't a right so when I hit
refresh not only do we get array and the
amount of elements in it if you check if
I add maybe something else in here you
can see that we now get two so it's
telling us there are two elements in
this array we get this output not too
readable it's it's not very readable at
this stage if you view the page source
you'll notice that this is readable
because this is a raw interpretation of
this file however because this is an
HTML file it's not taking into account
line breaks so we can remedy this by
actually using pre tags in the front and
then ending that just there so now when
i refresh you see that that maintains
that that structure so now this isn't
too useful because doing this everywhere
in your project that you need to
actually output something and kill the
page isn't very useful so let's create a
function this function could go anywhere
it could go in an initialization file
your functions file something like that
and I'm gonna call this DD just for sure
it stands for die and dump so I'm gonna
accept a variable into this now what I
want to do is I want to cut this and I
want to paste that into there and then I
want to use the die or exit whichever
you prefer
and just pop that in there so now what's
going to happen is when we want to find
out the contents of a variable and just
kill the rest of the page and
why we obviously you might be doing this
in a control or a model or at the top of
a view or something like that I'm
basically just gonna run the DD function
and I'm gonna pass in what I want to die
and dump and then we just changed this
too far and there we go so with a small
function we've given the ability to kill
the page and output something in a human
friendly way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
