within chrome developer tools is the
network tab and this is useful for quite
a few reasons and we're going to take a
look at a few of probably the most used
in in this part so you can see that we
have a few requests just here but we'll
skip this and just pop over to our text
editor and just see what we're doing
within here first of all so the first
thing is I'm loading in jQuery from
Google hosted libraries so that's the
first request that we're making to
another file the second is we're making
a request to our app j/s file stored in
the jas directory which you can see here
is making an ajax request using jQuery
to use as PHP users dot PHP is just a
JSON file it has a list of users just
here so we've got three users and we
just JSON encoding that data and sending
it through or echoing out rather so when
we go ahead and refresh a page or hit a
page initially what we get up in the
network tab is every request that's made
to each of the files and we can see
different statuses here different types
at the size the time it took and we have
this timeline here as well which can be
quite useful so the first thing we're
going to look at is this one just here
so if we click on this we get a little
bit more information about this just on
the side so this is basically just a
request to this URL so the file that
we're serving is obviously index dot
HTML just here so when we see this under
the headers tab we get lots of
information with all the headers that
are being sent with this request so for
example the remote address which is the
address that I'm accessing this on so
it's local host on port 8000 the exact
request URL the request method which is
obviously get but this could be post if
it's an ajax request and we also get the
status code as well so if you have an
error you might
500 error here you can automatically see
that there's been a problem and you can
go ahead and fix up whatever has
happened you might see a 404 here if the
file can be found or the page can be
found
etc and you've also got the response
headers as well so these are being sent
by the server so the server type the
date last modified transfer encoding etc
so this can be quite useful if you are
diving into this for whatever reason now
we've also got the request headers so
for example any data we send along will
be included here and we'll be looking at
that in just a moment as well but apart
from that you have all of the standards
so the accepted encoding the accepted
language the cache control things that
you might need in the future so what
we're going to do now is just take a
look at a couple of these other files
and see what we can find out from these
so for example this jQuery file is being
served by Google hosted libraries so
it's an external file as being requested
from this URL here and we have a 304 not
modified this basically means that it's
been cached it hasn't been modified so
we don't need to redownload it so three
or four that's basically what that is
and we have all the other information
here that we've just took spoken about
the same kind of thing goes for the apt
Jas file again it's pretty standard but
what we really want to focus on is this
users dot PHP file here so remember we
are making an ajax request to users dot
PHP it will be the get type by default
this in fact should be get or post and
then we could have something like data
type JSON which is the type we expect
back but you can kind of ignore this so
this is the type of request if we just
refresh again and click on this you can
see that we have a request method of get
we get 200 because that file was found
and it was served ok and again we get
the response headers etc etc now the
reason this is useful we are making an
ajax request so we could even fill
filter it by xhr requests which will
filter all of your Ajax requests things
like that so we can see these this list
of things in here so if you are making a
lot of Ajax requests you can filter it
that's really nice so there are all
these filters here so for example
scripts we know that these two script
styles we don't have any attached images
if you do have any and you've got things
like media fonts documents web sockets
all of which are useful if you are
filtering but let's take a look at
actually sending some data through to
users PHP and see what kind of thing we
can pick up from this so in apt Jas
let's go ahead and define some data in
here so let's just say blah one we'll
just use that as an example and let's
refresh click on this you can see that
that's being sent as a get request it's
in the URL is in the query string and we
can actually see this being sent through
if we just scroll down here we have this
new query string parameters section and
we see blah one now that's all well and
good because we can see it being sent
here so this is pretty obvious but if it
was a type of post then it's less
obvious because we can't see it in the
query string it's being sent via post
data but still we see form data here and
we see blob one so if you are having
trouble debugging data that is sent
through to this file then this makes it
really easy to see now let's just switch
back to all and let's go over to app J s
now let's look at some of these other
tabs so let's look at preview here all
this does is it gives you the contents
of that file it's just a JavaScript file
and your server being served so we can
see the the code for this just here but
more interestingly when we head over to
something like users PHP we get a
preview of the data that we get back so
this is just a JSON string here but what
the chrome developer tools will do is it
will put this into an object for you
that you can actually examine so here we
obviously have a name which has a value
you have a user name which has a value
and the same for these two records as
well so this means
that as a JavaScript object we can
actually just look through this so you
can see the name property there when we
go to this one we can see the name in
the user name property in the same with
this as well this is really useful to
actually take a look at and what we'll
also be looking at in this series is the
console which we'll be working with this
data as well so we can see what we can
output within the consoles we'll learn
about that in a bit so we also have
things like response data so this is
just literally the raw data and we also
have the timing as well so it will give
you all of the timing statistics for
this how long it took
etc etc so it's pretty straightforward
and really just to examine any fast
you're using whether it's Styles images
or probably more useful to add Ajax
requests you can go ahead and examine
all of this and it just makes life a lot
easier when you are doing this imagine
now not having chrome developer tools
open you don't really know what's going
on on the page so you can't debug
anything so having this open makes it
really really easy to go ahead and just
work with any of these files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
