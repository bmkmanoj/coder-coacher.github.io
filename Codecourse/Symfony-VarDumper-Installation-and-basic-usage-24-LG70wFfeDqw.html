completely fresh far we're not working
with any framework at this point just in
case you're not working with slim 3 and
we can look at how to get this installed
and how to use it and then in the next
part we're going to look at changing the
default styles I'm also going to demo
how this works on PHP's command-line
interface as well so to go ahead and get
started with this we need to pull this
down with composer so I'm going to go
ahead and do a composer require on of
course symphony and we pull in the VAR
dumper component and just wait for this
to finish okay so that's finished
installing and literally just by doing
this if we go ahead and require in our
composure autoloader we actually already
have access now to this dump function we
just go ahead and have a look inside a
vendor inside of symphony and via dumper
you can see that just over here inside
of resources inside of functions we have
this dump function just inside of here
and all this is doing is using the
Varden per class which just sits inside
of here and it's using these static dump
methods if we just open this up to have
a little look you can see that that is
just there now we're going to look at
slightly more advanced things in the
next part how to modify and change
things around but for now we can just
test this out very quickly but maybe
creating a user class where the single
property on so we could just say
username here and go ahead and set that
to anything but of course this really
helps when you're working with much more
complex objects or arrays anything like
that so what we can now do is just new
upper user just to kind of test this out
and let's go ahead and do a dump on user
and see exactly what we get and this
just works anywhere within your project
this is kind of global now so you can
just use it anywhere at all within any
project so let's go ahead and give this
a refresh and you can see here we have
our user object and we have our user
name property in there and if we had
anything more complex in here let's just
go ahead and define our right just as a
kind of quick example this will show up
as well very very nicely you can see
that we can just open this and close it
and it works really nicely now at the
moment the color scheme isn't
all that attractive so what we're going
to do is jump over to the next part and
we're going to look at how we can
basically set the handler for when we
call this function and then go ahead and
start to play around with some of the
styles and also look at the command line
interface as well and see how this
interacts when you may be developing
command line apps or just going ahead
and dumping something on the command
line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
