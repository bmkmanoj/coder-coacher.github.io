easy as just passing the errors that we
get from here through to a view but what
we're actually doing here is we are
redirecting so I want to do is set up
some middleware that will hold all of
the errors that occurred and then we can
pass them through as a global to our
view now again that might sound
confusing and the initial setup for our
middleware might be something new but
don't worry as long as we get this right
it will save us a lot of time in the
future all we'll have to do is this and
then we can forget about doing anything
else so we want to start to set up
middleware so we'll close these off and
just tackle that first of all so of
course again we're going to structure
this inside of our app folder so we're
going to create a middleware directory
now the middleware that we're going to
be using is going to use our container
if you're not sure what middleware is
it's essentially just each layer going
through to the point where your
application boots up so think of it as
someone comes in at the very outer shell
we cycle through each middleware layer
we check things we do things we set
things up we do whatever we need to do
then we get to the core of our
application now the reason that we're
using middleware for our errors is
because we need to send them through to
all views and it makes sense to place
this into middleware so even if this is
slightly confusing at first we will see
how it all comes together in the end
so let's just set up our base middleware
all this will allow us to do is create
subclasses under this which will allow
us to have access to our container much
like we did without base controller so
this then is just called middleware
so we want to namespace this under app
middleware and of course this is just
middleware base middleware so here we're
gonna have our container we're going to
have our constructor this is going to
take in our container
and it's going to just set it that is
all we need to do for our base
middleware simple as that
now what we can do is any new middleware
we create we can extend this base
middleware and when we actually attach
middleware we'll have this available
because we'll pass how container through
to it so let's set up our validation
errors middleware really straightforward
just validation errors middleware of
course there are loads of ways you can
structure this but I'll just be pretty
explicit here so let's just grab the
namespace form over here paste that in
and of course this class is called
validation errors middleware and of
course it extends our base middleware so
now what we need to do in here for all
slim middleware we have an invoke magic
method so into here we have our request
past we have our response past and we
have the next callable middleware and
it's important that we call the next
middleware because it needs to cycle
through from the outside of our
application much like an onion into the
core so let's just do a var dump and
just say middleware just so we can see
that this works when we attach it to
slim so to actually get this middleware
into slim we need to add it on our
bootstrap part of our application so
just at the bottom here will do just
fine
so here we say app add and then we
choose the middleware we want to add now
in this case it's app middleware and
it's validation errors middleware now
remember because we're extending our
base middleware we need to pass our
container in and that is pretty much it
so now if we actually refresh this page
we see the string middleware just up
there so we've gone error here because
the middleware must return instance of
response interface all this means is
that we need to return down here the
next callable middleware so all we do is
we say response and
is next to the next middleware we passed
the current state of the request the
current response and we return that
response we just do this as standard in
all middleware so this is before the
state is changed and this is after the
state has changed so when i refresh it
works as normal but we see this cold at
some point in our application so of
course we don't want to bar dump here
what we want to do is attach our errors
that we got from our validation so if we
open up our validator we want to attach
all of these errors to all of our views
or we want to add them as Global's so
how do we do this well a really simple
way to do this would be when you do
validate we set them into a session here
and then inside of our middleware we
take that session and we set it into our
views so what we're doing is just
persisting that data so for our errors
here we're just going to say session
errors and of course you can call this
whatever you want errors may be a bit
vague and we just say this errors simple
as that so now that we've done this over
here we want to take them errors and
then place them into our views so to do
this we know that we have access to our
container within here so we just say
this container view we use the get
environment method let's just fix this
up and then we say add global so this
will just take two parameters first is
the name so this in this case we'll just
call it errors and the second is the
actual value so in this case it's
session errors so remember we are taking
the errors caused by the last set of
validation setting it into our session
and then within here we're attaching it
to all of our views or at least the view
that we're rendering now this is really
important we want to unset this
afterwards because we no longer need it
we don't need to keep this in the
session so we get rid of it and then by
the time we have got down to the core of
our application this will still be
available because it will be of
a global inside of our views so let's
just test this out and see how this
looks on our signup page so somewhere
around here doesn't really matter where
we can just output this like so so we
can say errors and then we can say JSON
encode like so so this will just dump it
out for us so we can see what we're
working with so now we can see null when
I submit it you can see we now have an
object of all of our errors perfect so
we haven't needed to touch our
authentication controllers at all we
haven't had to go through and send that
stuff to review and do all that stuff
and it just saves us so much time this
is all now set up for you to just output
errors you don't need to do anything
else you just need to validate and
redirect the user back if validation
failed so now we can actually use this
errors variable that's within our view
to actually output the errors simple as
that so to actually do this then we of
course need to check each of these and
see if they have errored now on our form
group class just here we have the option
to pass and have a has error again this
is just part of the bootstrap framework
so let's just mock this out so you can
see here that we've got now got a red
outline around here perfect and what we
can also do is down here we can output
some help text and this is in the form
of a class called help block and this
could be a span makes more sense
so in here we'll go our error message so
now we have the following so this is
kind of what we want it to look like so
we want to get it to this state but of
course at the moment we have everything
hard-coded so first of all the check to
actually add this in here well it's
pretty straightforward we just need to
do a ternary and all we do is we say if
errors email so we don't even if st.
Munks we're doing a ternary if that's
the case and that does have data we can
say has error otherwise just an empty
string and we've put a space here that's
really important because we've missed
out the space just here so now when we
hit submit
that goes red we just need to output the
error now so in here of course this
needs to be wrapped in some kind of
conditional so we use a twig if
statement and we say if errors email
down here we end that if statements end
if we can indent this and here we want
to output the first error message now of
course you could cycle through these but
it's usually only helpful to output the
first error message so we can say errors
dot email and then we can use the first
filter within twig so all that will do
is it will grab the first element of
this here simple as that what we can now
do is hit sign up and we get our error
we get that outlined in red and this
looks good so now we can do the same
thing for these two and now we have our
validation set up so let's just copy
this over here paste it in this form
group for our name and of course this is
checking errors name and of course we
can take this block here as well paste
this down here so if it errors dot name
then we want to output the first error
from that we can do exactly the same
thing for the password as well down here
errors dot password and then we can do
that block again really straightforward
so errors the password errors dot
password so now let me submit there we
go so we've got all of our errors in
there so let's just check this out let's
say we enter a perfectly valid email
address and we enter a wrong name and we
enter a normal password so here's his
name must contain only letters eh-2-zed
so we've got rid of the first error but
we now have an incorrect name I've also
just noticed that we're not validating
that this is a valid email so let's just
go back and add this in if you haven't
already so into our off controller
course our email must be a valid email
so let's check this out and of course my
front end validation is getting in the
way so just to get by this I'm just
going to change this type to text and go
ahead and submit the form again there
email must be a valid email so that is
how simple it is to set up our error
messages so all we need to do now is
remember to check for the validation
failed redirect back and our middleware
will handle the rest
now of course really importantly we need
to be able to show old input in the
forum so if I am going and I'm entering
my details and then for some reason I
enter one field incorrectly we see that
we lose these two others we probably
don't want to persist the password but
we at least want to persist the email
and name so we're going to tackle that
in the next part once again with some
middleware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
