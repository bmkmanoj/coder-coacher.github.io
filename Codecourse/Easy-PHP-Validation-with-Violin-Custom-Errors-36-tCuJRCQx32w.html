are going to look at just changing these
error messages and we're going to do
this in one of three ways the first
thing we're going to look at is adding a
rollup message so any required rule out
/ in terms of an error will have the
value that you give this so this just
means that we can say something like V
add rule message the first argument of
this method is the rule that you want to
change the message for and the second is
the actual message so we could say
something like you better fill in the X
field so the reason I've left X here is
because we can actually use placeholders
here to replace the field name so i can
just type in field here surrounded in
curly brackets and then when we see a
required message we see that change to
you better fill in the username field
and obviously if it was a password field
this would say password so the next
thing we're going to look at is adding a
field message which basically allows you
to specify for a particular field and on
a particular error what message you want
to see and this provides you greater
flexibility because sometimes you don't
want to apply the same error to a
required field so for example we could
do something like add field message for
the user name when the user name is
required we want to say you need a
username to sign up now this is a very
specific error because it means that for
the username that we provide this is
talking about signing up so we're saying
that the username is required for
signing up you can obviously change
these around to use placeholders if you
want to but generally these two methods
coupled together just provide you extra
flexibility when you are outputting
error messages so the next thing I want
to look at is using field aliases so
this allows you to
provide an alias for each of your field
names so for example say we were quite
happy with just the way these errors
looked but we just wanted to update the
user name the email the password confirm
and password fields now instead of
adding custom rules we can use aliases
here so we can use a pipe symbol and
then we can give the alias for this
field so I'm just going to add pipe
symbols here and just say I want this to
be email I want this to be password and
then password confirm which is probably
where the alias fits in best here i'm
going to say password confirmation so
all this is going to do is when we
refresh username is required username
must be a minimum of three email and
password confirmation must match
password so now that we know how to use
violin its basic form next we're going
to look at a real world example of using
this to validate a form and we'll then
also look at how we can output errors in
a sensible way within that form when the
user submits the page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
