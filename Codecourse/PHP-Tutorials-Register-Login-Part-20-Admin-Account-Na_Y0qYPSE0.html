we're going to give ourselves the
ability to set particular users to be
admins or not so this is relatively
straightforward with the way that we've
already got this system set up so it's
not going to take long to do at all and
essentially we're just going to put a
flag next to a user's account to let us
know if they're an admin but we're also
going to make this so in the future we
can maybe add different user types so
you might have know some kind of
moderate or admin or you know different
levels of ability to do things so the
first step to do is is add a field in
our database table in our users database
table that essentially feeds back the
the users type so by default this will
be 0 and then perhaps an admin will be
one and then something else will be two
so let's go ahead and modify our
database table so I'm on the structure
tab here let's go ahead and add one
column at the end of this table and I'm
going to go ahead and call this type now
I'm going to keep it as an int and I'm
going to set the length to one I'm also
going to set the default the default
value to zero so let's go ahead and save
that and let's see how that looks in our
with our two users that we already have
registered
we've got type set to zero perfect so at
the moment both of these users are just
normal users blah blah blah so now let's
go ahead and create a page that we want
to only allow an admin to access which
will be a user of type 1 so let's go
ahead and open up let's say contact PHP
let's go ahead and copy the contents of
this and save it as admin dot PHP so we
can use that well this is obviously just
our out sort of base template let's go
ahead and change some of the details
here
okay so this is our admin page now at
the moment is obviously accessible by
everyone so here what we want is we
first of all want the user to be logged
in that's easy
all we do is we add protect page here so
when i refresh sorry you need to be
logged in to do that now we login now
when I go ahead and access admin now it
lets me but I am NOT an admin I am of
user type 0 now how can we quickly and
easily grab this user type from our user
and determine which type of user they
are well in init dot PHP we have this
user data function which we've already
seen a fair few times and we can just
add fields of data that we want to
retrieve so if I say retrieve type this
will then retrieve the type so if we
just go down here somewhere and just
echo use a data type then this will just
output a 0 at the top here and then when
we change that that will be reflected
here and it will change to a 1 so what
do we need to do now well let's go over
to general dot PHP we've got this logged
in redirect function and protect page
we're already using protect page which
is good but now we want another function
to kick a user away from a page if
they're not an admin ok so I'm going to
say function admin underscore protect so
this is pretty much going to come after
protect page because we want to be able
to be logged in to obviously be an admin
so we're going to use protect page and
underneath this we're going to call this
admin admin protect I suppose it
would've been best call it protect admin
but I think admin protects sounds better
so here what we do is we say if
now we don't need to check the users
logged in explored using protect page we
want to say user data type is equal to
zero or what do we want to do well we
want to kick them away from this page so
I'm just going to send them to index dot
PHP and then just exit there so when I
click on this now undefined variable
user data okay that's fair enough that's
because we don't have the user data
variable and basically global so it can
be used within this function so we can
just use global user data here so now
I'm going to go ahead and refresh now
this is an interesting problem what's
happening here well we would assume this
to be correct because we are accessing
the data type the user data type that
does equal zero so why isn't it
redirecting us to index dot PHP well the
reason being is that I'm using a a type
comparison here as well and this in
actually this is a this is an integer if
I was to do that that would be fine
because we're grabbing data from our
databases returning it as a string so I
just need a double equals it so I'm not
checking type as well
okay so now I'm going to click on that
again and it's redirected us to index
dot PHP so it's not letting us access
admin dot PHP which is good however
let's go ahead and change our rights to
this so I'm going to go ahead and edit
this record and I'm going to change type
to one now you may want to be careful
where because if you want say type 1 2
and type 3 you obviously don't want to
say if it equals 0
you know redirect you might want to have
some kind of switch and determine where
to what to do with the user depending
there's you know there's those different
ways we can do this but it's all about
flexibility really so I've changed my
user type
I'm now going to try and access admin
and is worked so I've accessed admin dot
PHP because I have a user ID or a user
type of one so we can obviously do this
in page as well so for example on the
home page we could go ahead and let's
just open that first of all index so we
could say if user data type is equal to
1 echo admin for example and there we go
and I'm going to go ahead and remove
that that won't be displayed anymore now
this is a well and good but we have to
make this check every single time now
what happens if we change a database
table a database field or something like
that you know or we change different
access codes around it would be a lot
better to create functions based on your
different levels so for example let's go
ahead and close this and we'll keep that
open but we'll open up users here so we
could create a function called is
underscore admin for example and we
could pass through a user ID escape not
escape this data but cast this to an
integer because we know user ID should
always be an integer and then we can
return true or false whether the user is
an admin or not so I could say return my
SQL result I'm going to run a query in
here and I'm going to return account now
if all of this is equal to one then I
want to return true otherwise I want to
return false and the reason being is I'm
going to select the count based on the
user's ID and whether they're type is
set to one so I could say
select count oops user ID from users
where user ID is equal to user ID and
type is equal to one so one is specific
to an admin so is admin if the user ID
has type one so ieave these to match
this will return one then we return true
from the function so now we can actually
go ahead and we can incorporate this
into our admin protect function and we
could say if is admin we could we could
do user data user ID because we're
pulling that in here and then we could
say is this equal to true well if it is
equal to true oh sorry if it is equal to
false then tell them to go away so let's
just go ahead and test this out let me
just go and edit my put here set this to
zero go so that's gone now what I've
removed it but so admin dot PHP I now
can no longer access so this means that
wherever we are on a page we can just go
ahead and say
if is admin and we can pass through
session user ID which is the user ID
here from the session and if that is
equal to true then we can echo admin or
do something else
so this makes it a lot easier if we ever
need to go ahead and change these
conditions in here so I'm not an admin
at the moment but if I was then we'd get
that little admin message up there so
that's basically how to allow you to
allow yourself to determine different
levels of access on a site and we've
looked at a standard user and an admin
and there we go that's it you can play
around with this and give users
different rights create different access
levels as well and create different
functions that return you know something
based on on on whether a user is an
admin or or something else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
