this video we are going to be learning
about the short PHP tags basically what
they are how come how we can enable and
disable them and also we're gonna look
at an example of how we can echo content
out using the short tags and without
using the echo statement so the first
thing really is to look at what these
short tags look like now you may be used
to seeing PHP tags written like this
however you also may have seen them look
like this and you may have come across
the fact that they may not have been
enabled on the server that you're
working on so you may have used short
tags but they have but nothing's worked
inside so for example within short tags
we can do everything that we would
normally be able to to do with the
standard tags they're exactly the same
thing the only downside is that they may
not work on some servers just depending
on how the PHP to ienai far is
configured now I have the PHP dot ini
file open in my text editor and you can
see that there's this option here short
underscore open underscore tag is equal
to on now if this was to off and I were
to save the file and go ahead and
restart my server then the short open
tag would not be enabled and therefore I
wouldn't be able to use them and then we
wouldn't be able to utilize the benefit
of what we're just about to look at and
I'm going to show you a really not a
really good example but an example of
how we can use these and how we can use
a slightly modified syntax to echo out
variables and a much cleaner way of
doing it as well providing these tags
are on so assuming they are on we've
already looked at the way that we can
use them but now in page dot PHP I have
created a very very basic markup
document without the body so I'll just
go ahead and add that in now now we have
a page title here what we're going to be
doing in this part of the tutorial is
we're going to be up here creating a
variable called title which will
represent the name of the page - dot PHP
and it will have an upper case for the
first character so whatever page were on
for example if it was tutorials doc PHP
or download
your friends dot php' that the page name
would always be an uppercase for example
four friends it would be an uppercase F
so if you have no idea what I'm talking
about I'll go ahead and start writing
this out so I'm going to go ahead and
open PHP tags and I'm going to create a
variable called title now the reason I'm
showing you this I'm going the long way
around it but what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be injecting
this title into here but in a more in a
cleaner way with better syntax so this
is really just a sort of treat of how to
do this so the first thing that we want
to do is set title to underscore
underscore file now this represents the
the current file that we're working with
and the path to it so if I open my
browser now and head over to page dot
PHP you'll see oh oh no because we're
not outputting it so if we were to go
ahead here and I don't know let's do it
here okay title you'll see that we've
got this here so this is the path and
the file that we're working with now
what we're going to be doing is we're
going to be using the the base name
function so we're gonna wrap the
function here base name around this file
and what's going to happen now is we're
going to get something like this page
dot PHP perfect so now what we want to
do is get rid of this PHP extension so
we can pass an additional parameter to
this base name function and that will
remove this extension so if we go ahead
and look at this now we've just got page
now what what can we do with page well
we want to go ahead and use the you see
first function to convert the first
character to uppercase like that so
whatever this page name is we've now got
a representation of it here that we can
use within a title now I want to inject
that into here so I could go PHP echo
title and this is fair enough but we if
we're doing this a lot down our page for
example if we're working with into HTML
tables or we're working with lots of
data within loops and we want to break
out of HTML back into PHP it's really
annoying to have to go ahead and use
echo every single time now providing
that we have the short tags enabled we
can go ahead and remove
PHP part here and we can remove the echo
construct and we can actually stick an
equals just in here get rid of this end
of line Terminator because we're
obviously just wrapping this within
these tags we don't need the end of line
Terminator so there we go and this is
going to do exactly the same thing so
what's going to happen now if you keep
an eye on just up here this will change
to this value in fact let's go ahead and
just get rid of the echo there and
refresh so now we've got this page just
here now obviously this part of it is
irrelevant that this part makes a lot
more sense to do everything like this
now we don't just have to use variables
here we can use anything we can use a
return value from a function for example
we could even use the ternary operator
to determine what to output so for
example traditionally I mean you could
use the ternary operator here but
traditionally you might say if 1 is
equal to 1 echo title that might be the
way that you're used to doing it and
that's perfectly acceptable it's a an
inline if statement essentially and it
has a block here in echo as the title so
in this case when i refresh we've got
page here however when we have one equal
to 0 for example and I refresh
we've not got anything there well we've
just got the the browser default title
that it sets it to so in this case what
we can actually do is we can go ahead
and remove this which is unnecessary and
we can go ahead and we can create a
ternary operation here now what this is
doing is the condition is within here so
1 is equal to 1 if 1 is equal to 1 title
no need for echo and then other sorry
when you just need to stick in equals
there now otherwise we could just say
something like ever for example so now
when I go ahead and refresh we've got
page so that part of its work the
ternary operation here up while the
condition here sorry has returned true
so executing this part here outputting
this part and otherwise we're going to
output error so if 1 is equal to 0 and I
go ahead and refresh we get
so really this has taken a lot longer
than than you know normal to demonstrate
just such a simple concept but you know
it's important to include examples like
this when you're learning about things
like this and how them how they might
make sense now there is a drawback to
using the short tags and is the only one
that I could think of and that's if you
are developing like this and using the
short tags perfectly acceptable what
happens if you go ahead and you transfer
your entire project where this might be
used under a thousand times and you
transfer to a server where one you may
not be able to modify the php.ini file
and - well that's it then
you know the the short and the short
open tag option might be set to OFF and
you may not be able to change this in
this case the short hand tags would not
work and therefore this line here just
wouldn't work so that's something to
bear in mind but for such simplicity if
you know that you're going to be
uploading to a server that allows you to
use this the PHP short open tags then
it's really worthwhile investing time in
you know getting used to using this kind
of syntax it's a lot shorter it's a lot
sharper and it can save you a lot of
time particularly if you're embedding a
lot of PHP within HTML</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
