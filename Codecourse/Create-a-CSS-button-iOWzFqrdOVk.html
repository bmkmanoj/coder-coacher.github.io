some CSS buttons that work perfectly
cross browser allow you to modify them
in a nice way so you'd have to write too
much code and we're also going to look
at not just styling anchor elements
we're going to look at styling button
and input elements as well so you can
see here that we've got a few sizes so
we have size changes as well based on
which class you give it so very very
easy to change the size of the button
makes it really really quick when you're
actually developing using the buttons as
well so we're the top ones here at all
anchors so that all a elements we can go
ahead and click on these and these will
go through to the href nothing at the
moment to hash the other ones here
you'll notice that they're all exactly
identical our input types of submit and
the ones down here are buttons so
whichever sort of you know method you
use to or want to use these this stars
on you know they're available not only
that like I said they work cross browser
so I'm previewing this in so I ate and
these look the same the only difference
is that we don't have the border radius
because the border radius property isn't
supported and Explorer eight and also
Firefox as well so we'll be checking
cross browser as we go which is
extremely important I've also got this
sort of subtle hover effect but really
the color of the buttons is entirely up
to you at the moment this is just button
primary so button primary dictates this
color here in this hover color however
if you wanted to have secondary color or
wanted to have you know any other color
you can go ahead and create a class
really really quickly and then go ahead
and give it the size so they're the
buttons will go ahead and actually get
started on building them so the first
thing that we're looking at now is the
basic markup of the page now what I'm
going to go ahead and do is just open up
the directory structure for this we'll
take a look inside so we've got an
index.html file here and we've got a CSS
file which just contains main dot CSS so
as long as you've got these two files
created we can go ahead
Crouse Styles load our stylesheet in you
see we've just got a basic html5 markup
structure with a the CSS file here
basically just LinkedIn as a stylesheet
that's all we need to do we'll go ahead
and write the mark-up in the body or
style it in main dot CSS and we'll
preview it as we go let's hop over to
main dot CSS because the first thing we
want to do is dictate the font for the
page and this will be applied to body
input and button now the reason that we
do this is because if we apply something
to the body we might not get the Styles
chosen for the input and button fields
so we want to keep a font consistent
through our page and anchors our inline
elements that just act as text so they
will be picked up by this body selector
so we're going to create a selector body
input and button we'll go ahead and
create our block for this you can go
ahead and just write this like this it's
entirely you know preference but I like
to separate these into multiple lines
and we're going to go ahead and we're
going to use the font shorthand property
so traditionally what we could do is say
font family and define which font we
want to use but I'm going to use the fun
shorthand property and I'm going to set
the font size of the page to 14 pixels
I'm going to choose trebuchet ms' and
I'm going to do my sort of backup font
if you like as sans-serif so now that
we've done that any elements we add to
the page should be styling this way so
we'll just type hello for now let's head
over to our browser and hit refresh and
we've got this nice crisp clear phone so
now what we want to do is go ahead and
actually start to play around with some
anchors will be styling anchors first
and then we'll move on to change this
for inputs and buttons as well so I
guess the first thing we want to do is
go ahead and create the mark on our page
so we're just create an anchor element
and we'll just type sign up in here just
so we have some text to preview the href
I'm just going to set to hash because
I'm not worried about where this is
going it's purely styling and a class
I'm going to go ahead and choose a class
name
I'm going to call this button so we're
going to create a styles under this
button class which are going to be used
for any button and then we can
subsequently go on to choose which size
we want on which colors we want after
that using additional classes so this
this if you like is the sort of base
class for all of our all of our styles
are sort of generic styles with a button
so at the moment we've literally just
got this link it doesn't do anything so
you know that's fine we you know we just
click on it as normal
well we want to go ahead and make it
look like an actual button let's go
ahead and set some padding on this so
I'm going to set the padding to 8 pixels
16 pixels what this means is it's the
same as writing this it basically means
north east south and west so I'm
basically by removing this saying I want
north and south to be 8 pixels and east
and west or left and right to be 16
pixels I'm also going to go ahead and
display this as an inline block and what
this will do is allow me to use padding
but also have the button inline so you
saw in the initial example that this
button was in line with each other with
with or with everything else so it's an
inline element still so you can see here
that the green area represents the
padding that's 8 pixels north and south
and 16 pixels east and west
so we have our padding we know that's
been applied now what we can go ahead
and do is just sort of tidy this up so
I'm going to choose the text decoration
property and set this to none and what
this will do is simply go ahead and
remove the underline we don't want that
to appear here and the next thing we
want to do is just give this order
radius now this is a little bit
difficult because we won't be able to
see that this is working because we
haven't applied our primary class that
gives it the background color so we'll
go ahead and do this but we'll also go
ahead and give this a temporary
background color we'll just give this a
value of CCC's this is temporary
okay so what we also want to do is I
know that's it for now we will need to
add a few more stars in here later and
that's for the fact that when we go
ahead and use an input button we need to
add some additional properties here but
for now you can see that we've got this
gray background and we've actually have
the shape of our button this looks more
like a nice button now so the next thing
we want to go do is let's go ahead and
and create the button primary class now
what this is going to allow us to do is
choose which style of button we have if
you like so you could have button
primary buttons secondary whatever or
button bright or button dark it's
entirely up to you what you call this
I'm just calling it primary for now
we'll just give it ours
call our primary color for our color
palette on our site so we go down here
and we go ahead and create a new class
this is button primary I'm going to give
this a background slate grey of course
you can choose any color you want here
for the foreground color I'm just going
to choose white and we also want to be
able to change the background color on
hover so for this I'm going to say
background sorry button primary hover
and I'm going to go ahead and change the
background color and this is going to be
background light slate gray so we're
changing it from slate grey to light
slate gray on hover and we'll go ahead
and take a look at that now so now we
have our button primary styles you can
see that we've got the button primary
here in our other an element inspector
and we've also got the base styles of
which the background color has been
overwritten by default now you can go
ahead and leave this default in but I'm
going to go ahead and say that I want to
force you know a background color to be
created by one of these I want to
dictate which one should be displayed so
if we get rid of this you can see that's
gone from here and we've got our nice
primary color here and you'll also see
that we've got the hover effect this
goes ever so slightly lighter when we
hover over it
so now that we've got our color and our
basic shape we need to go ahead and
create three additional classes now what
this is going to do is it's going to
allow us to create a tiny button a
medium button or a large button
so we're classing this here as a sort of
normal button we can go one smaller we
can go one bigger and then one bigger
again that's the large so this is fairly
straightforward all we need to do is
create the classes that we want to apply
to this based on you know how big we
want this to be so we want bust and tiny
and what we're going to do is we're
going to go ahead and reduce the font
size to 12 pixels by default it's 14
we're going to go to smaller to twelve
the padding we're also going to reduce
by two so we're going to say six pixels
and 14 pixels again - smaller than what
we have as a default so now what's going
to happen is if we go ahead and we copy
this and paste it above here I'm going
to say button tiny and you'll notice
that that takes on them of them then
styles and makes a tiny button here
perfect so now we want to go ahead and
build a bigger one and then another
bigger one so we want these these other
styles in there and this is so useful
for development because it speeds up you
know development and it also keeps sizes
consistent as well so let's go ahead and
create button medium probably guess this
is going to be 16 because it's too
bigger than the standard I'm also going
to go ahead and do exactly the same
thing with this we're going to make this
10 pixels and we're going to make this
18 pixels so we're going to up every
time and 2 down for tiny and that adds
sort of level of consistency here so go
ahead and copy this again but this time
we'll create this as button medium okay
so now that we've got button medium
let's go ahead and preview this there we
go we've got a larger button here so
let's go ahead and create the large
button that's pretty much the same as
what we've already done we just need to
increment what we already have by 2
again so the font size here will be 18
this will be 12 and this will be
probably guess 20 so that's 4 button
large
so let's go ahead over to our index to
HTML file copy this paste that there and
change this to large there we are so
we've got four different sizes of button
we've got a standard a tiny medium and
large so we now have different sizes
that we can use wherever we want in our
site without having to write the mark-up
again and again and the other you know
Styles again again and again we can just
you know use the classes that we've
already created so let's go ahead and
take a look now what happens when we
instead of doing this use I'm just going
to put a horizontal line there use
inputs so I'm going to go ahead
you know let's say we had a form or
something like that an input type of
submit with a value of sign up a class
of button button primary and we'll just
leave that as a standard size for now so
what happens well you'll notice that it
doesn't quite look right it looks a
little strange
obviously comparing it to this one which
is the standard size it looks like we've
got some sort of if we just zoom in some
sort of border around here we've still
got the border radius that's fine but it
doesn't look quite right
so we need to go ahead and and sort this
out so what we need to do is inside
about CSS we need to add some properties
to the button class as I mentioned
earlier and that is border zero and
margin zero a margin will correct other
mistakes so we can add that in for now
but basically with them with the with a
border set to zero we've now got an
identical looking button to our signup
now we do have one problem still and in
fact let's go ahead and create the rest
of the markup first might make sense to
just compare it to the one at the top
and we can sort of line things up
so that's going to be button tiny and
let's go ahead and duplicate this down
and we'll say button medium so we're
basically looking for consistency here
and we'll say button large okay so now
looking at these next to each other they
look absolutely fine there's no
difference between what we've got here
for inputs which is brilliant however
when we head over to Firefox and refresh
you can see that these are actually
slightly wider so we've got a terrible
inconsistency here with the sizing and
basically there's a pseudo selector that
Firefox called focus in err which
requires the Moors prefix and this will
be allow us to set the border in the
padding to zero so let's go ahead and
take a look at how we implement this so
inside of main dot CSS I'm going to
apply this up here and I'm going to
apply this to input and this is Mars
with the Moz prefix focus in ER so now
I'm going to go ahead and set the border
to zero and the padding to zero so now
when we go ahead to Firefox and refresh
I need to go ahead and like this you can
see that that changes and it changes its
size within basically what this pseudo
selectors doing is it's overriding the
user agent styles for this and the
padding is something like two pixels I
think but basically what we're doing is
we're just overriding that default style
so we'll have to do this for button as
well but let's go ahead and create the
button and see what this does
so let's go ahead and place another HR
here and we'll go ahead and create a
button close that off go ahead and add
our signup text class here so let's just
go ahead and copy its first class copy
this down so that will just be standard
size
this will be button medium and this will
be button large okay so now let's take a
look at what this looks like
well it looks consistent in Chrome
there's no surprise there this looks
absolutely fine however in Firefox it's
slightly bigger so what we need to do is
we need to go ahead and we need to apply
the same pseudo selector for Firefox as
we did with input so we just change this
to button here so using the same pseudo
selector must focus in ER that we'll go
ahead and reset the user-agent stars
that the padding and when we go ahead
and check this out it looks absolutely
fine let's go ahead and have a look at
what this looks like in Internet
Explorer at the moment our is looking a
gap certainly fine the only thing that
we're missing is the radius if we go
ahead and check in later versions as
well so 910 and current this looks fine
as well so we know that that's fine
we've only got one thing left to do
really now and if you notice that when
we hover over each of these anchors we
get this nice hand icon this cursor icon
as it's probably a pointer icon sorry as
it's probably properly called and but
with the other buttons we don't so we've
got an inconsistency here where we just
have a cursor and it doesn't really look
like I can click this it doesn't seem
like I can click it so what we're going
to go ahead and do is just add a few
more stars in under here and this is
just going to be styling these so they
have a cursor when we when we hover over
them so we're going to go ahead and say
input type equals submit so we're using
a attribute selector dot button so we
want to make sure that we're actively
targeting buttons we're not affecting
other styles and we're going to say
button dot button
so we're basically choosing the type
here and then the class on the end here
so now what we're going to go ahead and
do is so cursor:pointer and that's going
to go ahead and fix that issue so let's
go ahead and refresh you can now see
that we get our nice point our hand icon
when we hover over
that actually is probably one last thing
when I click on anchors we you know we
just redirect to the href in this case
it's hash however when we click on
buttons or inputs we get this horrible
blue border around it now this can be
left or enhanced glow or something like
that but if we want to go ahead and
remove it we can place this under these
styles and we can just say outline:none
so if we go ahead and refresh we now
don't get this when we click on them so
we've successfully built a set of CSS
buttons with a color class a button
primary which you can go ahead and
extend and also we've built different
sizes which again you could go and
extend make extra large or extra tiny
buttons and these work cross-browser as
well and consistent as well through the
different elements that we've applied
the classes to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
