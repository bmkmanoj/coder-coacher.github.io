available properties that editor Comfort
gives us to all of the files inside of
the directory and sub directories that
we're working in as we saw in the last
part we'll be looking at the most used
and probably most useful properties and
the obviously the full list can be found
on the official website now we've
already seen the directory structure
that I have let's go ahead and create a
new file and we'll save this with a dot
editor extension and that's it
dot editor config hit save and there it
is now we want to define that this is
the topmost editor config file by
setting route to true for now I want to
target all files in this root directory
and sub directories so I'm just going to
apply the Asterix selector within square
brackets and we'll look at different
selectors in the next part let's first
of all set the character encoding so you
use char set and I'm going to set this
to utf-8 we'll set our indent style as
well and I want this to be a space we
can also though choose tab so now I want
to set the indent size obviously this
can be anything you want but I'm going
to choose two so when I go down to a new
line or anything like that it will
indent this by two spaces by default and
I want trailing whitespace to be trimmed
as it's messy and it's going to lead to
larger file sizes so setting the trim
trailing whitespace property to true
will combat this now I also want to
insert a final new line so I set this to
true as well so now that we've got the
plugin for sublime installed we can now
choose to maybe open global dot CSS and
test this out so let's make sure that
all of these properties that we've
created
I've actually worked so I'm going to
define a class here and when I create my
curly brackets and hit enter this should
automatically indent by two and you can
see that if I go back that's
automatically invented by two now I've
just saved my file and that's trimmed
the trailing space here because this
wasn't actually needed so that we know
that that property is working as well
and we also you may not have noticed see
that we have a final line inserted or
final newline inserted and that's it
we've applied a select set of properties
to all files that sit within this and
under the root directory and as long as
this editor config file stays in this
project anyone using a text editor with
this plug-in installed will have these
rules automatically applied it's
important to note however that not all
properties will work for every plugin so
make sure you check the support
specifically beforehand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
