repose is often shortened to well it's
basically a place where your code sits
now for every project or website that
you create you'd go ahead and create a
new repository so to create a repository
on github
I can either head over to my repository
tab and hit this new button or I can
choose create new from the top the first
thing they would do is choose a name for
our project in this case we'll call it
hello world since we're only creating an
example here you want to name this
something that directly relates to your
project so it's easily recognizable by
yourself and other people the
description is optional however
particularly for public projects a
description is helpful to sum up what
your project is in a couple of lines so
I'm just going to write a hello world
project next we choose whether the repo
should be public or private now if it's
public anyone will be able to discover
it so make sure you're not storing
sensitive information on this repo like
private keys or passwords will be
looking later and how to ignore certain
files within your project so you can
only see them when you're developing and
this basically means that even if you're
using sensitive information within your
project you can still open-source it and
have it private a public obviously if
it's private no one is going to be able
to see it be on github you do have to
pay for this option now let's initialize
this repository with a readme far more
look more about project readme later
part in the series now once we create
the repository we're done this is your
repository and you can start pushing
fast to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
