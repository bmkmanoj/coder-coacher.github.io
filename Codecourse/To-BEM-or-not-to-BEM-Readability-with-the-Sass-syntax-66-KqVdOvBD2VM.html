syntax now and see how we can make this
look even better so step one I'm just
going to cancel watching any changes and
I'm going to rename my files to have a
sass extension so let's change the
mixings file
let's change our app file and let's
change our list as well
so before we restart the watch process
will update the syntax and then we'll go
ahead and start to compile this so we
can leave app dot sass out of this and
we can focus on mix-ins and our list
module so for our mix-ins we obviously
need to make a few changes here we can
define this using an equal sign now
rather than the app extend and of course
what we can do is we can get rid of all
of our curly braces so we'll just get
rid of them and as long as we're
indenting properly this will work as
normal so this isn't what we really want
to make them tidy out it's more like the
list so first things first get rid of
your curly braces so that's great
and now all we need to do is say plus E
so like this so how clean does this look
we've got a list we've got a list item
which is an element again if these were
called element I might look a little bit
nicer
so modifier in fact let's go ahead and
change these here as well you could of
course create another mixing and
reference the longer name if you wanted
to so you could switch between them so
now we have this nice clean syntax we
know our list stars we know our element
stars and we know any modifiers and of
course if you want to apply a modifier
to our list you can do plus modifier and
then you could go ahead and define that
in there as well so really nice and
clean and we should be ready to go now
so let's restart the watch process but
this time with the sass extension and we
shouldn't see any errors and of course
we do need to update all of our Styles
to not include semicolons I'm not
massively used to this so
a little bit tricky so there we go so
let's go and well we're already watching
and we should be good to go we can see
that this works exactly the same way
so we've now seen how we can use this
with sass and we've now drilled down
into the most basic form of using BEM
using our mix-ins to define out our
styles and this now we can use anywhere
and it just works perfectly and it looks
really neat and tidy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
