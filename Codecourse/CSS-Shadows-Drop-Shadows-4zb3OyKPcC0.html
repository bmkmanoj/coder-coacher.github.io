looking at applying a drop shadow to an
image on our page now a drop shadow is
basically a way of creating a glow
around an image and you don't need to
have a circular image like we have here
it can be any kind of image but
basically the drop shadow will apply a
glow or an effect to the non transparent
parts of your image now to do this we're
going to be using a CSS filter our CSS
filters basically ways of affecting an
element before it's displayed and the
commonly used to adjust the rendering of
an image the background or border of
element on your page there's many ways
you can use them the very interesting in
you can create some cool effects but
drop shadows effects I'm going to be
looking at in this video
one thing to note is that they're not
very widely supported CSS filters our
new feature and they'll only really be
working at the moment in WebKit browsers
say your latest Chrome and Safari
browsers so let's look at some code for
this I'm going to start with a basic
html5 structure like this and with a
nice link to a stylesheet here and in
the body tags I'm going to create a div
which is going to be the container for
our image and so I'm going to give that
a class of container inside that I'm
going to create an image tag and the
source of the tag is going to be 50 PNG
now 50 dot PNG is a file that is in the
same directory as my HTML and CSS files
and it's basically a trans the
transparent image so football with the
transparent background and it's key to
have a transparent background for an
image I'm to use the drop shadow filter
because without that transparent
background the filter won't work at all
and then going to apply a width of 250
pixels and height
of 250 as well to the image and there we
go that's all the markup we'll need
let's have a look about on the page
there we are just got the image loaded
in with no effects on it so far so let's
look at some CSS for this first of all
I'm going to provide just a gray
background to the page and remove any
default margin I'm then going to targets
the the then going to target the div
with class container add a bit of
padding to it add a black background so
that we can really see the the glow
being applied I'm going to target the
image itself using this selector here
and then we enter apply the filter so
applying the filter first of all I'll
need to add the WebKit prefix because as
I said CSS filters aren't very widely
supported but they'll be supported on
the latest WebKit browsers so there we
are WebKit - filter that applies the
filter to container image now I'm going
to pass to filter the drop shadow
function so drop shadow is a function
rather than a property and the drop
shadow function takes four parameters
the first T ring x and y offset the
shadow so that's the x and y offset from
the non transparent part of the image
the third value is going to be the blur
radius and the fourth value is going to
be the color and if you're familiar with
text shadow or box shadow this order of
values here will be very familiar to you
but you can play around with those and
see what effects you can achieve so
let's now see what that looks like
there we are we've got the the glow
applied and that's all down to the drop
shadow and line that I showed in the CSS
so let's just open up web tools
and have a look at that here's our drop
shadow applied and as I said if you can
play around with this so if I wanted to
move the shadow slightly to the right
I'd give it an X offset about 20 pixels
and you can see that blur moving and you
can do the same thing with the y offset
10 pixels smooth it down keep moving it
down and so on so it's just like another
shadow and the other shadow or box
shadow or text shadow very simple to use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
