anything into our database table
articles yet but what we do need to do
before we do so is add another column
here now we've got a name description
and created that column but this doesn't
give us a unique enough identifier as to
as to the difference between each
records we could have maybe 10,000
records in this table and there's no
single thing that will distinguish it
from the others two articles may in fact
be created exactly the same time that
doesn't mean that they're - that doesn't
mean that they're the same article that
doesn't mean they're two different
articles necessarily so what we need to
do is add another field in here which
you'll commonly find in database tables
and that's a unique field now we're
gonna look at a couple of different
things here as well we're gonna look at
the fact that this is a primary key and
we're also gonna look at the fact this
is an auto incrementing field but first
of all let's check out the syntax of how
we alter this table to actually create a
new column so we use the alter table
syntax then we choose the actual table
that we want to go ahead and change and
this in this case it's just articles so
what we want to do is we want to add a
column so this is part of the my SQL
syntax we want to add a column then we
want to choose the name of the column
that we want to add and in this case I'm
just going to call this ID now I now
need to as when we created the table
actually define the type of field and
this is going to be int now remember in
the last video we looked at the
difference between null and not null and
why this you know why it should be but
now we'll understand why this field
should be not null whereas these are
null so we say not null and the reason
for this is that because this is an auto
increment field it always has to have a
value so by default we will start at 1
so when we create our first record it
will be 1 when we create our second
record I build 2 and this will
automatically happen it's his auto
increment so automatically increment or
automatic increment so we need to
actually define that we want this to be
an auto increment
by saying Auto underscore increment so
now we've done that now because this is
an auto increment it also has to be a
primary key so primary key now this also
just type this correctly primary key so
because it's a primary key this is the
unique identifier for a table so
therefore because it's the primary key
if we had any other tables that
reference this they would always
reference the records by the IDS this is
the primary key of here so we end this
and hit enter and you can see here this
is query okay let's now go ahead and
describe articles then we can now see
that we've got another field in here
which is ID we've got a type of int
which is 11 and character length Orton
are in two digit length
Nullah is now the key is PRI which
stands for primary the default is null
which is fine because it's going to be
required and the extra now says also
increment which means that when we
create a record this field without
specifically defining it will
automatically increment the number so
the first record we create will be one
then the second will be two and so on so
now that we've actually a altered our
table and added a new record as sorry
added a new column we can now go ahead
and start inserting records</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
