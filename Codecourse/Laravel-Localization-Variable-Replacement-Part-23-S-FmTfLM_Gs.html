to create translations but also inject
variables into them and obviously this
is made really easy with laravel let's
look at passing some data from our route
12 view and then including these within
the translations so we've got our view
open here let's head over to our routes
and use width and I'm gonna say username
and set this to Alex so we can now
access this variable in here like this
so over to our translations file will
open the English version here and we'll
just focus on working with the English
not the German in this case I'm just
going to use this as a placeholder so
I'm using a colon and then the name of
the variable that I want to target now
what I can do here is go back to here
supply an array and choose which I want
to replace in this case we've got user
name being passed from the routes let's
just switch this back to trans as well
to keep things nice and short
so we're translating the hello greeting
and at the moment we're set to the
default en locale we're passing in an
array of values we want to replace this
is the name of the placeholder which
will replace this with the value here so
let's take a look at this when i refresh
you can see it says hello Alex
let's pass another variable down to our
view so we'll replace this with an array
we'll pass the user name in and we'll
also pass the weather so now that we've
done that we have access to both of
these in here so in greetings all we
need to do is say hello username it is
weather today
so now inside of home deploy PHP we can
pass in weather to this translation and
the weather that we've passed down to
the view so when i refresh now you see
that's also included in our translation
now this is really useful for longer
sentences where you might need to pop in
unique URLs as well so for example if
you're sending out an email with an
activation link or for a user or
something it saves you having to break
your translations up into very small
pieces which is obviously gonna be
confusing and often won't make sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
