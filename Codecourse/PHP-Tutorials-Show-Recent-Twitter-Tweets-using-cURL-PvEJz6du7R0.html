to show you how to display the last
posts of your from your Twitter account
so I'm just in this example I'm just
going to show you and how to display
this this one this is the example I'm
going to use I'm just displaying this
one here so basically what we're using
is been using a piece of software called
curl which is a client-side piece of
software if you have paid hosting it
might already be installed if you're
running on a local server room might not
already be I'm not sure if it comes with
xampp or anything like that but yeah
curls basically allows you to connect
via different protocols like HTTP FTP
and basically to grab information from
different servers or would like to
communicate with the server if you like
okay so my example page here by the way
I don't have a tutorial and how to
install curl if you need to but if you'd
like I said if you have paid hosting or
even something like xampp or wim p or
anything else then it might be available
but I'll check back on that and maybe
make a tutorial on how to install it
anyway this is the page that the result
of my code yeah I've just basically
displayed the last last post as you can
see here okay so this is the code it's
relatively simple there was some
complicated parts about it but it's very
sure this is the part where the text is
echoed out and obviously it's set as an
array so what we're doing is you can
copy and paste this down to echo out as
many the recent statuses as you like
okay so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to blank this page and then we're
going to start coding
okay so I've blanked the page and you
can see on this page here we've got
nothing I've already refreshed it so
we've got our PHP tags as standard and
we're going to start going so the first
thing we need to do is establish your
username and power
obviously I'm not going to enter my
password in here because that would be
giving out away by I'm going to show you
obviously how to do this so we've got a
username and password variable my
username is obviously PHP academy' and
I'm going to leave this blank for now
but when I come back to it I'm going to
pause the video reenter ur and then
refresh to show show you the result of
it okay so the first thing we need to do
is use the curl init function which is
the Corrine ich heiße function which
we're grabbing the page that we want to
work from so if we call the variable
timeline since we're taking data from
the timeline or from your specific
timeline I'm gonna say curl initialize
and this is a function so we're gonna
have two brackets and inside we're gonna
enter the address so no one expects that
you know this but it's in fact
twitter.com so remember the HTTPS it's a
secure server and that's for slash
statuses and then we're going to go for
slash user underscore timeline Dex and L
okay so that's that done now we've taken
our page we've grabbed the page and we
can work from this from now on
okay now what we're going to do is we're
going to use the curl set up function
set opt function sorry so what this is
going to do is it's just setting
specific options for the page that we
have already connected to so let's say
setup as a function what I'm going to do
is this is then it would be applied to
Timeline so we're applying it to this
initialization here and we need a comma
the first thing we're going to do is
we're going to need to obviously apply
the username and password being a secure
server and needing to login we need to
grab this information so I'm going to
type in capitals curl up underscore user
and then PWD for password it's cut so
it's a user password and then we have
another comma and we're going to type
the user name so we're grabbing the user
name
from here so that's PHP academy' and
what we need to do is concatenate a
colon onto there and then concatenate
the password on to the end of that I
don't actually know why it's in this
structure that's obviously just the
structure that we're using for Twitter
so we need to do another set option and
basically what this is going to do is
just return the transfer that we've
already done funnily enough like to
timeline again and once again we need to
enter our capital text here for the
return transfer and that's just return
transfer okay so that's done and then
we're saying another parameter here as
one not sure why that is either but
there you go that's it this is just the
way car works you need to get used to
how you know the methods that we use and
how it works okay so that's pretty much
done so far all we need to do now is
grab the result so I'm going to say
result in equals curl execute and that's
a function and obviously once again
we're sticking in the timeline there
because that's what because that's what
we're executing okay so I'm gonna reset
the result variable and this is going to
be two new simple xml and that's going
to be of the result so what we're doing
is we're creating the result here using
the curl execute function and taking
that from timeline here
we've already set all our options up
we've connected and we've returned and
now I'm resetting the variable to a
simple XML element and that's taken back
from the result here which is the
resolve this function so pretty
straightforward I'm just reiterating or
re setting that variable okay now all we
need to do is act around the code so I'm
going to say echo result and I'm going
to use this
a - and a greater than sign and then
status and here it is but basically an
array so what we're doing is we're
saying 0 1 2 3 4 depending on which you
want to display and then we're saying
text that's just how we're returning it
okay so this at the moment as it stands
should echo out our correct
come back here should echo this out here
so I'm going to pause the video and
enter my password and I'll meet you back
on the this page here okay so we're back
on this page here into my password I'm
going to refresh the page and nothing
has happened so obviously somewhere I've
made a mistake okay so what I'm going to
do now is go back to the code
we'll see pause the video again and take
out my password first okay so we're back
on the code obviously ever raised my
password and I've I've already noticed
where the problem is I've typed user
user time I am tired and you know it's
just how you get so okay so I've
corrected this error everything else
looks okay to me I can't see anything
else wrong with the code I can't imagine
there would be it's pretty
straightforward I'm going to pause it
again and my password and I'll meet you
back again on the actual page okay so
we're back on the page I haven't tested
it yet but I'm gonna give it a refresh
and there you go we've got my last post
displayed there so now obviously what's
going to happen if you want to display
say the last three or five or ten posts
let me pause the video and go back and
I'll show you okay so we're back on the
code let's okay so all we really need to
do is copy and paste this down let's say
we'll do the last two and then obviously
from there on it's quite straightforward
okay so that's done I'm going to let's
say concatenate a
Lyonne great on the end of this in fact
we'll make it a paragraph break and okay
so we'll go back to the main page and
test this out
and remember like I said this is an
array so obviously what I've done is
I've taken the element inside and gone
from zero to one and this is just going
to take it to the next status I say okay
so we're back on the page that we're
working on and I'm going to refresh and
we should see both tweets come up okay
there we are so you can see that there's
the one at the top that I've shown you
already this one here and then if we
come down you can see this one here it's
been displayed directly underneath it
with a paragraph break like break in
between so obviously going back to talk
about the code if you whatever you want
to display however many tweets you want
to display you just need to copy that
copy and paste that down make sure the
element number inside is obviously
incremented each time depending on how
many you want to display so you'd have 0
1 2 3 4 5 all the way down that copy and
pasted array that's being echoed out for
every tweet you want to display okay so
hopefully hope this was helpful just

lot guys I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
