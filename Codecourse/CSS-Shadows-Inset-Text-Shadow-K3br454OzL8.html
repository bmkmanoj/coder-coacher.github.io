looking at applying a text shadow in
such a way that it creates an inset
looking effect for the text that we
apply it to you so something like this
where we have a headline on a page and
the text looks slightly sunken into the
page rather than giving it a 3d effect
which is what we traditionally expect
from the text shadow property we're
going to be doing this in such a way
that we can reuse the style anywhere on
the site nice and easily just by using a
span and a class on that spam so let's
start writing some code what we'll need
first of all is an HTML template looking
something like this and crucially we'll
have a link to a style sheet which is
where we're going to obviously put our
text shadow property and use that and
the style sheets here is just in the
same directory as the HTML file so let's
start doing some markup we'll need a div
with a class of container just to allow
us to put all the code you'll need for
the headline itself inside this and give
that a bit of formatting so there we are
that's the first thing you'll need then
inside this container we'll just have
our h1 which is going to be the title of
the page but you can have any element
there so a P tag or so on and apply the
start of the PTA and then we'll need
some text say the dark night
then we'll need some text so the dark
knight rises will do nicely and finally
we'll apply a span tag around this text
and basically we'll add the class to the
span tag a class of insert shadow and
that's what will target and apply the
shadow to you and this will allow us to
reuse the shadow where if we really want
to say for example of us to take rises
out of there and put it here then the
shadow would only be applied to the dark
night and not to the word rises so let's
go back to this and see what we get on
the page with that at the moment is just
a basic bit of HTML with no styling so
let's apply some styles so the first
thing I'm going to do is just give the
background a color which is going to be
just a gray color then I'm going to
remove any default styling and any
default margin from the page then i'm
going to start starting up the title
itself give it a font size 5 en give it
a font family of georgia that's what the
styling needed for the h1 and then
finally i'm just going to give the
container a bit of padding just to get
the the headline away from the edge of
the page a little bit so there we go see
that again and there we are we've got
our title in the middle but no shadow
applied to it just yet so let's create
the shadow so you will select the so
we'll select the spam tag using um so
I'll select the spam tagged with the
class of internet shadow using this
selector here and then the first thing
we'll need which is crucial is we're
going to give the text a color of
transparent and what this means is that
we won't actually see any of the text
will only see the shadows
and the reason this works is because
transparent is equivalent to having an
RGB a color where the Alpha value is set
to zero so we literally just see
straight through the text itself as it
isn't there and then we'll need some
text shadows now we need to text shadows
and you can use two shakes take shadows
by commas separating text chalets in the
selector so the first of all I need is a
white text shadow with a slight offset
so I'm going to have a y offset of 1x
offset of one a blur radius of two
pixels and then the color is going to be
rgba 255 255 255 and then I'm gonna
pacity of nor point six so it's going to
be white but we can see through it
slightly and then the next thing we'll
need is actually before I do that let's
save this and see what it looks like on
the page here we here we can see what we
have and it's just a bit of a blur at
the moment and not doesn't quite look
like what we want at all so the crucial
thing to do now is to apply a black box
shadow sorry the crucial thing to do now
is apply black text shadow and we're not
going to give the black text shadow and
offset at all it's going to render
exactly where the color would render and
the reason we're doing this is so that
we can see a very slight amount of the
black text shadow and then all of the
white text shadow and that'll allow us
to create the effect that we're going
for so to summarize before I show this
on the page we have a color of
transparent which means we don't see the
text itself a tool we only see the
shadows we have a white shadow that is
slightly see through so that we can see
some of the background through the
shadow and behind that shadow we have a
black shadow which is just a solid
shadow so let's save that go to the page
refresh and there we are we have our
effect just like what we wanted
and five in the final thing I'm going to
do is remove rises from that span tag
paste outside and go back to the page
just to show you that the shadow is only
going to be applied to the bit inside
the span tag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
