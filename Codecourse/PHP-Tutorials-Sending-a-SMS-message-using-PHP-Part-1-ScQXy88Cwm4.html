be creating a form that allows us to
send an SMS message via PHP through a
gateway to a mobile phone or a cell
phone to do this we're going to first
need to register with a gateway that
allows us to send text messages now what
I mean by this is something like this
website here it's called text local
credit you K with text spell txt now if
you go ahead to text local credit UK and
what you want to do is you want to click
sign up for free follow the registration
process
sign up and once you are registered
you'll be presented with a control panel
such as this now you get ten free
credits which means you're going to be
able to send ten free text messages
after that you will have to buy credits
but they are relatively cheap and you
don't necessarily have to use this
gateway you can choose to register with
another gateway that could allow you to
send more free text messages or might be
a bit cheaper but I've choose to use
text local because it's a really good
value for money and I just found it
easier to register I'm in no way
affiliated with them I just found this
one and it was easy to use okay so I've
got six credits left I've already used
four of them in the testing process
before this tutorial you can see that
you can just automatically click send
messages you're allowed to send a
message directly from the website but
we're going to be using the API that
allows us to send it via PHP now to find
out these settings you need to simply go
to documentation and what you'll be
provided with is a list of variables
that you need to send from this page
here so after this you'll need to send
all these post variables you can use get
variables but I'm going to be using post
you need to add them afterwards now
we're going to be doing this inside PHP
you
in curl and the reason we're using cuz
it's a lot more secure than just
submitting a form with these variables
in which we could well do but obviously
then people are going to find out our
password and use the name things like
that so this is what the form is going
to look like in the first part the
tutorial we're going to be simply
creating the form we're not going to be
doing any of the programming behind in
PHP so we're just going to create in
this form so we know what we're doing so
hopefully so far you understand how this
is going to work obviously if you don't
just keep following the tutorial and you
should get the hang of it so if I go
over to my page here I've just created a
page called SMS PHP now you might notice
that I'm running this on my paid web
hosting the reason I'm doing this is
because curl is currently installed
I don't currently have curl installed on
my local host on the software that I'm
running on my computer so either
download a package such as xampp there
that has curl with it or run it from
your paid hosting but that's the reason
I'm running it from paid hosting now
we're obviously going to need to create
a form so I'm just going to start out
I'm not going to worry about any other
types or anything like that the form
action is going to be itself because
we're going to submit back to this form
and deal with the results in PHP so we
inside our PHP tags so the method here
is going to be post and the first thing
we want it to say let's just save this
quickly and back to there and let's
refresh this
okay so we've got a blank page at the
moment okay so inside here we're going
to need the number so we'll say number
we'll break down the first thing we need
is the area code of the mobile phone in
the UK that's four four so I'm going to
put an input type in here and the type
is text the size is 2 I'm going to put a
dash between that for the rest of the
phone number the name of this is going
to be called number ext for the
extension I'm going to create another
input field and that's going to be text
again and the name of this is number and
that's just going to be regular sized so
I'm not going to alter the size of that
I'm going to come down here and do two
breaks let's just save the changes see
what we've come up with and then we can
get on with the rest of this form let's
cancel that okay so yeah we've got
number and we've got the extension and
the main part of the number there and we
broke down and I'm going to say send up
and this is going to be the text that's
displayed when the user receives the
message so input type equals again text
and the name of this is just from let's
break down a bit more now we need the
message about correctly and this is
going a text area so it's just basic
HTML and the name of this is message
okay now we need to come down here and
we need to put in a submit button and
the name of that is just submit and the
value is going to be
now we need a hidden field that we can
use to check if the form has been
submitted so input type equals hidden
name equals submitted and value equals
true so if we save that and refresh that
yeah again we're coming up with this
message refresh start we see we've got
oops you need to break down there a bit
so after this break down okay so you can
see that we've got the number we can
type four four here that's for the UK we
can type the number that we want to send
the message to here the sender can be
something like PHP academy' and the
message can be whatever you want as long
as it falls in the guidelines of text
messages I think there's probably a
maximum length that you can send but
obviously you can put the form
validation in afterwards obviously this
is a text field but you're going to need
to check this numeric I'm not going to
cover this in this tutorial but I'm
using my other tutorials you should
learn how to do that or you can use the
PHP manual Google for it something like
that okay so we've got our basic form on
clicking send this obviously we'll send
the text message at the moment all it's
done is resubmit to the information back
to this SMS PHP page what we need to do
in the next part of this tutorial is we
need to create some code in this PHP
area that's going to take use of the
api's of txt local using txt local we're
going to sort of submit the varial the
variables that we need that I showed you
just here and these ones just here type
the message things like that we're going
to submit them to this page here and we
need to use our account information to
do that obviously the username and the
password and then that will allow us to
send a message through txt local via PHP
so that will come in the next part of
this tutorial when we learn how to
complete this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
