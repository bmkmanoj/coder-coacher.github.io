method and property you wouldn't think
that there's much left to talk about
well there is the next thing that we're
going to be looking at is reflection
parameter and it will delete all of this
we'll keep this here just in case we
need it
and with this what we need to do is we
need to pass in the class and the method
as an array so we're going to use the
set data method for this because it's
the only one that takes a parameter oops
and then we need to provide the number
of the parameters so because this is the
first parameter it's going to be number
one so let me just check that we didn't
get oh we got an error yeah I suspected
yeah I suspected that the first
parameter would have to be zero so make
sure you don't fall into that pit trap
that I just did
so let's uncomment this and see what we
can do with this we have get name sub
explanatory we have a few of these which
are a little bit confusing looking we
have get class which gives the class of
the e the parameter is array which in
this case well if we type in this two
array because this would be in the right
then we're going to get true its collar
ball so if it's a closure horan on an
anonymous function allows no a get
position is optional let's look at this
one is optional so obviously if we say
echo RP is optional and we point this
out
we didn't say if we're going to get
false because this parameter here isn't
isn't assigned to anything so we have to
pass it in it's obligatory but if we
were to assign this to an empty array
and go back to our browser hit refresh
we get true because this is a optional
parameter so let's remove this and add a
second parameter for autosave so what
this will do it's automatically saved
the user to the database without was
having to call
an additional method and by default this
will be false so if we changed the
number parameter to one and we keep this
here we're gonna get one still if we
changed this to the other parameter
which is the array of data we're going
to get nothing because it isn't optional
again just play around with all of this
it's very useful knowledge to have you
can't really go wrong
it's all very self-explanatory
especially with the docs so do check
those out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
