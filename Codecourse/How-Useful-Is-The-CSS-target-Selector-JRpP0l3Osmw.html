the target selector to highlight
sections of a page and there's a couple
of reasons why we might do this and
really the focus on this video is
looking at the target selector and how
it can be used to add functionality and
rid the need for JavaScript particularly
libraries like jQuery where plugins for
this kind of thing do actually exist but
really they're unnecessary so let's just
imagine a page like this all I have at
the moment is just a header here and
then just two paragraphs of text these
will have IDs on them so if I inspect
this we've got sections here with ID
section 1 and then so and so on until
section 10 so as you'd expect with a
browser you would do a hash and then
section 1 for example and what this
would do is it would place you at the
point of that specific ID so if I do
that you can see it's placed me at that
point so just above the section element
so if I was to do for example section 10
this brings me down to the bull of the
mother page but this is really the
problem the reason that we have this
yellow highlight that you've just seen
anime is because when we want to tell
the user you know say we're linking from
an external site we want to go from some
site to section 10 on our website this
to me looks like it would normally be
section 10 because it's brought me down
to this point on the page and I would
immediately think that this would be
section 10 but in actual fact it isn't
this is section 10 it's just that
obviously the browser can't come down
any further you might have a footer yes
but it might not always be the case so
what we're doing here is without
JavaScript at all we're actually
detecting which ideas been selected and
then we're styling that ID using the CSS
target selector and not only that we're
going to look at doing an animation as
well so we're going to create an
animation which is the flash that you
see here so we'll be looking at CSS
animations so the first thing that we're
going to do on this is generate the
markup I'm using Emmet so this
is gonna make it really really easy to
generate if you don't have em it perhaps
go ahead and install it for your
favorite text editor of the text editor
that you're using and then follow along
the shortcut that I expand out into
markup otherwise it doesn't really
matter you can just sort of watch and
not actually write this code out so
let's jump over to the text editor and
start writing this out and then we'll
look at the CSS side of things okay then
so over in my text editor and i'm gone
much here at the moment just basically
html5 document here and i'm linking in
this main dot CSS stylesheet just here
at the moment this is empty so we're
gonna do things completely from scratch
now what i want to do is generate some
section elements with header ones and a
couple of paragraphs inside and i want
to generate ten of these so i'm using em
it like i said to expand this out it's
really really useful to to use this so
we want some section elements and we
want the IDS of these to be section and
then the number you can also use a hash
here if you don't want to use the
attribute attribute modifier so inside
of these we want to head header ones and
these header ones need to contain some
lorem ipsum so we use the Lipson
generator built-in here and i'm gonna do
these at ten words okay so now what we
want to do is we want to use our well we
want to shift back one element because
we've come inside of here and the next
to the h1 we want say two paragraphs
worth of text and in here we'll put some
more lorem ipsum and let's say 150 this
time so this should expand out nicely to
this markup like I said we've got our
section element here we've got an ID of
section one and that will be the same
for section two section three that's
where the dollar sign replaced it we've
then got an h1 and two paragraphs here
and that goes on all the way to ten of
these so if we head over to the browser
there we go so you've got nice markup in
here so if I was to add a hash on now
say section ten you can see that that
goes all the way to the bottom
Paige so we're getting the result we
expected so once you've got some markup
like this in place we now want to create
the functionality that actually style
something based on its ID and previously
you might thought well you know use
JavaScript for that detect the hash in
the URL and then apply Styles
accordingly to the element the matches
with the same ID but we can actually use
the target pseudo selector in in CSS to
do this so what maps you're gonna do is
I'm gonna I'm gonna target any section
with a specific ID we don't have to
actually enter the ID that would be very
very complicated and really shouldn't be
styling sections based on this you know
maybe look up the actual definition of a
section but either way we're gonna say
section here and then we're gonna use
the target selector so this is all we
need to do and the way this works is
what's going to happen is it's going to
say well is there a section 10 in the
URL because there is a section with an
ID of section 10 if we just find it here
so it's gonna it's going to match
basically and then anything that matches
based on its ID in the hash part of the
URL we can style so for example I could
then choose to have the background color
of yellow for any element that matches
so in this case when I visit section 10
we get a yellow background say me
section 9 and so on and so forth you can
imagine that it will do this for every
single one now this isn't great because
we don't want to consistently show a
yellow background that's going to be a
little bit annoying for the user instead
what we want to do is just implement a
little keyframe animation here just to
flash a bit of yellow so what we'll do
is we'll say for half of the animation
we'll have yellow and then for the rest
we'll have a transparent background that
will just flash it on and off you don't
need to do it this way but there you
know there are tons of ways to do this
so what we want to do here is we want to
define our key frames so we want to say
WebKit so we're vendor prefix in this
key frames flash so this is the name of
the key frame set or whatever you want
to call it
and then we define the percentage and
then another percentage so in this case
all we're doing is we're saying well we
want half of this to have a yellow
background and then the rest of the
animation for 50% we want it to be
transparent and we can use ease in and
out to make this look quite nice so
we're gonna say background color yellow
and then for the next for the 50 last
50% we're gonna say
background-color:transparent or you can
say none or something like that so now
that we've done this we can actually add
in that we want this animation to run
then we can choose things like the
duration how many times it's repeated so
we're gonna use vendor prefix so then
sorry WebKit animation animation and we
want to choose the name of the animation
that we've created based on these key
frames that's flash and then we want
this to last for three seconds we want
it to repeat only once you can change
this to three if you wanted it to flash
three times but not great and ease in
out so that's it I'm gonna duplicate
this and I'm gonna use animation you
might want to just look up support for
this maybe head over to can I use comm
just to check the best way to implement
this for different browsers but now
what's gonna happen is when we refresh
you can see that that flash is on and
then just gradually fades out
so flash is on gradually fades out
really really nice so that then
alleviates the problem of us coming down
to section 10 perhaps from our own
website or from another website and
because this is flashed very briefly we
know that this is the intended section
that we were link to and we've done this
all without any JavaScript at all just
with CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
