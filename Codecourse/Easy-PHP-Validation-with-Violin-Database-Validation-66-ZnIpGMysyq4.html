violin so we can create our own custom
validator to keep all of our rule
messages field messages and more
importantly we're going to create a new
rule that allows us to validate whether
user name is already taken in our
database and normally when you're
working with validation of this kind it
gets really really messy but this way we
can create our own class keep everything
nice and tidy and we can reuse this rule
wherever we want to so we're going to be
creating a unique username rule now you
could go as far as creating a unique
rule that allows you to pass in
different arguments and then you can do
some really clever stuff with in here
let's look at a basic version of this
first then you can go ahead and update
it as you need so the first thing that
we want to do is just create a new file
with this class in so this is going
going to be our validator class so i'm
going to call this my validator so in
here then let's create a my validator
class now for this to work with violin
we need to extend violin and we also
need to go ahead and import so extends
violin we also need to go ahead and
import violin violin up here and we can
include this into our index page you
obviously wouldn't do this normally it
would be part of your project we can get
rid of the import here and we can go
ahead and we can require in my validator
dot PHP nava see this would all be nice
and structured in the real world so now
that we've got this this kind of works
in exactly the same way and we've got
this issue here let's just take a look
yeah that's why we need to get rid of
this so there so now instead of doing
this which just caused an error because
violin can't be found now because we
haven't imported it on this page we
create a new my validator which then has
all of the functionality the violin
offers us now what we're going to do
this time is we're going to start
working on our database so we have a
database called website this is the
table in it called users which is
probably what you
find in most applications and we have an
ID which is an auto incrementing field
and a user name so what we're going to
do is we're going to create this rule to
check whether whatever we type in exists
in our database and if obviously we come
across a value that does already exist
we can return false and then the rule
fails we can output a custom error to
our user so what we want to do then is
within my validator and we're going to
go ahead and accept a database
dependency so I'm going to create a DB
property in here now in the constructor
of this we are going to take in a PDO
instance i'm going to call that DB i'm
going to say this DB equals DB so where
is this database connection coming from
well in this case all we're going to do
is in here we're going to say DB equals
we're going to create a new PDO
connection so this is going to be mysql
the host is going to be localhost the
database name is website and also i'm
using a different port so this is 3 30
60 whereas normally it'd just be 3306 so
you may not need to include this and
then we provide our username in my case
it's homestead and then our password in
this case it's secret so let's just
check that that database connection
didn't fail okay so the area that we're
seeing here is because we need to pass
in the database as a dependency to our
validator so all we do is we pass that
data connect database connection into
our validator and then we have access to
that within our validator so when i
refresh nothing really happens do not
doing anything so now what we need to do
is work out how we're going to validate
this so let's just go ahead and validate
and in here we're going to say well we
want to pass in a username so this could
be at the username that the user
submitted when they're registering for
example and in here I'm just going to
type in Conan
so in here then we want this to be
required so this is our required rule
let's go ahead and VAR dump V errors all
and we should see no errors so we've got
an empty array because this value has
been included so now what we need to do
is add a custom rule called unique
username so this is going to check that
this value doesn't exist within this
table so over in my validator we're
going to create a custom rule in a
slightly different way by adding a
method so any custom rule that we create
needs to be nice to have validate
underscore prepended to it and then we
give the name of the role so unique
username like so so now within this
method we can return true or false to
determine if this rule has failed or not
so for now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to return true just hard code that
in so we can make sure this works and
then we'll go ahead and update it to use
our database connection so remember as
with adding custom rules using the a
draw method we have value input and args
if we need to use them in this case what
only going to be using the value so when
i refresh then nothing happens because
we return true here but if I return
false this is going to give us an error
but we don't have an error for this
unique username rule so let's go ahead
and add it within our constructor so I'm
going to say add roll message unique
username that user name is already taken
so now because I've returned false there
we will see that user name is already
taken simple so now we need to come up
with the solution to actually check this
you may already know how to do this so
you can obviously feel free to skip this
part if you want so let's go ahead and
do this now so we're going to create a
variable called user and we're going to
use this DB remember we stored our
database connection that we passed
through
due to our validator up here so we're
going to save prepare we're going to use
a prepared statement here and we'll just
do a quick query just to select count
star as count and that's going to be
from the users table and this is where
the username equals and then we have a
username placeholder which we can go
ahead and execute on it's all we need to
do is say user execute pass in user name
and this value obviously comes from the
value that we pass through which is here
so now all we need to do is an if
statement to say if user will fetch this
result back as an object will grab the
count which is remember this count that
we provided here so if the user name
does exist we want to return false so
this is all we're doing we're just
checking if it exists or not and then
otherwise we want to return true at the
bottom just here so now this is actually
using our live database connection we
have our rule message in place we
obviously have our rule in place so we
can go ahead and check this so when i
refresh we see no errors because we know
that the value conan doesn't already
exist in this database table but if we
update it to something like Billy or
Alex will get the message back that
username is already taken so just by
creating a custom class extending
extending violin we can go ahead and we
can create our own rules within this
using validate underscore and then the
name of the roll and obviously you can
pass in any dependencies you need to
this class so for example if you were
keeping all of your errors within some
kind of config or some kind of language
language helper you could go ahead and
pass that in here and then you could
replace all of these just to keep things
nice and tidy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
