variables so variables are pretty much
everything within a language and they
basically hold all of the data and
values that you're going to work with
now think of these as just little
storage areas in your code for either
text numbers and just any other data
type which we'll be talking about in the
rest of the series now for now let's
take a look at how we create a variable
assign a value to it and then go ahead
and output it to the page and then we'll
talk about some of the other rules and
advice around variable naming and how to
do some other things with them so as
always we start with our PHP tag at the
top of our page and then down here what
we're going to do is use a dollar sign
to start a variable name so here I'm
going to just give this a name of name
and then I'm going to assign my name to
it so with this we use an equal symbol
and then just the value now we've
already seen what a string looks like
when we create our first PHP file but
for now let me just go ahead and type my
name in it and obviously here we just
end that with a semicolon so this equal
sign here is what we call an assignment
operator doesn't mean that this value
technically equals it we're not
comparing this value we're saying well
place this value here whether it's a
string a number whatever into this
called
name okay now so as we've already seen
we can echo out a value within PHP and
that will appear within our browser
however what we now do rather than
reference directly a string or a number
we just go ahead and reference the
variable that we've created and again we
end this with a semicolon
so what we're now doing is saying we'll
store this value in here and then just
output whatever is stored within that
variable so if I come over to the
browser and give that a refresh you can
see here we get the value out that we
expect it now PHP doesn't care what we
assign to a variable and PHP is what we
call a loosely typed language in other
languages what you would have to do is
say well I want to declare that this
variable is storing a string now what we
can actually do is assign any data type
to a variable so as I've said before
we'll be looking at
eight types and a couple of videos along
but for now let's just quickly try this
out by some assigning a number to a
variable so let's get rid of this
example and let's go ahead and say days
in week now we know how many days are in
a week that's seven so all we do is we
assign the value seven not within a
string you will get a little bit caught
up if you do things like this but we
will be talking about that later when we
look at adding numbers up and doing all
sorts of mathematical operations so for
now because we know that this is
definitely a number we want to assign it
just a number with no single or double
quotes so this is now what we call an
integer so let's go ahead and just echo
this out and we'll see what we get so
we're going to echo out days in week
let's go over to the browser
give that a refresh and you see we get
seven now you might be wondering this is
a little bit weird because if this isn't
a string how isn't it being echoed out
to the page because technically when we
echo something out we would expect it to
be some kind of text well behind the
scenes what's happening is PHP is saying
well since you are outputting this I'm
going to kind of in the background
convert this it doesn't really work
quite that simply but basically that's
what's happening here so we can echo out
integers we can echo out floats which
are numbers with a decimal point and
other data types there are some data
types we can echo out and that is an
array or an object but we'll get to that
a little bit later now just before we go
ahead a little bit of advice about the
naming convention of variables now
notice what I've done here is I've
started this variable name with a
lowercase D and then I've gone ahead and
without any spaces which is really
important because that just won't work
I've gone ahead and I've uppercase t'
each subsequent word in this now there
are lots of different ways that you can
name variables so for example I could
have done this if we just go ahead and
refresh here you can see that it doesn't
work because it's looking for that exact
case so really important to remember
this is case sensetive now there are a
couple of other ways that you can name
variables you can use underscores if you
prefer so let's just go ahead and switch
this over with lowercase characters just
like that so this is perfectly
acceptable
the most important thing to do is stay
consistent now from being a developer
for a while the best thing to do and the
most common way to do this is actually
the way I originally did it so this is
called camel casing you can also do
things like studly casing which is where
you have a capital at the start but to
be honest most developers will use this
convention when naming variables but
whatever you choose whatever you think
looks readable it really does not matter
don't let anyone tell you that you have
to name things in a certain way just
remember keep it consistent don't switch
between two different styles okay so the
next thing we're going to look at we
haven't quite looked at this year but we
can actually concatenate which means
basically join text on to other text so
what does this mean well in this case
echoing out days in the week on its own
doesn't really make that much sense
really what we'd want to do is place
this into a sentence so let's just go
ahead and echo the sentence out and then
we'll look at how we add this variable
that we've created into this sentence so
it joins together so I'm going to say
there are seven days in a week now let's
just say that the days in the week could
change obviously it's not going to but
let's just assume that at some point we
may have eight days in a week in the
future well in this case this is a
hard-coded string we don't have any
flexibility over really changing this
easily and obviously this is a very
simple example but for more complex
things you might want to store variables
elsewhere and then have things update
based on the value of their variables so
in this case what we can do is we can
actually get rid of this and we can go
ahead and concatenate on now what I
would normally do is if I was writing a
string out and concatenated I would do
the following now that looks a little
bit complicated so what we're going to
do is start this again and look at how
we break this up so let's go and echo
out there are now after there so I'm
going to place a space but within the
single quote then I'm going to go ahead
and use a dot to concatenate on which
essentially just means join the variable
so I'm going to say days in week then
I'm going to concatenate again using
another dot another string
so two single quotes here we end the
line so there are days in week days in
the week like so so let's go ahead and
check this out and you can see there are
seven days in the week now that's just a
simple example we're going to be
covering concatenation in more detail
later on so don't worry if this is a
little bit confusing and of course we're
going to go and dive into different ways
that we can do this too okay so now that
we've spoken about how we assign things
to variables
the different data types and go ahead
and add a brief look at catenation what
I'm actually going to do is assign this
string here because we now have a new
string to another variable now it's
highly likely that you'll do this you
want to build up different values based
on other variables and all this means is
I'm going to say well the text here is
equal to or I'm assigning this text here
to this text variable now obviously this
isn't going to work now because we're
not doing anything with it but of course
what we can now do is echo out that just
there like so and that means that we can
reuse this string anywhere else we want
so in actual fact what we could do is
duplicate this line down head over to
the browser and see that we have now
output it twice so essentially what
we're doing here is we are storing a
built-up value in this case it's a
concatenated string with the value that
we already happen to have into a
variable and then we can reuse it more
than one so it just saves us a little
bit of time now of course throughout the
rest of the series we're going to be
looking more at exactly how we use
variables and by the end of the series
it will just be second nature to you
okay so there's one more thing I want to
talk about which is overwriting a
variable in order to do this what we do
is we basically just reassign a value so
let's say we had days in the week just
here now what if I were to do days in
week equals 8 but keep this original
value now what's going to happen here is
PHP is going to assign 7 to days in week
and then down here since this is the
next line down it's then going to assign
8 two days in week so if you just follow
it down that's exactly the order it's
going to be assigned in now because we
already have this
variable we're not going to see an error
all we're going to see is this value
overwritten so if we refresh now if we
just echo this out then you'll see we
have there are eight days in the week
and of course we could do this however
many times we won now it's not always
the case that in this very simple
example you would go ahead and overwrite
this in this case you would simply
change this but there may be some kind
of condition that means that you want to
overwrite this particular value and of
course we'll look at that later when we
get to things like if statements and
loops as well okay so there's one more
thing actually I did lie that I want to
talk to you about and that's that you
can echo something out at the same time
you assign it now this is a good idea if
you want to echo something out and then
use the value later on or you're just
testing around so in this case to see
text equals and then this value I could
just do echo text we know that that
works however what I can do is just
stick echo in the front of it and
sometimes this is really useful for
testing if you just want to output
something very very quickly just means
you don't have to write echo text you
just write the word echo and you can see
that that works in exactly the same way
okay so this should give you enough
information about variables to create
them use them over write them out put
them concatenate which to be honest is
pretty much what you'll be doing all the
time when you're writing code of course
like I said we'll be using variables a
lot throughout the series so if
something doesn't make sense here you
will pick it up in no time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
