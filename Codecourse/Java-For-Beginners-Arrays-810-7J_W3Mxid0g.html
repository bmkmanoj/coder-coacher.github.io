this Java series for beginners in this
video we're going to be looking at
arrays and arrays are a different
concept that we haven't covered yet in
Java and what arrays are is they are
variables which hold more than one value
at least that's the best way I can
describe them so I can show you a an
example straight away before we were
looking at variables such as integer a
equals 10 but what if the variable is no
longer just an example variable such as
a for example if we change this to ages
for example the ages of pupils in a
class for example we don't want to make
loads of new variables like so and we'd
have like two three four ages one two
three four of all the pupils in the
class it's far more useful and easy to
read if we can store all of the ages of
the people in the class in this one
variable here and then access them
somehow later on so we just want to
basically we only want to use one we
only want to have to call one variable
to do them and to do this the syntax is
quite simple so the first thing we do is
we need to change the variable type that
we declare so we want to declare an
integer but we want to declare an
integer array and the symbol for array
is an opening and closing square bracket
like so and you can think of the square
brackets like a box and the the box is
the array and it holds more than one
thing so the integer array this is the
variable type we're declaring it's a the
in followed by the two square brackets
and we can do this with any other
variable type much like the ones I
showed you beforehand like float we can
add a boolean array we can have any
variable variable type array any
variable can be in array form and we
could store more than one of them
so we're making an integer array we're
calling it ages so we're going to set it
equal to now the difference here is
there's not one value that's obviously
going to be more than one value there's
two ways we can initialize an array we
can initialize it as a sort of blank
array and give it a set amount of values
or we can just start entering the value
use manually so I'll show you how we can
just manually start entering the value
straightaway we can set it equal to and
then do the spiked brackets that we're
familiar with and then inside these
spiked brackets we do any amount of
comma separated values that are a valid
instance of this variable type so all of
the variables in here have to be
integers they can be doubles or billions
or anything so a list of comma separated
integers in this case so we'd have like
17 21 18 19 et cetera and they could be
any number of these values here so let's
leave this array how it is and I'll show
you a different way we can initialize an
array and then I'll show you how we can
access each individual value from inside
here so the second way we can initialize
an array of let's do a boolean array
this time and we'll say boolean array
using the two square brackets and we can
just separate with we're going to put
some spaces here so both of the variable
names will line up and you are allowed
to do this in Java there can be any
number of white space between within
reason between different things like
between the equal sign here between the
brackets here etc so let's do a boolean
for if this group of people with their
ages let's see if they're students or
not for example so let's make the equals
lineup as well so we've got this boolean
array here for whether or not each of
the corresponding values here each of
these people here is a student or not so
we're not going to initialize this the
same way with the brackets we can I'll
show you the second way to initialize an
array we can say boolean array give it a
name we can say it's equal to a new
boolean array like so so with where we
declare the variable type first of all
which is a boolean array we give it a
name then we could set it equal to a new
instance of this and then inside the
square brackets here we actually need to
give
a value an integer of how many slots we
want the rates out how many how many
like variable hold its does it need so 1
2 3 4 we had above so let's just put
this one that's 4 okay so those are the
two different ways you can initialize an
array now how do we access each of the
values in here so this boolean array
here is obviously blank so far we've
given it the amount of slots we want but
we haven't actually given it values yet
so let's go ahead and I'll show you how
we can give values to this so we first
call upon the variable which we have
school student and then we can put the
square brackets like this so we're
accessing this student array and inside
the square brackets we need to give the
index of the value we're accessing so
there's four values there's four like
holders in this array here and this is
the most important thing to note about
arrays the indexing in Java starts at 0
so putting in students 0 like so access
is the first point in the array and then
if we put one it will access the second
one if we put two it's going to add the
third one and if we put three it's going
to grab the fourth one and three is the
max amount we can is the highest one we
can access because there's only four
slots in the array so again the indexing
starts at zero so basically the zeroth
place in the array is the first slot in
the first slot in the array so let me
just explain this but our other comment
here so I'll annotate it above this one
here so this this first one here with
number 17 is actually the zeroth one and
then this is the first one and this is
the second one and this is the third one
and so on
so those correspond to those ones below
and that's how you access arrays in Java
so using we're going to access the first
one using the number zero we can set
this equal to true then we could just
copy this down sum and we can just make
sure we increment those values 1 2 3
because they're true false false and
true so that's the second way we can
initialize a an array you can see it's a
if we you could see if we already know
the values it's much easier to do it
this way but you might not know the
values beforehand you might need to do
it like this so those are basically the
two ways you can do them so now let's
look at how we can use these values in
loops now that the easiest loop to use
when doing arrays is a for loop because
we can use built-in variables we can use
a built-in a property that arrays have
to easily loop through every instance in
an array so let's go ahead and write 4
we're going to make an integer called I
equal to 0 and I is the standard one we
use I for increment then we need to give
it a condition so we can say if I is
less than and then we're going to choose
the array we want here so we're going to
say ages then if we put the full stop we
can access the properties of this array
here and arrays have an inbuilt property
called length and the length of the
array is basically how many things it
has in it how many items it has in it
then we could put a semicolon and then
we need to increment the I by 1 every
iteration of the loop so the reason for
loops is so easy for arrays is because
if we start on 0 we're going to first
loop we're going to first access the
zeroth one in the array and then the
first one the second one incrementing
each time and then on the on the last
one obviously ages length this value is
equal to 4 so because the length of it
is equal to 4 and we put the last and
value here it means it's only I is only
going to ever be equal to 3 which means
we're not going to get errors if we if
it sort of ticks over to the next one so
I'll show you the way we
use this and I'll also show you the
errors you get if you try and access an
array slot that isn't available so let's
go ahead and say system dot out dot
print line and we'll just put in the
value of Ages so we're accessing the
variable ages and then much like we did
here we need to access a specific one
we're going to put in the value I so
each instance of this loop so we can go
through it because there's only four
it's not that hard to do the first
instance of the loop I is equal to zero
so we're accessing the zeroth one in the
array that's going to print out 17 the
second loop this is going to be equal to
one so we're going to print out 21 the
thirdly Brown there will be equal to two
we're going to print out 18 and on the
fourth one it's going to be equal to
three which will print out 19 and then
when it comes again for the fifth time
to check it is going to be equal to four
and four is not less than four which
means this loop won't run so when we hit
run here we can see that it prints out
all the values so let's go ahead and
change this here to less than or equal
to so what this is going to do now it's
going to make it's going to cause an
error it's going to do the exact same
thing as this except on the fifth
iteration four is less than or equal to
four which means that it's going to try
and do this again and it's going to try
and print out a value in slot four of
the array which doesn't exist slot four
would be this imaginary one here the
fourth slot up here whatever number you
put in there but in this example we
haven't actually initialized that value
yet so we're going to print out all of
these and then we're going to see we're
going to get an error so you can see we
print out all the values and then we get
this array index out of bounds exception
this thing here and you can see it
prints out the number the invalid number
that we were trying to access and then
also it tells you where the error was at
so you can click it and it basically
tells you the line on which the error
occurred so that's just an important
thing to be aware of if you try and
access an array value which doesn't
exist you're going to get this error
here so hopefully that all made sense in
the next video we're going to be looking
more at arrays and we're going to be
be looking at strings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
