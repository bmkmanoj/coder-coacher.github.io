alone make mistakes and the reason has
not said good the bad is because I've
sort of come to believe there's nothing
bad about using framework to be properly
so as I've said I'm Alex if you've got
nothing better to do with your life
follow me on Twitter and I'm web
developer for mainly front-end kind of
stuff I work in the back end with
freemarker so bridging the gap to my job
and stuff we do on the front end so
first of all who is anyone here that
uses frameworks sort of actively or has
used three months before cool okay
anyone that doesn't use frameworks
because they think the good idea cool
okay that's one and cool so yeah
frameworks generally offering ready to
use bill code for specific languages I'm
talking front-end back-end today so
we're not going sis of any other
frameworks design frameworks i'll be
talking to back in mainly referring to
laravel which is a peer-to-peer
framework and bootstrap because i can
sort of pick things out of these
frameworks to talk about so we use them
it's basically just to improve our eight
development in some way so obviously
there's a massive general area to this
but generally we use it to either you
know improve or just speed up
development book or two brother or so
the dangers we say dangerous because
it's dangerous misusing frameworks I
don't think there's any actual negatives
frameworks such except probably if
you've got negatives within a particular
framework you're working with though so
in absolute 0 security vulnerability
stuff like that the point is that we can
sort by an amount along the way so the
first thing I think really good about
frameworks is rapid prototyping if you
find idea and you want to get that into
papers so per se and you want to go
ahead and just you know get your ideas
out there start writing them down get
users using you know using your product
your workings parts of the lean model of
you know i'm going to give this to my
users and get some sort of feedback so
that could be either you know just front
end well that could be you know sort of
adding the dynamics in the back end as
well yeah so you know if you've got an
idea and you need to get some feedback
on him it's perfect for that because you
can quickly get that sort of idea out
there secondly code and design
consistency now when you're working
either on your own with one other person
a massive team or hundreds of people
your aim is consistency just because
you're working on your eyes as well
doesn't mean you're not going to achieve
consistency because you know you might
forget something you did two weeks ago
and rebuild it or or build on it you
know in a slightly different wrong way
so as working on your own or as part of
a team it's a good idea to sort of have
that that consistency within a framework
and will come and sort of the
documentation of it later that that
really helps if you're working within a
team and obviously I'm not just
referring to frameworks that are out
there ready built for you that you can
just go and download you could have your
own framework as part of an organization
just yourself so you can build up your
own framework and reuse it and if your
document that that is even better yeah
so if you are going to go over the web
and just grab a framework that's already
built for you and you'll often find
there's enthusiastic communities that
sort are active in the development of
stuff and how it's documented and also
people that are literally there just to
help you so can be a good learning curve
as well we're looking a bit about some
bad stuff about you know why frame one
is so good for beginners but generally
you've got this community of people
looking that can really help you out
people are really enthusiastic bala-tik
your framework so it's good to sort be
able to jump over and get help with
stuff as well as actually participate so
yeah as I've already said audis have
gone into the faculty documented for you
so if you're working as part of the team
I know where I were we document
everything we do so if we have you know
style guides for example we know exactly
what we need to build on we know what
modules we can sort of fit together on
the front end to you know keep the
design consistent especially for new
people that are brought on to a team for
people that you know are you know sort
of lower level than other people so
specifically referring to PHP I don't
know does anyone here development here
to me is that yeah that's right so you
probably already know that pitch was
massively inconsistent in a way that
your names functions in the way there's
generally designed it is a bit bit like
javascript in the way that if you know
how to use the lies it really work you
can make a really really good job using
patterns but for PHP like I said of
specifically speaking about laravel it's
perfect because if completely abstract
all the bad stuff in the language I
think I've got an example here the first
one here we've got a snippet of code
that would trim a host if it's great for
900 characters and add your ellipses and
otherwise just not post out but in an
hour where we get to sort of common
string model that we can just say
wyndham in this and that would through
everything there for you now moving down
we've got exactly the same thing we've
got str2 up let's just low which is
obvious but we've also got you see work
which does something to a string but its
name so completely differently so it's
obstructing that and giving it some
common grounds to to work with and the
benefit there is that it's easier to
learn the language as well so you can
learn things a lot quicker if you're
working with things that actually make
sense the same here as well we've just
got a function in PHP again means the
underscores we're missing
answers again inconsistent but that
obstructs that we've got that file model
makes sense we can put or append things
to files so that's that's another thing
that's that's good so what can be
dangerous about frameworks well visual
heavy front and frameworks can make such
look region area anyone with bootstrap
before if you go to a website and you
see something that looks bootstrap need
you go right in bitch it so I'm guilty
of this massively guilty of this and I
still sometimes when I'm releasing a
product early it will look a bit generic
and that's a massive problem because
people don't sort of take the time to
say oh you know I'm going to sort of
tweak this to my own needs I've got
little example of the site life found no
idea what it is but it looks like just
bootstrap and you can tell it built on
bootstrap I don't think it's bad that
you can tell a size build a bootstrap I
found another slide which is boot strap
which I think looks pretty decent it's
got a unique look and feel to it you
know someone that's familiar food strap
would be able to tell but otherwise it
looks it looks good the second point
code bloat is referred to the back and
front end downloading things you're not
going to use is ridiculous and using
things they can't be used I've seen
examples of particularly bootstrap sites
that use you know we've got to style
sheets we've got bootstrap CSS and
bootstrap responsive of CSS and then
maybe eight or nine script includes
plugins that may not may or may not be
used so your Korean HTTP requests for no
reason the main problem for this is
education people sort of you know take
it from the the documentation don't
understand you know why it's there and
don't sort of understand the
implications of it same with the back
end if you've got stuff loaded in now
this varied depending on the framework
that you're using but you know if you've
got frame with us loading a load of crap
you don't need you know that's that's
bad the third point is quite a big one
it's assume stability security and speed
amongst other bits and bobs but yeah so
I mean people download frameworks
thinking that they're just a perfect
package to use and you know this is this
is wonderful and in our dentists bother
escaping out or anything like that and
again I'm guilty of f as I'm sure are
the people of Earth that's the problem
you know people see this wonderful
package how it's advertised on site
frameworks tend to have this lovely
splash with this is what this framework
can do this sort of gives the impression
that home you're downloading something
birth it's just going to work and you
don't need to really worry about
anything and that sort of brings on to
the point that it can abstract we talked
about the obstructing for good reasons
but it can obstruct so much from actual
you know the vanilla code that we forget
to actually bother to learn and keep up
with the code that we're writing this
thing off in actually working with
laravel your wife
the HP I a lack of PHP go off you know
it's coming bothered but really you know
you've gotta keep up with a kind of kind
of flow of development as items as well
as at the end of that you're still
writing in the language but you're just
writing perhaps a better version of it
or something that you're going to work
quicker with so frameworks you know tend
to use of MVC and it's easier to abused
if you're not if you're not creating
something within the realms of a
framework or you're very inexperienced
and you think that just using a
framework is going to make you a better
developer then that's bad so it's easy
to abuse in that aspect so you know I
could name numerous examples but you
know things like not not following MVC
model reviews controllers and stuff like
that and of course you might be using
functionality vanilla functionality
there's available in the framework so it
sort of mixing things up a bit as well
so there is a kind of tendency to have
to learn the framework but again that's
that's pretty obvious so just cos then
what can we do to actually use
frameworks well if you noticed if we're
going to actually make use of generators
mainly for front-end stuff that user
generators to actually pick and choose
the bits that you're actually getting
used from the language I know bootstrap
has one but you could do more than that
generator that's that's the point as
well generator so you know we change
colors for you and remove
my New Year's or remove parts of CSS
Michael use but still it makes sense to
actually get to know it and strip out
the bits that you don't need and again
gets no framework inside out if you're
using code someone else's code or code
within a company that you've perhaps
joined in a frame works available then
why wouldn't you get to know that code
you're essentially then just taking code
and just making use of it without
without making sense of it enough you
know it doesn't make sense and keeping
with in best practices as well that's
within the framework within the language
that you're working with as well so you
wouldn't just say I'll download
bootstrap stick it with my site build a
nice design and then you know completely
you know say entirely new style sheet
start writing out things and calming
away and it sort of modular sense of
bootstrap because it's it's very modular
in the sense that you can literally
together together a site like a jigsaw
you just look at the building blocks in
so you need to stop keeping in best
prices that comes with some knowledge of
what you're doing as well some knowledge
of the language as well but generally if
you if you look at the documentation of
a framework and you actually analyze it
that we've said get to know well then
you'll solve you know to stick to that
in a sense and also continue to research
language security best practices core
update applications stuff like that it's
about sort of staying
everything that call sense but making
use of the framework for the sort of
benefits it gives and obviously update
the actual code that you're using when
it works available a massive massive
problem is that you have a code you know
you're using code particularly the back
end of a site what happens when a
security vulnerability comes up you know
you've got them thousands and thousands
of people that you know know and
understand that security Barnabas you've
seen this in plenty of plenty of mass
you know announcements of security you
know it will struggle scramble together
the making sure people are updating
stuff and that can become a real problem
so you have to keep on top of actually
updating you know whatever framework
that you're using getting involved in
the community as well as a really really
good way to sort of increase your
knowledge report you know bugs
improvements things that you'd like to
see things that you know that other
people would like to see you know just
generally getting involved in what
you're actually working with because
again if you're putting someone else's
code using it in there going I don't
care you know it's it sort of not giving
credit to actually build up so it's good
to so get involved with with with people
and and sort of get involved in a
community help people out helping people
to really really good way to learn as
well so that was very short but thanks
for listening and I viewer I've got to
room to say to people this is why you
should use very much cool any questions
at all yes straight
a dangerous thing you didn't mention
which is the fact that sooner or later
the framework you will have to make some
customization personalization or what
sure because your website solution
whatever trying to get a little sleep
were drunk while you are yeah I think
this is the best day worse in other
words it's a risk a danger that we have
to face as a developer when you he use a
framework because it's your posture at
the beginning but then your attitude
that you got that later absolutely and
especially with their dates because
certain what you are you say if I made
that break something no I don't update
showing so I think this is the most
patriotic theme of using a frame yeah
yeah I totally understand now I think
the fact so getting back to
understanding how the framework works is
a really really important part of it
let's say you've written up framework
which is a good idea in practice anyway
you know it's good to have a sort of
solid bicycle you're doing organize your
code and everything like that if you
build your own framework then and you're
updating it if you get to know the
framework that you're using just in the
sort of the same position if an update
comes out you can sort of you know
perhaps apply them updates as you know
has a sort of knowledgeable person about
code it does make it difficult there are
it's easy ways to do to do things like
that but not you see your point that's a
good point the others
what's the difference between frameworks
and ESP libraries like jQuery and Joe
spirits and processes functionally messy
yeah yes it's sort of like a very vague
area things are you know people say you
know don't refer to this kind of thing
as a framework I've seen CSS grid
systems where people say yeah this is a
framework but then I've seen others will
say we are not a framework so there's
sort of not a definitive way to define
our framework libraries again perhaps
slightly different because if I load up
you know if I need to develop some cool
jobs with functionality the first thing
I think about is jQuery is subtracted
from JavaScript and I use that solely
obviously have to mix PHP in a sari
javascript in but it's the same with a
PHP framework I use the framework but
there might be a function that isn't
replaced so I do that I think yeah it's
a difficult one to answer because I
think it varies depending on you know
that the authors opinions and the people
who use it and also the complexity of it
as well and the way it sort of built up
but I probably say jquery is defined as
a library the innocent yet you know it's
a framework to build buildings on the
differences here that it's not you don't
sort of place it where you need it and
then do it on top of it you just use
jQuery as a replacement for JavaScript
of sasha's it's a library that you would
sort of use in a sense
yeah yeah it's more sort of foundation
for your user but you know you get you
get JavaScript libraries that are
referred to as frameworks as well
despite the fact they are libraries so
but that's the city good way to litter
here cool it's a thanks anyway I do
subscribe to your videos on YouTube are
like I their butts out for you to read
yourself we have dimension teeth like
three months yes yeah yeah and the other
equation right that's why would someone
want to use when stars anymore for PHP
rather that you say the next wave of
which is a whole package console is it
about good and you can use any of this
language
see show I think I'll answer it in terms
of say PHP frameworks if you think about
it this way anyone can build a bit of
framework you know anyone can build a
framework host it how people contribute
to it and so use this framework because
we're fast we can do this we can do that
I think the main thing is personal
preference and what suits your
application I guess this sort of ties
into the problem of how do you know two
years down the line what your
application needs are going to be so if
you pick a framework now it might not be
suitable in the future so you know that
could be a problem I guess the way you
can look at it is that if you are in
desperate need of a change in the future
you can choose another framework and
build on top of that there's plenty of
sites applications that do rebuilds
based on their have change your needs so
I think with a framework pick something
that you feel comfortable with and that
you feel that will meet your needs don't
go overkill for a simple application you
know some frameworks I can be suitable
for a beginner la ragazza perfect
because it's just so into you know you
could just use it the destructive box
it's brilliant but yeah I mean it's
personal preference on what you need and
the key probably is to just research
exactly what you need before you
actually do anything with it because
probably another another danger would be
to just go oh you know my friends are
using that
that's wrong pull any other questions
recent
yes
it does make things easier
close
doing things like the CSS
best thing CSS
it doesn't do that ourselves
very well
creating reload
such special change
so inheritance very cool thing I I feel
the frame
it is something that you replace this is
a
but being pulled
foundation
yeah well I mean I wouldn't by any means
day to you know replace learning a
language is in framework it be sitting
but how many people start learning
JavaScript enough J I know we're not
talking specifically framework it's a
library but when you know there's plenty
a handful of people who refer to jQuery
as you know they think there's a
difference between javascript and jquery
when fundamentally there isn't I think
in terms of being able to to sort of say
you know using a foot I mean like you
said you use a framework at work you're
building in yourself building something
yourself or analyzing a framework so
much that you can change if you need
you're starting with us that fundamental
understanding of it for beginner learn
the court you know dancer that's really
really important learn CSS before you
start playing around with
things like that again it sort of varies
based on needs as well like I said if
you want to prototype and you you're
comfortable knowing you know you know
CSS you know how to write you know
semantic markup but you need to quickly
build something you can not on the old
version of rutile but definitely
advocate of building your own framework
within you know your company you can
solve test your needs then but if you
think about it in that sense when once
you've built your framework as part of
team in a company and someone new joints
thus completing user you know you just
read you've just recycled it is exactly
the same thing as just taking notes from
somewhere else I think the danger with
in building something within a company
would be there might not be documented
properly whereas if you plan to release
something out in the wild you want to
document it you want you to start using
it so i think there's dangers in all
respect of things but i think you've
just at the end of the day got to think
about you know making sure that people
use what is available properly learn the
fundamentals absolutely so Joe Christian
cool anything else yes I'm doing so to
use five months like Twitter nominations
get approached by that officially would
you take you then you have your price of
work lumens look engraving because you
customization would you stick with the
frameworks ago so production website or
would you I felt I wonder then just go
with your own stuff you know by your own
CSS and guilty of different plugins and
so on well I mean it depends i mean the
point of prototyping is to find out if
people actually want to use something or
if they like the way it looks they like
the way it functions they actually like
the product itself so if you prototypes
and you feel you know you you can prove
we are not a un tour that's perfect if
you can prove that people are using your
product in its you notes it's doing well
then really you know you don't need to
change anything you're obviously
changing perhaps in the future and again
it's personal preference if you're if
you want to stick with something that
you're comfortable with and you know or
if you think actually our case use a bit
more high dependency we need to move
from lara cutters end or you know from
bootstrap to just the 960 grid system
and then we
completely restructure our design you
know it's that kind of background
situation there's no answer to the
question because their needs vary
outcomes very once you've got an initial
prototype of so it's really whatever
makes sense and why are they comfortable
cool
the questions cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
