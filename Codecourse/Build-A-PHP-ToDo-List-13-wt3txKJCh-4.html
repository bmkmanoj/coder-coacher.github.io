learning how to create a to-do list app
with PHP and we're going to take a look
also in the next video how to style up
the front end so it looks like this you
don't obviously have to do that you
might have your own design but we'll be
doing both so you can choose whether to
skip to the last part what we will be
focusing on just the PHP side of things
and in this video we're going to have a
look at how this works it's important to
note this does simulate a user being
signed in but you don't have to include
this you could just use it for your own
to-do list or of course just build it to
learn more about PHP so if you do have
some kind of sign-in authentication
system you can hook it up to this so
when you do set your user ID in perhaps
a session here you'll know that you can
use that as the user in this case it's
user one if we just take a look inside
of my database this will be Alex but if
we did have say another record called
Billy then obviously if Billy signs in
this would hold a user ID of two
well-loved forget about that for now
though so let's take a look at how this
works and here you can see that we've
got no items added we've got a nice font
up here which we'll be including we've
got a nice body font as well which we'll
be including I'm going to be doing that
from google fonts API so we'll be
integrating that in the front end and
we've got this input here which is
styled to pretty much look like at one
of the two do's with this underline here
we can just type a new item in here so
we can type anything so we could say
something like go vegan and we hit add
and you can see now that that's been
listed in this to do let's do something
like turn off lights to save energy
all good things that you might want to
do and that adds that as well up here so
what we can also do is hit add that's
going to give us a little bit of
front-end validation but we do of course
have back-end validation as well just in
case is this required attribute is not
supported
now obviously from here you can see that
as I hover over each of these we have
this mark as done option so for example
you
if I once mark this one is done I just
hit mark done and that then hits strike
through that it doesn't delete it you
can go ahead and add the functionality
to remove it from the list later on
that's really really straightforward to
do just be altering a very small query
and there we go
so that is pretty much it it's really
simple to do app we're going to be
wearing some front and backing code to
get this working let's go ahead and
start with the front end in the next
