very basic URL shortening service but
we're gonna have a focus on the API of
this so we're gonna be generating URLs
via an API not through a web interface
so we'll take a look at how this works
the first thing to know is just on the
home page of this site we just see a bit
of text but obviously you could have
anything let's take a look at actually
generating a URL through the API so this
is what we are going to be building on
the backend to be able to handle so I'm
using pour which is an arrest client for
Mac you can use other rest clients so
you can have a look around for them but
all I'm doing here is I'm sending a
request through to my host which is just
my domain name here so localhost
tutorial shorty public and I'm sending
it through to API generate so that's our
endpoint now the body of the request is
just a JSON bit of string here or text
or object with a URL property and then
the URL that I want to shorten if we
don't provide a URL we get errors back
so we're gonna be looking at HTTP status
codes we get an error here saying URL is
required if we were to pass in a URL and
hit go what we get back is a 200 ok we
get back the URL that we passed in and
we get a generated URL here which
because this is the first record is 1
we'll talk in the series about how we
can adjust our auto increment on our
table to give us slightly longer URL
shortens but for now this is just a base
encoded number basically from our record
just here
but we'll talk about that a little bit
later either way this has now been
generated so if I copy this URL and I
paste it into my browser that takes me
off to the right site so we're gonna be
building all of this with the slim to
framework also going to be using laravel
database component so we can use
eloquent to easily
access our database and this is gonna be
a really fun thing to build and you can
expand on this if you want so that's
what we're gonna be building let's dive
into the next part where we're gonna be
looking at what dependencies we need and
then we'll get this system built</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
