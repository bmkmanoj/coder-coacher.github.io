set up and the great part about using
this bootstrap project that we're going
to be pulling down is that you don't
actually need a web server to run this
so if you don't have any kind of web
server installed it doesn't matter this
is all gonna go ahead and open for you
and we're gonna serve this within web
pack okay so just to kind of give you an
idea of what you're gonna need you'll
need nodejs because we need to pull down
all of the dependencies that we require
using NPM if you're not sure that you
have this installed just head over to a
terminal and run NPM V and you should
see the version that you're running as
long as you've got that installed then
we're ready to move on so like I said
we're gonna be using phaser which is a
desktop and mobile html5 game framework
but we're not gonna be directly using
any guides inside of this to get this
working like I said we're gonna be using
this bootstrap project so I'd recommend
going over to phaser they have a lot of
examples a lot of tutorials if you
wanted to carry on after this course so
go ahead and check this out anyway and
I'll leave of course a link to this in
the course links section ok so now we
want to go ahead and pull down this
template just here so let's come down to
how we do this
we need to go ahead and clone this down
so you will need to get installed to go
ahead and pull this in
I'm currently just within aaww directory
here and I'm gonna go ahead and grab
this link paste it in and we're gonna
call this breakouts of course for
building a breakout game so once this is
all downloaded we want to go ahead and
CD into that breakout directory and like
I said using NPM we want to install all
of the assets this will pull down phaser
it will pull down webpack which will
bundle everything together for us and a
couple of other things as well that are
going to help us out along the way
we're gonna have browser sink setup so
as we make changes in our text editor
this is going to go ahead and update
what we see on the screen so pretty
useful so we've gone ahead and on this
step just here you can of course use
yarn if you prefer that and the next
thing we want to do is run the
development server and this is gonna go
ahead and open the local host on port
3000 so now that this is all finished
let's go ahead and run NPM run dev and I
should go ahead and open up for us and
we'll be ready to go okay so this is now
opened up and it's watching for changes
you can see that this is now a
game and it's of course working you can
see here that you don't wanna come out
of this because browsersync is going
ahead and pushing to your browser and
webpack is just going ahead and waiting
for changes so you can just pretty much
leave that in the background now unless
you have any issues and you need to go
ahead and restart it okay so now that
we've got this installed of course what
we want to do is open up our text editor
and start customizing this as lovely as
that spinning mushroom is we're gonna go
ahead and get rid of that so opening up
my text editor let's go ahead and bring
the breakout game into here like I said
because this uses web pack we have some
web pack configuration in here as well
unless you really know about web pack
it's not really worth diving into these
you can always go ahead and explore
what's going on a little bit later what
we're mainly interested in is this
source directory here which has the
state of each of our game States we also
have sprites in here which we're not
going to be using we're going to be
using prefabs instead and also we have
our assets directory here with any of
the images in here that we have now we
can go ahead and get rid of the
mushrooms so the first thing that we're
gonna do is come into the game section
just here you can see what this is doing
is just adding some text to this world
and I'm gonna refer to the game as a
world just because that's how phaser
refers to it and of course don't worry
if you don't understand any of this year
we're going to be of course looking at
each of these so we're gonna get rid of
all of this because we don't have
mushroom in there we're gonna get rid of
the import for the mushroom at the top
just here I'm also gonna get rid of the
render condition in or the condition
inside of this render method so let's go
ahead and delete the sprites just here
because we're not gonna need that
mushroom so let's delete this and it's
go ahead and delete this mushroom image
as well just so we don't have too much
floating around in our code so at the
moment then if we head over to the
browser you can see that we just end up
with the following it's just a obvious
square with the background color just in
here and what we can do is we can head
over to boot which is the boot state of
the game that loads in fonts it goes
ahead and shows the loader bar which we
can't quite see at the moment because we
don't have too many assets being loaded
in but if you were building on a much
larger game this would show a progress
bar now we can leave this all in because
it's worth keeping in
we want to go ahead and change the
background-color now one of the things I
do want to do first of all is over in
config is you'll notice that we have a
predefined game width and game height
and this is going ahead and pulling in
and going ahead and setting the conflict
that we need but if we just go ahead and
get rid of this notice that we just end
up with a full screen game and that's
what we're gonna be doing in here but
you can of course change the width and
height over your game if you need to so
now that we've done that all I want to
do is come over to boot and change the
background color over to f of F or ffff
and we now have an empty slate ready to
start placing all of our things on that
we need to get this breakout game
working so that's pretty much it for the
setup that's what you'd do if you were
using this kind of boiler plate and you
wanted to just have a completely fresh
slate to start with we're gonna be
adding more States to the game but feel
free to have a little look around here
we can also get rid of this reference to
loading in that mushroom because we
don't need that all this is doing is
going ahead and loading in the loader
background and the loader bar and it's
going ahead and setting that loader
either way that's pretty much it but
we'll learn more about this along the
way we can now have a nice fresh slate
to start working with and the first
thing that we're going to do is go ahead
and add the score text at the level text
and the lives text at the top of the
page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
