then I mentioned in the last part that
we were gonna do something like send
magic link and it just means that we can
very nicely and easily chain this on it
just makes sense so let's implement this
method so the method here send magic
link will obviously be on that trait
because again we're keeping this nice
and flexible if we want to use this for
other models so in here then we can just
very quickly create this so send magic
link now what we're also going to do is
accept an array of options in and
essentially these options are just gonna
be what we can tack on to the query
string when we send the actual email off
and this is important because what we're
gonna be able to do then is say things
like remember and then be able to grab
if the user has checked the remember box
so in this case we would do this request
has remember and this would be a true or
false value depending on whether they
have actually selected that and of
course as well what we want to do is
also append onto the query string the
users email and we know that we have
that user so we can just do the
following now the reason we're doing
this here and not just doing it say
inside of here is because what this
means is that you can add anything else
on that you need to it just makes it a
little bit easier to do so so this is
what we're gonna be doing here and then
over in our magically authenticate all
trait in here we can start to think
about how that we're gonna send this off
now all we're literally gonna do in here
is use the mail facade to send an email
but of course we need to generate an
email first now to do this for the Nara
veil we can say PHP arts and make mail
and we're gonna call this magic login
requested and we can go ahead and start
to fill this in so this will generate a
mail folder with that in there and kind
of now we need to think about what we're
gonna accept into this email so we know
that we probably need to send through
the user so we can extract any
information from them and that will
allow us to in turn then get the token
that's associated with them and also
that list of options as
so the way that we do this just to
define out the way that we send the
email first of all because we're using a
trait now we're just gonna say to this
and then we're gonna say send and this
is a new magic login requested class and
then into this we're gonna pass in this
and we're gonna pass in the options as
well so let's just pull in the email
facade up here and that's also pulling
that mail so use app mail magic login
requested and we can now move over to
this accept them to in and then start to
send this off so we get a user in here
and we get a list of options so let's go
ahead and set these so this user set
that to that user and then of course do
the same for the options as well so up
here we can set them in properties so
user options and now down here we can
start to figure out the view that we're
gonna do what we need to pass through to
the view and all of that other stuff so
the subject first of all sort of start
with something a little bit easier this
is just gonna be something like your
magic login link and then the view is
gonna be something like email or dot
magic dot link so that's keeping the
directory structure nice and tidy in
case we had need to add anything else so
that's going to views we don't have an
email folder so let's create that let's
also create an auth folder this could
just be if you wanted to email anything
else to do with auth you could do it in
there but in our case we're gonna have a
separate magic link folder which does
seem a little bit overkill but I like to
do this so it's nice and tidy from the
get-go and then in here we can just
create that link blade dot PHP file so
your magic link is and we'll leave it at
that just for now so lastly let's just
make sure that we pull in our app use a
model just in there because remember we
type painting it in here and we now need
to think about sending email so if we
just come over to our mail trap account
if you don't have a mail drop account go
ahead and sign up we're gonna create an
inbox here we're gonna set this up in
laravel it's just a fake email
in box just to allow us to very easily
send and test email safely so I'm gonna
create an inbox called fresh and when I
come over to this I will have a username
and a password that I can go ahead and
put into my environment file now laravel
is pretty much all set up to use mail
trap you can see that the host here is
set to mail trapdoor I oh we just need
to replace in the username and password
and we're pretty much done so very very
simple to get going testing these kind
of things okay so now that we've done
this then let's go over submit this
without email address and we should
receive an email it says go over and
there we go your magic looking link and
obviously we don't have any link at the
moment but you get the idea it's all
working ok so now we need to think about
what we're gonna be sending through to
this view now what we need to do is send
through the actual link we're gonna
build up the URL within here rather than
having to do it in the view because it
will get a little bit messy so in here
I'm just gonna say that the link is
going to use a method called build link
we can implement that just inside of
this mail class so let's create that
build link method and all this will do
is it will return a URL because we use
that to build up a full URL within
laravel it will be slash login slash
magic and we haven't actually set up a
route for this year but it will be X
here will be the actual token which will
then be able to look up in the database
using root model binding so let's just
for now implement this it won't work
because the viewed at the root doesn't
exist and the controller method doesn't
exist but this is basically how we're
gonna validate the token so all we need
to do here say this user token and then
the token column value and that's it now
we need to append on the query string
and remember that we have these options
passed through now this is an array and
in fact I'm going to type in up there so
we can use a PHP function called HTTP
build query and all we need to do is
pass through this options this will
basically take an array and it will
dropped a query string for us simple as
that so now we should actually have the
link in there the last thing we need to
do is just update this just here so in
here we can create an anchor inside of
here we can output the link and then in
the href we can output the link as well
and obviously you can make these look as
pretty as you want and they just need to
be variables like that okay so now let's
go ahead and test this again so let's
send the magic link we should get back
an actual link now and there we go so
we've got fresh start out 8,000 which is
obviously what I'm using here log in
slash magic then the token so huge long
token then remember equals zero because
we didn't check remember and then my
email address so we can test this again
by just going and checking remember me
hitting this coming over here and we
should see remember equals one so we can
use that when we actually manually
authenticate the user to see if they
want to be remembered or not so now that
we've actually sent a link obviously
this isn't gonna work at the moment but
before we start to validate it let's end
this part by just redirecting the user
and showing a friendly message so we're
gonna come over to our controller
because this is where we're gonna handle
this from over in here under auth magic
logging controller and just here we just
want to redirect back and go ahead and
display a flash message to the user so
to make this a little bit easier I'm
just gonna say return redirect to and
I'm gonna implement a property which
allows us to very easily control where
we want to be redirected back to when we
are or when we have requested a link so
I'm just gonna create a protected
property up here called redirect on
requested you don't need to do this but
I prefer to keep everything like this
the top just makes a little bit more
sense and this is just going to be login
slash magic so now we can just say that
when they have requested the link we're
going to redirect to this redirect
unrequested and then we're going to
implement some very very basic flash
messaging so I'm gonna say with success
and I'm going to set this to we've sent
you a magic
like so ok so now this obviously won't
show anything at the moment so we can
just very very quickly update our
template to actually show this now
obviously at the moment what's going to
happen is when I go ahead and actually
request something like so it redirects
us back here so what we can then do is
show a little message up here to say
that the link has been requested
so to very quickly set this up then we
are going to come over to our layout
over to app and down here just before
our content we're gonna implement a
little container that's going to show
our flash messages so this is really
basic flash messaging functionality but
you can go ahead and you know integrate
this with what you already have or
implement something a little bit more
robust so we're going to have a column
layout here and we are going to offset
this by two this will just match the
container that we have within content
and then inside of here we just want to
include some kind of partial so we're
gonna say layouts dot partials and then
we can create some kind of notifications
partial so under layouts let's create
that partials folder and in here let's
create that underscore notifications
blade dot PHP partial so inside of here
then to do this very basically we're
just gonna say if session success so
this is just laravel session helper then
we can just show a flash message so in
this case we're just gonna have say a
class of alert and we can go ahead and
give this a class of a success and in
here we just want to output the value
from the session success so remember if
we just head over to our magic login
controller this here will be picked up
here and then it will show this with
that value so now we can go ahead and
enter an email address hit some magic
link and that should redirect us and say
we've sent you a magic link so we'll
leave it at that so we've again covered
quite a bit here but now we're in a good
position to go in ahead and implement
the route for this to validate the token
along with the email address and
obviously going ahead and sign the user
in with the remember value
they've chosen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
