this tutorial we're gonna be looking at
how to include files into the page with
a click of a button using jQuery now
we've already established how we create
our functions in our Jay funk JFR and if
you haven't done this already this is
pretty easy to see here when we've
included this with a script we also have
included jQuery and they also have a
father I'm ready to include into my page
on the click of a button and that's
called scores dot HTML now this could be
any type of file such as HTML documents
which I'm going to be using in this
example we can also include PHP files
text files anything like that
the only thing that you'll find the
won't load using the load function are
things like images you would have to
modify header information and I'm not
going to be covering that in this
tutorial ok so let's first of all take a
look at the interface that we need to
create if I go ahead and look at the
page at the moment we can see that
there's nothing let's go ahead and
create a button which will initiate the
file loading into the page so the type
is button the value is going to be load
and we need an on click event and we
need to call a function when this
onclick event is initiated okay so let's
go straight over to in fact let's first
of all create the area that we want to
include this file to be put in so I'm
gonna say div I'm gonna give this div a
ID of content area so this is the name
that we're referencing from let's go
over to Jay func which is included on
our page so we can take advantage of
this separate file I'm going to create a
function called let's eat load file
now we're going to give this to
parameters that we can take in the first
one is the file and the second one is
going to be the area in which we want to
include the file so in this case I'm
just going to type with elements because
we're gonna choose an element where we
want to include it so let's go ahead and
actually call this function even though
we're not doing anything
so load underscore file remember we're
giving it two parameters the first one's
the file so we can determine that in
just a moment and the second one is the
area we want to include it in and this
is hash content area we're referencing
this div with a hash and then we're
giving the name that we've specified
just here now the file is going to be
scores to HTML and this is in the root
directory that we're currently working
in you can see it just here so let's
just type scores scores dot HTML so the
first thing we're passing is the name of
the file or visit obviously if it was in
a different folder you can use directory
switching and then the div to load in so
it'll load it just into here so scores
to HTML is just a HTML document with a
table and a list of scores next to each
name so I suppose we can go ahead and
just preview that and that's what it
looks like in its plain state without it
being included and you can see that
we've got the addition of a load button
when we refresh this page so the
function is going to be extremely simple
it's just one line we need to again a
reference to something that with where
we're putting something and this is the
element that we passed through and we're
going to say dot and we're going to use
load now this is the function that
actually loads the file in much like an
ajax way in ajax where you were to load
a file in however we're doing this on
just one line remember jquery can take
advantage of ajax functionality so here
is just going to be the farm and that's
essentially it so what we're doing is
we're pressing this button we're loading
scores to HTML into content area which
we've specified down here using this
function which is included on our page
so let's go ahead and see what that what
happens click load and you can see that
the file is loaded into the
Paige so as you can see this is a pretty
standard function and its functionality
simply just loads in a page so you may
be thinking why would you want to do
this well in some pages you may want to
by default load a file in for example a
PHP file you then might want to have an
additional function which then updates
that data for example you might want to
by default load this score in you might
have another button up here saying
change score or sort scores or something
like that now you wouldn't be able to
take advantage of the load functionality
in this case but you would have to use
requests and this is something that
we'll look at look at in another
tutorial however knowing this load
functionality exists is extremely useful
when you're just loading data into a
page from another source</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
