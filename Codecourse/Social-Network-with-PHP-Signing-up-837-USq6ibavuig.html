the application and this is pretty
straightforward there's not really too
much to do here
naturally laravel handles will our
validation via the requests that we
receive so it's pretty straightforward
so we're gonna start off by creating our
controller so over in app HTTP
controllers we're gonna create a new
controller in here and this is going to
be our earth controller so we'll create
this and I'm gonna go over to my home
controller and just copy and paste this
over just a safe typing everything out
again we do need a couple more things in
here but we'll look at them just in a
minute so we're gonna have one method
here which is gonna be get signup this
is gonna be the get request to the page
which will just display view and then
we're gonna have post signup which will
be posting the data through to this to
actually sign the user up in order to
get all of our request data we're
actually going to use request request
like this this will give us access to
the post data and it will also allow us
to just really easily quickly pass this
through to validate as well and to use
this we need to use illuminate HTTP
request otherwise this type in here
won't be found so let's start out with
our form and we'll build this form up
and then once we once you've done that
we can go on to actually sign the user
up so I'm gonna return here view or
signup all that means is that inside of
resources views we can create a new
folder called or just to keep everything
tidy I'm gonna have a new file in here
and we'll call that signup blade PHP and
let's just write signup in there for now
so we don't actually have a route
through to this get signup method so
let's open our routes file which
remember is just within here and we'll
go and create a new route for this so
let's just come
he's just so it's a little bit easier to
see so I'm gonna say home here I'm gonna
say authentication and we're ready to go
so we're gonna say route get there are
other ways of doing this but I'm just
going to be very explicit so this makes
a lot of sense so we're going to say get
sign up this is going to use our earth
controller remember it's under chatty
HTTP controllers and it's our earth
controller now and we're going over to
the get sign-up method and we're gonna
call this earth dot sign up we're using
these as a kind of namespace so we know
what we're doing so we keep all of the
or Thunder earth dot and there we go
we're pretty much done so we can go now
and we can refresh on sign up and I
probably forgot to change the name of
the earth controller
I did indeed this obviously do that when
we copy and paste things and when we
refresh we see sign up perfect so let's
work on our sign up view remember
without home template we extended the
default template so again I'm just going
to copy and paste this just to save a
little bit of time let's paste this in
here and instead of this content here we
need a form to sign the user up so if
you head over to the downloaded
templates as part of this course you'll
find the mark-up for the for the form
obviously you can go ahead and look at
this and see if it would be better off
modified for you but this is the general
mark up we're going to use we're going
to type all of this out and it looks
very much like this it's got your email
address choose a username and choose a
password so before we get going on this
form and before we forget we're just
going to update our navigation so when
we click through on here we don't go
through to a hash we actually go through
to that route so let's quickly update
that now so remember under templates
partials navigation we have a sign-up
link just here it's been here all we
need to do is say
root auth dot sign up and then when we
go over and refresh saber on the
homepage we can just click sign up and
we go through to this page perfect
so let's close off our navigator let's
close off home because we don't need
that
we'll keep routes open we're going to be
adding a new route in a moment but let's
focus on building up this form once we
submit it so remember a submitting
through to post signup so let's just
kill the page here and just say sign up
just so we know that we're being sent
through to this properly you could even
do a die dump and request just to see
what it's all about
and see what we have in there so we're
gonna create a new route here this time
though it's going to be a post request
to sign up and we can get rid of the
name and instead of get sign up here we
have post signup so what we want to do
then is under the signup form we want to
modify the action that's where the user
is submitted through to so we're gonna
say route or signup the reason we don't
need a new name for this is because it's
under the same name but we're sending it
through as a post this route here won't
be picked up but this one will so we can
share the name from them just makes
things a little bit easier so when I hit
sign up now we get a token mismatch
exception but we're gonna handle that in
just a moment but least we know it's
being posted through so the reason we
get a token mismatch exception is
because laravel by default has
middleware if you come under HTTP
middleware you can see we've got
verified cross-site request forgery
token and this extends the base verifier
so you can add exceptions here if you
don't want anything to be cross-site
request forgery protected but we're
gonna do that for all routes so we can
leave that so to actually remedy this we
need to include at the bottom of our
form our token which is generated with
every request from laravel and i like to
do this manually as well as all of the
form as well I know laravel does have a
form builder but I like to keep the
markup completely handcrafted
just in case I need to be very specific
with what I'm doing so here I'm gonna
have an input type of hidden the name of
this is going to be underscore token and
we have a value here which is session
token like that so well that's going to
do is it's going to output that token
onto the form if we just inspect this
form now you can see that the bottom
we've got a value here which is the
cross-site request forgery token and
that means that now when we go ahead and
submit through we see that Diane dumped
signup text that we output in our post
route okay cool so we are good on the
way to actually signing up but obviously
there's a little bit more we need to do
here the first thing we want to handle
is validation and then we want to add
some things to our form to output to the
user if anything has gone wrong along
the way so with laravel 5 and 5.1 this
is extremely easy we don't need to
create a new validated instance all we
need to do is say this validates we pass
in request which contains all of our
posted data and then we have this array
which will contain our names of our
fields and our rules so you can
obviously chop and change these I might
not include everything you may need or
may want but you can add to these it's
super simple too so this email is going
to be required it's going to be a unique
email on the user's table so this will
do a look-up on the user's table we want
it to be a valid email address and we're
gonna say we want it to be maximum of
255 so you don't have to do that but I
always like to so the next field we're
validating is the username so if we just
use this as a reference we've got email
username and password so the username
again we want to be required we want
this also to be unique to use us and so
alert us if there is any username that
already exists we don't have register
users for multiple usernames we want
this to be alpha dash
and we're gonna set this as max 20 so
the next one then is on the last one
it's the password and this is going to
be required and it's just gonna be a
minimum of six you can obviously include
more validation in there if you want so
what I'm gonna do down here is I'm just
gonna kill the page and say all okay
just so we know that this validation has
passed what will happen is here is this
will throw a new validation exception
and then it will redirect us back to
this to this page and it will give us a
ten errors that we can just start using
so at the moment when I hit sign up it
looks like nothing's happened but we
actually now have the error data within
this view so we can output the errors in
the form so let's focus on outputting
the errors just now if we head over to
the signup page we can start to add
these conditions in so what I'm gonna do
is for the email you can see that this
is separated by form group and what we
can actually do is on form group with
bootstrap we can add a class called has
error you'll notice that that will turn
everything red there including the input
so what we want to do then is we want an
if statement here to check if we have
any errors for the email field so we're
gonna say errors which now exists within
this view well it always will always
exists but it has relevant data in now
so if errors has email we want to output
the text has error now notice I've not
included a space here but I have
included a space here that just means
that we don't get an extra space always
included within the in between the
classes and then otherwise I want an
empty string so it's just a ternary
operator really being output as a string
it's pretty straightforward so now when
I click sign up we know that this has
gone red because we have an input and
it's a required field so I'm just going
to quickly do that for all of the other
fields so after form group we can paste
this in so its errors has user name and
then down here
Ares has password and of course you can
include a password confirmation as well
if you wanted to so I'm gonna hit sign
up and we see all Wed so we know that
this is working but where our error
messages well we can do that underneath
our input so just underneath here we can
go ahead and say if and we'll just end
our if there to start with I'm gonna say
if errors has email so exactly the same
as we did up here then what do we want
to do well bootstrap has markup which is
a help block so we have a span with a
class of help block like that so you can
write this markup out and then inside of
that help block we output our first
error so we say errors first email
pretty straightforward so now when I hit
sign up this the email field is required
perfect and if there was anything wrong
with that so if it already existed it
was too long then we would get the
relevant message there she can play
around without yourself so I'm going to
copy this paste it down here and change
this to username and this to username
and we'll do the same for the password
as well so if errors has passwords
helper the first password error refresh
hit sign up and there we go we've got
all of our errors and it's showing us
that there's an error too so what
happens if I enter some data in here so
that's not a valid email I don't enter a
username and I enter a password that's
too short and I hit sign up now we've
got the relevant error messages but our
data has disappeared now we want to keep
the data for email and username we want
to persist these so user can quickly
correct them up and they be on their way
to signing up so what we want to do then
for the email for the input which is the
text and that's the email under this
value attribute here we want to output
any old data that we
so all we do is we say request old
then we specify the field name which is
email if that is the case we want to
output that otherwise we want to output
nothing so all this is doing is it's
like a short ternary operator
we're outputting the old email otherwise
an empty string so when i refresh and I
enter an invalid email and I hit sign up
that day turnout persists okay so we're
gonna do the same thing for the username
we're not gonna do that for the password
we don't don't really want to output old
passwords on the form and we can just
change this now to use name so let's say
I sign up with my email address I choose
a username and I forget a password we
now have these two persisting and we can
just correct this before going ahead and
successfully signing up we get that all
okay string that we saw before
perfect so all this left to do now is
actually register the user and then go
ahead and redirect back with a success
message saying that we can go ahead and
sign in so to create a user we need to
use the user model so if we head under
the app directory just here we're going
to create a user model you can see that
one already exists here it's got lots of
data in here already
we've got our traits in here for
authentication authentic a table and can
reset password so what I'm gonna do is
I'm just gonna copy all of this I'm
gonna get rid of this here and delete it
and I'm gonna put this inside of a
folder in app just to keep things nice
and tidy and I'm just gonna call this
models so this is a very light structure
you wouldn't want to necessarily have
all of your models in one file you might
want to separate them by type but I'll
leave that up to you to do when your
application grows a little bit larger so
I'm gonna call this user dot PHP and I'm
gonna paste that in there and what I'm
gonna do here is I'm gonna get rid of
can reset password like that and I'm
going to get rid of the trait that's you
use just here
the contract that we implement here so
I'm just gonna get rid of that up here
as well so we end up with the
authenticator ball trait here we end up
with our base model which we're
extending here
and we have our contract there that we
implement on this user model and we have
the table that this is looking into
we've got the fillable fields which
we're going to modify in a moment and
then we have attributes that are
excluded from the JSON output if we were
to output this so we can leave this in
here but we're not gonna be doing that
so it doesn't really matter it's not
really relevant to this video and I'm
actually just for the sake of clarity
gonna get rid of these comments I
recommend you do have doc blocks on
everything that you create within a
model or a controller but we're just
gonna leave them out for now just so
it's easier to read the code so I'm
gonna bring these down into a list just
they're a little bit easier to read what
fields we want to be fillable well if we
look inside of our database we've got
email username and password you can see
that they're both there and well we have
name so we can change this to username
we also want first name last name and
location to be fillable so let's just
add these in now with even though we're
not using them just yet so first name
last name and location and I'm just
gonna pull these down as worlders I just
like to keep consistency so I'm gonna
pull them down there like that perfect
so now what we can actually do is we can
use this user model it's named space
under chatty at the moment and remember
we move that to the models folder so
it's chatty models now it's chatty
models user so over on our earth
controller we need to use chatty models
user and under here I'm gonna say user
create and then we can pass in all of
the fields we need to create a account
so this takes an array and there are
many other ways we
and create an account but this is just
you know very straightforward and simple
at the moment so this is absolutely fine
so we're gonna say email now where do we
get this data from in previous versions
of laravel you would have seen something
like input this input facade but we can
actually grab this from the request the
sent through so we can say request input
the email you can do the same for the
username and for the password this is a
little bit different so for the password
we obviously want to hash this and we
can use the bcrypt helper this is a
helper function within laravel to do
this so you can say request input
password there we go done so that will
have created a user account but we want
to redirect the user back to the home
page and then flash them a message we've
already looked at the alerts partial
that we created earlier
so all we're gonna do here is return a
redirect we're gonna go to the root home
and we're gonna say with info we can
also do with info like that whatever you
prefer it's gonna say with info your
account has been created and you can now
sign in and I'm just gonna pull these
down onto new lines just so we don't go
over too many columns ok perfect to be
validated we've already looked at
updating our form now we're creating the
user and we're redirecting so if
everything's gonna ok here I'm just
gonna move this up to here like that
just keep things nice and neat and I'm
going going to attempt to register so
just to confirm we have no accounts in
our database table that sends my email
choose a username choose a password hit
sign up
that's redirected us back to the home
page with your account has been created
and we can in fact see that that user
has been created there it's got the
right email username the
password these null values because we've
not set them yet and we have a created
an updated death date automatically set
using eloquent
so we've now registered a user that's
great but we now need to sign in so
let's jump over to the next video and
look at signing a user in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
