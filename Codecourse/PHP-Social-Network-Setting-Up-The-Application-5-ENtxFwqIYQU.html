now unfortunately we're not going to be
working on the social network
application itself for quite a while the
first thing that we need to get done is
the framework behind it so that's what
we're going to be starting on today now
the framework was inspired by laravel so
a lot of the elements that you'll see a
very similar and we're actually going to
be using eloquent as our 00 RM as well
so if you're familiar with laravel then
great this might be a little bit easier
for you if not don't worry I'll try to
explain everything as clearly as
possible so the first thing that we need
to do to get this ball rolling is to
create some sort of class to handle the
application so to do that we're going to
go into our vendor folder into mr. Terry
age and framework and we're going to
create a new folder and we're going to
call this call inside here we're going
to create a new file called application
whp we're going to have the namespace of
framework core and we're going to
declare our class up here now inside
here just for now at least we're going
to have just one method and we're going
to name this run and what this will do
is it will run the router it will start
the sessions it will register our error
handler it will initiate the the orm
which in this case is eloquent but for
now we're just going to echo method
invoked so back in our index file we're
going to first instantiate that
application class that we just created
so new framework call application and
then we're just going to simply call up
run so let's see what happens when we
run this in the browser we should get an
error okay so apparently we first have
to turn on error reporting
so to do that we need to first find out
where our PHP any file is so we're going
to just put in our index file PHP info
and somewhere around here here we go
loaded configuration file we're going to
copy this path and inside a vm we're
going to sudo nano this we're going to
use a search with ctrl w we're going to
look for display errors and we're going
to look for the next result and here
where it says display errors equals off
we're going to set that to on now we can
write that out with control oh and exit
with control x we're then going to
restart apache so soon though service
apache2 restart and hopefully if we get
rid of that PHP info hopefully if we
refresh we should get an error and
perfect class framework call application
not found and that's because we haven't
actually included it so what we can do
is say include vendor it's a very edge
framework call application of PHP and
that will fix the problem but as you can
imagine as we add more classes this is
going to get extremely impractical so it
looks like the only option is to create
some sort of autoloader well luckily we
don't actually have to because composer
will do this for us now before we get
started with that we just have to
correct one mistake I made in the
previous video so in this composed JSON
file here inside of our framework
directory we're going to take this out
take all of this out and we're going to
paste it into our our original
compositor Jason inside our chat
edirectory just like so and inside a vm
we're going to go to vagrant and we're
going to say composer dump auto load
so now all we have to do is require
vendor autoload and provided that I
didn't mess anything up our error should
disappear looks like I spoke too soon so
back in the composite of JSON file we
need to fix this path here so going to
make this vendor mr. Terry H framework
friend compose a dumb part or load again
a hit refresh and there we have it
everything is working fine again so now
that that's done we can go back to our
application class and we can just get
rid of this and now we're ready to move
on with the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
