to install the dependencies that we need
with composer
now if you've not worked with composer
before it's a dependency manager for PHP
and just allows you to pull down any
dependencies for your project so you can
basically port your projects around a
lot easier so don't be too worried it
works on pretty much all operating
systems go ahead and follow the download
instructions here once you have it
installed on your system you should be
able to run composer in either your
terminal or your command prompt and
you'll see the following options and
we'll work through how we're going to
pull down our dependencies so we only
have two dependencies here one is a
framework called slim so the slim
frameworks very powerful but very basic
to work with it's fairly easy to get a
hang off so don't worry too much about
this this is just going to help us along
the way I make this a lot easier to
build and we're also going to be pulling
in laravel database component just so we
can easily work without database so what
we want to do then is inside about empty
directory here called shorty we are
going to create a new file so if you
open up your text editor and create a
new file within your root directory here
we're going to call this composer dot
JSON so composer can read this file and
inside of here it's just JSON and we're
gonna choose the dependencies that we
require for our app so the first
dependency is slim Slim's documentation
gives you instructions on how to install
this so it's slim slim and then it's C
it's version 2 including the next
significant release so all we need to do
here is so slim slim and it's version 2
we're pulling in so now we want to pull
in aluminate database Solera files
database component so why don't we just
copy this paste it in here and then
we're gonna change this to 5.0 star so
now that we've got our dependencies
let's head over to the directory that we
working in within our terminal or
console and we'll see how composer
taught JSON file all we need to do is
run composer install and then we'll take
a look at what happens after this has
installed so that's now finished if we
look inside of our main directory you
can see we have this vendor folder and
that has more dependencies than we
required because the dependencies that
we have used depend on other packages so
these have all been downloaded and we
can include these in when we start to
build our app so in the next step then
we're actually going to be setting up
our slim app so we can navigate to it in
our browser and eventually create routes
for our project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
