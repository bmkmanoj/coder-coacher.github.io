number 12 in my new series called to
introduction to CodeIgniter what I'll be
showing you guys in this video and in
this next segment of the series will be
I'll be showing you how to build a basic
website will do things like page linking
you know like the basics of course
there's a code another way to do it
although so this the thing about this
website will be though
even though it'll look really stupid and
you know kind of feel really plain it
will be content managed from a MySQL
database which will be really cool and
interesting and I'll show you guys how
to do that this video specifically
though we'll be dealing with loading
multiple views mostly setting up for
that for the next video but this video
is very important so let's get started
first of all we'll go to the code matter
comm website download coding matter
we'll just click download code measure
right here save file open it up I'm just
going to copy this I'll go into my WW
folder and in my web server and I'll
just paste this here so right click
paste
and I'll just rename this this folder
basic site okay
next thing I want to do is open this up
in my text editor and we will get to
configuring this first thing I want to
do is get my mod my mod rewrite working
so I'll actually go into my old
tutorials if you don't know how to
access this um you can just go to look
up the tutorial where actually did this
issue and be that many videos that many
tutorials you go so I'll just copy up
copy this dot HT access folder or
information create the same file right
here pop that in basic site save it X or
both those two okay now we'll go into
our application config because if you
remember step number two for that is
getting rid of the index page
information so we'll save this next
thing we'll do is we'll run this we'll
check it out see if it's working and
sure enough it is so this is obviously
the default controller why don't we set
up four controllers then we'll go to our
controllers
there's the Welcome controller why don't
we create our own so I'll just copy this
over there your new file will call it
site PHP so that's an awesome thing to
call my controller rename it a site
in case you're wondering I will be going
a lot a lot faster in these videos the
first ones we're pretty slow but these
ones hope hopefully I'll be able to
speed up and keep most you guys
attention so uh so yeah first thing I
will do now that I've set up this
controller go to my routes and set up
the site controller is my default
controller and just test if this is
working haha that's a fail
sorry with that and there you go all
right we have changed the default
controller and we're loading the index
function in that next thing we want to
do is go ahead and create our home page
view so we'll go into controllers views
why don't we love this view first before
we can before you create it so we'll go
this load you we're going to call this
you underscore home same thing we did
last time now I'm going to use open up
the welcome message that PHP view we're
just going to copy this over create a
new know we'll just rename it to view
just go home type PHP wonderful will
kind of do what we did last time just
lead all this stuff delete all the
styling sucks or we just won't be easy
dozen second okay
okay now we'll check and see if this is
being loaded it
all right because I just change the
Welcome message view if I copy that
right now it's in my clipboard open this
control a delete control V put it all
back save that and there we go so now
we've got a whole bunch of nothing but
we can tell that this is the review
because I named the title home page
sweet next thing I want to do is we will
make it now under send this now we'll
create an unordered list and a couple
list items here Oh a a trip I'll show
you guys how to do this later
so website this website will have three
pages home about and contact next thing
I'll do is create the content give
yeah
okay and next I'll create a flutter
basic site comm - some bogus all rights
reserved or something like that that's
professional right save this take a look
wow that isn't awesome website I think
for this video we're going to leave it
at that and do some styling in the next
video and I'll show you the multiple
page views thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
