just having a look at how this works and
then we are going to set up a pub nub
account create an app go ahead and
install their SDK and we're ready to
start building this thing so I'm just
going to bring up a terminal on either
side I just have this split so I can
very easily work with it and I'm just
gonna run this file using PHP like so so
I'm gonna do this on both sides
assuming that two people are using this
even across the other side of the world
so I'm gonna join a particular room so
there's the ability to have multiple
rooms in here and I'm gonna go ahead and
connect with a username and that will go
ahead and connect me to that room with
that particular username so I can do the
same thing on this side I'm going to
join the same room but I'm gonna use a
different username and this also has the
ability to check if a user already has a
username taken so it will just ask you
to enter a new one so now I can do is
just start typing away and it works and
I can do this on the other side as well
and it's very very quick this is
actually in real time so just to exit we
just do a command + C and we're out and
we can go ahead and connect again if we
want let's just take a look at the
username checking that I just spoke
about so if I just very quickly
reconnect to someone this is actually
gonna be taken it just takes a while to
get rid of that user but if I go ahead
and connect to as Billy which we can see
over here then it says username taken
and we can go ahead and choose a
different name so that is pretty much it
but to be able to do all of this we need
a very good service that allows for
real-time communication and for this
we're going to be using PubNub so what I
recommend you do is go ahead and sign up
for an account what I really love about
this is that you don't have to enter a
card you don't have to pay for anything
to get started testing this out so go
ahead and sign in and we'll go over and
start to create an app now the first
thing that you'll notice when you sign
in is a demo project that's already been
created for you so what we can do is go
ahead and click on this and you can see
here we have a demo key set essentially
all these are just the public or the
publish key and the subscribe key that
we can use when we download the peer
P SDK now we're gonna be taking a little
bit of a look around this later when we
start to test out some messages we can
actually come over to this debug console
and actually check this out so once we
have these set up so what we need to do
then is download the PHP SDK and we are
of course doing this with composer so if
you go over to github I'll leave a link
to all of these in the course downloads
that you'll find the PubNub PHP SDK so
the package name here is just PubNub
forward slash pub nub so if you come
over to your terminal inside of the
directory that you're working in I've
currently cleared this out so we're
starting completely from scratch you
want to run composer require and then
paste this in and we'll wait for this to
download okay so now that this is done
we need to create our chat file you can
see here that we've got a composer JSON
file with the PubNub package in there
and the version we have a composer lock
file and we have our auto load that we
can go ahead and pull in so I'm gonna
create a new file we only need one file
for this entire thing and I'm just going
to call this chat dot PHP so we need to
pull in the pub nub library because we
actually need to work with this so I'm
going to use PubNub slash PubNub that's
just the namespace to the class and then
we're going to create a new instance of
this so we can use it so we're gonna say
PubNub and we are going to create a new
pub pub instance and into this we need
to pass in our keys so let's go over to
PubNub and have a look here so if we
click on this you can see we've got our
published key just here this is the
first argument to this I'm just gonna
pull this down so it's a little bit
easier and then we have our subscribe
key just here so let's copy this and
paste it into here and then finally we
have our secret key which of course you
don't want to reveal to anyone so if you
need any more information on the table
library of course there are lots and
lots of helpful things in here for you
to look at we're going to be covering
what we need to get this working but of
course if you want to go use this going
forward then go ahead and read this and
of course read the official document
so now we are pretty much set up so we
can subscribe to a channel and start
listening to things and in the next part
we're actually going to pull all this
together there isn't a lot of code at
all so let's go over and build this chat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
