another video in the tutorial series
where I'm building a registered login
registration system for a website using
codeigniter which is a PHP framework
before I actually get on to building out
the login views like I said I would in
the last video there's two things that I
forgot to do with the mod rewrite we
actually need to with mod rewrite and
the database class the first thing that
I forgot to do is actually configure if
you go into the config folder in the
application and the config file we
actually need to change this index page
we need to delete index dot PHP out of
here and then save it this is important
just because when we actually have this
mod rewrite well I will be getting
errors and things like that later on
unless we get rid of this right away
which is prot it's good practice to get
rid of this if you're going with a mod
rewrite technique of URLs the second
thing that I didn't show you how to do
is actually configure the database using
CodeIgniter and and the database class
so why don't we actually auto load the
database the database library go down to
libraries and database and while we're
at it we might as well also load
sessions the session library as well
so we'll save this will be using
sessions later on so just trust me
next we'll actually go into the config
folder and there's the database PHP in
here this is where we're going to enter
information about where the where the
MySQL server is so why don't we go to
our MySQL server what I will do is I'll
grab this yeah ok grab this number right
here for me few words it'll probably be
different
my username will be a user tutorial in
the database I'm connecting to is also
user tutorial and my password I cleverly
thought of a little foo bard
version of password because you know you
guys can notice I'm not actually worried
about you guys hacking my super secret
you know after this tutorial series is
over it's not going to matter to me at
all so so that's the password of my of
my database your username is not always
the same as your database the database
is actually like over here the database
that you're connecting to which will
have the tables in it the username will
be the username that you're connecting
to the database with and the password
will be password obviously host name a
lot of the times it's just localhost in
my case it'll be these numbers so we'll
save this and then if we just run our
installation of of coding writer if we
if we get errors okay there is okay we
have a session class we're required to
send an encryption key in the comp
config file okay let's not auto load
sessions for now then because I want to
show you guys encryption keys in another
video okay refresh this perfect so we're
not getting any errors which means it is
successfully connecting to the MySQL
database and we're good to go there
okay so why don't we actually go ahead
and start building this building our
first login view with a form helper so
the first thing we'll do is auto load
the form helper because in just about
every view we're actually using the form
helper we'll also auto load the URL
helper because we want to use that too
eventually
next thing we'll do is we'll go into the
Welcome controller and we're actually
just going to copy all of this and then
rename the file well I usually rename my
main controller main but obviously in
bigger projects you want to separate and
name these more applicable but this is a
very small project so we just have one
main controller open it up and then
rename
the class to Maine with a capital M and
then we'll save it next I can XOR this I
guess I didn't actually need to copy
that
perfect and then the view that I want to
load instead of welcome underscore
message will be login and then why don't
we actually create that view
so we'll just open up welcome message
copy it and then rename it again I don't
think I needed to copy login dot PHP
rename it to login dot PHP open it up
I'll close out of this other one perfect
and I just want a really basic looking
login login sheet login form so it's not
actually going to be it's not going to
look super nice just call this login
page get rid of all of this and we'll
just leave this container with the h1 so
login we'll save it now we'll just check
refresh this okay so it actually can't
find the Welcome controller get rid of
this and again right this is because our
default controller is still set to the
Welcome controller which doesn't exist
anymore so if we go back into our config
folder go to routes and then scroll down
you can see right here the default
controller is set to welcome we'll just
change this to mean save it and then run
okay right away and then you can see
that our we're loading the lot the main
controller and the index function of the
main controller it loads the login view
now I think we want to do this a little
bit differently let's just get rid of
some of this come to doubt code that's
nothing why don't we actually create a
function that a function that actually
loads the blogging view we'll just call
this login
and then what we'll do instead of
instead in the index function this will
actually just load the other function in
this controller so by doing that we can
just go this login so essentially it's
the same thing it's just it's better
practice to separate these so you can
see here we can also go login or sorry
main and the index function redirects to
the login but if I actually want to
specify login I can still go there as
well as index okay perfect
okay now let's build the login view or
we just voted time in this video why
don't why don't I stop it will actually
start and will start actually building
the login view in the next video thanks
