create a user registration form and how
to register a user into your - ql
database now one word of warning before
you start watching this tutorial I
suggest you check out my user login
tutorial I'm going to post a link it
should be up on the video now and I
suggest you check this out before now
the reason that I've created the user
login before I've created registration
it's a lot easier I find to do the user
login process before I do the
registration process because once I know
that I've got the login process right
and I've got all the fields in the
database that I need then I can start my
registration process I just find it a
lot easier to do it this way because
then you know what you're registering
into your database okay so to start with
in the first part we're going to create
our form and we're going to check for
the existence of what's been typed in
now a couple of sort of pre warnings I'm
using my from my existing tutorial like
I said check out the login session
folder which has got oh no that's yeah
well basically this is it and what I've
got is I've got my login session and all
my files in there but I'm going to
create a new folder a new file sorry
that's just some tags in there I'm going
to create this inside my login session
folder with the index or PHP which is
the main page yes or login logout and
the member page if users are logged in
and I'm going to save this as register
dot PHP as this is sort of a following
from this tutorial I'm creating a user
registration form so the user can
register before they decide to login
okay so I've created my register dot PHP
I'm also going to open my index file and
I'm going to create a link underneath
the form and this is going to be just a
link to that register page and I'm just
going to say
here register okay so what we've got
here then is a link same register which
goes to our page that we've got nothing
in at the moment so just following on
from this list from the last tutorial
where we could log in I'm just basically
creating a link to a page that we can
register before you do this because
before we were just typing data into our
database now if I just open up a new
window I'm going to go across to PHP my
admin and this is the table I used on my
note this area this is the database I
use is PHP login and this is my users
table you can see that I've added an
extra Field called name and I'm going to
go ahead and I'm going to add an extra
another field and called date just at
the end of this so at the end of table
and that's going to be called date and
it's going to be in date format so where
is it to date the other is so before
just before you get confused about what
this date is going to be it's going to
be this current date so the date that
the user is registered and we'll just go
and save that out so from the last
tutorial on the user login
we just had ID username and password but
now I've added a name so that's going to
be the user's name and then add the date
which would be the day that they
registered so this browse in here we've
got a couple of values and already I'm
going to do is I'm going to delete these
because I'm registering my users so I'm
going to start off with a clean database
assuming all assuming that I've got no
users at all and I've got a link here to
my register page and here's my register
page now I'm going to walk through a bit
of an HTML tutorial and tell you how to
create this page we're going to create a
form first of all and this is going to
be a self submitting form so it's going
to submit two back to register dot PHP
and we're going to create a table and
inside this we can have a row here and
they're going to have two columns so two
TD blocks here and the first one is
going to have your say your full-name
and you can split this up into first
name and surname I'll leave that up to
you to do but just for speed I'm going
to do this this way and then in our
second column here I've got my input
type of text and my name equals
full-name so you can see at the moment
and if you're confused about this I'm
going to go back to my original page
click on register and you can see that
I've got this is one column here split
down here and this is another column
with the with this input box in and I'm
also going to go up here and inside PHP
I'm going to echo out a header and I'll
explain a bit later why I have done this
okay so we've got that so at the moment
we have this and what I'm just going to
go ahead and do is I'm going to copy and
paste this down so make sure you grab
from TR from an TR I'm going to paste
that down and then I'm going to say
choose a username and obviously I'm
going to change this to use that name
I'm going to paste that again I'm going
to say choose a password now this
instead of text is going to be password
just to secure anyone looking over I use
a shoulder or any screen capture
software that's being used to sort of
infiltrate someone's computer and the
next one down I'll just I've just copied
and pasted this again it's going to be
repeat password or repeat your password
and again password and this can't be
this can't be set to password again so
I'm just going to set this to a repeat
password we're going to use this to
compare the passwords once they've been
submitted to see if the users made any
mistakes on up and the know me - you
need another field that's the last one
and one thing we do need is the date but
I'm going to do that when I am submit
the form okay so this is our form krei
let's go back and refresh okay so we've
got you can see how this is evened out
in a column that's why I've used a table
I like that we need a submit button so
underneath our table I'm going to create
a paragraph break and my input type here
is going to be submit my name is going
to be submit we need to check the
existence and the value is just going to
be register and let's refresh and there
we are and you can see that the password
fields have been blanked out and our
full name and I'll choose our username
is there for the user to type the values
in okay now I'm running slightly short
of time so I'm going to stop the
tutorial here if you're following this
step by step make sure you've got your
form written out and give a go design
the form as you wish I mean I wish I had
enough time to do it but I don't so go
ahead
create your form as you one do anything
you want to it change these labels just
make sure you've got your boxes and your
register and the next part we're going
to talk about checking that the users
typed each one of these required fields
in we're going to compare the passwords
to see if they're match I mean if you
say them two passwords these don't match
because they're a different character
length meaning the user can't register
because they might have made a mistake
I'm sure I'm sure
the majority of you watching have
registered at some point and you've had
to type your password in again and we're
also going to encrypt our passwords I'm
going to remove any dangerous or any
potentially dangerous HTML tags from
each form just to have a bit of added
security to your registration form okay
so I'll see you in the next part thanks
