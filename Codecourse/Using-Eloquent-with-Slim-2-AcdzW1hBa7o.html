component whatsoever we're going to be
looking at including eloquent which is
an object relational mapper as part of
the laravel framework so we're going to
take that and put it into our slim
project first of all let's just take a
look at what we can actually do with
this
so just in my browser here I'm able to
pass to a root a username and in this
example we're just getting back an array
but an array of all of the properties
within that row there so this is the
database table that we're going to work
with we have three users or have user
names obviously and then we have two
users with a first name and a last name
and one without
so this first method we're going to look
at involves creating a new capsule
instance setting our database settings
which sounds a lot harder than it
actually is
and then attaching out that to our slim
container which we can then use within
our routes or anyway where else within
our application and the second method
we're going to look at if we just look
at this this is the first method the
second method we're going to look at is
using this directly on our models so
here we did app DB and then we use
tableware and joined all of these
methods on to get the result we wanted
here we're using the user model and then
we're accessing where and then first as
usual and then what that'll allow us to
do is use methods on that model so for
example get full name or user name
here's my user model it's extending
eloquent and we can go ahead and use any
methods on there and then access
different values using this and then the
column name so this will give us the
following obviously if we switch over to
Dale there's no first and last name
there so we just get the user name back
so this can be incredibly useful and it
is actually really easy to set up so
we'll head over to writing the code now
we're gonna start with a very basic slim
- application structure and we'll look
at how we build this in so before we
Perle eloquent in we'll just take a
quick look around the structure of the
application that we're working with at
the moment just so you can get a good
idea of how to go ahead and implement
this based on my structure yours might
be slightly different and that's fine
but as long as you know what we're
working with here we'll make you a lot
easier to understand so in the browser
then at the moment I'm within the public
directory within the root directory
where my project is installed and we're
seeing a 404 because we don't have a
root for this /page so don't worry about
this too much for now so as I mentioned
we're in the public directory all index
dot PHP is doing is pulling in this
start file within this app directory
we'll look at that in a moment and then
we're running our slim application we
also have an HT access in here which is
rewriting our URLs which is really
useful when we're working with routes
obviously otherwise it's not going to
work so over to start dot PHP then all
I'm doing is requiring requiring in
composers autoloader
creating a new slim application and then
I'm requiring in a route which I've
stored in routes users profile so this
route then all it does is it is a get
request to this URL here so users and
then a username placeholder we're
putting in that variable here we're
using app because we need to access app
within this route and then we can just
do anything we want in here so for
example we just echo hello out if we say
users Alex we just see hello at the
moment so what we now need to do then is
go ahead and pull in eloquent so we do
this obviously within our composer JSON
file and it's also worthwhile noting
that I am psr-4 autoloading under the
composer namespace and this folder is
here and it's in aapko courses at Koko's
that's just so we can create our models
directory and we don't have to require
everything that we need in so we now
need to pull in eloquent you
we quickly head over to the packages
page for this you can see we're on
version 5 so what we can do is we can
pull in illuminate database like so and
then we can pull in version 5 like so so
what we want to do now then is update
our composer dependencies that will go
ahead and download eloquent for us or
the database component of laravel so now
that that's done we obviously have this
installed here and various other
dependencies so we can start to connect
up to our database and then inside of
start we're going to add our database
connection as a object within our slim
container so why do then is I create a
new file inside of my app directory and
I'm going to call this database dot PHP
this is just basically brown gonna load
up my database and give it all my
settings and then we can include this
within start so we need to use
illuminate database Capshaw which is an
easy way of pulling these kind of
dependencies in manager as capsules
recording it capsule so we're going to
instantiate this and now we want to add
a new connection which is what's going
to actually connect to our database so
we're going to say add connection we
have an add connection method we pass an
array in here and we can choose things
like the driver which is going to be
MySQL in my case although it can be
whatever you want whatever supported we
have our host here which for me is just
a local host we also have the name of
the database in this case it's project
you can see that just here and for the
username
and password for me I'm just working on
my local machine its root and root and
we want to also supply a char set as
well for a character encoding just gonna
be utf-8 we have a collation here that
we can set so utf-8 unicode CI and we
also have the ability to prefix but I'm
not going to choose that so I'm going to
have no prefixing so now what we want to
do is to be able to use this as globally
across our application we're going to
set this capsule instance is global and
then what we're going to do is
specifically boots eloquent so that's
what we need to do so now that we're all
connected up we need to make this
available within our slim application so
we can use it within routes and when
we're going to work with models directly
this won't matter this is just if you
want to use the database functionalities
like the query builder and not directly
attached it to your models but it's
worthwhile doing this anyway just in
case you need to so the first thing that
we want to do then is include this in
start PHP and then we say app DB we're
essentially attaching this to our slim
application and all we need to do here
is return a new capsule instance so now
we don't see any difference here because
we're not doing anything within profile
but let's do a var dump on App DB from
within here now and you'll see it looks
like we have an error so let's just
quickly turn arrows on
now refresh ok so class capsule not
found its start of course what we do
need to do here is import it so over in
here remember we use this all we need to
do is copy this and just pop it at the
top just here get rid of this snaps we
shouldn't see any more errors so here we
are doing a var dump on capsule and you
can see that we've got pretty much what
we need out of this so now what we can
do is within profile we can start to use
the query builder to build up a query so
we know that we're getting this user
name here we can echo username out here
if we wanted to
that just mimics whatever we pass
through into the URL but what we want to
do is we want to grab this particular
user from our database table so we're
gonna say app DB and it has all the
functionality now of eloquent you can
read read up on the laravel manual if
you're not too sure about eloquent I
assume you are though if you're watching
this video and we can select the table
so in this case it's the users table and
we have this table just here and we can
then say where username is equal to
username and we can do a var dump on
user now obviously this is going to give
us back an array cuz we're not working
with an object in this case we need to
use first to grab that record so we just
see an array of four items which is the
ID username first name and last name but
this isn't great because we don't want
to have to keep building up queries
every time we want to do things we want
to make things a little bit easier to
work with and make our code a lot more
efficient a lot more reusable and just
genuine generally a little bit nicer so
we're going to get rid of this we
already know how to bring eloquent into
slim but what we're gonna do is we're
gonna create a model and see how we do
this so like I mentioned the star I'm
psr-4 so loading this app code course
directory
under the code course vendor namespace
so all I need to do then is mimic this
and say code course models just rename
this to models and create a new user
model that's obviously a class user and
we're going to namespace this under code
course models so what we now need to do
then is use eloquent on this model much
like we would do in laravel so all we do
is at the top here we use illuminate
database eloquent model and you can say
as model if you want to but I tend to
just say as eloquent in that way we can
extend eloquent and then we get all of
the lovely functionality from this ORM
so let's try this out now by saying
something like user equals user where
user name and then that user name we get
back and then let's grab the first
record and we'll do a var dump one user
now obviously this is going to fail
because we need to import this at the
top here we need to say use code course
models user and when we refresh now
let's just check this ever go extends
and there we go so we get this model
back here perfect so now what we can do
is start to implement functionality like
get full name or user name much like we
would do just within laravel and for
example we could check if the first name
is empty or the last name is empty and
if that's the case we can just return
the user name otherwise we can return a
string
with that users first name space and
then that uses last name between the
profile now we can do a var dump on user
get full name or user name and there we
see that Fidel this will just be the
user name because she has no first and
last name so there we go we have
implemented eloquent into our slim to
application we can either use the
standard query builder or we can extend
eloquent on our models and then use all
of the functionality that eloquent gives
us and it's as easy as that you now have
really great database support within
your slim to application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
