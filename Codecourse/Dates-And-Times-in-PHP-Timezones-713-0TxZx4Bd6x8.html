work with when you're working with dates
and times is time stamps so in this
video we're going to look at how Carvin
handles time stamps when we're creating
dates however you choose to do that and
we're going to refer to the source code
to see where we can specify time zones
and there are a couple of ways that we
can do this so first of all let's take a
look back to creating a date now
remember we just say carbon now like
that and let's go ahead and just far
dump this and see what we get out we've
already seen previously that we get a
time zone type and a time zone here this
is defaulting to UTC so if we go ahead
and look inside of the source so let's
just pull open this however you've
downloaded it and we go ahead and look
for now you can see that in most of
these methods we have this t z argument
that we can pass in and t z just stands
for timezone so anyway you see this you
know that you can specify a time zone so
all we need to do then is within here
specify a time zone so for example
Europe slash London you can find a list
of time zones that are supported and
that you can use within PHP state time
class remember that Carbon extends date
time if you take a look at the top of
this class so we can use all of the
functionality from data time so go ahead
and these up in the PHP manual if you're
not too sure but now when we go ahead
and refresh you'll notice that now we
see time zone Europe London and you
would have seen the date change that
other time changed there as well so if
we just take it back to its default
you'll see that the time will change
when I go ahead and refresh and that's
gone from 22 back to 21 so we're now
specifying our time zone really really
easily using carbon so what we're going
to do now is look at another way that we
can do this so for example we could say
create from date if that's what you
wanted
so we can go ahead and type in date here
with m3 argument you can do the same
with time as well and eight time and you
can go ahead and do exactly the same
thing so if we look at the crate from
date method you can see that we can pass
in the year the month the day and also
the timezone so we can go ahead and
specify that just in here with whichever
timezone that we're working with so I
would encourage you to go ahead and look
at the source and you'll find anywhere
else that you're actually able to pass
in the timezone this is really really
helpful so we can have our timezone
stored somewhere within our project
perhaps in configuration or if you're
allowing users to set their own time
zone that'll be in your database and
then whenever you need to create a new
date with carbon you can just go ahead
and pass that value in really easily and
everything will match up now there is
another way that we can do this we don't
have to pass it in as an argument so for
example we could say carbon now let's
just return back to a UTC time zone what
we can is we have a couple of methods so
we can say T is ed for time zone and we
can go ahead and specify it this way so
Europe London and when we go and refresh
we see we get Europe London and we can
also say set time zone as well if you
want a method that's a little bit more
descriptive that does exactly the same
thing so that's how we work with time
zones in carbon anything you now do with
this date is going to be under this time
zone so that's extremely handy tonight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
