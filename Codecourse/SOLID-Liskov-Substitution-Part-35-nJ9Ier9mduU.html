at the L in solid which stands for LSB
which stands for let's call substitution
principle Uncle Bob describes this as
derived classes must be substitutable
for their base classes so let's have a
look at this I have a car which I'm
creating here I have a driver which I'm
creating annum in certain car using
dependency injection then I'm calling
driver go so let's look at this we have
I drive the file I'm injecting a car as
you can see and I'm calling driver go
here so all this does is called this car
drive which we can see in our car class
now what the Liskov substitution
principle is saying is if I was if I was
to change this to an Astra then this
would still work which it will because
if we have a look at Astra it extends
car so it's going to inherit this this
drive method so if we change this to
beetle which I have here that also
extends car so this code is still going
to work and that's all the d LSP is it's
probably out of the five principles in
solid it's probably the easiest
principle to get your head around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
