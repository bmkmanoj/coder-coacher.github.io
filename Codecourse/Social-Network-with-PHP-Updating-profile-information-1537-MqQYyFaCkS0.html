going to give users the ability to
update their profile and we're going to
keep this very basic but of course you
can add as much as you want here so you
can allow the user to enter information
about themselves in any way at all
you can follow the same structure and it
will be very easy for you to update this
so to start out we need to add to our
profile controller let's just close
everything off that we may not need at
the moment and let's focus on adding in
these edit methods into our controller
so we need a page that will render the
form for a user to be able to fill out
their information so here we're going to
say get edit this is just going to
return a view and of course with other
things that we've done we have a post
version which will actually store this
information in the users account so
we'll start with get edit and we'll
return a view which is going to be
profile dot edit so over in our views
here that's gone to profile we already
have our profile index I'm going to
create a new file here we'll call this
edit blade PHP and we'll go ahead and
we'll take the template structure from
home again just just save a little bit
of time and we'll get rid of this
content in here so again as part of the
course downloads you'll have the form
data in here so I'm just gonna paste
that in and we'll indent this so we've
just got a header let may have a form
here with the first name last name and a
location and an update button so we can
check out what this looks like in a
moment when we've added our route so
let's update our route in HTTP so our
routes file so for the user profile we
can add this in now a user can only
update their profile if they are
authenticated so I'm going to make sure
I add in my middleware for auth that's
really important otherwise anyone will
be able to access the edit profile page
and this doesn't necessarily matter
because they're not gonna be able to do
anything they're not signed in but it's
good to actually include this anyway so
let's add our first route which is being
able to view the form
this is gonna be profile forward-slash
edit of course you can choose any name
or your our path you want for this and
again I'm just gonna copy and paste this
uses and ours just to make life a little
bit easier so it's get edit it's not get
profile and this is going to be profile
edit and of course we have the same
thing here for the post we don't need as
we need to just change the method to
post and we need to change the method
name to post edit so let's have our
middleware in now before we forget so
it's middle we're and then here it's off
you can of course create a group around
these two for this but we'll just be a
little bit explicit here anyway so we'll
do the same for this one so if we're not
signed in we're not going to be able to
access this or this route simple as that
okay so let's go and check this out
we'll update our navigation so we can
actually click on this button first of
all so let's head over to our navigation
here and down here if we are signed in
remember we see this update profile URL
so let's say route profile dot edit and
if we refresh and click on update
profile we see that form so we can enter
a first last name in the location we can
hit update and that will go through to
our post route so let's go over to our
edit blade up hitch pin farm and we'll
update the action to reflect that so
it's route profile dot edit and once
again we're following the same steps
that we did when we registered a user
and logged in and things like that so
when I hit update now we get a token
mismatch exception so we need to add
that in so let's go down to the bottom
of the form we have a hidden input here
the name is underscore token and the
value here is session token so let's add
in using the session facade and the
token method now we can hit update and
that's now showing our method that we
created for our get or post edit rather
so over on our profile controller for
post edit we need to be able to access
our request information
so once again we say request request and
then we can start to validate and do
everything that we need to do so we're
gonna say this validate first argument
is the data the 2nd is the array of
validation options for each field so we
have first underscore name now we want
this to be alpha and we want it to be a
maximum of 50 you can obviously change
these rules do what you want here so
have a last name as well and we're just
going to say exactly the same thing then
we have a location and that's going to
be max of 20 and of course here you can
allow people to edit their username if
you want you can do whatever you want if
you want more columns in your database
you can you know create more form fields
and allow them to edit anything so let's
kill the page here and just say all ok
again just so we can get through the
validation so here when I hit update you
can see we get all ok and this is
because none of these are required so
this is just working as normal
we don't necessarily have to have a
first and last name or location but if
we were to type in say 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 4 4 5
into there and hit update
we're just redirected back with some
errors so we need to handle these errors
now okay so the first thing that we need
to take into account is if a user
already has a first name we need to
output this in here and here and if they
already have a location we need to
output that in there so let's just
handle that quickly now so for the first
name then for the text value here we
need to output the database value and
we're going to do something else here
that may not make sense at the moment
but it will do a bit later on so we're
gonna say auth user first name so we're
gonna output that if that doesn't exist
we're gonna output the old request data
and we saw this on the other forms as
well so requests old first-name that
means that if they have submitted a
first-name and it's wrong so 1 2 3 then
they'll see the request data and we can
copy and paste the
down and do that for the last name as
well so it's just changed this to last
name this to last name and we can do the
same for the location as well so it will
just paste that in there we'll change
this to location like so so let's
refresh make sure we didn't break
anything and what I'm gonna do is I
actually manually update these in the
database
so i'm gonna change my first and last
name and I'm gonna set my location to
London UK and I'll actually see them
then appear in there so if I was to say
1 2 3 and I hit update we're now seeing
my name appear so what in fact we need
to do is we need to reverse this check
so let's just do this so we need to
check for a request old data first let's
actually get rid of this and we'll start
again so we're gonna say if request old
first name we want to output that
otherwise we want to output Earth user
first name so we'll do this for all of
them we'll just copy and paste these
down again so we have a last name here
last name there and the same for the
location as well so I'll paste that in
change the location so that makes sense
in that order
so now we still see Alex Garrett London
UK if I was to do 1 2 3 the validation
fails and we have old request data in
there so we can go ahead and output it
to what we want ok so now that we've got
that let's deal with the actual errors
so remember we have this form group div
here which can contain has error so we
need to check if this particular field
has an error so we just say errors has
first name if it does we output has
error otherwise we output nothing and we
can do the same thing for the last name
and we can do the same thing for the
location as well so the first and last
name need to be alpha I think we set the
location as a max of 20 so let's go
ahead and try and trigger an error on
this as well so let's just enter a load
of rubbish in here hit update you can
see that these will go red so the last
thing to do on this then is just output
the first error for each one so again
under the input we have a if statement
here and we'll end that if there and we
just say if errors has first name again
we have our span here within bootstrap
which is a help - block then in here we
can say errors first and we'll grab the
first first name error we'll copy and
paste this down for our last name and
we'll change this as well and again for
the location so it's exactly the same
thing to pull this in a little bit and
there we go so we would submit similar
information through so I'll just do one
two three and then I'll just do a load
of rubbish in here and there we go so
the first name may only contain letters
location may not be greater than 20
characters perfect so if I was to hit
update here you can see we get all okay
and we can actually now store this
information so our form is complete so
over in the profile controller then
instead of dying dumping all okay we're
going to access the currently
authenticated user that's with auth user
and we need to use the author facade up
here as well and we're going to say
update and then we pass an array of the
columns that we want to update for this
user and that is first name
and remember we use that request up here
input first name will do the same for
the last name and we do the same for the
location like so and then obviously once
we've done that we can go ahead and
redirect them to the profile edit page
with some information so we can return a
redirect to profile edit with some info
and I'm just gonna pull this down onto
multiple lines just to make it not too
long so your profile has been updated
great so let's try and update this then
let's just change the first name let's
change the last name and we'll change
the location hit update there we go so
your profile has been updated you can
see my details have now been updated
there and obviously that's reflected in
the database as well so you can
obviously extend this and add more
fields and then you can go ahead and
just append to this list of updating
obviously you can change the validation
and if you do include any other fields
you can add more validation rules as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
