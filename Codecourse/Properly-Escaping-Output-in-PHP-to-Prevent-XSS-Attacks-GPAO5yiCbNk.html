about escaping output within PHP why
it's important we're going to take a
look at a couple of small things that
you should pay attention to and then
we'll look at the function in PHP that
allows us to do this so we're gonna look
at this example here you can see at the
moment it's just outputting hello and
then a name - hello Divya and if we head
over to the page that's outputting this
you can see that we've got a variable at
the top the first thing we're going to
talk about is what data we should
actually escape when should we escape
data and the answer to that is anything
that comes from any external source now
in this case we wouldn't necessarily
need to escape this we know that this
data is hard-coded in it's just a string
this shouldn't change so this is just
within our page and we're just
outputting the name so I guess in this
case we wouldn't need to however if any
data that you are outputting to your
page comes from any other source so for
example your own database an API
somewhere a file anything that the user
is passing in to the application that is
being output needs to be escaped if you
are outputting it to a page so for
example you could have something in the
URL that allows you to pass in say a
name and if you're outputting that data
directly to the page you need to be
escaping this when you output it we're
not going to be talking about sanitizing
data into your database or any other
source we're focusing now on outputting
any data you previously stored or you're
getting from another source
so let's take a look at how this could
be a problem at the moment it's fine but
for example let's say a user submits
something or store something in your
database with some script tags now
JavaScript function to just alert
something out looks like this in this
case just one is going to be output in a
dialog box so as soon as we refresh you
can see that we get this output you
might not think this is a problem at all
but this is called cross-site scripting
and all it means is the the user has
constructed something in such a way that
some JavaScript can be run and that
means that anything
can happen really you your users could
be redirected to another page
they could have cookie stolen and you
they could Forge a user login
there are various problems that can
occur from using script tags when you're
outputting so we need to make sure we
take this into account now we need to
understand why this is actually
happening and the reason for this is
that hTML is obviously made up of these
characters so for example a less than
sign a greater than sign etc etc there's
a few other things that we need to take
into account we'll be looking at the PHP
manual as well to see what the function
that we're going to be using actually
does escape so if we go ahead and just
referred I guess we can refresh the page
and just view the page source we can see
here that we are getting these script
tags output just as normal and that
means that the browser is interpreting
them and it's going ahead and running
this JavaScript within it what we need
to do our goal for this is to convert
these so these greater than and less
than signs to HTML entities and all that
means is that when we are placing them
on the page they're not interpreted as
HTML they're still rendered as these
characters so you'll still see script
script script but they won't actually be
interpreted and run so let's take a look
at how we can do this so the first thing
to take into account is the character
encoding on your page this should be
utf-8 in I guess all circumstances so we
should be using utf-8 as our character
encoding now if you're not too sure what
this is or why it should be utf-8
there's a really great site called utf-8
everywhere org I would highly recommend
you go ahead and just read through this
and also have a little search around and
just find out more about utf-8 encoding
and what exactly what's involved in
using this and that will give you a good
basis of why we're using this and this
really ties into the HTML special chars
function that we're going to be using in
PHP to convert special characters to
HTML entities so
let's now focus on using HTML special
chars within some kind of helper
function in our application so we can
use it whenever we're outputting
information so let's get rid of these
script tags just for now and just return
to the original state of this so we
don't get that JavaScript alert come up
and let's go ahead and inside of this
functions dot PHP file which is just
floating around in this root directory
you can obviously place this way you
need we're going to go ahead and require
this in so let's require in function
stop PHP and we can now use any
functions that we define in here so
let's create a function called escape
now this could be called anything you
want as long as it's convenient and easy
for you to use every time you need to
escape something e is a really good name
for one because it's just easy but in
this case we'll just be a little bit
more explicit and call it escape so
within this then we want to be able to
pass in a string and we want to be able
to return something for now let's just
return string so all we're doing is
passing this in and returning it and we
can use this to wrap anything that we're
outputting in this so you can see the
benefit of using something like e it
makes it a little bit easier so when we
refresh OOP so we've got a little error
here and it's just refresh here so we
get no different at all there's no
difference in the output it's just
basically returning the same string now
let's focus on the HTML special chars
function of Z chars
stands for characters so what this
function is going to do is it's going to
convert any special characters which
we've spoken about already so for
example a less than a greater than sign
single and double quotes and ampersands
as well and it's going to convert them
to HTML entities and you can see the
entities just here now again these are
just rendered as you would actually see
them on the page rather than being
interpreted by the browser so let's go
ahead and look at the arguments we need
to pass through this
the first one is going to be what you
actually want to convert so the text
that you want to convert in this case
it's just what we pass through to this
function the second is going to be the
flag that you use to determine the level
of conversion for these so commonly you
reduce something like int compact so
this will convert double quotes and
leave single quotes alone so this is
just sort of a standard general-purpose
int quotes will convert both double and
single quotes now bear in mind these
will automatically do the less than and
greater than sign in the ampersand so
these two options here which are the
most popular are just going to be
concerned with whether they basically
convert double and single quotes you can
also use end no quotes which will leave
both Dublin single quotes unconverted
this is useful if you are outputting
content within attributes if you do have
problems with basically outputting
anything within attributes you might
find that double quotes within that data
is going to miss your page up so you've
got a few options here and we're gonna
be using int compact or we could use end
quotes it's really up to you I mean it's
it's good to just test around with the
kind of data you're using and outputting
so let's go ahead and use Inc quotes
just to convert both single and double
quotes so we just paste that in there as
the second option the third option is
the character encoding which we know
from our page by including this meta tag
here that our character encoding on our
page is a utf-8 this is so important so
as long as you have this defined on your
page and you have this defined here you
are good to go
so we now completed this escape function
and let's take a look at how this
differs from what we saw earlier when we
added our script tags so when we refresh
here again we see no change it's just
going to add a double quote here just to
see what happens so you can see we've
got a double quote there when we view
the page source we now see ampersand
quote and then
a semicolon so that in fact is still
showing on our page as a double quote
but it's actually an HTML entity so now
let's look at a more extreme example
where we might be vulnerable to an XSS
attack and let's do the same as we did
before by alerting something on here
which could obviously be a massive
problem now you can see the difference
just by using this escape function that
we've created we're seeing this but it's
no harm to our users
because it's not being interpreted by
the browser and it's not running this
JavaScript within it so again let's view
the page source and we can see here that
we're getting less than script greater
than alert 1 and then less than and
greater than again so although we're
seeing this script tag it doesn't really
matter at all we don't need to strip
these tags you can do if you want to if
you have a good reason to but you don't
need to use a PHP function to strip out
tags in output it really doesn't matter
as long as you are converting these
characters these special characters to
entities then you are all good to go so
that is pretty much it there's a couple
of points we've addressed like the
character encoding of your page how to
properly use the HTML special chars
function the different levels of
converting we can do of the special
characters to entities and then more
importantly defining the character
encoding so everything's done properly
and nothing slips up anywhere so a quick
security tip there for when you're
outputting any data from a source that
you're unsure about and you can go ahead
and use this today just to help you
prevent against XSS attacks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
