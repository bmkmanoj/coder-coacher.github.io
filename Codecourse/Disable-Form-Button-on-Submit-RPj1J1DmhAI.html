we can implement the disabling of a
button when a form submits and changing
the text of that button as well so let's
say you have a form that you want user
to fill out so maybe you want to it for
them to enter their name or something
you want to go ahead and allow them to
hit a submit button now if this submit
process is going to send an email or is
going to insert some data into a
database or do something that you don't
want to be submitted twice perhaps
making a payment anything like that you
may want to go ahead and disable the
button so that if the web server is
taking a little longer to respond and
it's you know the web page is loading
while it posts this data then you might
want to disable it and maybe our little
message here so what we're going to be
doing is implementing a form and we're
then going to go ahead and use jQuery to
find this button within this submitted
form and go ahead and save lit and
change the text within it as well so his
little example this doesn't actually
post anywhere we've just done a return
false on the event handler and we'll
take a look at what that means in a
minute but basically I can go ahead and
enter any information here I want
obviously nothing here works and I can
go ahead and click send so all this is
now done is it's disabled the button so
I can no longer click on it if we go
ahead and spec this you can see that
we've got disabled the disabled
attribute equals disabled so this is now
disabled and I can't click or do
anything with it and the value of this
is now please wait now we also have this
data submit value and basically this
allows us as a web developer to
customize what we want to show here on
specific instances and the class up here
defines that we have a form that we can
actually have a button in here that just
does disabled and this will work with an
input type of submit so an input element
but this will also work with the button
as well so it works with different
elements as well so let's go ahead and
start writing out the code that allows
us to do this
okay so over to our text editor I'm not
going to go ahead and waste time
actually building this form or using or
inserting jQuery in here so he can use
it but I'll go ahead and take a minute
to explain just what however things set
up here so we've got basic document
markup we've got a form here an action
of hash we're just not really submitting
anywhere this is just an example in
reality obviously this would go to a
specific location we've got a method as
well and we've got two elements within
this form so the first one is an input
type of text which basically just looks
like this it allows a user to enter the
name fairly straightforward we have a
placeholder in there as well not really
important in this example but it helps
so we also have an input type of submit
and a value so that just has this
element here which is sent so whatever
we apply as our action this will then
submit to so you see that's just
submitted that data within that form to
hash we're going to ignore the fact that
we you know this is a functional form
it's not functioning properly we don't
need it to so it's not really doing
anything useful
now the next thing that we want to take
a look at is that I've included jQuery
here from Google hosted libraries so
however you're serving jQuery whether
it's a local copy a CDN copy or Google
CDN or hosted library's copy that's fine
and I also have a link to an external
javascript file which we're going to be
writing the code in for this so that's
basically it we're going to make a few
modifications to this form including the
submit element as well and we'll write
the JavaScript along with this so first
of all within the mark-up let's take a
look at how we actually want this to
work well for every form
I want this functionality to work on I
want to go ahead and give this a class
and this class is going to identify the
forms that will whose input submit
button or button will be disabled so I'm
going to go ahead and call this form
disabled you can go ahead and give it
whatever your name whatever name you
feel appropriate as long as you target
this when we create the event handle
later now with the input type
of submit we do want to go ahead and add
data attribute to this in a moment we
can look at a short way of doing this
and then I guess a long way of doing
this so let's go ahead and create the
event handler for this and we need to
use a jQuery selector first to do a
jQuery selector on the class of form
disabled and then we use the on method
to basically create an event handler so
I'm going to say on submit so this
basically means that when the form is
submitted via a button then this event
handler will be triggered so you also
have a function here so we have a
callback which does something when the
form submitted in this case what I'm
going to do is I'm going to console.log
submitted and then I'm going to go ahead
and return false and what return false
will do is it will stop the default
behavior of this button the default
behavior of this button or the form
rather will be to go through to this
action sending the data in the method
that we provide so we're just returning
false so it doesn't do anything if we
take a look at the console when I hit
Send now it's just submitted and nothing
happens so we're not submitting to the
hash that we saw before we're just doing
nothing and this is just for an example
purpose you wouldn't include return
false normally on a form you'd want it
to submit through you know to wherever
you want it so we'll leave return false
therefore the purpose of this tutorial
just so it's you know we can see how
button actually working so what I'm
going to do inside of here is I'm going
to create a variable called self which
is going to reference the jQuery object
this and this is just going to allow us
to easily reference self and you know if
we want to find something so I'm going
to come down here and tab in and I'm
going to create a selector or a fine use
the find method and pass in a selector
for the input type of submit so the
input field so the input element with
the type of submits or type attribute or
a button let's go ahead and create this
variable so button equals self we're
referencing what we've just created
above fine so either the find method and
then we pass in a selector
in this case it's an input and we need
to do an attribute selector so it
creates square brackets let me say type
equals and then we look for which type
we want which is submit and we comment
seperate selectors to select multiple
and in this case I just want to select
button so in this case button now
references this here so we can go ahead
and use that to change the value let's
go down then and actually create the
functionality so I'm going to say button
dot and I'm going to use the attribute
method to change a specific attribute or
add an attribute in this case it's
disabled so I give the name of the
attribute and then the value of the
attribute as well so let's take a look
at how this works so the first thing
we're doing is referencing the form
itself and then we're using the find
method to find the input within the form
so when we go ahead and refresh here and
click send you can see that that is now
disabled so now what we want to go ahead
and do is actually change the value of
the form button or the button so I'm
going to go ahead and just tab down here
just to make things look a little bit
easier to have to do this we can
actually just probably go ahead and
append it to the end so I'm going to say
dot Val so the vowel attribute will
change the value of this and I'm just
going to change this to please wait so
when I go ahead and refresh now not only
does that disable it actually changes
the value as well too please wait so
we've got the functionality we need but
how about making this a little bit more
flexible so I'm going to do is within
the form itself I'm going to go ahead
and add a data attribute onto this field
so I'm going to call this data submit
value and I'm going to give this a
specific value so I'm going to save
please wait or just wait for example
just so we can see that this works
little bit differently so what this is
going to do now is rather than
actually change this to please wait we
have a hard-coded value in here we're
going to pick up this data attribute
this value here and then change it
accordingly because what if we had two
instances of this form well we might
want one to say just wave me white might
want one say please wait
we never know so we're going to make it
as flexible as possible so what we need
to do is under here we need to say
submit value equals and then we're going
to go ahead and say button so we're
referencing the selector here button
we're going to say button data so use
the data method to get the data
attribute that we won and that submit
value so this might look a little bit
strange but data will basically pick up
any data attribute and this is the name
of the data attribute it's data and then
- and then whatever the name you want it
to be so this is what we're picking up
here so submit value will now contain
the value just wait so it will be a
string of just wait now what we can do
inside of Val is go ahead and say submit
value so this will now contain this
value so when we refresh and click send
it says just wait however what if we
decide that we just don't want to
include this and we want this to default
to a default value well at the moment
what's going to happen is this is just
going to go to nothing which is a shame
it doesn't look very good and you know
if you miss it out someplace it's not
gonna look very professional so what we
want to do is we want to go ahead and
only include this string if this data
attribute is available so let's go ahead
and do that now so in here what we want
to do is create a ternary operator and
we're going to go ahead and say if
submit value then we want to output
submit value otherwise we want to go
ahead and have a default value please
wait so it's just basically saying does
this exist if it does then output submit
value otherwise output please wait so
returning to the example if we hit send
it says just wait because we have this
value here
but if we get rid of this save that and
refresh that doesn't exist so we see the
message please wait
so don't remember don't forget to get
rid of the return false here ordinarily
this would then just go through to
whatever page you won obviously if this
takes say a couple of seconds the user
will see the police wait message and
then they'll have to wait and won't be
able to resubmit the form so for the
purpose of example include return false
in there so that's how to create a
disable and change your message on a
form button when you submit a form</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
