tutorial series we are going to be
allowing the user to upload a profile
picture this profile picture is going to
be stored in their user account if you
like in the database or the location to
the file that they've uploaded will be
what's thing going to happen is this is
going to be accessible to be displayed
anywhere so this can be displayed on
their profile page it can be displayed
to them we're obviously going to be
showing a small preview of the profile
picture that's been uploaded just here
and of course it goes without saying
that we're going to be creating the
functionality to pick a file check this
file type securely so we you know don't
allow dodgy files to be uploaded and
then we're going to be allowing them to
upload this so the first thing I think
to do here is to actually modify the
database table to allow a location to a
file to be stored and this is really
important because it allows us to
specify where this file should be or
which file should be shown so this means
that we're not storing images within our
database or anything like that so what
we're doing here well we've got all our
fields at the moment let's go over to
the structure tab and we'll add a new
field at the end of the table I'm going
to go ahead and call this profile and
the type I'm gonna set to a varchar' and
we'll give it a character length of 55
now this might be longer depending on
where you're storing the images on your
on your server but you can adjust this
accordingly so I'm going to go ahead and
save that you can see that we've got
this here now obviously in browse at the
moment these are blank for everyone the
default value here is just nothing so we
can use this to check if this is empty
now if it is empty we can you know not
show a a profile image or we can prompt
the user to upload one and obviously if
it has contents this will be the path
the relative path to the file so then we
can just display the profile picture
so I've opened the three files here that
we need to edit but the first thing I'm
going to do is go ahead and open up the
core of our project I'm going to go
ahead and I'm going to create a new
folder and I'm going to call it images
and inside here I'm going to create a
new folder and call it a profile now
it's important that we don't allow
access to this profile by the way this
is going to be where all of the images
are going to be stored for every single
user now we want to make sure that we
don't allow allow sort of browsing
access through a browser to this so
we're going to go ahead and create a new
file this is going to be an HT access
file which we save much like we did for
let's just go back here much like we did
for this it's a dot htaccess file and
basically this is just going to specify
or tell the server that this directory
should not be listed the files in this
directory should not be listed so all we
have to do for this is options
- indexes we'll go ahead and save this
obviously in images and profile I'm
going to say this is a dot htaccess
document and there we are we're done so
now if we open up our browser and go
over to images this this allows us to
browse because we have-we don't have an
HT access file in here specifying that
we can't browse if we go into profile
though we've got this access forbidden
message and the only way that a user or
a browser of the site will be able to
check for images in here is or display
images or access images is whether they
type you know if they type in the the
image location or the file name and
we're going to be hashing the current
time so this will always be different so
you know the user can't necessarily
guess this they might be able to but you
know you can be inventive and think of
ways that people might not be
to guess this anyway let's go on with
the actually developing the
functionality we've got our database
setup ready to go here all we need to do
is develop the upload functionality and
the ability to display this out
so in init dot PHP we already know that
we've got this user data variable that
holds the fields that we want to
retrieve from this specific user if
they're logged in now we've got a new
field that we need to access called
profile so let's go ahead and add that
to the array that we passed through all
the fields sorry that we passed through
to this function so now we have access
to this profile data so over in logged
in dot PHP width which is within the
widgets folder so essentially this is
what displays here we're going to go
ahead and we're going to create a little
area here so I'm going to create a new
div I'm going to give it the class
profile we might actually need to go
into the style sheet as well and add
some styles just to make this look a bit
neater now I'm just going to go ahead
and test this out so to test I'm going
to say echo user data and then profile
so at the moment you may already guessed
that this isn't going to display
anything so I'll refresh the page
nothing's being displayed however
obviously I'm logged in as Alex I'm
going to go ahead and edit this let's go
ahead and add in just write test here
for now go ahead and click go here when
we refresh we get this test value out so
we know that if this is the path to an
image or it's going to be the path to an
image let me just go ahead and modify
this get rid of this here so if it's the
path to an image what's going to happen
is we can put this inside an image
element but we need a couple of
conditions first so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create an opening and a
closing PHP tag I'm going to say if
empty is equal to false so if something
is empty and this is user data
profile in fact I'm going to say if it's
not false then we echo and we echo an
image tag here on image element and we
need to give it an old as well so we've
got the two required attributes for this
inside of here we're going to place user
data profile so that will include that
in the source and the alt is just going
to be X's let's just escape that
character X is a profile image so X is
obviously going to be the user and we
already know how to access that
information we've got it up here so
let's use a data first name so we can go
ahead and just plunk light in there
there we go so head over to here and
refresh it looks as though this is
appeared and in fact let's go ahead and
inspect this sauce hmm let's go ahead
and look at the code I'm sorry now it'll
be let's just get rid of that it will be
is equal to false saris I'm confusing my
logic completely so if it if the profile
is not empty then we display it if it is
empty we don't display anything okay so
we've done that once we've uploaded a
profile picture this will display what
we want to do down here is go ahead and
and give the user the option to browse
so I'm doing this here just because it's
easier for the user to access but you
know you can go ahead and do this in
settings as well in the setting page if
you if you wish so the input type here
is going to be a file we need to give
this a name as well and I'm just going
to put this profile and then I'm also
going to include
an input field and this is just going to
be a submit button now obviously we need
to wrap this in a form so let me just go
ahead and indent that so we've got an
action and we've got a method and
because we're uploading an image we need
an ink type as well and this is going to
be multi-part slash form data just means
that we're transferring a specific type
of data over here we can access images
and process the image and the method
here is going to be post doesn't need to
be capitals and the actions going to be
blank because we're going to be posting
this back to the same page so if we go
ahead and just quickly preview this
you'll see we've got this it looks a
little messy so we're going to add some
styles in just a moment in fact we'll go
ahead and do that now so if we go ahead
and open up the CSS folder and screen
let's scroll down to a place that makes
sense so perhaps just after aside we'll
save profile and we will give this a
background of F 9 f 9 f9 and we'll give
this a border of 1px we'll make it
dashed and AAA or CCC so that looks like
that so a little bit better let's just
go ahead and give it some inner padding
10 pixel might be too much there we go
so um this is to upload a profile
picture you can you know go ahead and
head add some header in here I'm not
going to bother just for now just
minimize or make this a bit smaller okay
so now what we can do is choose a file
this will allow us to choose a file I've
got a file here ready to be uploaded
it's a PNG file we're going to be
accepting PNG JPEGs and gifs I guess you
can choose which image files to accept
by probably think bitmaps a bit too
large and file size most lightly so
we're going to be selecting this image
we're going to be clicking submit that's
posted back to the same page and then
just above here we're going to be
processing this in the code now we'll do
all the relevant security checks check
this the right file type and then if it
is we'll go ahead and upload the file
place that in the correct directory and
then we'll go ahead and update the
database and that what that will do is
then the picture the profile picture
will automatically appear so in the next
part we'll look at tying this all
together and actually allowing these ER
to upload the profile picture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
