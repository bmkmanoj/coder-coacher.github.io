are we're gonna go and look at building
a very small video sharing project and
this is really easy to implement so the
first thing I'm going to do is just
demonstrate how this works then we're
going to go ahead and start building
this out so to upload a video we
obviously have our clip champ button
here we can go ahead and click that we
can record a video from webcam or we can
go ahead and drop a file in so I have a
file ready here I'm gonna go ahead and
drop it in and I'm gonna go ahead and
submit this that's gonna prepare it's
going to upload it to Amazon s3 and then
what we could do is after we've finished
we're immediately redirected to the URL
that we can share with anyone so we have
an html5 video player in here that will
just allow us to play our video back and
of course what I can do is copy this
paste it anywhere and anyone can come to
this page and see this video it's a
really straightforward stuff but really
effective and if you wanted to carry
this on as a project you could tack on
additional features really
straightforward to do and we're doing
this using the slim framework so very
very easy to get set up so let's jump
over start to build out our slim project
and get this ready to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
