example what happens if within the
styles for each of our items we had a
margin on the right just to space things
out a little bit let's say that was 10
pixels well of course that's going to
space our items out but for whatever
reason say we're putting this in a tight
container we might not want the margin
on the last item in fact let's increase
this just to make it a little bit more
extreme okay so we've got our margin but
again we want the last item to not have
any margin on the right
so this is where modifiers come in so
this again is going to look very very
strange but once you start to work with
them you'll actually really start to
enjoy working with it and how specific
you are is really nice
anyway so our last item then what we're
going to do is for the class name and
again this is going to look really odd
we're going to say inline list
underscore item and then we use instead
two hyphens to denote the modifier then
we give the modifier name so for example
this could be last or end or whatever so
why are we re writing out inline list
item normally we might say something
like ul Li dot last and then we define
the styles on there as well but again
we're not doing that for the reasons
we've already discussed so we use the
same name with the modifier so Endor
last whatever we called it so that was
and and then we define the new styles
for this so all we do is we say margin
write zero so now this will give us
exactly the same but we just have no
margin right on the last element so try
and wrap your head around how this looks
of course at first it does look a bit
excessive but once again this is a very
widely followed methodology and really
the joy of just writing all of this out
makes it a lot clearer
it's very descriptive
and really just makes sense considering
we now have a completely flat file and
of course we can apply modifiers to our
block as well so we could do something
like inline list board it and then we
could say we want a boarder on this then
I make this look really ugly and then of
course we could use this then in
addition to our main block class and
then we get the following result so it's
really about just having all of these
modifiers attached to whatever you want
that slightly modify the appearance of
them and then we can have multiple ones
because they're very descriptive it's
really easy to see exactly what's going
on here it's really easy to modify this
CSS because we can see exactly what
we're doing we're not going to come
across any problems where we can't
update something because it's tied into
another element it's all very flat and
easy to work with and this is really the
main goal for me just making sure that
things are really easy to update as your
project grows larger we're obviously
looking at very simple examples here but
as you can imagine as your project grows
larger and you have lots of small
components that you can reuse with lots
of little modifiers this makes working
with your elements really easy so we've
already discussed blocks elements and
modifiers and this is pretty much it
there's not really much else you need to
know about this methodology we've seen
how it works we've talked about the fact
that it does look a little bit strange
we've seen how we write the Styles we've
spoken about the speed benefit of this
and the ease of maintainability but
really we want to take things a little
bit further and if you're working with a
preprocessor like sass then using this
is so much better if you were to write
everything out in a flat file that's
fine but using a preprocessor makes
working with them even easier so even if
you haven't used a preprocessor before
we're going to cover doing this in the
next section so let's jump over and look
at working with
em in SAS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
