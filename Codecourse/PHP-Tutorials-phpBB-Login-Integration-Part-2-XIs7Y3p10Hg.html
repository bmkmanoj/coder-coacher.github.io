logged in via our PHP BB registered user
inside the database what we're going to
do now is just clear up this code and
make it more into a actual login actual
login process so everything here is
working the only thing we need to do now
is first of all the main dot PHP page at
the moment we just write success as you
can see in the browser but we do know
that the login has worked now what we
need to do is first of all we need to do
this securely that's an important note
to go by and we also need to link to a
logout script obviously we need to let
the user log out so the first thing
we're going to do is use OB to say ov
start with what we're going to do is
we're going to be using a header data if
the user isn't logged in and oh we're
going to be using sessions as well so
sports a session star since we are
dealing with session data okay so what
the first I'm going to do is an if
statement we're going to say if not set
so if it if not is set so that's
basically saying if not set and the
session that we've used is session
username then we're gonna open this and
we're going to say header location login
dot PHP so essentially what we're doing
is we're checking this first and we're
saying is this is this session set has
it been set and then here with the
exclamation mark we're saying had it not
been set if it hasn't been set we're
going to head over to login dot PHP
using our header script that's why we're
using this Oh beasts are here it's not
necessary as we don't have any output
above here but with your website you may
do now we also need to use exit in case
we have any modified browsers that don't
accept this header
and header function and the content
inside it we're going to exit anyway
just to be secure otherwise the user
will be able to continue with the script
okay so otherwise and all we need to do
now is this pretty simple just say like
hello and we can append onto this
session username and append on to that
full start and a link log out and we'll
link this to log out or PHP now it would
probably be a good idea to come here and
just say username section equals session
username actually what would do is we'll
make this a bit more logical and say
session username and then what we can do
is we can paste that into there and then
paste that into there what you could
even do is then remove these are pending
full stops and put that inside but I'm
just going to use this now just for the
sake of complex ways to do things just
so you can okay so and that's basically
what we've got now what I'm going to do
is just show you what's going to happen
if we go on to here hello Alex now
presumably we are actually logged in so
you know everything seems to be working
if we go into our login dot PHP page
let's go into that we can still log in
so this makes me think I might come up
here and just say if is set dollar
underscore session
username then we're going to header
location main dot PHP and we're going to
exit now basically what this is going to
do is check if it's set we're going to
head over to the main dot PHP page and
then exit just in case this isn't
successful so basically what we're doing
is we're not letting the user login
twice so they go no matter how many
times you can see we're back at the log
in the main page you can see no matter
how many times we try and access the
login page it's always going to switch
back to the main so that's just a bit of
useful useful code you can take into
account the only thing we've got to do
now is the log out page so this is
basically a session start we're starting
the session before we destroy a session
and we're going to use the session
destroy command or function rather just
to do this and then what we're going to
do is header over to the login page
because as they have logged out we're
going to forward them back to the login
page so you can see here if I press log
out we're back to this page and then if
we were to come on to the main page I
haven't demonstrated this yet then we
redirected straight back to the login
page so this really is quite fun where
it's functioning quite well and we've
done the main job we did that in the
first part of the tutorial but hopefully
this has helped you sort of adapt this
and integrate it all into it so and
that's basically this tutorial over with
