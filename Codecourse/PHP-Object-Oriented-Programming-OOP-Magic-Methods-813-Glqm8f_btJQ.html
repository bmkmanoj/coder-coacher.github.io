example here this collection and I'm
going to be reusing this code for this
lesson and I'm going to be demonstrating
magic methods now as I mentioned before
we already looked at the construct magic
method now we're going to be looking at
set get call and to string so let's just
comment this so we know what we're doing
and I'm going to say public function set
and again that's two underscores if you
can't tell
and this takes two parameters it takes
key and value and all we're going to do
here is we're going to say this set key
value so now what this allows us to do
is say something like collection which
we call it ma call it as so C bars
equals foo bar our cooks will be a
better one
so it looks like we're setting a
property here but we're actually not
because this set method this set magic
method here recognizes that we're
setting a property here and it overrides
the action so if we go to our browser
and hit refresh let me just fix this
I'll just say a cup and our container
all and we'll add this method down here
just to make things a little clearer and
we'll also add a pre before that there
we go much better so now let me just fix
this so not getting that one down there
so we're setting the second parameter of
printer to true which tells PHP that we
don't want to output this we just want
to return it so there we go that's gone
so now you'll see that this worked we
have our property here or our item there
and now if we just add a quick get
method so get key and we're going to
return that will have a ternary operator
here so return array key exists key this
item and if the if the key does exist
will return this items key otherwise we
return no so now what we can do is we
can just comment this out for now and
then we can say echo see get pass and
hopefully yep we get Kooks so now what
we can do is we can use this get magic
method up here so public function get
and this one just takes one parameter
called value although you can name it
whatever you want and we're just going
to return this get value so if we go
back to our index all we have to do is
echo see that's and it looks again like
we're accessing a property but PHP
recognizes with this method that we're
accessing a property and overrides it so
here we get the same result so now let's
look at call so public function call and
this takes one parameter called eggs
which is short for arguments in fact
sorry no it takes two parameters one
called function and neither called
arguments let me just get rid of these
so we know which ones we've done I can't
think of a useful example for this so
we're just going to echo
so if we say down here at Cosi get bars
what's going on here this method here is
only called when the method doesn't
already exist so if we change this to
Sifu then we get the function name and
let me just make this clearer func has
been called with arguments here refresh
foo has been called with arguments and
we need to add the arguments so because
this is an array we can't just paint
that we're going to get an array to
string cup version so we're going to
implode this excel fill has been called
with arguments and if we just add an
argument foo bar Baz hooks and let's
just add a space there so foo has been
called with arguments foo bar Baz cooks
so we also have called static but we're
not going to look at that just yet
because we haven't looked at static
itself so finally we have to string so
let's add that public function to string
and in this case I want to echo a JSON
formatted array which is the same as
what laravel does so echo sorry return
this jason serialize so now what we can
do is we can echo C and we get that
array however if we remove this while
was it up here if we remove this we're
going to get an error because an object
can't be converted to a string without
that method being implemented now there
are more magic methods but we haven't
got time to cover them all do look in
the docs I think there's about six or
seven I'm not entirely sure but do play
around with them they can often be very
useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
