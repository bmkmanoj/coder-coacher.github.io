great day whatever you're doing now I've
been working on another huge laravel
course carefully designed to cover what
you'll need to know to launch your next
big idea so we're going to be building a
classified ad to the site which allows
your users to create and pay for
listings in categories within an area of
their choice we're keeping things quite
simple for making sure the end result is
easy to extend and that by following
best practices carefully thinking about
the structure of our project and keeping
an eye on the speed of everything by
monitoring how many queries we're
running and in terms of searching we're
going to be building a super fast also
complete drop-down search that searches
within the area and category a user is
browsing as well as showing results in
other categories that match as well
overall we're going to be covering
techniques like nested set view
composers components and slots
reusability of partials intermedia
eloquent relationships and how to work
with them effectively techniques to
speed up our pages clean code and a
whole lot more now this is a premium
course but there's a huge amount packed
into this alone so I'm really excited to
see how it's going to help you out
thanks for listening and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
