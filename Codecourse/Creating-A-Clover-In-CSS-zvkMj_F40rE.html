are going to be building this lovely
clover in CSS now first things first I
know this is late second of all I know
that some of you are going to say it's
easier to use an image or it's easier to
use an SVG because it's going to be very
quick I know but it's just a little bit
of fun we're going to be building this
up with pure CSS and hopefully you'll
learn something that you didn't know
before and you can sort of manipulate
this little clover to suit your needs
how you like it so this is what it looks
like it's actually constructed from
three different elements all having a
before and after pseudo element and you
can see it's a shape of a heart we've
covered building a CSS heart before I
think that was for Valentine's Day so
we're going to be doing the same thing
but then we're going to be slightly
manipulating it so the shape of the
heart's a little bit skewed and not
quite a perfect heart shape and then
we're going to be rotating three hearts
around so we get this this kind of
clover effect so this is going to work
in browsers that support transforms i'm
currently on can i use calm we're going
to be using vendor prefixes for Internet
Explorer Safari which requires it chrome
back to 31 requires WebKit so it's going
to be in there anyway because of a
safari but doesn't really matter too
much firefox we've got full support and
obviously for things like Android uses
webkit and we've got is Safari which
uses webkit as well so this is what
we're going to building let's get stuck
into the code and get this sir get this
clover built so as usual we're starting
out without document defined for our
doctype head body I've included a
stylesheet just called app dot CSS in
the CSS folder which currently has
nothing in it so it in this from scratch
so really what we want to start with in
is this basic heart shape so I'm going
to create a div of the class of clover
just to house
top left and right pieces or top sort of
left bottom right bottom pieces and
let's first of all just create a leaf
element and this will be our heart which
we can then manipulate and then we can
add additional classes to this if we
need to eventually going to have three
of these ones going to be top left and
one's going to be right so let's start
out with this stem the first thing then
is just to apply some base stars to this
wrapper because we are going to be
absolutely positioning these leaves so
I'm going to give this a position of
relative so them absolutely positioned
elements don't float out this container
and just for sort of the purposes of
this I'm going to give it a margin of
100 pixels literally just so it's pushed
out of the way a little bit so we can
work a little bit easier on this so the
clover element then inside of this we're
going to style up the leaf now what we
want to do is we want to change the the
transform origin here and if you head
over to Google and just google for this
it will give you a lot more information
about it but we're going to set this to
50 pixels 50 pixels and we'll add our
vendor prefixes as well you'll notice
that if you don't apply a transform
origin your rotated or transformed
elements will just be all over the place
so we want to settle these in a nice
position so we've got our transformer
origin let's quickly add our vendor
prefixes so we need a WebKit vendor
prefix and as discussed we need a
Microsoft vendor prefix for IE so the
before and after pseudo elements are
going to apply to all leaves so we need
to say clover leaf and we're going to
apply our before pseudo element and down
here will do the same for after as well
and this will become clear why we're
doing this if you don't know what before
and after pseudo element is it's
basically an element but it's not
physically existing in your markup as a
as a piece of written markup we do this
control this directly from CS
s so these are going to be a position of
absolute so you can position them where
we like we're going to set the content
nothing because we don't have any
content in here this would usually be
fighting text and we're going to set
this to the left of 50 pixels so that's
where the absolute positioning comes
into i'm going to set the top 20 so the
width and the height of these then let's
go ahead and define a basic width and a
height you can obviously play around
with these if you want to to get
different sizes and shapes so I'm going
to say width and height of what 50
pixels and 80 pixels respectively and
let's set our background color now just
so we can see what this looks like so
I'm going to say 3d 92 one which is
going to be a nice green color and let's
just preview this in the browser so we
get this sort of square so it's not much
use at the moment this is actually going
to be forming part of our heart shape
now there are actually two elements here
because we're targeting before and after
pseudo elements there's actually another
one of these green squares behind this
you can actually see it that will be the
other pseudo element so what we need to
do then is control the border radius so
we get that nice round effect on our
heart so we're going to say border
radius 30 pixels 20 pixels 0 and 0 so
these are just sort of top left bottom
right and there we go so this is the
kind of shape we're aiming for usually
what you would do if you were actually
building a heart is you would set these
the same because you want that nice
rounded thing we're going to rotate this
away from this in a minute which means
that what's going to happen is is that
it's going to reveal another one of
these lumps which is going to form the
top part of the heart now that's the
reason that we set the transform origin
250 pixels 50 pixels because we're
positioning this and in such a way that
we want it to rotate around a certain
axis so or the origin so let's now go
ahead and just actually rotate this so
we're going to say transform and we're
going to rotate this
I'm going to choose the degrees that we
want to rotate it at and this is going
to be minus 45 degrees so let's go ahead
and refresh and see what happens so
there we are we've got our rotated
element just there and we are going to
just now while we're here because we
can't see the other piece we're going to
target just the after pseudo element
here so what we're going to do is just
pull this down a little bit we're going
to do the same thing within a transform
and we're going to rotate this instead
of rotating it minus 45 will rotate it
45 degrees and now we end up with the
following so this is looking a little
bit better art what we need to do is
just say left of 0 here and then you'll
see that that will pull that over just a
little bit like that what we need to do
now is set the transform origin on this
and this will put it into the right
place will do the same here for this but
we'll change this to one hundred percent
and a hundred percent and we have the
following so we've now created our nice
little heart and it looks all lovely but
we're not creating the heart we're
creating a clover so while we're at it
let's just add in our vendor prefixes so
we need one for WebKit and we need one
for ms for IE and we'll do the same for
this as well so WebKit and ms and again
the same for these two as well so let's
just pull this down WebKit and now i
miss one and the same for this so WebKit
and ms okay cool so this is going to be
working now in chrome obviously you can
see I'm working in Chrome Firefox ie etc
etc so now what we want to do them is go
ahead and add some more of these heart
elements to our container let's do this
just duplicate it down now we need a way
to actually identify these so I'm going
to just call this
left and right for the sake of it this
is just going to be the bottom left in
the bottom right-hand side of the clover
when i refresh you obviously see that
nothing has happened because all of
these leaves are in the same place left
and right have no effect because we have
no selectors for these so let's go ahead
and add some of these selectors we're
going to say clover leaf and that's with
the left class I'm going to do something
to this in fact let's change this one to
the right one and we'll work on that
first and then we'll sew leaf that's
left here okay so for the right-hand
leaf then we want to transform this in a
way we want to rotate it so we're going
to rotate this I'm going to rotate this
120 degrees let's take a look all that
is done you can see that it's soft
popping out right hand side there
perfect so let's do exactly the same
thing to the left but this time what we
want to do is we want to just reverse
that so we want to rotate it minus 120
degrees so we've now got this soft blob
which isn't obviously good enough it
doesn't look at all like clover so we
want to translate it translating is
basically moving an element in in a way
that you're actually transforming it
you're not actually positioning it
differently you're just translating it
again you can go ahead and look up at
the technicalities of this so we apply
this directly after this we don't need
another transform property or all of our
functions here just go in line so we're
going to do this by 15 pixels on the
x-axis and minus 30 pixels on the y-axis
and that gives us the following so it's
just pulled that out just a little bit
so you can see that shape of the clover
start to form there and we'll do the
same thing for our left leaf as well so
we'll transform sorry translate I will
do this by this time minus 15 pixels and
minus 30 pixels on the y axis so we get
the following shape like this perfect so
that is our clover done let's just add
our vendor prefixes just down here just
to make sure that we are supporting our
other browsers
so let's have our web get one in finally
out ms one and that is our clover
complete super simple you can go ahead
and play around with it if you want
different shapes if you want to change
the individual characteristics of each
leaf you can if you want to make it a
little bit bigger you can have a play
around obviously this would be useless
really in in the ideal world but it's a
little bit of fun and gives a little bit
of CSS theory here just for fun so that
is how we create a clover in CSS and
there we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
