series
well this series is going to be is an
introduction to Java games programming
through the creation of knots and
crosses so we're going to solve the nice
simple game just to get a bit of the
logic down and some basic Java knowledge
understood so yeah let's just get
started so you want coming to your IDE
and create a new Java project and for
this one I'm just going to call it knots
and process and what you're going to
want to do is create a new new class
inside the source called main ok so it's
a new project so we have to do the thing
that you have to do the same thing every
time with a new project and create your
main methods a public static void main
string Arg s ok so that's our main
method that's the replication don't you
point created so next thing we need to
do is create some initialization methods
so these are going to be run from our
main method to actually start everything
off so public void in its underscore
components and public void in it
unscoped icons ok so what these are
going to do is we're going to put in a
little bit of code in each one of these
which is going to initialize everything
so what we actually need to do first is
create the objects that we're going to
be initializing so for lots of courses
rush you're going to have two images
well actually image icons which is going
to be excellent not so not so crosses
and we're going to have a grid of
buttons which is going to be our actual
grid I'm then going to have an integer
array which is going to be the board so
we're going to start with is the J bus
and so public J button for a grid equals
nu J button
I'm just going to say nine of them
because we're going to have 3x3 house
you can spell and capitalize okay so who
can see important report that what we're
going to want to do now is create some
image I calls it public image icon X
icon zero i fumble Oh icon okay and
again import that so what that's going
to hold the array of J buttons is going
to be our actual play boards of what we
click and the image icons are going to
be what we display on the screen so what
we need to do now is actually put
everything on the screen so the way
we're going to do that is we're going in
our in its components method we're going
to just create a jframe we're going to
the create panel going to add it to it
and then we're going to put in all of
the buttons so what we okay so in here
create a new jframe J frame for frame
equals a new jframe all kinds of inputs
and spell jframe quickly so frame dot
set default close operation and that's
going to be 3 which is exit on close so
it's going to stop the java application
when it closes frames set visible true
frame dot set resizable true because one
of those bits cove you'll adds is to
allow us to resize the buttons nice and
easily and frame dot set that now it
won't need to set the size just yet so
what we need to create now is a J panel
now J panel is something that week
draw two and then put that inside the
frame to hold everything it is similar
to a container which is just going to
hold all of our buttons so Jade panel
panel equals mu J panel okay
frame dot gets framed opt set content
pane panel now this would've thrown
terrified about such a panel correctly
organized in plots so that's game set it
is the main content of our J frame so
that's so now we've actually got the
panel on the frame so what we need to do
now is set the layout of the panel so
what we're going to say is panel dot set
box set layout it's going to be a new
grid layout like capitalization is all
over the place today grid layout and the
parameters are going to give it a 3
comma 3 comma 0 comma 0 ok so that's
going to do is it's going to create a
default layout for us which is just
going to be a three rows of three
columns so basically it's going to be a
three by three grid which is uh not
across this board okay so when our final
things we need to do for panel is say
panel dot add what we're going to be
doing is adding a component listener so
panel to add component listener new
component listener and if you just open
this up at the end of that now it's
going to want you to add unimplemented
methods so import it first and then add
the only implemented methods now what
were actually going to be making use of
here is not component shown
but component resized moved again we
won't need component hidden we won't
need the only one as I say we're going
to need is actually going to be
component resized and for this all we're
going to say is in hit underscore icons
now the reason why is going to come very
clear shortly so that probably doesn't
make much sense at the moment but it
will do eventually many ways that okay
so now that we've actually created our
panel what we need to do is add all the
buttons to so if you come down
underneath the component listener I'm
going to create a for loop so for int I
equals 0 I is less than 9 I plus plus
just going to create a final integer now
the reason it's going to be a final
answer is because we're going to be
passing it into an action listener so
final it pause equals I okay so what we
go to do is make use of the grid array
that we made further up and say grid I
equals new Jade button again capitalized
to be okay and then grid I got bad
action listener new action listener and
close that same at or Gaussian ports and
add them implemented methods
which should just be actual performance
okay so what what we're going to do in
here is food leave everything outside of
this we're going to say int id equals
pulse now we could have just say int id
equals I because I can constantly change
and it really doesn't Marcus do it now
in fact it won't compile so that's why
we've had to create the final integer
equivalent of it which is pause so what
we will do in the actually performed
it's just going to say play I ID even so
just going to play the ID so just above
our init components method guys create a
method public void play int ID okay come
back down here to our actual font that's
actually the action listener done and
finished so now that we've created the
ocean list now we can add it to the
board so panel got pads grid Phi okay so
that's going to have added the butter to
the grid so the final thing we need to
do is just say frame set size and just
something nice like 450 by 450 okay so
now if we save this and run it
absolutely nothing's going to happen
and that's because we've not actually
put anything in the main method so the
final part of this is we're just going
to make it all just wrap the screen so
go save main and equals new name and
then m dot init components okay so if I
were just out and got into icons as well
because we will fill out that method
shortly but now if we save this and run
it
we're going to get jframe and it's got
nine buttons three by three so what we
can do with this is we can resize it and
you can see all the buttons resize to
fit and all of these have got an action
listener on them so the play method is
actually running for each one so in here
if we just quickly add system dot out
dot print line planes where and then
plus ID if we run this again what you'll
see if we start clicking these it's down
here is playing a square with an ID and
that's how we're actually going to be
playing our game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
