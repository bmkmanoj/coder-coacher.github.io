but now we're going to take a break and
build a function that calculates the sum
of any numbers passed into it so think
about how this might work we need a list
of numbers that we want to add up and
then we want to return the result so we
already know how to build functions and
earlier when we looked at rithmetic we
know how to add numbers up so if you
take what we've learned we might build
something like this so I'm going to
create a function called add and in to
this we might accept a list of numbers
so let's say num1 and we'll do the same
for num2 and num 3 and of course within
here we can return the result of num1
plus num2 and then of course num 3 as
well like so let's go ahead and call
this and then we'll talk about the
problem of this so let's go ahead and
add up 5 10 and 10 and we'll echo the
result of that because obviously we are
returning a value let's take a look in
the browser and of course we see 25 here
so this works but it's not really that
flexible we're only allowing here for
three numbers to be passed in and if we
wanted to add another argument this
could break our code later on so for
example if we wanted to add another
number or at least accept another number
and then go ahead and add this on we'd
have to go through our code and update
anywhere we used the add function
because of course it now requires four
arguments and now we are missing
argument for so there's a couple of ways
that we can get round this and I'd like
you to think of a way that you might be
able to get around this using an array
now we know that we can define out any
number of options within an array so we
could say numbers or at least any number
of values we could say the same thing so
5 10 and 10 and into this rather than
pass a list of numbers we could pass an
array in so if you'd like pause the
video and try and create a more flexible
solution what we need to be able to do
is pass in an unlimited amount of
numbers into this function loop through
them and add them up so I've already
given you a clue but have a go if you
like otherwise we'll look at this
ticular solution now and then we'll go
on to another easier solution okay so
the numbers that we have here then we
want to accept into this just here so
let's go ahead and get rid of the return
value as well and we'll also get rid of
this so into this we now need to accept
in an array now what we can actually do
here is rather than just say numbers we
can do something called type hinting now
this involves placing before this the
type you're expecting and into a
function at the moment at least with
versions in PHP lower than 7 you can't
type him any other data type but now
this function tells us that we must
accept an array in let's just try and
call this an we'll see what happens if
we don't pass an array in so let's echo
out the result of add and then we're
gonna go ahead and pass it and say 5 in
there so just a single value let's go
over to the browser and you can see here
argument 1 passed to ad must be of the
type array but an integer was given so
this is pretty useful because it means
that if you are definitely accepting an
array you can actually protect against
anything else being typed in and it will
give you a more friendly error message
here so now that we have an array of
numbers obviously when we invoke or call
this function we want to pass in that
array up there that we've already
created so just to keep things simple
let's bring this down here okay so now
we need to basically you know create any
variable it really doesn't matter but
basically just something to keep track
of the total now obviously to start with
before we start iterating through the
numbers this is going to be 0 so now
what we want to do is using what we know
about for each loops we can go through
these numbers so for each numbers as
number and then on to that total we can
add each number so total and we can
either say total equals total plus
number remember or just to keep things
nice and simple we can say plus equals
is a little bit cleaner and then down
here once we finish looping we can
return that total so now what we should
get is the same result
but things are a lot more flexible if we
wanted to add up more numbers we just
add them onto the array and it just
works and of course you can also pass
this array directly into this as well
like so without having to declare a
variable so we get exactly the same
result now this solution works perfectly
however there's a much easier way if you
literally just wanted to take a list of
numbers add them up and that's where
we're going to talk about the func get
args function so let's go ahead and get
rid of all of this and just start again
and see how we might do this
so func get args is a predefined PHP
function that when used inside of a
function will give us an array of all of
the arguments that have been passed in
now this might seem a little bit weird
but what we're gonna do is we're gonna
define out this add function with no
arguments at all and then inside of here
we're gonna do a var dump on func get
args because remember var dump will
output that to the page so let's go
ahead and echo out add and then just see
what we get so that's a refresh and you
can see we get an empty array so this
func get args function is returning an
array to us which we're just dumping to
the page at the moment now if we were to
define but not in an array a list of
numbers so before we had 5 10 and 10
what's now going to happen is despite
the fact that we haven't provided in the
options or arguments that were expecting
this will pick them up anyway using this
funky args function so if we refresh you
can see now we have 3 items in here we
have 5 10 and 10 so using this then
rather than directly passing an array in
what we can do is just do a for each
over func get args and it makes the
function usable like this rather than
having to pass an array in now I'm not
saying that this is the best solution
but func get args can be very very
useful at depending on what you're doing
so at least you know it's there now so
let's go ahead and recreate this we're
gonna say total equals 0 and again we're
going to do a for each loop because
remember func get args returns eighth
array so we're gonna say for each func
get
args as number in here we're gonna say
total plus equals number and then down
here we're going to do the same thing
because of course we want to return that
total so once again we get exactly the
same result now if you wanted to kind of
protect against this what you could do
is inside of here
create an if statement remember we can
go ahead and continue or break inside of
a for each loop so you might want to say
if not and we're going to use a another
built-in function called is int and then
say number now you can also use is
numeric as well which might make a
little bit more sense so if the number
within the arguments we've given is not
numeric then maybe we want to continue
and not add it on so for now let's just
get rid of this and see what happens
when we pass in a value that we
shouldn't really be passing in so let's
pass that in and refresh notice we don't
get any difference but to remember PHP
is typecasting these values if I were to
say 1 Alex that will be cast to an
integer when it's added and you can see
it's added on to the total so things
like this can get a bit confusing but
just for the sake of clarity if it's a
string we want to ignore it and that's
where that check that I just added in
there comes in so if it's not numeric so
if any of these options that are passed
in or arguments that last in a not
numeric we want to continue the loop so
now you'll notice we only get 25 because
this is not a number so hopefully that
makes sense it's still quite a lot of
code here though so we can literally
shorten this down even further to just
one line within this function and let's
get rid of all of this and look at how
we might do that so there is a another
built in PHP function called array sum
now what this will do is it will add up
any values within an array so just to
test this out I'm going to go ahead and
comment this line out and I'm going to
echo the result of array sum and I'm
gonna pass in 5 10 and 10 just in an
array to that function so let's go ahead
and refresh and you can see we get the
same result so by doing this and
combining that with func get
we can actually in one line return up a
total of any amount of arguments we've
passed in so inside of the function then
we would simply return array sum and we
would go ahead and pass in func get args
which we know is an array like so and
then we're done that is pretty much how
easy it's going to be so now let's bring
back using this add function five ten
and ten we know is twenty five we get
exactly the same result so really the
lesson from this example is that the
writing code is sometimes about finding
better ways to do things by using what
we already have available to us and it's
not always possible to memorize every
single PHP function but just by having a
look around the PHP documentation or
having a look around online you'll often
find best ways to do things now this
isn't always the case with everything
sometimes writing a little bit more code
to make what you're writing easier to
understand is better but in this case
this is perfectly acceptable and it's a
lot shorter and a lot cleaner so you now
know how to grab a list of arguments
that are passed in if your function that
you're building doesn't require
potentially an unlimited amount of
arguments like this one then there's no
real need to use font get arcs it's
always better to define out what you're
doing in here and actually the example
we looked at earlier where we passed in
an array of numbers actually makes a
little bit more sense if someone else
was looking at your code and they saw
this they know that they have to pass an
array of numbers in to be added up so
I'd recommend this solution personally
so there we go a couple of practical
examples and we've learnt quite a bit
from this lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
