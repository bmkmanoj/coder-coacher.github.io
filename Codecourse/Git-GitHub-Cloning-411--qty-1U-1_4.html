than pulling it down from where it's
hosted and in this case we're obviously
hosting it on github now you'll find
this link within your repository and
you'll need this so grab this link and
copy it to your clipboard now we're
going to head over to the command line
I'm going to issue the clone command and
we're going to go ahead and paste that
in this will automatically place the
repo files in a directory called hello
world however we can specify the
directory name to clone this into if we
want to let's just check this out in our
text editor first you can see that I've
got the folder that I'm currently within
open here and that's then cloned hello
world if I did want to clone it into a
directory of my choosing I just type it
after so for example I could just choose
hello and that would clone it into the
folder hello let's just go ahead and get
rid of this so finally as we've already
seen if we check out the directory you
can see that we have the readme father
was generated by github now in this
directory so you have successfully
cloned your repository</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
