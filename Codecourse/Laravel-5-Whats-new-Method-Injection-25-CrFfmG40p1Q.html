in this video is method injection so to
demonstrate this I'm going to create a
very quick class inside of our app
directory we're going to call it through
and I mistyped the file extension so I'm
just going to say class foo where's our
syntax highlighting so class foo and
we'll save public function bar no we're
going to do is return foo bar so let's
go to one of our controllers they are
now located under App HTTP controllers
and they named spaced like so so let's
get rid of all of this messy commenting
there we go now we're a bit cleaner we
can do some working this is the method
that's getting called when we load this
page now so if we just died in bump
hello we're going to get that here so
what we're trying to do is access this
bar method on the foo class inside of
this function now what we would have
done before is we would have added our
use statement so use Acme foo we would
have injected it through the controller
this foo equals foo ignore this line for
now add our property and then down here
what we do is die in dump this foo bar
if we refresh we should get no we didn't
namespace this namespace Acme hit
refresh and there we go and get our
fubar now that's all well and good but
if you have a huge controller with lots
of methods each needing their own
objects then this constructor is going
to get fairly cluttered fairly quickly
so what laravel 5 allows us to do is
method injection so all we have to do is
move this into here get rid of this and
this and then all we have to do is
fubar and we should get the same result
perfect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
