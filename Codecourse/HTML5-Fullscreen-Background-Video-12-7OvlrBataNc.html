background video to the page much like
you can see just now you can see I've
got the video basically on loop in the
background and the page itself is just
normal this will allow me to add
additional elements to the page so I
could add maybe a logo up here I could
add some text in the middle of the page
this is essentially a background video
so this is what we're going to be
building we're going to be using an
html5 player for this and we're going to
just be applying a few style so you can
get the effect that we can see here what
we're also going to be looking at is how
we can speed up or slow down the
playback rate so this is a little bit
slower and obviously we'll be taking a
look at some best practices as well
including muting the video by default so
it doesn't annoy users so let's go ahead
and build this so to save a little bit
of time I've already marked out most of
my page we're just going to be adding
the video element and some script tags
and obviously over in our style sheet
that we have linked in we're gonna be
adding the styles so just to explain a
little bit about this if if you're not
familiar with it we've obviously just
got a html5 doctype with a head we've
got just the usual title we've got this
LinkedIn style sheet here which is
really important it's going to be adding
our Styles here to select that video and
we also have inside of a video folder
here just a video video of someone
typing in a laptop so it basically looks
like that if I just open it up in my
browser and this is obviously just
playing with a control bar down here but
we're going to be removing this so this
is what the video looks like it's going
to look a little bit different to this
when we actually apply it to the page so
this is the video make sure you have a
video prepared I'm obviously using an
mp4 video here and I'm only going to be
using an mp4 video for the purposes of
this tutorial but there are obviously
other media formats that you need to
include in an html5 tag or element to be
able to support multiple browsers so I
highly recommend just heading over to
where developer mozilla.org basically
MDN
and have a look at this article that
just gives you a good idea of the
different supported types and this will
probably be constantly updated it's a
really good resource this so have a look
at this and decide how you're going
going to include different types to
support different browsers other than
that we're going to just use an mp4 and
get on with it
so at the moment my page is obviously
blank inside of my body I'm going to
create a video element so the video
element here we can get rid of this
source here we're going to include the
sources within this there's a couple of
attributes that we need to add in order
to make this a little bit nicer so the
first thing is we want it to autoplay
and we will have a problem here on
devices like I think probably iOS
devices with browsers on iOS because
they won't allow autoplay but if you
have an iPad or or some kind of iOS
device like an iPhone try it out and see
what see what kind of result that you
get with that other than that we want to
take into account the fact that we want
this to loop because obviously when the
video finishes we don't just want it to
stop you might do but you can remove
that loop prop attribute if you want to
otherwise you can just leave it in the
video to loop now again really
importantly we want this to be muted
it's probably good idea to use a video
that doesn't have audio or if a video
that you want to use does have audio go
ahead and strip that out because it just
really be unnecessary and you don't want
the audio to play for the sheer reason
that if your users want to mute it
they're going to have to turn down their
speaker's they don't have they're not
going to have any controls here we're
not including the controls attribute so
you know the users not gonna be able to
to pause to mute the video or you can
pause it okay so now what we're going to
do is add a class and ideas you'd expect
the ID we're going to use just to
control with JavaScript down here if
you're using a library like jQuery or
something you can just use the class to
do this but I'm not going to pull in
jQuery just to access this element so
the class is just going to be eg video
and the ID is BG video
so for the sauces then let's just add
these in so the sauce is in video and
this is laptop underscore girl mp4 and
the type here is obviously video / mp4
so now we should have on our page that
video cool so it looks good it's going
to loop you'll see the point where it
does Luke's it's quite a short video in
just a moment there we go just loop that
so we've got our video in here this is
the actual size of the video so
obviously at the moment it's not our
background image or background video
rather obviously we're not going to be
changing something like the body
background property because that would
be silly we can't do that with the video
at least not yet so we need to be not
hacky but a little bit resourceful in
order to do this so under main dot CSS
let's target to BG video remember we
have this star she linked in and the
first thing we want to do is add the
change the positioning of this so we can
fix it to the page and that means that
the other content on your page will
scroll fine but this element will remain
fixed and that's exactly what we want
because essentially what we can then do
is mock a background video so we're
going to say position fixed and we need
to set the basically the top left bottom
or right properties so I'm just going to
say right 0 bottom 0 and then we're
going to say we want a minimum width and
you probably guess what this value is
going to be of 100% and we also want a
minimum height of a hundred percent so
the width and the height are going to be
auto so let's take a look now at what we
have here and let's just do a refresh
there we go so we've now basically got
this sort of fixed to the where it looks
like it's fixed to the background of the
page if for example in this page now we
were to add some paragraph elements down
the page let's just do that a few times
let's just grab these and paste these
down here
we should have enough room to scroll now
okay so this brings me on to the next
property that we need to add and that's
changing the Zed index that's just where
this is placed in layers if you like so
we change the Z index if we want an
element really far forward we would add
there a number higher otherwise we would
add a lower number in this case I'm just
going to do - 9999 and that means that
any elements added will automatically be
placed on on the front here so let me
just add a few more paragraphs cuz it
looks like that wasn't enough just add a
couple down here and then when we
refresh we can now scroll down the page
so you can see now that we've got a
background image stuck on the back now
so now that we've got our background
video sorted this is looking really good
but what happens if your browser doesn't
support background video one of your
users browsers more quickly doesn't
support background video and that's
going to be a problem particularly if
you've got say light text on a on a dark
video you're then going to basically
show your users this because the video
element just won't work the video won't
be shown so to combat this what we need
to do is put some kind of placeholder in
effect so what I actually have here is I
have a still of the of this girl typing
on this laptop so I'm going to hit or
create a new folder call it image and
I'm going to drag over this still we'll
have a look at this in just a moment so
inside of my text editor then let's just
open that I've dragged across it's
basically just a still of the girl
typing and I lazily just screenshotted
this from quick time so you can see that
I've got my little controls thing open
here but you go ahead and do a better
job of that and then just following the
rest of the steps to get this sorted so
like I said if the video is not
available we're just rendered with the
white screen so what we can do is on the
background of this page and obviously
you wouldn't want to apply this to all
of your pages because then you would
have a background of some hands typing
on a keyboard you would say background
image and then you choose the URL in
this case it's image slash
typing PNG and obviously make sure this
image is you know highly optimized for
the wear but it's as small as possible
just so you don't spend any or your
users don't spend any additional time
loading images that are too large so
let's get rid of this video element now
then and its refresh and oops let's just
change this to background rather than
background oh okay obviously we're in
the CSS directory so we want to go back
one and we should then see the following
cool so this is obviously looking a bit
odd at the moment because essentially
what's happening is it is chopping off
the image where the viewport is too
small let's find what we can do is we
can use the background size property and
you can go ahead and look this up on mdn
if you want but basically the one that
we're going to be using is cover and
this says this keyword specifies that
the background image should be scaled as
small as possible which is what we want
we don't need to chop off but while
ensuring both its dimensions are greater
than or equal to the corresponding
dimensions of the background positioning
area that basically means that whatever
the ratio to the image we want this to
basically try and fill the hole of the
background art we don't want any white
space to be left so what actually
happens is when we say background size
contain did I say contain or cover sorry
we won't cover then we're going to see
the following so it contains it within
it but you can see that it has been
chopped off a little bit at the bottom
because it's a wide a wide image but
that's not a problem you won't have this
horrible bar down here either it does
look a bit dodgy at the moment but
either way regardless of whether the
video element is supported this will
produce a similar effect and the reason
as well that this image is a little bit
zoomed in if you like is purely because
the video I'm using is really large you
may want to kind of scale that down
particularly if the video is a high file
size as well at the moment this is
loading really really quickly for me
because I'm just working locally
obviously you can imagine a 3 or 4
megabyte video is going to
quite a while to download over the over
the web particularly on devices that
have low bandwidth like mobile phones
particularly if you're out and about and
on Sunday night 3G so just bear this in
mind it's really important to bear do
you need a video image on your website
because obviously users like I said with
lower bandwidth will suffer with that so
that's how we do a background video
checking out on other devices and sort
of learn how to support this between
devices and you'll probably struggle on
devices like iPads where this won't
autoplay again you'll just get a still
image here and there probably JavaScript
libraries to detect and choose the most
appropriate course of action here have a
play around anyway even if you don't end
up using this is quite a fun thing to do
and know how to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
