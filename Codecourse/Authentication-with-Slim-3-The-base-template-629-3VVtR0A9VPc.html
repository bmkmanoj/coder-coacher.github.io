to create really nice templates that we
can reuse and it gives us a really nice
structure to work with rather than just
requiring files in everywhere so we're
gonna set up our base template which all
of our other templates will extend so
they all look the same they will have
the same look and feel to them and
essentially just the same structure so
let's start by just creating a new
folder in here and we're gonna call this
templates and inside of this folder
we're gonna create a file called app dot
twig
so in here this is just going to be a
basic document layout and let's just go
ahead and give this a title now there's
a couple of things that we need we're
going to be using bootstrap which is a
front-end framework and we're also going
to be pulling in jQuery as well and this
is mainly due to the bootstrap
navigation which is responsive and
requires JavaScript but of course you
can use this to go on and use any of the
other bootstrap JavaScript functionality
so first of all let's just head over to
the bootstrap homepage go ahead and hit
download we can pull this in from a
content delivery network which makes it
a little bit easier to get started with
so let's start by pulling in the styles
we just need to copy these over into our
head like that and then of course we
need to pull in the JavaScript as well
so let's go and grab this and this loads
at the bottom of our body so now we need
jQuery so head over to cDNAs and search
for jQuery and we want to go and pull in
version two point two point two we can
go ahead and grab the minified version
so what we need to do now is include
this in script tags like so so that's
pretty straightforward now as part of
bootstrap we have this container which
everything should be wrapped in now this
is where we want to place all of our
content because this is our kind of
overall theme or our overall template so
we're going to have our navigation up
here in a moment we're going to have
flash messages which we'll pull in a bit
later but overall we just want to see
our content in here so we do this by
defining a block so a block looks like
this and it has a name so in our case we
can call it content and then here we
just go and end that block simple as
that so now what's going to happen is
any file that we want to use this
template on we have to define that block
to place that content there why don't we
just go and set up our navigation first
of all just so we can see it in the
context of our overall template so we're
gonna create a partial for this just to
keep it out the way of this file so it
doesn't get too long so I'm going to
create a partial directory within
templates and within here I'm gonna
create a navigation dot twig file so I'm
gonna go ahead and just copy over all of
the mark-up that we need for our
navigation and you can find this as part
of the course downloads all this is is
just standard bootstrap code that you
can find on their documentation I've
just modified it very slightly and again
you can find this all in the
documentation and this will just suit
our needs so to get this navigation into
our template we obviously need to
require it in so to do this we use
include we give the name of the full
path so in this case is templates
partials and navigation dot twig and we
are pretty much done so now over now
home dot twig file what we can do is
extend this template and we can place
the content inside of this block here
okay so over in here let's extend this
out so extends and we give the name of
the template so it's a twig and let's
just see what this looks like when i
refresh you can see that we now have our
navigation bar at the top now of course
this has out drop down as well to sign
out and change password because
obviously what we're not doing at the
moment is dynamically selecting which of
these items to show we just have
everything here so all of the options
are here everything that we're going to
build in is here
so now we need to work out how to get
our content in this area here so let's
just define our block of content and
here we end that block and here is our
home page so that's as simple as that
the content here will be placed here
within our container so let's go and
refresh and it looks like this doesn't
work but in actual fact there is no
padding at the top we just bring up the
developer tools and go over to the body
we say maybe add some padding on the top
here you can see that that pushes this
down so what we need to do is include
our own stylesheet just to fix up these
couple of things so here I'm gonna go
and create a link to a stylesheet and
remember when we set up twig view we
passed in our Rooter and we passed in
the current URL and that's important
because now what we can do is use the
base URL function and this will give us
the base URL for our application then we
can go into the CSS directory and we can
load in a CSS file and this means that
it's an absolute and not a relative path
and your Styles will always work so
let's create this app dot CSS file and
just quickly fix up this top padding so
in here we want to create a body
selector and then we want to add padding
at the top of say 80 pixels and while
we're at it we'll add some padding on
the bottom of say 40 pixels perfect so
now we should see that that works
perfectly so over in our head we can see
that we have the full path now to that
stylesheet so whichever route we're on
this is going to work so that is our
template or our base template at least
set up we're not going to be touching
the home page but of course we're going
to be
going ahead and creating views for every
other page that we create and all we
need to do is extend that base template
and output the content that we need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
