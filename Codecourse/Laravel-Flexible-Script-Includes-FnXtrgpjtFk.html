you're probably going to need to include
external JavaScript or even internal
JavaScript files only on specific pages
so we're gonna look at within laravel
how we would do this best within
templating and obviously laravel is
extremely good with templating with the
blade templating engine so let's first
of all define a couple of roots and just
redirect these or render some views so
for the first one let's make a view
called home and let's go ahead and just
duplicate this and we'll call this pay
for example and this might be some kind
of payment page or journey or something
like that so inside of our views folder
let's create these two now so the first
one is home and that saved this out as
home dot laid the PHP and we obviously
have another one which we've created
called pay so let's say pay blade dot
PHP and might pay in here so over in the
browser now we've got the home page and
then we've got the pay page and the pay
page I want to include an external
javascript library from another provider
so perhaps we're taking payments with
stripe which is a credit card payment
company so we may want to include the
script on this page but not include it
on home because that's going to slow
things down so let's set up our template
to actually deal with this this is
extremely easy I'm gonna create a new
folder in here called templates and
inside of here I'm gonna create a new
file and I'm just gonna call this
default so we've just basically got a
standard template you might already be
using templating within your project in
which case you can just modify this to
work so let's just create a stand
document in here we'll just call this
website or something like that and
inside of the body you would obviously
find yourself adding your scripts down
here so you'll probably have a script to
a farm maybe in public so let's just
create a jas folder and create a new
file in here and this might be some kind
of global javascript file that you just
use absolutely everywhere within your
application so inside of here we can
just link to that
using assets is global yes so now what's
gonna happen is when we actually use the
template so on home let's just extend
template stopped default and in here
let's create our content so I just say
home and obviously in default what we
need to do down here in the body is
yield the content so we just yield
content so what we now get is on our
home page that's just extends there we
go so if we view the page source you can
see that we've got the script there to
our global Jas file and everything's
working here if we just bring up our
console you can see it's console logging
what we put out so that's the the
JavaScript that we want on every page
let's just copy and paste this into pay
and pay so now we have home and pay both
including the same JavaScript now what
we want to do is we want to say well on
the pay page we only want to include our
stripe JavaScript library but we don't
include on home so how do we do this
well there are obviously a couple of
ways you can do this one way would be to
go ahead and paste this down here so
we'll just paste the URL just in here so
you could do this and then on your page
we have this script here but it's a
little bit messy
the reason being is that we're actually
including this up here and if there's
any content after this
for example a footer in your template or
something like that so for example in
the template you might have footer down
here and this is your website footer
then you are seeing the following so
we've got a script included up here and
that's actually blocking so what we want
to do is we want to dynamically be able
to include this on that page on that
same paper
but have it appeared down here and
preferably we want this to appear above
these scripts here I just in case we
need to do anything additionally in here
it doesn't really have to be that way
but it depends on what you're including
so how do we do this well inside of pay
let's just modify this slightly and
let's include a new section so I'm gonna
call this section script and I'm gonna
say it's top and we can go ahead and
just paste this in here that's just do
this
so there we go we've now got a section
called scripts that's obviously not
going to appear on this page now because
we've not actually yielded the content
within default but now what we can
actually do is down here we can yield
scripts so now on any page that we want
to include this in it now includes it
down here out of the way the rest of
your content and it's a lot easier to
maintain so we've now got our pay page
which actually goes ahead and include
our stripe library there we go that's
included and then on the home page now
that doesn't get included because we
don't need it and we've not added it to
a script section inside of here we've
just got our content section so that's a
really good way that you can dynamically
encode scripts where you need them on
specific pages and this is in my opinion
a nice clean solution and it's easily
maintainable you can just head over to
this and modify them and you can add
obviously multiple lines if you need to
