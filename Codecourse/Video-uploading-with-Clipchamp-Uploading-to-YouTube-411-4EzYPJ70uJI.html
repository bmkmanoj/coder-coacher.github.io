very very simply to youtube using the
clip jump button this is incredibly
straightforward so we're first of all
just going to hook up our youtube
account so we're going to go back to our
dashboard we're going to go over to show
all settings and down here we want to
allow upload to my youtube channel so
i'm going to go ahead and just
authenticate off-screen with this and I
pull this over so you can see I'm just
going to go ahead and click allow so now
my youtube account is all hooked in I'm
going to click apply changes and we are
done so if we head over to the
documentation again just so we know
exactly what we're doing remember that
we have this output option so we chose
s3 before but of course we can now just
choose YouTube now this is incredibly
straightforward because all we need to
do is in our case we're going to get rid
of s3 we're going to set the output to
youtube so that is all we have to do to
have exactly the same functionality but
now our video will be uploaded to
youtube and of course what we're doing
now is we're still using out on upload
complete call back and we're doing a
console log on the video so now we can
see what gets returned from that and
that's really cool so let's go ahead and
upload another video so let's go and
pull this one over again and submit it
wait fer to prepare it will go ahead and
upload now and we are done so over in
our object now that's returned we'll
take a look at youtube in a moment we
have the file name as we'd expect we
have the URL which is literally just the
path to the YouTube video so that's
really useful and of course we have an
embed HTML now that this is great
because all we need to do now is we
don't need to mess around with creating
the iframe beforehand this is just
youtube standard embeddable iframe all
we need to do is go ahead and place this
on the page somewhere and we'll have
that YouTube video there but let's go
over to my youtube videos give this a
refresh and you can see here we have
this video now perfect we've uploaded it
we
go ahead and click on this and we can
see this as normal and that is pretty
much as simple as it gets we've given
the ability to upload to YouTube very
easily all we've had to do is
authenticate over on clip champ with our
youtube account and then we can just
switch that over on the clip chat button
and our video gets sent off to YouTube
of course with the data you get back you
can do whatever you want with the URL
that you receive back in that object as
part of the on video complete or on
upload complete method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
