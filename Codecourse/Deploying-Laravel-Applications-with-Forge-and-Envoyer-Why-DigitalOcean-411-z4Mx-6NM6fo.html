account is laravel Forge is nothing but
a kind of provisioner of servers on
digital ocean so what we can actually do
is we can on Forge choose all of the
information that we want we can have
custom servers but digitalocean is a lot
easier what's gonna happen is when we
create this it's gonna go over to
digital ocean it's gonna build up our
server with everything we need on it
ready for a laravel project and ready
for them pretty much any other project
and it's so simple to do we're gonna
talk in the next video about more about
why we use Forge and why it's helpful
you do have to pay for this service so
it's worth knowing exactly why you're
actually paying for it really the cost
of a service like Forge for the amount
of functionality you get and how
powerful it is is good but anyway you'll
need a digitalocean account so if you
haven't already signed up go ahead and
do that and we'll be diving more into
digitalocean later and looking at the
droplet will be SSA Qing into the
droplet to have a little look around and
see how Forge has set things up and also
how invoice sets things up a bit later
