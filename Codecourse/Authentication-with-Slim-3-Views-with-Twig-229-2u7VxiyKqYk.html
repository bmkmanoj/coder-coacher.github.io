you'll need some way to render a view so
we want to go and pull down the twig
view package from slim so this is pretty
straightforward
all it will do is allow you to easily
use twig within slim it's kind of like a
bridge
between slim and twig and we'll take a
look exactly how we set all of this up
and render our first view as well so
this is the package name so go ahead and
grab this and then over in your terminal
we'll go ahead and require this in using
composer so now that's downloaded you
can see that as well as the actual
package is pulled down twig so we have
that pull down for us ready to go so the
goal here then is to replace what we're
currently doing now if you go back to
roots we're just returning the string
home of course what we want to do is
separate our views so we can just return
them rather render them from either our
controller or routes like this so where
are we actually going to keep these
views well if we create a resources
folder just in the root directory and in
here we create a views folder this is
where we can store all of our views so
we'll leave this for now we'll go ahead
and get this set up and what we're going
to do is do this inside of our bootstrap
that makes sense
so we need to attach this to Slim's
container and to do that we first we'll
need to grab the container so I'm going
to create a variable called container
and I'm going to say app get container
so now what we can do is bind anything
we want to the container we'll be doing
a lot more of this later so if it
doesn't quite make sense we'll be
covering this again so if we say
container view and here we have a
function so all this is going to do is
when we want to use view it will resolve
this from the container we have
container here because
we can access previous container items
if we need to so in order to do this it
is pretty straightforward what we need
to do is create a new slim view Twigg
instance we need to tell this where our
views live and then we need to add an
optional extension but this is going to
be really useful so let's start by just
creating a variable called view and this
is a slim view Twigg instance so into
here we pass as the first argument where
our views are kept now we know that
because we've already created the folder
so let's go ahead and choose this so we
go back a directory into resources and
interviews so that just means that when
we define which view we want to render
we don't have to give the full path
every time so we also have an array of
options and in my case I'm going to turn
caching off just for now so if you're in
production you might want to change this
to a directory where your cached views
will be stored we don't need to worry
too much about this so next I spoke
about this extension what this will
allow us to do is generate URLs to
different routes within our views so
don't worry if this doesn't make too
much sense at the moment we'll see how
this works of course later on so we're
going to say add extension and this
extension is a new slim views twig
extension so into this we want to pass
our router and we pull our router from
the container this is on Slim's
container so we say container Rooter now
why do we need our router well of course
we need our router because we're going
to be generating URLs for links within
our views so what we also want to do is
pull in the current URI and we do this
using request remember I said the
request is responsible for the current
requests to the page so to do this we
can say
get URI pretty straightforward then all
we want to do is return view simple as
that okay so now that that's done we can
actually test this out because it's now
on the container but how do we access
the container well from within your
roots you can say this and then the name
of the item within the container
so we've happened to call it view so in
the case of rendering a view then we
want to say return this view render we
need to pass in our response which we
don't currently have there so let's just
put in our request and our response and
then we give the name of the view we
want to render so in my case I'm going
to call this home twig we haven't
actually created that yet so let's go
ahead and create this inside of the
views folder so home twig and then here
we'll just write home so now we should
see well we see an error because we've
given the wrong name space to twig so
let's go ahead and correct this
so it's slim views twig and now we see
exactly the same result so this is now
our view rather than just returning a
string and we can prove that just by
changing this over here great so we now
have slim views setup and we can now use
these within the controllers that we're
going to be building a little bit later
