additional options into this flash
method and this allow us to have access
to them within our view if we want to
give any additional options to whichever
solution that we're using so for example
I might want a timer on my messages that
after a certain amount of time they
close well in this array I can say but I
want them to close after 200
milliseconds so two seconds and I can
pass this through to my view really
really straightforward so all I can do
is say timer and then in here what I
want to do is say notify option and then
I just past the name of the option so
timer and this will return nothing or
null if it's not available and therefore
you can also use an if statement on this
so you could if you wanted to say if and
we'll just go ahead and grab this paste
that in there so if that option does
exist then go ahead and output the timer
property on the suite of that object
here with that value in there so what
you can now do is see when we go through
to this we see it and after two seconds
that will go ahead and close so any of
the options within suite alert you can
obviously customize this you can see all
of the options here you can implement
them you can just pass them into this
array here and then you can access them
in your view when you're outputting so
it's a really flexible option to go
ahead and output any kind of
notification within laravel whichever
front-end framework you're using
whichever JavaScript solution you're
using to show alerts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
