looking at applying a box shadow to an
elemental page and what this means
basically is having a little shadow like
this the renders underneath a square or
rectangular element to give the element
a 3d effect so it's coming out to the
page slightly we're going to be doing
this using a class so that we can reuse
the effect anywhere else on the page
that we feel necessary so let's look at
some code for this this is going to be a
quick example just showing the basic use
of a box shadow and not delving into too
much of the detail but just to get us
started so the first of all let's have a
clot a div and give it a class of shadow
one so this is the first kind of shadow
we're going to apply it's going to be a
really basic one and that's all the HTML
that will need so let's let's start
styling it up now first of all let's do
a bit of formatting for the page so I'm
going to give the page a background
color which is going to be a gray color
and remove any margin and ok and then
that style the the container itself so
first of all I'm going to give it
background color it's of hash FFF which
is white and notice that we can use the
specific background color or just
background and provide a color to set
the background either way we can do that
doesn't matter let's then give the devil
width of I'm actually let's give it 400
pixels so let's give the width 400
pixels height of 200 pixels some padding
let's provide 15 pixels of padding and
margin 15 pixels again just to bring it
away from the edge of the page a little
bit and then let's plate it left okay so
this should give us our basic element on
the page but without shadow so now
that's now that that's done let's apply
the shadow so going back to the HTML you
can see that there's a class of shadow
one so I need to select shadow one
there we go and will now need to apply
the box shadow property so box-shadow
takes a comma separated list of shadows
but in this case we're just going to use
one shadow and we're going to give it
some basic parameters now we can
actually give it up to five parameters
the first parameter being the X offset
the second being the wire offsets the
third being the blur radius the fourth
being the spread radius and the final
one being the color but in this example
we're just going to use the xml offset
and to do that all the is provide a
pixel value of five pixels for the X
offset and five pixels for y offset and
what this means is that the shadow will
now render five pixels to the right of
the element itself and five pixels below
and the X offset controls right or left
the y offset controls up or down and
positive values will go to the right and
downwards so there we go that's fine and
now let's apply color and i'm going to
give an RGB a color so red green blue
alpha so 150 150 150 and then a slight
opacity of north point 5 so there we go
let's see what that looks like on the
page there we are we have our shadow
nice and simple that's how to apply a
basic box shadow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
