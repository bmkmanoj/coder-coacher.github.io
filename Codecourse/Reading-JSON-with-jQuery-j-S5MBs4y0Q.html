reading JSON with jQuery we're going to
be using a couple of methods we'll look
at these sort of easier ways to do this
and then sort of more in-depth way to do
this I'm going to be looking at the
example JSON here which I've just gone
ahead and created this is hard-coded but
whether you're reading this directly
from a server or from a static file
you're by the end of this video you'll
understand how to read a JSON and
Traverse JSON data with jQuery so you
can see in my console is an example I've
Traverse I've looped through each of
these article examples and I've
outputted the name of each of the
article so we'll go ahead and look at
two ways we can do this we'll head over
to our code editor now and do that okay
so we've got basic document markup here
I've gone ahead and included a CDN
served version of jQuery from Google
hosted libraries wherever you serve this
form it doesn't really matter as long as
you using the up most up-to-date version
at least the version I'm using in this
tutorial then you'll be able to use the
methods that I'm using so I'm going to
do all of the coding here inside of a
script tag just on this page ordinarily
though if you were obviously working in
production you do this within an
external file it just makes it a lot
easier for us to you know do it all on
one page so taking a look at articles
JSON we need to go ahead and first of
all read this file and reading this file
will then bring this in using jQuery
jQuery is super intelligent and working
out that a JSON file is a JSON file that
you're you know Ajax into and then it
will go ahead and it will allow you to
just traverse this or use the find
method as long as you're using your data
as an object but don't worry if that
confuses you we'll look at this
step-by-step the first thing that we're
going to do is go ahead and look at the
get JSON method so the get jason method
looks like this so it's obviously using
jQuery and it's get JSON and Capitol's
now let's go ahead and just take a look
at this within the jQuery library so
I've got the uncompressed version open
here so if I go ahead and search for get
JSON
and you can see that we've got this
method just here so this actually uses
the get method within the jQuery library
so it's sort of a shorthand way of
defining this and it says that oh yeah
you know this is JSON data so really all
this is doing is it's making Ajax call
using the internal workings of jQuery
using the get method but what it's doing
is it's saying well this is JSON data so
it's basically a shortcut way to read in
JSON and in a moment we'll look at using
the ajax method which is much easier to
do not easier but you get more control
so this takes a URL and we're not going
look at this we're going to put a call
back so basically what happens well
we're going to look at the data so we're
going to have a call back the returns
data so what we'll do here is we'll go
ahead and specify the file that we want
to read in so looking at my directory
structure I've got the index.html file
that I'm working in an article JSON so
what I'm going to do is go ahead and say
articles JSON and then I'm going to have
this data call back which will allow me
to return data here's an argument and I
can console.log something here just to
say it worked so data we'll look at in a
minute we'll console.log data in a
moment but let's just check that this
work so if i refresh you can see that in
my console I get it worked so now that
we know that the actual age axing worked
or we can go ahead and check this in the
network tab if we really want if we
refresh you can see that it's Ajax into
this and if we look at a preview we can
see that this is in fact an object and
we can traverse it we don't to do that
we want to do that with jQuery so now
what we can actually do is inside of
here we can go ahead and console log
data and then we can see that we
actually get a object back that we can
go ahead and look through so we've got
an object we've got a property and he
called articles and an array of three
elements and if we click through here
we've got the first one which is an
object and then we have an ID and a name
second we have an ID in the name of
we have an ID in a name and that
basically just corresponds to the date
that we've got in here so console
logging out data like this is really
helpful because it allows us to see
everything that we can actually work
with and we know that what we can now do
is actually loop through this if we need
to now get JSON is good for this but
what we're going to do now is just go on
to use the Ajax method and you're more
than welcome to use the JJ's get JSON
method but using the Ajax method
actually allows us to have success
callbacks failure callbacks it gives us
a lot more control so let's just comment
this out and take a look at how we may
be able to do this with a little bit
more control over what we're doing so
I'm going to go ahead and call the Ajax
method and this takes an object and then
a series of properties and values so in
this case we have a URL property which
is going to be articles JSON we then
have a and these are actually optional
so we don't actually need to provide
these a data type so in this case I'm
going to say is JSON so I'm saying I am
expecting JSON from this back from this
Ajax call a type as well which can be
get post or whatever in this case it's
just going to be get and and I'm also
going to go ahead and say cash true so
we can actually cache data as well when
we - you need to provide this we can
cache false and that will cache bust the
request so what that basically means is
it'll add a timestamp on as a query
string so this will constantly you know
refresh and we won't get any cache data
so like I've already said we get a lot
more control this way so I'm going to
have I'm going to provide another
property here which is going to be a
function of require a success callback
here and this is going to contain data
much like we did up here similar similar
kind of deal so in here I'm going to go
ahead and console log data and we'll see
that we get exactly the same result so
we refresh we get an object with an
articles property and three elements to
this array and then we can go ahead and
loop through them if we want let's go
ahead and look at how we might actually
leap through them
so we know that we can console up data
and we can see everything but what
happens if we want to just go ahead and
do it callin each method and the each
method looks like this sorry whatever
you want dot each and then you'll have a
callback in here which will be run for
every element that you want to loop
through now the only problem with this
is it needs to be a jQuery object to be
able to use this method on it obviously
so what we do is we say data and then
whatever we want to access so in this
case it's data dot articles we already
know that we kit we have this data here
articles so accessing each of the
articles because this is an array of
three items we can go ahead and say dot
each on it we can provide this callback
we can go ahead and provide an index and
a value and then we can go ahead and
console dot log in here and look
whatever you want so I'll just say it
worked so now I'm going to go ahead and
refresh you can see it worked and we get
a little three in a circle here which
means it was output three times so we
know now that we're looping through the
three elements within our articles are
right here so we've got an object for
each one of these array elements so now
that we've done that we know that it
worked so we can go ahead and in
index.html we can go ahead and instead
of console logging it works we can
consult log value so index will be zero
one two three
basically the index of the array that
you're looping through or whatever
you're looping through value will be the
actual item so when a console log value
we can now see that we've got an object
with two properties ID and name so ID
being one two three for each one and
then the name of the article so now what
I can do is I can do a console dot log
value dot name so accessing properties
by dots if this had another property
within it or whatever we could do dot
something else it's just up to you to
look at the data are working with and
see how best you can traverse it so now
you can see that because I'm console
logging data or value sorry name were
outputting the name of the article and I
could do exactly the same thing there
with dot ID and it would work in that
way but it without put the ID and like I
said if you had any other properties in
here or you know any objects within
these for example then you can go ahead
and traverse them just as just using a
dot so that's a really quick way that we
can go ahead and read JSON with jQuery
we can either either use the get JSON
shorthand we can use Ajax to actually
get a lot more control over this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
