code course but if you don't already
have an account head over to upload care
com go ahead and create an account and
you should land over in your dashboard
so here I have a project that we use for
code course com to upload profile images
but of course what we're going to be
doing is creating a new project
specifically for what we're building
here so you want to create a new project
and go ahead and give this a name so I'm
going to call this awesome image and our
project is created we can start using
our keys and we can go ahead and pull in
the PHP library to get this all working
so we can use this either as a widget or
we can go ahead and pull in the upload
care PHP library which makes our lives a
lot easier this will allow us to
generate all of our widget code for us
it will allow us to upload to their
content delivery network and then we can
look at actually pulling images back
using this library as well so the first
thing we want to do is just pull this
into our project so we have it ready so
we're going to do a composer require on
upload care and then its upload care
hyphen PHP this will go ahead and
download this and we're ready to use it
now because we are using a framework we
want to create a provider for this much
like the providers that we've already
seen here for twig and doctrine now if
we go over to the documentation we can
actually get a good idea about how we
would use this so heading over to the
PHP section just under tutorials so
we've already pulled this in we already
have it included because we're pulling
in auto load already and this is how we
create a new instance of the library now
we don't want to just do this anywhere
because we don't it floating around and
that's where the service provider just
comes in so we can create a providers
directory just over here to store this
in and we are going to create an upload
care provider so let's go ahead and
create an upload care provided up PHP
far let's just rename this
and we can start to lay out the service
provider so obviously the first thing we
want to do is give this a name space so
it's going to be under a I and providers
and we then want to create a basic
service provider so we're going to use
silex application because we're going to
receive an application instance into the
methods we're going to create in here
and we will pull in the contract for our
service provider or the interface for
our service provider so this is just
cylex service provider interface like so
and we create a class here called upload
care provider and that of course
implements this service provider
interface now if we check out this
service provider interface you can see
that we require register and a boot
method and both of these will receive
the application instance into them so
let's go ahead and create these now so
we have a register method and this
receives an application so and we have a
boots method so let's create this now
and again this receives our application
instance now we're not going to be
touching the boot method we're
interested in the register method so if
you're wondering why are we even doing
this well remember over here when we
pulled in our twig service provider this
allowed us to do things like a Puig the
same for doctoring devo where we access
this using app DB we're going to do
exactly the same thing but allow us to
access upload care so inside of here
then we want to say app upload care and
this is going to be app share and we're
going to create our closure here we're
going to use app just in case we need
that and in here we want to do pretty
much what's on the documentation so
return a new upload care API instance
and we just do this like so from in
there now the documentation over on
upload care is clever enough to grab our
public and our private keys for us
just so you know if you go over to your
dashboard over to the project that
you're working on this is your public
key and you can go ahead and show your
private key so these two here or what
you place into here so now that we've
done this we are ready to go we can
start to use this as long as we register
our service provider so to register our
service provider we know that we just do
app register and here we want a new AI
providers and then it's our upload care
provider like so so we can test this out
just from in here if we go and kill the
page here and do a VAR dump on app
upload care we should see we head over
to the browser and what we haven't done
is prefix this with a backslash so
because we're working under a namespace
we just either need to import this at
the top or just go ahead and add a
backslash just there and now we see our
upload care aepi object and we can start
working with this exactly how we need
great so if you've worked with upload
care before you'll know that we can pull
in some JavaScript and start to work
with the widget now when we use the PHP
library this makes it even easier to get
started with now one thing to know is
that within cylex when we use our twig
service provider this will share our
application instance with all of our
views and what this means is that when
we do a normal output within twig we can
actually use app to grab any of our
loaded dependencies within out container
using app within our view so we can say
something like app upload care which
we've already created a service provider
for and shared and then we can say that
widget get script tag and we want to use
a twig filter to output this as raw or
this will automatically escape it so all
this is going to do then is if we just
view the page source here it will just
pull in first of all our public key as a
global variable and it will pull in the
script that we need
to run the upload care widget so really
easy and straightforward to do directly
within our view there so I do want to
set up a couple of other upload care
settings and you can go ahead and find
these if you need to do anything else
over in the documentation under widget
and if you go over to configuration you
can see that you can either set these as
a global variable or you can set them as
local attributes now because we're using
the PHP library it makes much more sense
to set these as global so what I want to
set is upload care live to false this
just helps during development of course
when you are live you can go ahead and
set this to true and we want to set up
load care images only too true because
we are building an image upload project
we only want images to be uploaded and
we're going to set the cropping settings
for upload care now i'm going to set
crop to free which means that when
someone uploads an image they can freely
crop it however they want and that's
pretty good so now that we've done this
we're literally ready over on our home
view to output the widget and then we
can just see if it works so to do this
then we do a similar thing we use app
which is global within our views we say
upload care widget get input tag this
time and then we can give this a name so
in this case I'm going to call this file
ID and this is just how we pick this up
when we go ahead and post so again we
want to make sure this is raw will be
escaping the output and now over on our
home view we should see our widget so if
you go ahead and give this a click you
should see your upload care dialogue
open and you can go ahead and upload
images from any of these sources and of
course what you can also do is drag
images onto here as well so we are going
to be styling this up just to make it
look a little bit nicer according to the
style of the site that we're building
but with that done we now have upload
care pulled in and we're actually ready
to move on to the next part where we're
going to be focusing on
uploading images by choosing these
within this widget and of course we'll
take the time to star this out as well
so let's go over to the next part where
we look at getting images actually
uploaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
