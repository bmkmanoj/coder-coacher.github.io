reflection class now we're going to be
looking at reflection method and you can
probably already tell what that means by
the name so if we just changed this here
to reflection method and we changed
these variables here and we'll delete
this line the next thing that we have to
do is go to our user class and pick a
method so we'll go with the first one to
get data so what we do is we provide
that as the second parameter so now what
we can do is we can print our get class
methods hit refresh and we'll get all of
these methods that we can use for
example is public if we echo RM is
public and will comment this out again
we get one and that's because get data
is indeed public if we change this to is
private or is protected we're not going
to get anything because that evaluates
to false so let's take another look we
have is static which can determine if
the method is static or not we have is
constructor which determines whether the
method is the class constructor the same
with destructor we have all this kind so
let's look at invoke so let's go back to
our class and we'll just echo invoke to
make sure that this did get invoked and
by the way invoke is basically another
word for call so when we're invoking a
function we're calling a function so
let's go back here and say RM invoke and
this is where it gets confusing to
invoke a method we need to provide an
object so to do this we need to
obviously create a user object like so
and we should probably do that up and
then we pass it in as the first
parameter so if we just refresh we get
invoke and that should be invoked
now we can also pass arguments through
here so if we just set this to foo and
echo foo here and we'd have to change
this to invoke eggs and then as the
second parameter we could pass an
and we could say hello world and forget
hello world and we can also store the
return value in their variable so if we
say return foo bar and say foo bar
equals and then echo foo bar and we'll
just remove this we get foo bar as
expected so there are tons of useful
functions that we can use in these
reflection classes we can't go through
them all in this series because we'd be
here forever but do browse the docs its
reflection api's are a good thing to
know especially for things like testing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
