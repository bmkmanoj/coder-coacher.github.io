security concern for our application and
that is cross-site request forgery now
I'm going to briefly explain what
cross-site request forgery is but I
highly recommend you to look it up and
sort of find out for yourself exactly
why it's important and why it's needed
so cross-site request forgery is the
ability for someone to redirect you or
submit something as you to be able to
perform an action on a website that was
not intended so for example if you were
on a website buying something and you
had something like in the URL buy item
equals one let's say that that
automatically purchased that item for
you now what someone could do is in
whatever way they could redirect you to
this page that would purchase an item on
your behalf without you wanting that to
happen so we want to do this within our
application and prevent against this and
attach this to every form that we create
by default so when we are developing we
know that everything is protected
against cross-site request forgery
so let's cast our mind back to when we
created our config and remember here we
had cross-site request forgery session
now this is the name of a token that
we're going to store we're gonna
randomly generate a token we're gonna
store a token which is then going to be
placed into a form when the user submits
the form that token is going to be
checked on that request and that means
that without knowing the token within
that session users cannot forward you to
a page and perform an action on your
behalf so again read up on cross-site
request forgery and hopefully this'll
all make sense but it should make more
sense as we progress through this video
part so to protect against cross-site
request forgery we're gonna create some
middleware which is going to handle the
generation of the token and it's gonna
handle the checking of the token within
any form we create and then lastly we're
gonna update our login and register
forms to use our token now the login and
register forms aren't as much of a deal
but of course with this cross-site
request forgery protection it will be on
every form
so we just don't need to think about it
it's a really good way to just increase
the security of your website so let's
create some new middleware and I'm gonna
call this cross-site request forgery
middleware dot PHP and we define this in
the same way as we did out before Middle
where we namespace it so we can just
copy that over we use slim middleware to
extend the middleware class so here
we're just gonna say class cross-site
request forgery middleware extends
middleware perfect so now what we can do
is we can have our call method as usual
we are going to say this next call which
is required within middleware by slim
and we are going to attach on a hook
before the request we're going to look
inside of this class object I'm going to
check and that check is another method
so we create a check method here we now
need to pull in the key that we're going
to use for the for the storage of this
cross-site request forgery token so this
comes from our config if we remember
it's cross-site request forgery sessions
this is out key that we're using so
let's say this key equals something and
up here we'll store that key and here
we're pulling that from our config as we
said so we're gonna say this app config
get cross-site request forgery dot
session or we could call this key it's
entirely up to you can make that change
so this is now on every request going to
check a token it's not appearing at the
moment because we need to add it into
our app so if we open start duplicate
this lime and we can use cross-site
request forgery middleware
we need to import that at the top as
well so let's do that so so now before
every request to our application we are
doing cross-site request forgery checks
that's not the case we don't want that
to be the case
we only want there to happen when we
post a form or something like that or
perform some kind of action so the first
thing we want to do then is actually set
that key in the session so I'll set the
token in the session so we're gonna say
if not set so if not is set dollar
underscore session this key so that will
be if this key is not set then we want
to add it to our session so session this
key equals and what value to be set here
well we want to generate a long random
number and then we want to hash it so to
do this to generate a long random number
we know we use random Lib like we've
used before so we use random Lib we
generate a one to eight length string
and we can set this to generate a string
and what we now need to do is hashes we
can just wrap this in this app hash hash
and why don't we just pull this down
just so it's a little bit more readable
like that there we go so we are now if
the session doesn't exist we're hashing
a generated string a large generated
string and just I guess for now we could
just echo out dollar underscore session
just to see what that looks like
so this okay so now we see this key in
the session so this is what we're gonna
append to our form which inside of here
we're then going to check if them to
match and again if this doesn't make
sense just at the moment it will be very
clear hopefully when we actually put
this into our forms so we're gonna grab
that session so we can compare the token
so we're gonna say this key and here
we're gonna check if the request method
that we're using eg get post put delete
whatever is within a certain
value so either put post or delete we're
going to go ahead and check the token so
if we're gonna use PHP in array function
if this app requests yet method or get
method does is it returns whether it's a
get request a post request put or
whatever we're checking that with an
array of values so we want to check for
post hurt which we're not using and
delete which we're also not using but
it's good to know that it's there anyway
so if that's the case we need to pull
out the submitted token from the forum
so we can do this by saying submitted
token this app requests post this key
now this key remember is the name of the
session here's process I request forgery
token in fact this should really be key
so I'm going to change that now in
production development makes a lot more
sense let's change this to key here
there we go so this key we basically
need to check if that's available if
it's not available we're going to set
that to an empty string so what we now
need to do is check if the token
submitted through from a form matches
but let's take a minute just to try and
understand how this is going to work and
we'll implement the key on our login
form so let's go over to views and let's
go to off login and down here we're
gonna have an input which is a type of
hidden so what we need is a name and a
value the name here is gonna be
something like cross-site request
forgery token and the value is going to
be that random string that we saw
generated so we need to share with the
views the name of the key and we need to
share with a view the actual cross-site
request forgery token as well so we'll
replace these in a minute but inside of
our middleware down here
what we're gonna do is we're gonna say
this app view append data we've seen
this before cross-site request forgery
key is this case that key that we're
storing in our config there and we also
want to store our share the token as
well so cross-site request forgery token
well where's our token is that token
that we generated in here which we've
pulled out here so now sharing this with
our views so what we can do is we can
say cross-site request forgery key and
in here we can say cross-site request
forgery
token so let's take a look at our login
form then so if we go over to log in and
we inspect our page here we have our
hidden input the cross-site request
forgery token and a value of that hashed
random string so when we submit the form
what we want to do is the submitting
checking goes here which we've got
already we want to grab the submitted
token so for now let's just echo out the
submitted token and when we hit login we
output the token we can compare the
token that was submitted in the form to
the one that's in our session if it
matches that's fine if it doesn't match
we're in trouble
and something fishy is going on so we
can just throw an exception so we're
gonna check if not this app hash hash
check I'm gonna check the token that we
generated with the submitted token from
the form now if that's not the case if
it doesn't match we need to throw a new
exception and we're gonna say cross-site
request forgery token mismatch like that
you can do pretty much anything you want
here but I'm gonna just throw an
exception and we could just get rid of
that backslash and use exception up
there just to tidy up a little bit so
let's try and submit the login form it
doesn't matter whether it works or not
you know we're just submitting through
this cross-site request forgery
protection is now in place and we're
checking that token so in our form let's
let's modify this token and by modifying
it I'm essentially just saying I don't
really know the token because I'm not
within your application I'm some kind of
attacker who's trying to submit this on
your behalf so I've changed the value of
the submitted token when that submitted
through we're gonna check that we are
making a post request which we are when
we submit the login form we're grabbing
the submitted token from the forum and
then we're checking if it matches the
one in the session and because I've just
modified it and I hit login we see we
get an application error and we get a
cross-site request forgery token
mismatch and that is pretty much it what
we need to do though is add this to
every form that we create it doesn't
need to be on every form that we create
but it's better to be a little bit more
careful and also if you ever forget to
include the cross-site request forgery
token so I've forgotten to include it on
the login form now when I log in we
still get the cross-site request forgery
token mismatch which forces you to go
ahead and implement this in each form
that you create so let's add it to our
register form down here and because the
key and token output if we ever change
the key it'll update on all of our forms
so we don't need to ever modify that so
I'm register now I can hit register and
it works I can also go ahead and modify
the key on register so let's just change
this something else hit register and we
get a cross-site
request for tree token mismatch so now
only you or your users who are in your
application are able to submit any forms
we're not allowing anyone to forge any
requests from outside of our application
and that is cross-site request forgery
protection and that's how we implement
it in our project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
