responsive emails and in this video
we're going to be taking some really
great templates from some really great
resources and making use of these and
learning how we can properly send these
through our application we're not going
to be looking at actually building the
responsive email because this does take
a lot of time and a lot of energy and
we'll see that a little bit later when
we look at how these have been
constructed so let's get started we're
just taking a look at how we're sending
emails it really doesn't matter which
language you're using to send the emails
that the same concept applies now in
this case I'm just using PHP to send an
email and it's important to know I have
this view set up called welcome dot PHP
and that just exists over here at the
moment we've just got a little bit of
text in there and we'll look at how this
is going to send in a minute so what we
see here is we're sending it to this
email address and we have a subject here
this unique ID is just so Gmail doesn't
categorize these emails so we can look
at them individually so let's just send
this email and we can see that when it
comes through we just have a really
boring email so the next step then is
really just to decide which kind of
template we want to work with and these
are really great resources so the first
one that we're going to take a look at
is probably one that I would use myself
by ZURB who are the creators of the
foundation front-end framework and
they've put together a collection of
email templates that we can download and
we're going to be looking at how we can
download these and modify them and then
convert them over so they can be
properly displayed in pretty much all
email clients so yeah we have these
templates available down here but serve
also released a responsive email
framework called Inc which I would
highly recommend you check out after you
have looked at the basics of doing this
and when I was browsing this site why I
found really interesting
is that they did struggle to create
these templates and you can go ahead and
click this and see their blog on how how
they did everything so that's really
interesting read if you want to find out
more about how they did this so there
are other options so this is another one
that I have used if you just head over
to github you can go ahead and download
all of the files that you need on this
we're not going to be using this one
we're going to be using these Erb
templates but there are other options
out there just so you know you can have
a little browse around a little search
around and find one that's going to work
for you so let's go ahead then and look
at pulling down this template we'll pull
it up in our browser as you can see it
here and we'll go ahead and look at how
we can put it into our application
modifier and then send it through so go
ahead and hit the download button and
once you've downloaded that you'll see
if we just close this project you'll see
that we've got a basic that HTML file so
you can see all of this markup just here
and we've also got the style sheets in
here as well so email dot CSS so these
are the star sheets for our responsive
email template now we can't just send
this as it is because we can't
necessarily link in a style sheet within
an email so we're going to be slightly
modifying this in in certain ways just
before we go ahead and convert this over
and send out and by convert I mean
placing all of our styles in line now
obviously this is really messy but it's
just the way things are with the email
on the web we can't go ahead and create
wonderful style sheets and then go ahead
and attach these somehow to an email we
have to do this really
Nestle and is it a bit of a shame it
works really well so what you're gonna
want to do then is once you've
downloaded them files let's just close
this off you can pull it up in your
browser so you can modify exactly to
your standard how you want it to look
you could break apart the header and the
footer if you wanted to or break apart
certain components in this case we're
just going to look at modifying the
whole thing
so we have this base email here then so
let's go ahead and look at modifying
this let's say for example we wanted to
change the logo we're not going to be
doing this but a really important thing
to note is this has to be an absolute
path to a hosted image so we can't just
say attach a logo or something to an
email that's really inconvenient what
we're going to do is you want to go
ahead and host an image somewhere like
in this example it's using placeholder
it which will just generate an image for
you and you just go ahead and include
that in there so let's just scroll down
and let's just change some of this so
that's just so responsive email and I
guess we can leave it at that for the
text just so we can see some around own
content come through and all I'm going
to do is just delete this section down
here so let's go ahead and search for
connect with us and this is nicely laid
out with comments as well so you can see
the end of the social and contact here
you can just go ahead pull this up and
get rid of that there we go
so we've now got this which we're going
to be sending to our email client and we
can have a look at it in here and
obviously if you have a fire in a soil
that's connected you can go ahead and
look at it on that as well so now that
we've got this template we need to start
modifying this so we can actually go
ahead and convert it over and then we
can send it so what we need to do is the
first thing is to grab all of the styles
and I'm gonna go ahead and copy all of
these and I'm going to go ahead and
create in here a style element and I'm
gonna paste them in so it's getting
really really messy now but what you're
going to want to do is keep this page as
your sort of base template this far here
is not what we're going to be sending
what we want to do is we want to take
all of the styles and convert them to
inline and that's going to allow it to
be properly rendered within an email
client so what we're going to do is
we're going to copy the entirety of this
page and there is an amazing resource
called pre mailer and all this
allows you to do is if you're not using
low if you are using local mail or
you're using something like mail done to
send emails you can go ahead and convert
your email it's properly displayed and
you could do this anyway just to make
sure but generally you're gonna want to
do this so with this we can use the URL
as the source we can paste the HTML M
which is what we're going to be doing
etc so we're going to click this and
we're going to paste all of that in and
we're gonna head down to our submit
button go ahead and click that and we
now have the result just here so let's
click this and copy everything in and
for the email remember it's stored
within welcome dot PHP so we're just
going to paste this in here and let's
just take a look at the difference of
this the styles in the head of obviously
gone but now you can see that they're
all in line so we've got these horrible
in line styles this is what's going to
allow us to send this email through and
it looked really nice in all email
clients so now rather than sending that
plain text we now have our converted
responsive email ready to go and we can
go ahead and send this email so let's
head back over let's just close this off
let's head back over to here and refresh
and there we go we can go ahead and head
over to here click this and there we
have our responsive email delivered to
our inbox you can obviously go ahead and
pull your browser in to kind of see the
responsiveness but obviously this would
be s be viewed on a smaller device or
something like that and that is pretty
much it this is the way that I generally
tackle setting responsive emails within
my application remember that as long as
you're storing your base template
somewhere that you can modify later so
for example if you wanted to down here
somewhere go ahead and output a name
maybe in here at least then you've got a
clean version of your template that you
can modify and of course what you could
do is just modify this itself but it
makes it a lot easier to make changes if
you do store the original version of
your template that's really handy to
have you can just modify it go ahead
convert it over again and the process is
a little bit easier the probably you are
automated solutions but working like
this gives us a good idea of how we
should be structuring our email in order
to send it and make it responsive when
we do deliver it to our users and that
is pretty much it with very little
effort and with the help observes
responsive email templates we've gone
ahead and sent a pretty nice-looking
responsive email to anyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
