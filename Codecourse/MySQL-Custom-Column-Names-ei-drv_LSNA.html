is selecting data from our database
table but doing something slightly
different and selecting data as a
different name so let's say we wanted to
set the name of our article but we
wanted this to be returned to us as a
completely different column name and
we're already seen this when we work
with the count so this is a very similar
thing but it works with the weather
columns as well so i'm going to go ahead
and I'm going to select star from in
fact i'm not gonna slick i'm not going
to select everything i'm gonna select
name from articles and that's going to
give me the only article that we have
and it will give me the name of the
article now what if i want to call the
call this article underscore name just
for the sake of argument i'm going to
now say as and i'm going to give this
the the name that i want to call the
column so i'm going to call this article
underscore name so I'm now saying select
the name of the column as article
underscore name from articles well this
will now do is it will provide me with
article name in place of the actual
column name so I'm almost like masking
the column name now if I want to go
ahead and also get the description I can
go ahead and get the description as
article underscore description if I
wanted to so article underscore
description so what I've actually done
here is I've comma separated so we've
done select names article name comma
description as article description comma
or kamar if we wanted to do more but if
we don't we just say from articles so
that will give me article underscore
name and a salon underscore description
so you can do this with any fields or
any functions that return values based
on your database data as we saw with
count earlier but this gives you the
opportunity to return data in a perhaps
a better for max you've got no control
over the table or if for naming
conflicts so if you have conflicts in
different namings within your
application you can go ahead and specify
how you want these to be returned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
