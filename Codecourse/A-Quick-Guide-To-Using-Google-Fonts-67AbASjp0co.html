including fonts using the Google Fonts
API we're going to go ahead and set up a
page with a paragraph or something like
that and we'll go ahead and implement
the font of our choice so let's open up
our text editor and just quickly create
a document so we can work with some
fonts here so let's create a title here
and let's also create a link for our
style sheet so I'm going to link in
maybe main dot CSS let's go ahead and
just create this now so let's create a
new folder called CSS and we'll store
main dot CSS the reason I'm doing this
is I'm going to choose the import
options we'll see in a moment so let's
create a paragraph of text here just say
hello I am a paragraph of text and let's
go ahead and preview this in our browser
so it looks like that nothing special so
over to Google Fonts what we're now
going to do is choose a font that we
want now luckily one of my favorite
fonts is at the top here I'm just going
to hit quick use so what this does is it
gives us the options for the font we get
this handy little page load graphic here
that tells us the impact on our page
load which is really important and I am
going to talk about this so it's good
practice to only choose the different
weights of the font that you actually
want so we've got things like extra bold
italic which you may not want so don't
ticket you can always have these really
easily later on so don't think that this
is the final you know time to choose
what you need so let's say we want
normal alight let's just choose them too
we've got with this font we've got the
option to choose the character sets that
we want and then we've got three
different options now my preferred
option is using import but you can go
ahead and simply copy and paste this
into a similar location that we have
just added our style sheet so what we're
going to do is we're going to hit the
import tab and I'm basically just going
to copy this I'm going to head back over
to my style sheet here and I'm going to
paste that in now we're not done yet
that's obviously not going to give us
our fun because we need to define what
we where we want this font to apply so
let's say we want this to apply to the
body all we do is we say fun
and then we give it the name of the font
with the fallback so in this case Google
suggests to us that we use open sans
well that's a requirement but we also
have a sans serif fallback as well so
this font name is called open sans and
it's a sans serif type so what we can do
now is go to our browser hit refresh and
we have our font on our page now I
mentioned earlier that with the font
weight this isn't the last time you can
actually choose them you may have
noticed that we do actually have the
ability to pass in the different weights
here so let's say for example you wanted
the bold
700 you can simply go ahead and include
this here and you can go ahead and set
the font weight here to 700 perhaps go
ahead and refresh and that takes into
account so that's a quick overview on
using google fonts to integrate fonts
into your website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
