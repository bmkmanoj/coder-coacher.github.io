continuing with the validation of the
data that we're posting in the
registration form so let's go down to
the next line and create a new F
statement we're going to be doing lots
of if statements one after another and
this one now we're going to check the
password length so we're going to check
essentially that it's greater than a
certain amount of characters and this is
going to give us some kind of control
over users password length and to make
sure they're not sort of just a on the
keyboard or something like that so we'll
say if our condition in here is going to
be that the passwords string length is
greater than six so I'm going to use the
STR Len function and I'm going to wrap
the post password in this and I'm going
to say is this greater than six we could
say greater than or equal to just
depends on you know how strong you want
to be you could say ten you know this
could be absolutely anything so there we
are
now the reason I'm not checking the
password again field as well is because
we are we're going to be checking the
passwords the passwords match anyway so
as long as the users entered say an
eight character password in the password
field then they go to the password again
even if they enter an eight for
character we will still get the we'll
still get the your passwords not strong
enough error but we'll also get no sorry
we won't get the passwords your password
isn't strong enough error but we'll get
your passwords need to match so they'll
need to make a change anyway so just
thinking about it logically we don't
really need to do that I mean you're
more than welcome to do if you want but
it's not required here so if the
password is oh sorry we need to say is
the password less than or equal to six
characters so if it's less than six
characters I'm going to say your
password
must be at least 6 characters ok so you
also may want to set an upper limit on
this so you might not want that password
to be you know I've no greater than 30
characters or something like that and
you could do this with all the fields as
well it's probably recommended in fact
so I'm not going to do it here but you
might want to go ahead and add an and
and then say and the string length is
less than 30 characters for example so
there we go okay so what do we want to
do now well we want to check the
password and essentially check it
against the second password that's been
entered so password and password again
so I'm going to say if I'm going to say
dollar underscore post password doesn't
equal so is not equal to password again
and if it's not we can just go ahead and
say error your passwords do not as much
and that's it simple as that okay so now
what we want to do is we want to check
whether the email address exists just a
thought as well the the username that
we're posting or allowing the user to
post can actually include spaces it'd
probably be a good idea not to allow
spaces within user names however it
depends on you know how specific you
want to be so let's go ahead and add in
a function that checks the amount of
well if any spaces are within the
username so I'm going to say another if
obviously I'm going to be using preg
match which is essentially a regular
regular expression match and this takes
a regular expression if you're
unfamiliar with regular expressions go
and look them up I'll give you a look
try and get a quick overview we're going
to be using a regular expression check
whether there is one or more spaces so
it user could have five spaces or
one space we ought to check any amount
of spaces between or within this
username so we say P rec matches how it
should be pronounced if this equals to
true now when will it equal to true well
we need to supply a regular expression
and we need to supply the field the
variable that we're checking and in this
case it's post username so the regular
expression well we need a /a a /hreul
Ike go inside of here and I'm going to
go ahead and I'm going to say double
backslash n and s so this is basically
checking for any amount of spaces within
so if we do have any spaces one or more
we are going ahead an echo and message
your username must not contain any
spaces okay so let's go ahead and just
test this out remember we've created the
the condition here as well that the
password must match and be greater than
six characters so let's just test these
all out I'm going to go ahead and into
Alex Garrett with a space in fact let's
give it five spaces I'm going to enter
password password and then pass and I'm
going to enter just my first name and my
email address so click register your
passwords do not match so we have this
this problem here in fact I actually I
think that Alex Garrett password and
pass Alex this is annoying thing about
testing these having to fill them out
constantly so we need to change this
double equals I believe because it won't
be returning I'll speak about that in
just a moment this is just one of the
things with with filling obviously
filling forms out it just takes a while
so let's say password and I'll take pass
and I'll give my first name email
address again register okay so now we've
got you username must contain
and must not contain any spaces now
let's go ahead and check out why are
neither this double equals as opposed to
triple equals obviously triple equals 10
checks for type checking as well it
doesn't just check the the value so for
example one will be equal to true
because and zero be equal to false in
this case if I was to go ahead and use
var dump on this here in fact how can we
do this yeah let's just go fired on this
so when i refresh oops
okay we're not gonna be able to dump
that so let's just dump her regular
expression and I'm going to go ahead and
say regular expression equals this there
we go okay so now let's go ahead and
refresh the page okay so here we go
we've got int 1 has been returned that's
the point I was trying to make what's
happened here is this function this this
preg match function has returned one so
we could in fact say triple equals one
no okay but as it double equals true so
essentially we're just checking this for
true ie containing you know to return to
value a positive integer and therefore
we know that there are spaces anyway
let's go ahead and move on before we
wasting more time so we've done that
we've checked the password and that the
pot passwords match let's go ahead and
fill the form improperly just very very
quickly so I'm going to give a username
Alex underscored Garrett which hasn't
been taken password I'm literally just
typing the text password I'll give a
first name and an email address I'm
going to click register all your
passwords do not match
okay maybe that was just a typo on my
part
Alix underscore Guerra password password
Alex and email address yeah there we go
so we've we've not returned any errors
now within this array so let's go ahead
and leave that there in the next part
we'll we'll return to some more
validation and it has run over slightly
just because I have been writing code
that you know doesn't make sense in in
an attempt to explain my examples but
let's go ahead and move on from this set
in the next part and continue to you
know write out some some of these
conditions and get this over and done
