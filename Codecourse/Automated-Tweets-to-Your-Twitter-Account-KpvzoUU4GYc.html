looking at automating tweets from our
application and basically posting tweets
to a specific account that's not a
user's account that's one of our
accounts that we're going to predefined
as authenticated to use basically so
let's take a look at how this works then
I've got a blank page here we're just
gonna refresh this and all this is going
to do is it's going to post us tweet to
this account here there are currently no
tweets on here so we'll know that this
has worked by obviously seeing this
tweet so let's head back to this page
here and hit refresh give that just a
second that's already done when we head
back to here and refresh we should see
that we appear perfect so this is
basically what we're going to do this is
perfect for if you want to automate
something within your application to
tweet about something or tweet sort of
dynamic content and like I said
extremely easy to do so let's get
started with writing the code so the
first thing to do then is sign in to the
Twitter account that you want to post
the tweets from I'm currently on this
code course forum account and I'm over
on Apps twitter.com/randymckown I'm
gonna give it a description so we'll
just say code course forum tweets will
give a website URL as well so let's go
ahead and type in here co course comm
callback URL we don't need because we're
not authenticated users with this it's
purely for posting tweets to that
account go ahead and read the developer
agreement and agree to that if you do
and hit create your Twitter application
and that will go ahead and create that
for you so the first thing that we need
to do within this once it's been created
is modify the application permissions
this is really important before we start
to use a consumer keys or anything like
that so let's click modify app
permissions and we'll go ahead and set
this to read and write if you set this
to read-only then start to use your keys
they'll be
invalid you'll need to regenerate keys
so make sure you do this step before hit
update and that will go ahead and update
that for us now this sometimes take a
while it takes a while to for it to
change take effect so if it's not
working immediately that's that's not a
problem just wait for a couple of
minutes so come over to the keys and
access tokens tab and you'll see your
application settings this will give you
your consumer key and your consumer
secret and we also need to generate an
access token and the reason for this is
we're not doing this on a user basis we
want to create an access token to
specifically define within our code that
we're going to be writing soon this just
makes sure that we are authenticated so
it explicitly saying we are
authenticated so go ahead and click
create my access token they'll generate
that for you and in just a moment you'll
see these here so the keys that we need
are the consumer key here the consumer
secret we also need the access token and
the access token secret as well so we're
going to be using these explicitly
within our application you should not
share these keys with anyone and they
shouldn't be human readable in your
application preferably stored in a
database somewhere but for now we're
just gonna copy and paste them in and
I'll let you decide where it's best to
place them for you so now that we've
done that we need to go ahead and use
some kind of library to connect to
Twitter's API so I'm going to be using
toad bird PHP this is a really easy to
use library we need to download and
install this with composer which is a
dependency manager for PHP and then once
we've done that it's going to be super
simple to get this going so if we had
over 2 packages we can actually pull in
with composer a specific version of this
this library and I'm gonna be pulling in
2.6 star so any increments on on this so
to do that we're gonna head over to our
text editor and under our root directory
we're going to create a new file and
we're going to call this composer JSON
and make sure you do have composer
installed before hand head over to get
composer 2 org 2
know this so we're going to start off
this JSON string then and we're gonna
require in a specific package this can
be done from the command line but I'll
do it here just so it's a little bit
more explicit and we want to require
something in here and what we want to
require is the repository and where this
is hosted so I'm going to copy and paste
this just into here and we want to
change this dev master we don't want to
pull in the dev master version of this
so we're gonna pull in 2.6 star so we
can just type 2.6 star in here and
that's it it's done so now we need to
install the dependency which is going to
create a vendor folder and an auto
loader to load in any dependencies we
have within our application now bear in
mind you can go ahead and download code
bird on its own if you really wanted to
so if you head over to the source
directory you can go ahead and download
this all it's a little bit more
complicated that way just to keep up to
date with the latest versions so I would
highly recommend using composer but if
you really don't want to you can
download this manually and this will
give you instructions here to include it
and everything else so head over to your
command line then making sure you have
composer installed which I do I'm gonna
hit composer install which is going to
install my dependencies you can see my
composer version is a little out of date
so if yours is go ahead and run self
update to update it and that looks like
it has successfully downloaded code bird
so what we can now do is check inside of
our main directory and we can openly
spend the folder you can see that we've
got that installed here we've also got
this auto load file which we need to
require in anywhere where we want our
dependencies to be accessed so the first
thing I'm going to do then is require in
vendor auto load dot PHP and that's it
so we now have full access to this code
bird library and we can start using it
so code word is namespace if we just
scroll down on the github repository is
names based on the code bird code bird
so we're going to need to go
ahead and import this so we're gonna say
use code bird code bird and then down
here we can just start to use it so I'm
gonna create a variable called CB for
code bird and that's just going to be a
new code bird instance and we can now
use any of the methods to set up
consumer key which we've already seen on
that Twitter application set our token
and then go ahead and update our status
so the first thing we want to do then is
set out consumer key so we use the set
consumer key method and this takes two
parameters which is our consumer key and
our consumer secret so if we head over
to our keys and access tokens let's go
ahead and just copy this and let's paste
this in here is the first argument I'm
gonna pull this down just because this
does get a little bit long we don't it
to run over too many lines and we're
gonna pull in our API secret as well
it's a consumer key secret so let's pop
that in there so that's the first step
now normally with code bird or any other
library that connects to Twitter API you
would use OAuth to authenticate a user
like I've already said in our case we
don't want to do that because we're not
dealing with users we're just dealing
with our Twitter account so we're gonna
explicitly define the token here so
let's go ahead and do that it works in
exactly the same way we've got two
arguments the first being the token and
then we've got a secret so it scrolled
down and copy and paste the access token
just into here and then let's go ahead
and copy and paste our secret just into
here so now anything that we do with the
code bird library we're fully
authenticated now so we can go ahead and
update our status so the method that we
use for this is statuses update and then
we pass in an array of options now there
are plenty of options you can find
everything you need on the code bird
repository on github so go ahead and do
read that make sure you understand
everything that you can do with it and
can't do and for this well in this case
all we need to do is pass in a status
key and this is just going to be a
datas you can't do things like post
geolocation here so once you're done
with this tutorial go ahead and check
out the kinds of things that you can do
so let's just go ahead and type some
text in here and that's pretty much it
so we're gonna refresh this page now
that's going to obviously set our
consumer key set out oaken and it's
going to update our status so if we head
over to here
remember we have no tweets at the moment
we head over to our page and refresh
hopefully we get no errors and when i
refresh this page you can see that
that's gone ahead and updated and
created a status and obviously we can do
that as many times as we want and it
will just go ahead and add more for us
so I guess if they are different so we
can do something else here like so okay
so that is how easy it is to automate
tweeting from particular account this
can be used for a wide variety of things
I'm sure you can think up some really
cool things to do with this but that is
pretty much it so simple and really cool
if you do need to use this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
