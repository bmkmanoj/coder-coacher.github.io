PHP and the first loop we're going to
look at deals exclusively with items
that can be iterated across so for
example data structures like arrays we
can iterate through each item in an
array and we can do something with that
item so the first thing we're going to
do is just build a quick array with a
few names in it a single dimensional
array and then we'll go ahead and loop
through and see what we can do here so
I'm going to create a variable called
names and that's going to be an array
and inside of this is going to be a few
names so if we just fill this in with a
few names here okay so now that we have
this array what can we do well let's go
ahead and use the for each construct
what this allows us to do is pass in the
item that we want to iterate through so
the the item that contains items so I an
array and then we choose what name we
want to give each of those items for
each loop so if we were to pass in this
names array here this is going to loop
three times because there are three
elements in this array so I'm gonna say
for each names as so that as keyword
allows us to define what we want each of
these items to be called for each
iteration so I'm going to just say name
it's usually a good idea to use a plural
and then a singular but I can then do is
I can go ahead and echo name and I'm
just gonna pend on a break after that so
let's go ahead and look at what this
looks like in the browser you can see
that now we just have in our source code
the value Alex break Billy break Dale
and then a break at the end so all
that's really done is is it's gone
through each of these items and it's
broken it up now what we can also do is
we can determine what position we're at
in this array we do this by using an
index and then we use this to us to
basically just assign or note that we
have an index and the value so we have a
basic key and a value so this will now
represent the key of the erase this will
be 0 1 2 and this will be the value of
the array so I can say here index space
dot the name and then break
because if we're gonna get zero dot
space then the name then a break so if
we go ahead and preview this we see that
this changes and gives us the key as
well the index as well so now what we
can do is for example we could say index
plus one and that would give us a source
of one two three effects so we can do
things with that index within this loop
as well what we could also do is perhaps
do something like a little check here to
say if index doesn't equal the count of
names then we want to echo a break now
what this will do is previously when we
looked at the source code we had a break
after the last result and when i refresh
again now we get the same result but we
don't get a all we do and let's just
take a look now there we go sorry index
plus 1 so if index plus 1 doesn't equal
the count of names then we want to add a
break so what we can then do is remove
the need for the last break there now
there are other ways of doing that but
all we're really doing here is
demonstrating how we can loop through a
list of array items using for each by
grabbing the index doing something with
the index and outputting this data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
