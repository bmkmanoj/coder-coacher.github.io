CMS in this video CMS is a content
management system and in our case we're
going to be building this system to list
pages on a home page like this and we're
also going to be building an admin panel
where we can add a page give all the
information we need and then we come
back to the home page and we'll see then
pages listed so this system touches a
few parts of PHP that are fundamental
when you are learning it so we're going
to be looking at the database connection
and the design of the database table
we're going to be looking at structuring
our application in a very basic way but
something that will give you an idea of
how you might go forward and structure a
very basic application we're going to be
touching on obviously the functionality
to insert pages to our content
management system and that's going to
involve touching our database working
with queries we're also going to look at
security as well in terms of how you
insert an output things as securely as
possible we're going to touch on the
concept of separating your application
logic from views which is essentially
saying what actually happens in the
background should be separate from what
you show to your user on the screen so
we'll take a look quick look around how
this works
and then in the next video we'll just go
ahead and get our database set up get
connected and then into the series we'll
just put all of this together so we've
already seen this home page we've got no
pages at the moment so we're just
showing a error or a message rather and
as we saw earlier we have this admin
panel here and this also says no pages
at the moment so let's go and add a page
and we'll give this title we'll say 1st
page or this is the first page now the
label is what you'll see as the link
text so this is the actual title of the
page and this is just what will be
displayed on the link we have a slug
which will be contained within the URL
to just give a more friendly way of
displaying the page so we'll just say
first - page we can't have any spaces or
anything in here what we could do but if
you are rewriting your URLs to look
pretty that won't work
and in the body we'll just say welcome
to the first page so we hit add and now
we get this view inside of this admin
area where we see the label the title
the slug we have the ability to edit and
delete it let's take a look back at our
home page now we can see that we get the
first page now this will be the same for
any other pages you out they'll just
lists down here underneath each other
and let's go ahead and click on this so
here's the title that we added here's
the body that we added we can also see
the slug just in here so we've got a
value in the query string and we'll be
learning about how we can pick these up
later and we've also got a created date
here so the 16th of May 2015 and if we
go over to the admin area we can edit
this so let's say I wanted to add an
exclamation mark to the title I can go
ahead and edit that you can see that
that's updated the title here we can
also go back and refresh and see that
that's updated here and we also now have
this last updated text down here so
there's a few things going on here we
can also delete by the way so I can hit
delete and that's going to go ahead and
get rid of that we can see that that
page can't be found now and we can go
back to the start so there is a little
bit going on in the background here yeah
but it's fairly straightforward but does
cover a lot of fundamental concepts when
you are learning PHP so in the next
video we're going to go ahead and design
our database and we're going to connect
set up our app so we're ready to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
