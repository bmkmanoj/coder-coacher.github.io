small application that every time we
refresh the page we go ahead and show a
quote a random quote from a set of
quotes that we've defined so you can see
here as I refresh we have pretty much a
random quote now we've already learned
about how to generate random numbers
we've already learned about arrays so
what we're gonna be doing is combining
these two to show a random quote from an
array and what we're then gonna be doing
is refactoring it so the code is a
little bit shorter and a little bit
cleaner okay so let's go ahead and build
this out and then we'll go and refactor
it to make it a little bit better
alright so we are starting with a blank
PHP file I'm actually gonna pull over an
array that I already have here just so I
don't have to type out all of these
quotes but by now this should be pretty
familiar to you okay so here we have an
array of arrays and then we have an
associative array here so we have author
and text so it's important to know that
all of these quotes are the same they
all have an author and they all have
text that's really important okay so
before we go ahead and output these to
the page we're first of all going to
work out how we can generate or at least
extract a random quote from this list so
the first thing that we're going to do
is create a quote variable which will
hold that random quote that we've pulled
out now we know that in PHP we can use
the rand function we've already seen
this start the course and then we can go
ahead and provide a lower and an upper
bound so in this case there and if we
just go ahead and echo out quote
obviously this isn't going to be a quote
at the moment however it is going to be
a random number between 0 and 10 so what
we can do from here then is knowing that
an array is 0 indexed we can leave the
lower bound at 0 but the upper bound is
always going to be the amount of items
we have minus 1 now the reason it's
minus 1 is because we have a 0 indexed
array so if we had say 1 2 3 4 5 in here
it would be 0 to 4 so we know how to
count the values of an array so we just
use count quotes and then all we do is
we minus 1 because obviously
count function here will return an
integer okay so now that we've done this
then we have a random number between
zero and four and we can prove that just
by giving this a refresh a few times all
right so now actually time to extract
the quote out and very very simply what
we can do is say something in here like
quote and then because this is an array
we're going to access it by that
randomly generated number so we just put
this into our square bracket notation to
pull out a quote and let's just change
that to quotes like that okay so now
that we've done that we should have a
quote but remember we can't echo this
out because this is going to be an array
within here so we're gonna do a var dump
unquote to see this so give that a
refresh and you should see now this
change every time so that's pretty
straightforward we are going to be
refactoring this in a moment but that's
pretty much it for now alright so now
we're going to from this quote extract
out the quote text so we can use this in
a more easier way and we're gonna go
ahead and grab that quote I'm gonna grab
the text out we're gonna do the same
thing on the next line so we're gonna
say quote author and again we're just
going to pull out the author from here
brilliant okay so now we need to display
this now I said earlier that we
shouldn't really go ahead and have PHP
start tags here in tags here and then
HTML not only what you would use is a
templating engine to make this a little
bit easier but since we're not that far
ahead let's go ahead and just do this
for now so let's go ahead and create
that document layout just here and again
if you want to copy down this code here
if you're not familiar with HTML go
ahead and do that and now we just
literally want to output these to the
page so the title here we're just gonna
say random quote and in the body we're
now gonna create a block quote element
with HTML and then inside of here we're
going to have a header now in here we
need to find out how we're going to
output this because we're still within a
PHP page what we can do is we can use a
PHP starting tag and an ending tag on
the same line and then we can just write
any code we want in here so if you are
building a very
small project this is perfectly
acceptable so let's echo out here the
quote text that we defined just up here
this will be available here so we can
use that and let's also create some HTML
entities and this is LD qu o and then a
semicolon this will just create a
quotation mark for us and then we need
to do the same but for a right quotation
mark so it's our D and then qu o and
let's just make sure that we end up
there with a semicolon
and we can go ahead and take a look so
there we go we now have a quote there
with quotation marks brilliant so it
just as a side note what you can
actually do and this entirely depends on
your PHP configuration you can actually
use a shorthand syntax for this and this
is the following so this looks a little
bit different and we don't need to
include the semicolon here but this will
go ahead and output the quote text it's
a little bit shorter but depending on
how your PHP configuration is set up
that may not work I always prefer to do
this just to be safe okay so now inside
of this block quote element we want a
strong tag and then in here we want the
author I'm just going to create a little
- there and we're gonna go ahead and
simply do the same thing but we're gonna
do this for the quote author so let's go
ahead and echo out quote author in that
line off and we're done so let's give
that a refresh and let's just make sure
we spell that correctly there we go we
need to change that over to author you
probably noticed that and then we go so
that is our random quote displaying on
the page and of course you can do
whatever you want with this alright so
what we're gonna do now is we're going
to look at an alternative way that we
can do this now this is perfectly
acceptable there's nothing wrong with
pulling out a random quote using the
rand function but there's a slightly
better way to do this and we'll take a
look at this now so what I'm actually
gonna do is just down here I'm gonna
kill the page and I'm gonna use
something called the die function we can
also use the exit function as well but
typically we use this just to kill the
execution of the script and you'll
notice here that nothing after that run
so that's just a little tip if you need
to play around with something and not
have anything else wrong okay so
what I'm gonna do is introduce the array
rand function so we know what an array
is and this just happens to be something
that plucks out a random value from an
array so let's go ahead and pass in an
array so this does require the array
that we want to grab a random item from
and remember if you want to check this
out
go over to the PHP documentation and
have a look what this accepts what it
returns and all that kind of stuff so
now I'm just going to assign this to a
variable quote and down here we're going
to var dump unquote just to see what we
get out of here so let's give that a
refresh and you can see here we get int
1 now this might seem a little bit
strange but what's actually happening
here is we are from that array plucking
out a random value but or a random array
item but by its key not by its actual
value so from this then just to avoid
having to do something like this and
having to minus 1 off the count of this
this makes it a little bit more
convenient so what we can do now because
we know that this returns an index we
can get rid of that or at least cut here
and we can just paste that directly into
there so that makes things a little bit
cleaner again there's nothing wrong with
the first solution but to me this is a
little bit cleaner so now when we go
ahead and refresh we can see that it
works in the same way okay so that's
that project done just a little
application to go ahead and display
random quotes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
