building a jQuery plug-in that basically
checks any field within a form that you
specify and it will check whether that
particular value exists in a database or
not so for example if I was filling in a
form to sign up and I needed to choose a
username I could start typing a username
what that's gonna do is it's gonna tell
me if this value is already taken or not
so then I can go ahead and choose
another username and it tells me that it
is available and we can do the same for
other fields as well so we're gonna make
this entirely flexible so you can use it
for more than one field in this case I'm
doing it for email which doesn't really
make sense it probably does make sense
in a way but you might not want to
include it for email so for example if I
were to type Alex at code course comm it
was available because I was still typing
but then once I finished typing you can
see it's already taken so what I can
then do is go ahead and just change this
and now it tells me it's available and
then the user can hit sign up and you
would obviously still have your back-end
checks that's really important you
should never ever rely on front-end
validation you know to prevent the user
perhaps from submitting the form anyway
you still want your back and checks in
there anyway let's take a brief look at
what what the mark-up looks like just so
you know how it's implemented here we've
just got a form which goes through to
sign up dot PHP this is just a page
doesn't exist at the moment now in here
we've got the form field for the
username I've wrapped this in just a div
here but the input here has a class of
check exists which later on once we've
loaded in both jQuery and our main dot
J's file where we'll be writing our
plug-in we can use check exists and then
we can actually activate our plug-in on
any element that has check exists so
obviously this selector will return the
jQuery object and then the exist check
is that function that we're going to be
building so we have a datatype here
which is essentially the type that
you're going to pass through to your
back-end and then you have some kind of
if statement will switch to check your
database it does sound a little bit
complicated but we're going to build
this up from scratch
it will actually be fairly
straightforward and a lot of this does
make sense it's just about understanding
how this needs to be put together and
obviously we're duplicating this for the
email field as well we just have data
type as email and this span here is
basically just where the user will see
the message so this is where we inject
text into to say sorry that particular
email is in use or that use name is in
use you can go ahead and adjust the
markup to how you need it you could
probably tidy this off a little bit but
for now this is just gonna be a really
easy way of doing this and you can
change it to suit your needs
so in the next video we're gonna be
building up the backend side of this so
we can actually look at how we check in
the database and then we'll apply the
front inside of it in the last part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
