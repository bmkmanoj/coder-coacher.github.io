final part of our html5 canvas drawing
application series so now we've created
quite a fully featured app I mean we've
given the user control of both the
radius and the color palette and we've
also given them the opportunity to save
their images so you know we've got we've
got enough features to say that this app
is done but you know there's it's not
without its flaws and there are
certainly other things that we could add
if we wanted to so I thought um I'll go
through some of the things that are not
perfect about it and what you could
think about adding so last time we have
the Save button which let the user save
their images so it downloaded it that
was all very nice so we use the
content-disposition attachment in the
HTTP header which was really handy and
meant that the user didn't have to right
click to save their image um but we do
get that sort of annoying pop-up window
that that just sticks about and this was
only to download the file um and this is
not just annoying for the user but the
browser knows that it's going to be
annoying and it tries to block this sort
of thing so I mean you've all heard of
pop-up blockers and in some browsers
this will block that window as a pop-up
it will see that and think that ain't
cool and just you know it won't it won't
let it through without permission so how
can we get through that and why is that
doing that so if we look at our code of
what's going on here basically browsers
see window door opens they're fine as
long as they're coming from a
user-generated event like a click or you
know mouse move or something and so
where's this coming from it's not coming
from user-generated event because you
know this is attached to the event
listener of click on Save button right
well it's actually attached to this
requester onreadystatechange of our Ajax
of our xhr here there
set xml httprequest and because this
request is done asynchronously it means
that it's no longer connected in
JavaScript sites so this is no longer
part of the click event so up until here
and all this outside of this and that's
all fine that's all part of the click
event but then this part that's
asynchronous that sort of goes off and
does it only does its own thing that's
gonna throw up some mornings because
it's trying to open a window and it's
not um it's not triggered by this user
event so how can we bypass that I mean
we could if we wanted to if we really
wanted to use window open we can make
that a two-step process so we could on
on the click load a URL into a variable
or something and then on the next click
open this window but there's no nothing
to say that we have to use window to
open at all I mean up I only threw that
in there last time because it was sort
of we had we already had it weird looks
at it before and it was of an easy way
to show it there are far better ways up
other things that we can do to get this
down load up PHP page for example if we
go into our save div we could create an
iframe if we wanted to give that an ID
of download frame or something and close
that off I'm also going to add the
hidden attribute here just because it's
quick if you're being really good you
would do that CSS because I don't think
Internet Explorer in every case deals
with hidden quite as you as it should so
you can get rid of the window line and
you could open up this download PHP in
your iframe so all you'd have to do to
do that is
to get your document document get your
iframe just using document dot get
element by ID say download frame and
then target that little source attribute
and set that to what we've already been
using so same pretty much the same
concept just in an iframe instead so try
that out here draw a gorgeous spiral put
some color in lovely and save it and it
won't even open up that annoying window
and it will just download straight away
so that's actually probably even better
for the user and because you don't end
up with that um window sticking about so
that's one really quick improvement that
we could make so what other problems are
there with our app at the moment so you
can see at the moment we've got this
this canvas this sort of drawing space
and we can go all the way up to the edge
of the window and the reason we can do
that is because in our main j/s we set
the width and the height of the canvas
to the window to end with an eye but
notice that that's only happening when
the JavaScript executes and this is not
in any sort of function or any sort of
loop this is not this is only happening
once so if we were to load the page
again if we were to load it smaller like
this and so at the moment we can go to
full width and height that's all fine
but when we drag it out you can see that
we can no longer draw out here because
you know it's not part of the original
width and height so we're sort of stuck
there so what we want what we want to do
to combat that is to do something like
use the on resize property of the window
and say set a equal to a function and it
just does this for you and that would be
a really easy thing to do and that's
that's going to do what we wanted to do
it's also going to have another effect
that we don't want it to have so we
resize we can see
um the is resized the canvas then we can
now draw outside where the original
window was but also reset the canvas it
just you know we lost everything and
that's really not what we want to happen
at all so why is that just because it's
in the spec the html5 canvas spec and so
whenever the the canvas is resized the
context gets reset so I mean there there
are a few ways you can go about getting
the image data and putting it back in
after the after the redraw one of them
is something called get image data and
it takes a few parameters it sort of it
takes a rectangles worth of image so
it's the x and y coordinates of the
start point and then the excellent y
coordinates of the end the bottom right
corner of this this rectangle that you
want to trace basically and so that
would be canvas taught with canvas dot
height and then you suppose put it back
in with put image data and you'd use
that object you what you want to store
this in something so like image for
example and then use that there and
simple it on there and you can see if we
do that and then that works a treat but
we still have the issue of the redraw
resetting all our properties and stuff
so you'll have to find a way around that
to help you do that I'm going to
introduce you to the official spec for
this context so if you do quick google
search for w3c context 2d will be the
first hit
and you get this really long boring
looking sort of introduction and then
the table of contents this is going to
be really useful if you want to sort of
look at more into on in depth of canvass
and what it can do just sort of quick
browse through the table of contents
will tell you if you're going to be
interested in what it has to offer
I mean pixel manipulation is a really
cool thing in my opinion because I mean
you can you can literally take pixel by
pixel and analyze them however you want
so you can get right down into the maths
of it all and create sort of an image
editing program or something so and I
mean it's fairly readable this sort of
spec is designed for the people who are
implementing the browsers themselves so
it's not really designed as like a
reference but it's so useful and it
tells you exactly how everything works
and how everything should work and
because it's a spec it's um it's what's
going to be used across all the browsers
theoretically anyway so um so yeah you
can see all the things that these things
can do so I was using that get image
data method there which returns an image
data object and then the put image data
method that takes in an image data
object so they're very easy to work
together that's actually not the best
way you could do that and you can also
use the idea of sort of a virtual canvas
so you don't necessarily have to have
the canvas visible to use it so you can
say document dot create element you
could create a canvas element and just
never add it to your to your actual Dom
so you can create this canvas element
and you can still work with it you can
a sort of virtual canvas call it
whatever you want work with it just as
if it is visible to the user but just
never make it visible so virtual context
and and just and you can sort of write
to this to this virtual context and
because you're never going to resize
that if you if you make that to start
with you make that as big as you ever
going to want the canvas to be and then
sort of draw to this virtual canvas that
can be a useful way to do things so I
hope that makes sense conceptually so
one feature that maybe our application
is lacking slightly is a clear button
I mentioned that resizing the canvas
does clear it so you could take
advantage of that and you'll see it a
lot in in demos if you if you were to
look around but if you create you could
create a function called clear you know
clear canvas take in a context and then
that can just be oh no taking a canvas
and you can literally just say canvas
width you don't even have to change the
width just as long as you're calling
this setter function this sort of you're
telling JavaScript you're setting this
property so you can set it to the exact
same thing and that will still clear the
canvas so you can see if we draw
something here and then clear canvas and
our canvas is just called canvas you can
see that that works fine and you know
that's a nice little hack that you can
do to clear the canvas really quickly
far quicker than some of the things you
would see in the spec so in the spec
there is
method called clear rect if we just
search for that so what it does
basically is clear a certain racked
rectangle and one way of clearing the
whole canvas would just be to to clear
the rectangle with a top left corner of
zero zero and then the bottom right
corner of the width and height of the
canvas which just clear the entire
canvas which works fine but it's so much
slower than this method that we've just
defined just literally resetting the
whole thing and if you're already doing
a resize function and sort of a restore
function for this resize if you're going
to create that anyway you might as well
do that and you get to go obviously for
the clear you won't have to restore the
actual image data but you would probably
still want to restore things like the
line width and the color so you know
where else do we go from here I mean
there are certainly things you can you
can add to this and I really do
encourage you to look through this
document do a google search for it look
through this document see what you want
to add and just try and do it because
it's just the best way to really get to
grips with all of this API as a
challenge for working with the image on
the canvas I challenge you to use get
image data and put image data to form an
undo system so you could have a certain
amount of history States even if a time
out be warned to start with you could
try using context get image data and
storing that somewhere every time for
example the user lifts their mouth and
then redrawing that to the canvas when
undo is clicked so maybe if you're if
you feel up for that give that a shot
you could also um do something about the
radius at the moment
there's no visual feedback when you're
setting the radius so you can only check
the actual size of the radius by drawing
and so you can maybe create a div that
that shows only when you when you change
this value and shows the size of the the
the radius and so yeah that could be
also useful feature if you're more into
the PHP side of things you could create
a public gallery so this could be more
of a sort of community type application
and you can browse other people's images
and things like that there's a whole lot
of potential for what you could do with
this so I do encourage you to have a
place see what you can come up with and
definitely definitely read this or not
not read this document but you know skim
it at least yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't
wish reading the whole thing upon anyone
but but definitely have a look through
and see what interests you because there
are certainly things that will things
like drawing text and drawing images
compositing and shadows is some really
cool stuff in there have a look through
and I hope you find something that
interests you so over this series we've
done a lot and I hope that you found
some of it useful I hope that you find
the things that we've covered are useful
in other situations as well so I mean
we've covered drawing to the canvas not
only in in this sense but also you know
through code how we can actually draw
things like like fill paths and drawing
lines and the underlying concepts about
how the canvas works so I hope that you
find that useful in your further
projects we've also looked at creating
Dom elements dynamically with JavaScript
with that color palette that we created
using the array to make life so much
easier for us
and that's a really good practice for
just whatever app you're building try
and make things as easy as possible for
yourself and for maintaining the app in
future and that's a good example of how
you can do that we've also looked at
some sort of more in-depth stop in depth
topics and we looked at how we could
save the canvas data and transport that
in in a way that we can save it to a
server and then bring it back and
download it immediately so I really hope
those concepts all proved handy I hope
this series has given you a glimpse into
the power of the canvas and really wet
your appetite for building exciting
applications in html5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
