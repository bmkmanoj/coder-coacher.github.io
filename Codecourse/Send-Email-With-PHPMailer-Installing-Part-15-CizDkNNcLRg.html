email with PHP and we're going to do
this with some software called PHP
mailer this is a PHP based email sending
solution so we're going to install it
first of all and we're going to look at
two different ways that we can install
this the first way is using PAC packages
and using composer to install this
package and composer is a dependency
manager and this sounds all a little bit
complicated if you're new to the idea of
a dependency manager but don't worry
it's going to be really simple but for
those of you that just want to copy over
the source of PHP mailer we'll be
looking at doing that as well so don't
worry so let's get started with actually
installing this fire composer so the
first thing I want to do is check the
compose it is installed in my case you
can see that it is if it's not installed
go ahead and install it head over to get
composer the org and you'll find
instructions there so what I'm going to
do now is I'm going to make a directory
called vendor inside of the file folder
that I'm working in so we need to
basically include this require inside of
a JSON composer to JSON file you can see
that the vendor folders here this is the
directory I'm working within and this is
the vendor folder I created so let's
create a composer JSON file basically
this is just what you need to require in
for your project very very simple so now
that's saved as composer JSON we can
open up the terminal again and we can
say composer install what this will do
is it will read that JSON file and it
will go ahead and install all the
dependencies and they'll be installed
within the vendor folder that we created
earlier so PHP mail has now been
installed let's look at how we might go
ahead and include these in our
application you can see that within
vendor this autoload dot PHP file has
been generated so I'm going to create a
new file and I'm going to save this
inside of here as
index.php this is the file that we will
be working on to send emails now what
I'm going to do is I'm going to require
in this autoload file because what that
will do is it will auto load all of my
dependencies that have been installed by
composer so I say vendor slash auto load
of PHP so now that we've done that we've
installed PHP mailer via composer now
let's look at a solution of installing
this just by copying over to your
working directory so the alternative way
to install PHP mailer would be to
download the current release from github
and then copy that over to your folder
within your project and then requiring
the PHP mailer also load up PHP file so
if you go ahead and download the zip
over in our text editor let's create a
folder within our root directory I'm
just going to call this libs for
libraries and I've already got an index
dot PHP file but within libs you want to
go ahead and copy over the PHP mailer
install over the PHP mailer that you've
downloaded from github let's create a
new folder in here called PHP mailer and
we'll copy that over now so once that's
copied over you'll have a root directory
that you're working in this is where my
index dot PHP file is we'll have the
peer at the libs folder then the PHP
mailer folder and then in here we've got
this PHP mailer autoload file we want to
include this in so let's go over to
index dot PHP and require this in so
this will be libs slash PHP mailer slash
PHP mailer autoload dot PHP so once
that's saved in our browser we can just
make sure that everything is working
here we don't see any errors and I have
error error reporting turned on so I can
assume that everything has been included
so that's the easier way if you like or
to a manual way to install PHP mailer
but either way you choose
we can now go ahead and start to send
the emails</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
