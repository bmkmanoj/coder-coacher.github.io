new PHP project I would open github up
in a new tab I would search her about 4
repositories I'd look for a database
obstruction letter layer so probably
doctrine or red bean or something
similar I look for maybe twig the
templating engine I look for PHP mailer
for mailing and I don't know I might
look for a root or something
so I download all of these all of these
packages I didn't click them into my
directory and then I make sure that all
of those classes were included into my
project which to be honest is kind of a
hassle it takes a long time and it's
annoying to set up so this guy decided
to create composer which is a dependency
manager for PHP so before I demonstrate
this to you we're just going to hit
getting started and we're going to
install this so we're going to scroll
down to about here before I do this make
sure that you have curl installed if not
it's it's very simple to install just to
Google search it all you do is copy this
we paste it any command line then you
copy this you paste it in your command
line and done I'm not going to execute
these because I already have composer
installed once you that once you've done
those commands you can just type compose
it to check that everything worked and
if you get this then perfect if you get
something else then retrace your steps
and have another go so we can close this
now we're going back we're going to go
back to our a project and we're going to
create a new file we're going to call
this composer JSON and we're going to
start the JSON file as we would any file
we're going to then add require key and
inside here will be all of the all of
the packages that we want to include in
our project so if we just go to packages
dog which is an excellent site it's
basically just a centralized location
for all composer
packages let's say that I want to
install twig which is the example I used
earlier we're going to search for twink
there is twig slash twig we can either
click this and copy this line which
we're going to do just like that or you
could say something in the command line
you could say compounds required twigs
lash twig but for now we're just going
to paste this into our acquire and then
we're going to run composer install and
that will probably take a couple of
seconds to install so eventually you'll
get this screen and that means that it
was installed successfully so we can
close this now go back to our index file
and all we need to do is say require
vendor or download the PHP and that's it
it's really just that simple you can
have as many packages in here as you
like just go to packages to organ and
search whatever you're looking for so we
could search for laravel we could look
for PHP mailer we could look for a
smartie the templating engine it has
pretty much everything so just have a
little look on there do a little bit of
exploring it's a great resource</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
