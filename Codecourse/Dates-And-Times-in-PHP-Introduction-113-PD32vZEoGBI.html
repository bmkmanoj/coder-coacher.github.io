times in PHP can be really boring and
really stressful at times as well so in
this series we're going to look
exclusively are dealing with dates and
times within PHP using a library called
carbon now carbon is an extremely
popular library for dealing with dates
and times and in fact it extends PHP s
date/time which is a massive improvement
in itself on the way that we used to
work with dates and times within PHP so
what we're going to be doing is in the
next video we're going to be installing
carbon and looking at two ways we can do
this the first way is going to be using
composer which I would highly recommend
and the other if you're not quite ready
to use composer or you have a very good
reason not to we're gonna look at just
pulling it into our project as a normal
file and just including it on our page
then what we're gonna do throughout the
series is take a look at all of the
different things that we can do with
carbon and how this is going to make our
lives a lot easier when we're dealing
with dates and times and this isn't just
going to cover looking at specific dates
and times and outputting them it's also
going to work with manipulating times
comparing times and some more advanced
things that really really will help you
along the way now finally at the end of
the series we're gonna look at an
example of how you can include carbon
into your project perhaps working with
things like models so when you're out
putting dates you can work with them
straight from your database so in the
next video we'll look at installing
carbon and we can get going looking at
some examples</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
