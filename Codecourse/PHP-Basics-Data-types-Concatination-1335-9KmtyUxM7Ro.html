in this part we're gonna take a little
bit of a deeper look just to understand
the different ways that we can do this
just to tidy things up a little bit it's
really important to get this right first
so let's say we have again a very simple
variable let's just call this weather
and we're gonna set this to sunny now to
display this to use it in a sentence
your first instinct might be to echo out
a string so for example the current
weather is and then go ahead and add a
space in and then go and echo out the
variable underneath there's not
necessarily anything wrong with this but
in terms of looking at the code it's a
little bit messy and a little bit
unnecessary so you can see here that
because of the way that HTML works this
is just text and it's just been bought
up to the next line including that space
so that is the very basics of how we may
do that now of course we want to
concatenate now rather than a crown
different lines and we've already seen
earlier on that we can use a dot to go
ahead and do this so let's go ahead and
concatenate on using a dot keeping that
space in there and you can see we get
exactly the same result okay so let's
throw another variable in here and then
we'll assign this to a new string so
let's say we have a status variable here
and we're gonna say the current weather
is X and it's and remember because we
now have a single quote in there we just
need to escape that we're gonna say X
degrees so we're gonna add in a
temperature just here as well so up here
let's go just go ahead and say degrees
and we're gonna set this to say 30 okay
so now we can replace these in now what
I tend to do when I'm writing out a
string like this I write out exactly
what I want to write I go ahead and get
rid of saying X or whatever I've put in
there I have two single quotes in here I
had two dots in and we now have
concatenation the first string adopt
whatever we want to concatenate the
second dot and then the last part of the
string now in this case we would say
whether and then for the degrees again
we would do a similar thing
get rid of the X and put two dots in
there like so and then go ahead and
output the degrees now we have a string
in there we're not outputting it at the
moment but we can very easily go ahead
and now echo out that built-up string
using concatenation the current weather
is sunny and it's 30 degrees now we've
already seen this but notice we are
concatenated an integer here this would
work the same if we had a float say it
was thirty point five degrees PHP will
realize that you're trying to get the
string value of an integer when you're
trying to output it and it would just
output it as normal as part of this and
we can kind of prove this by doing a var
dump on the status that we have here
what you would expect to see here is
just one value and that's exactly what
we do have this is now built up a string
and we have one simple variable type
it's being converted over to a string
now if you are building up a string with
a lot of variables in in this case we're
using two so it's not too bad but the
dot notation here it can start to get a
little bit messy and there's an
alternative that we can use to go ahead
and do this now technically this isn't
concatenation we're gonna look at
something called variable parsing so to
start let's look at how this wouldn't
work let's go and replace these
concatenated variables over with dollar
sign inside of this string and weather
and let's see what happens so let's get
rid of the degrees as well and again
replace this in with the variable name
dollar degrees let's just fix that up
okay so let's take a look and you can
see if we again go and echo this
remember we can do this inside of here
or we can go and echo it separately just
down here and let's have a look so the
current weather is dollar sign weather
and it's dollar sign degrees degrees of
course this doesn't make sense we can
see that the variable is here taken as
literal strings and to change that we
simply use double quotes rather than
single quotes and PHP will parse
anything it sees within a dollar sign or
with a dollar sign and actually inject
this variable into the string
let's go ahead and replace these with
double quotes we know that now we can
get rid of this single quote escape
because it will just work let's take a
look at how this has looked so there we
go
sunny and 30.5 so it works in exactly
the same way and this is called variable
pausing now I'm sure you'll agree this
is much neater and it's a lot easier to
manage if we need to add anything else
in there's no concatenation we just add
the variable name into there and
remember earlier we spoke about using
either single or double quotes for
Strings and generally sticking to one
but in the case of doing this again like
I said before you can break the rules
and it's just makes things a lot easier
to read a lot easier to write and a lot
easier to maintain if you needed to
update this at any time so sometimes you
might see the following syntax let's go
ahead and wrap these in curly braces and
see what happens
when we go ahead and output these and
there we go
there we go we have curly braces around
this and you can see we get exactly the
same result so if you do see this at all
why would you do this well when we don't
use curly braces like this PHP doesn't
know when the variable name starts and
when the variable name ends if for
example we wanted to include a degrees
symbol in here so for example if I were
to get rid of this let's get rid of
these two and go ahead and place a
degree symbol just at the end of there
what's gonna happen now well let's go
ahead and refresh and you can see
undefined variable degrees and then the
degree symbol so clearly what's
happening here is when we are placing a
variable directly within double quotes
it's finding this one so this is
absolutely fine and it's then looking
for something with a variable name of
degrees and then because we have no
space here it's going ahead and looking
for degrees and then the degree symbol
if we were to place a space here it
works however we want the space gone and
we want the symbol right next to degrees
so like I said we wrap these in curly
braces like that and this means that PHP
will say oh you want to end this
variable name just here
and then there's no space in between
here so I'm just gonna output this
directly after and you can see here you
have thirty point five degrees with the
degrees right next to it so this allows
not only this to be more readable but
also very very flexible now we can
include things here without having to
add in lots of different concatenated
strings so lastly I just want to cover
something you may see from time to time
which isn't really concatenation but it
works pretty much like it so we've
already seen throughout the series when
we're echoing things out we can use a
comma to separate what we want to output
so for example I can say here my name is
using a comma I can go ahead and output
some kind of variable or in actual fact
I could just literally place the string
in here so you can see that this works
so let's go ahead and add this into a
variable and then we'll talk about
what's happening here it's a name equals
or we're assigning the value Alex to
name like so and then it works in
exactly the same way so using a comma
here only works with echo and it's
basically a way to chain on many strings
integers floats to build up a string as
you're echoing out so this is only part
of echo so it's not going to work if you
were assigning this to a variable if you
were to say something like text equals
my name is Connor name it's not going to
work you can see we get a syntax error
and an unexpected comma on line five so
we're not expecting this
in actual fact what we are expecting is
a dot and then of course that would go
ahead and work as normal now generally
when you're outputting concatenated
strings it's best to stick with this dot
notation just so you don't get into
trouble if we were to revert this back
to echo my name is and a name with a dot
there you can see that works in exactly
the same way so it's good practice to
get into the state where you're using
dots never commas just in case you mess
things up when you go ahead and try and
assign this to a variable we've all been
there and remember if things start to
get complicated put everything inside of
double quotes and then go ahead and use
them curly braces if you need to add
characters onto variables so you'll find
concatenation every
in applications and now you know a few
ways to do this as well as what to look
out for when you're writing code like
this yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
