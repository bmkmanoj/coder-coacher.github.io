time stamps which are essentially a way
of representing when something was
posted without actually giving the real
day or time in this video we're gonna
look at a jQuery plug-in that makes this
super simple and what's best this
automatically updates on the front-end
so users don't have to refresh to be
able to see when something was posted
this will automatically tick over and
change when the time has passed this
basically means that if you don't have
an application that allows you to output
things like this you can use it as a
pure front-end solution or you can
combine it with a back-end solution
which outputs something similar so at
the moment you can say see that this
says posted about a minute ago in just a
second this is going to switch over and
it's going to give us a more precise
time okay so a little bit of time has
passed and you can see now it says in
fact posted two minutes ago because it
will automatically start at two minutes
and this works really well on the
front-end
it also supports different time zones if
you're using an ISO 8601 formatted time
stamp so let's dive in and take a look
exactly how we get this jquery plugin
started and how we can use this within
an application ok so it's starting
completely from scratch here as if we
were building a completely new project
but we're only going to take a look at a
very basic example the first thing that
we want to do inside of some kind of
index to HTML file or really wherever
you want to place this is I'm just going
to generate a basic html5 document
layout we are going to be using the
html5 time element and applying the
plug-in
to them elements specifically and with
those elements with a specific class we
don't apply this to elements themselves
because we want to control the
functionality with some kind of class
although how you specifically implement
this is completely up to you so you're
obviously going to want to go ahead and
download the plug-in so you can go ahead
and visit this website here and
obviously this project is available on
github which makes it really easy to go
ahead and
load and obviously contribute too if you
want to
so I've already downloaded this file
it's basically just within a directory
here all we're really gonna need here is
the jQuery time ago J s file for very
basic implementation however there is
the ability to choose different
languages if you need it
so go ahead and read up on the
documentation of how to implement them
so basically what we want to do is we
want to go ahead and copy this file here
and we want to put it in some kind of
directory so I'm gonna create a new
folder called GIS which is gonna
basically just store all of my
JavaScript files what I'm also gonna do
is inside of this create a file folder
called vendor which is gonna hold any
sort of plugins or anything like that
again this is entirely up to you how you
structure it and I'm just going to pop
that plug-in in there so inside of our
index page now we obviously want to pull
in jQuery if you're not using jQuery
already on your website this might be a
little bit overkill actually pulling in
jQuery is a dependency just because you
need to use this but I'll let you decide
of what you want to pull in so I'm gonna
be using Google hosted libraries to pull
in jQuery just cuz it's easier lot
quicker so I'm gonna head over to the
jQuery section here and I'm gonna grab
version 2.1 point 1 and come back over
to my project here and paste that in so
we've now got jQuery included now what
we need to do is obviously pull in the
actual plug-in itself so let's go ahead
and generate a script tag with a source
attribute and let's remember in j/s
vendor and it's called jQuery dat time
ago J s so we say J s vendor jQuery dot
time ago
j s so now that we've done that we're
gonna want to pull in some kind of a
custom javascript file perhaps something
that just globally loads in all your
JavaScript or contains all of your
JavaScript so inside of the j/s
directory i'm gonna go ahead and create
that now and I'm gonna call that global
J s so let's pull that in J s global
chain
yes easy so now that we've got the
plug-in installed we need to activate it
on an element but we don't have anything
on our page just yet so let's go ahead
and build this up now so I'm gonna
create a little paragraph tag here and
I'm gonna say posted and this is gonna
say something like X minutes ago just
basically whatever you want it to say
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a time element here and I'm gonna
give this a specific class so this is
going to be called time ago and we also
need to provide a date/time attribute
here to include the actual date we're
pulling in now this can be absolutely
any date format really obviously has to
adhere somewhat to how this plugin
interprets it you can do things like
this here which is the ISO 8601
timestamp or you can basically just pull
in something like the following so in
this case it's July 17th 2008 so let's
go ahead and write this ourselves inside
of here so my date time might come out
of my database like the following it
might be 17th of September 2014 and the
time here might be let's say 12 o'clock
so we don't have to insert anything
within this time element you could
though add this in in some kind of
format that's been generated on your
server however you want to make sure
this matches up with what is output with
this jQuery plugin or you'll get it
flash from one version to another in
this case I'm going to leave this empty
we don't really need to fill this in
necessarily so what we're now going to
do is go ahead and activate the plug-in
on anytime html5 element that has the
past time ago and this is pretty
straightforward inside of global dat Jas
so the first thing we want to do is wait
for the Dom to be ready or load its
fully so we have the ready method here
on our document and we pass a closure in
here so you basically just use an or
more jQuery selector so I'm gonna say
anytime element with the time ago class
obviously this is a class selector and
we're going to use time ago on this to
activate the plug-in there are options
you can pass through to this which is
really useful but I'll let you go ahead
and decide about what you want to do for
example you can do things like enable
dates in the future for example so let's
now take a look at what this looks like
inside of our browser you can expect to
see that this set now says about nine
hours ago because twelve o'clock at the
time I'm recording was about nine hours
ago and if you go ahead and set this to
say the current time this will go ahead
and it will update and you'll be able to
see it update on the page without any
refresh at all so that's how we can
utilize functionality like within this
time ago plug-in to use dates in this
way and it provides a really powerful
way to represent dates on the front end
that automatically update super easy to
use and really effective</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
