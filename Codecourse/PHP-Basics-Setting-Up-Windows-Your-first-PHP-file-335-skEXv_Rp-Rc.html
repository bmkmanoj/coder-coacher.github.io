problems installing lamp what we're now
going to do is just to make sure that we
have everything running on the desktop
you should have lamp server 32 let's go
ahead and just double click on that and
just wait for this to load everything up
again we want to say that we want to
allow this and what this will do if it
wasn't already done during installation
is it will start up your local webserver
so once that's finished what we're going
to do is head straight over to the
browser we're going to open up a new tab
and we're going to come over to the URL
localhost so this is HTTP colon forward
slash forward slash localhost now what
this will do is it will point to your
local webserver and this here is the
default wampserver landing page we're
going to remove these files because
we're going to be going and creating our
own files in this part so now that we
have this up you want to keep this up in
your browser this is what we're going to
be working on throughout the rest of the
series so you want this page up in your
browser and let's just go over to the
WAMP directory that we saw in the last
part so inside of this WAMP directory
are all of the files required that so
you'll have things like the Apache files
you'll have your PHP configuration files
we're not going to dive too much into
that because we don't really need to but
if we come over to this www re notice
these files here so these files here are
exactly what you're seeing just over
here now the first thing I'm going to do
is delete them if you want to keep these
you can go ahead and move them to a
different location but I'm just going to
delete them so now when we refresh this
page you can see that we have an index
of forward slash that basically means
that we are viewing the directory here
and we don't have any files so now what
we want to do is create our first PHP
file save it here and then go ahead and
see this in the browser and then the
rest of the series you'll be good to go
so there are plenty of text editors
available however I would highly
recommend using atom now this is a very
simple very clean editor and it just
really moves everything out the way so
you can just focus on learning
PHP so what you want to do is head over
to Adam to i/o I'll leave a link to this
in the course links and you want to grab
the Windows installer and make sure you
have that downloaded and installed it's
very very simple so once you do have
that installed let's go over to Adam and
I'll show you around and we'll create
our first PHP file okay so now that Adam
is loaded up you'll probably see
something like this now the first thing
I'm going to do is just close off all of
these files because all we really need
to do is go ahead and create a new file
so what we're going to do is go ahead
and create a new file and we are going
to immediately go ahead and save this to
that directory so we want to come over
to lamp
ww and what we're going to do is first
of all save this out as just an any old
file so we can just call this one PHP
and let's go ahead and save this so what
you'll notice when you come over to your
browser now that you have this file
saved when you refresh this page you'll
see that file just listed there and we
can click on that and this is now a PHP
father we can write any code in now what
we're going to be doing throughout the
series is we're going to be creating an
index.php file and you'll notice the
difference when I go ahead and create
this now so let's save this new file
into the same directory so we're going
to say index.php save this just in here
and we'll close off this one cuz we
don't really need that let's go back
over to our localhost here give that a
refresh and you see this looks like it's
blank now what's actually happened here
is Apache has picked up on the fact that
you've called a file index.php and it's
loaded this as the main fast it's
automatically run this file we don't
need to click on it and that's generally
what happens when you visit a web site
there's one file index dot PHP or
whichever language that's being used and
this will be shown to you first so if we
wanted to access that one dot PHP file
that we created earlier
we can manually see that just in there
or we can directly access the index dot
PHP file just in here so that's the same
far as if we just land on localhost so
this and this are the same so hopefully
that makes sense but
let's get down to it and just go ahead
and output something using PHP so to
start our PHP file we use a less than
sign a question mark and then the text
PHP so if we come down and we want to
get rid of this last tag if this inserts
it we don't need an ending PHP tag
generally you may see an ending PHP tag
but unless without putting any HTML or
anything else below this we do not need
it so throughout the series we're just
using a starting PHP tag ok so now that
we've done this this will tell our web
server that this is a PHP file despite
the fact we have an extension as well
and now we can just go ahead and write
any code out so let's go ahead and
output something to the page we'll leave
it at that and then of course we'll
carry on with the rest of the series so
let's use echo this is a basically a
command that says well anything after
this just output to the page so here
we're going to use two single quotes and
we're going to end the line with the
semicolon we end most lines in PHP with
a semicolon
so inside of these two single quotes and
we can use double quotes as well but we
will get to that later we're just going
to output hello simple as that
so make sure you save this file out and
come over to the browser and remember we
are immediately hitting index.php and
you should see that text just in there
so once again we can go over to one PHP
remember this is a completely separate
file and we can go and edit this as well
so let's go ahead and just do the same
thing just to kind of drill in how we go
ahead and do this so we open our PHP
tags and then we go down and we echo out
something within single quotes so we're
going to say one like so just to
differentiate this between the other
file so let's save this one out come
over to the browser refresh on one dot
PHP and we see the following
so we now basically have two PHP files
just in here but that should be enough
for you to be able to create new files
and of course throughout the series we
are going to be creating a couple of
other files as well mainly we're going
to be working within index.php but now
we are all set up and we can carry on
with the rest of the series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
