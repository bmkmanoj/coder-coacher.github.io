quick look at how we install composer
and use it to download project
dependencies so if you're not familiar
with composer
it's a dependency manager for PHP a lot
of packages now that you may want to use
either rely or recommend you use
composers to download them so it's very
useful to know so this doesn't matter if
you're working on Linux on a Mac on
Windows it's exactly the same concept
and we're gonna be working with
downloading the composer top P har file
I'm not going to talk about how to
install it globally but either way this
will work so the first thing we want to
do is on the composer website head over
to the download section here this gives
us commands that we can use to download
the composer file so if we have curl
installed on our machine we can use this
command here otherwise if we just have
PHP installed and we don't have curl we
can use this command here now I have
curl installed but I'll let you decide
which one you choose to use and just
opening up my text editor here I just
have a directory here called composer
with an index dot PHP file in so we're
not doing anything here but we need to
be within this composer directory so we
can download the composer dot P H AR
file in order to download our
dependencies so open up a terminal or
command prompt depending on which
operating system you're in you can see
that index dot PHP file just in there
and I'm gonna go ahead and paste in that
command that we saw on the composer
website and I'm gonna hit enter what
that's going to do is download the
composer P har file for us we're not
really gonna want to like look at this
it's just a PHA our file and it doesn't
really make sense to dive into it but
you don't want to commit this up with
the rest of your codebase ideally you'd
have a server with composer installed
globally there's nothing wrong with
committing this up but just bear in mind
that it will obviously generally get in
the way so anyway now what we can
actually do is if we find that within
this current project which we're not
doing anything in we want to download
dependency we can now do so so let's
head over to the carbon github page
carbons just a simple way to work with
dates and times in PHP it's just a nice
wrapper or an extension rather for
date/time so most repositories will give
you instructions on which versions to
pull in which package name we want to
pull in and you can see here that carbon
does just this so under installation
with composer we can use composer
require nesbitt carbon now because we
don't have composer installed globally
that depends on your system and whether
you're on Windows or Mac or Linux we're
gonna be using the composer top P har
file for this so to run this the command
is require and the name of the author is
nesebar and the package name is carbon
so all we need to do it is under our
command prompt is we need to run PHP
make sure you have PHP installed you can
run PHP v2 get the version information
so we want to run PHP composer dot pH AR
require Nesbitt forward slash carbon and
this is just whatever package you want
to download so we hit enter and you can
see a couple of things happening in the
side here we have a composer doc JSON
file and once that is downloaded we'll
have a vendor folder so you can see
that's now been downloaded and we have
our vendor folder just here with our
Nesbitt packaging symphony is a
dependency of nesebar and we have our
auto load that we would require in for
any project that we use so that is how
we install composer and how we go ahead
and download a dependency if we're not
working with it globally I'll let you go
ahead and figure out how for whichever
operating your system you're using to go
ahead and install it globally and in
that case you'll be able to run composer
without having to run PHP composer pH AR</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
