exceptions in a very specific way within
laravel you've probably met the
exception handler which lives over in
exceptions just here this gives you the
opportunity to check a specific
exception and go ahead and report on it
and also do the same for rendering as
well now with reporting specifically you
may wish to send an email so in this
case we're going to look at an example
of going ahead and throwing a very
specific exception which should trigger
an email to be sent to maybe a developer
or a team of people so I have this
exception created here it's just a
standard class that extends PHP basic
exception and we're going to go ahead
and just throw that from here so really
really simple so for a new custom
exception and we'll go ahead and pull
the namespace in for that so at the
moment we just see the following give
that a refresh our custom exception now
before laravel 45.5 what we would have
to do is over in the handler just
underneath here go ahead and check this
exception this will be immediately
passed through into this method and we
will get that custom exception in there
and that's the same for any exception we
throw as well so we can Interceptor
handle it how we want in this case what
we would have to do is say well check if
the exception is an instance of the
custom exception that we've just thrown
well let's go and pull the namespace in
which for a start kind of you know
starts to get a little bit messy
especially when you have lots of feeds
in here well in that case I'm going to
go ahead and send an email so I'm going
to email this or maybe the log it with
bug snag or something like that so we
can see that we get the following now
like I said if you have lots of
different exceptions and you want us to
handle these in slightly different ways
even with just a few tricks here things
start to get a little bit messy
now the change in our FL 5.5 means we
can do this directly from our custom
exceptions which kind of makes sense
that is where these kind of checks
should live not in a huge long list down
here so let's go in and get rid of this
what we're going to do is dive in to
clear this up as well we're going to
dive into the base air exception over
here basic exception handler sorry so
let's go ahead and open this up it's
actually just here so let's open this up
just down here and we're going to go
ahead and come down to report and we
will see here
if a method exists on this exception
called rapport then go ahead and just
call this method all that means is that
over an our custom exception we can go
and create a rapport method and we can
do anything we want in here rather than
having to check that instance inside of
our handler and then you know get into a
huge mess so in here we can email or log
and that's going to work in exactly the
same way it's just nicely tidied up into
its own method inside of your custom
exception you can still use your handler
if you were checking maybe for a
specific instance of something you might
have a specific group of exceptions that
went ahead and implemented a particular
interface and you wanted to take an
action based on that then that's
absolutely fine you know there's nothing
wrong with placing something in here and
in this case you maybe have some kind of
alert interface so you would have
something like exception is an instance
of alert interface and maybe that just
always sends an email inside of here to
a specific person maybe a developer on
your team or something like that with
the information about the exception you
know there's nothing wrong with doing
that but if you did just want to handle
these individually inside of custom
exceptions we now call this report
method when these are thrown</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
