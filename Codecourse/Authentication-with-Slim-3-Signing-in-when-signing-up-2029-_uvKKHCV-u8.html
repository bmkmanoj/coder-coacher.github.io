when we actually sign up for an account
we're automatically signed in and this
is actually pretty straightforward
because we've already written the code
for it when we are actually signing in
so let's just sign ourselves out if you
haven't already head over to resources
and cookies for a localhost and go ahead
and get rid of that and just give the
page a refresh we can go ahead and sign
up again but this time we obviously want
to automatically be signed in so back
over to our Earth controller we're going
to go down to post sign up now after the
validation or rather after we've created
our user obviously makes sense we can go
and authenticate the user just as we did
when we signed in so here all we want to
do is say this or attempt and then what
do we need to pass in well we need to
pass in the email address of the user
and the password so we can either grab
the email from the user that we've just
created doesn't really matter whether we
grab it from the parameters that are
sent through or the user model and then
of course we need the password but we
need the password in plain text so we
obviously have to take this from the
form input because if we pulled the
password from the user it would be the
hashed version so here we can just say
request get / am past word so now we've
signed the user in because remember this
will sign the user in if these
credentials are correct we know these
credentials are correct because the user
has just chosen them there's nothing
really to validate against so let's just
test this out let's go and sign Billy up
for an account
into the password hit sign up and there
we go we've not only created an account
but we have now been automatically
signed in as easy as that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
