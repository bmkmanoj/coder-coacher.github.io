we've already discovered this is going
to be a lot quicker of course because
we're doing image processing now I
really like using this service provider
for caching it's really really flexible
and we go ahead and implement this setup
file based caching but of course later
down the line if you wanted to use this
package it's very very flexible so you
can use any cash and drive you want so
let's come over and install this first
of all and we will look how we set this
up so very simply do a composer require
on this wait for it to finish and we'll
go get set up okay so that's done I'll
leave a link to this in the course link
so you can go ahead and grab this let's
go over and start to create our caching
directory maybe we had another directory
with the cache directory in it in this
case what I'm going to do is literally
just create a cache directory in here
and then maybe have some kind of images
directory inside of this but of course
feel free to structure this however you
want okay so now that we've got this
directory of course what we need to do
with this service provider is register
it on our application as we've done with
everything else and then of course pass
in the options as well to say where
we're cashing to which driver we're
using and all that kind of stuff so
somewhere around here let's go ahead and
register this and this is under a or
this package namespace and it's under
selects provider and it's a cash service
provider and now what we need to do is
go ahead and pass in our options so cash
options in here and then we can just go
ahead and pass these in now this is
really simple we just need a driver
which is a file-based driver and we need
the cash directory which we use if we're
using firebase cashing in this case we
can just grab the current directory we
can go back into cash and then into
images mo it's pretty much it so now we
can use this inside of our route to
retrieve an image from the cash if it's
previously being stored now the way that
we're going to do this is first of all
attempt to get from the cash
and if it doesn't exist so if it's not
in there we're going to process the
image as we're doing down below and then
we're going to store it into the cache
so this is just a kind of common way to
look at look something up in a cache if
it's not in there we go ahead and do
whatever we need to do we store it back
into the cache and then on the next
request if we do attempt to get it from
the cash we're probably likely to see in
there and we can just use that value
from the cash so let's go and first of
all say that our placeholder is instead
of this so we'll add this into a
conditional we want to say app cache so
this is how we access that package now
we want to go ahead and fetch at a
particular key now what we want to cash
by is the width and height so if we say
we request a 200 x 500 image we want to
grab an int random image we want to cash
this and the next time we request 200 x
500 this is simply returned from the
cash now the only downside this is
you're always going to get the same
picture but there's not really a way
around that you can't then reprocess
another random image but not cash it so
that's really the only way to get around
this so what we do is we fetch by
specific key we're going to choose the
key and this is going to be the file
name so I'm just going to go ahead and
pop these in here we're going to
separate these out by a colon and then
we're going to say the width and we're
going to say the height like so so
that's just pretty standard and what
we're going to do is at the same time as
fetching this we're going to go ahead
and grab the cash key so we can store
this at that particular key as we've
checked it so we're kind of checking it
setting the key and then down here we
can use that same key to go ahead and
set it just so we don't have to repeat
ourselves repeat any code ok so now down
here if the placeholder is false which
will be returned if we don't have
anything in the cache we want to store
it into the catch and to do this we only
need to do this when we can't retrieve
it from the cash so this is the only
time we're ever going to be processing
an image so now what we can do is after
this we can store it into the car
and then we can return the version of
that image so we'll return this if it's
not in the cache will go ahead and store
it here otherwise men on the next
request this will be true or it will at
least hold a value so then we'll just
return the place out of this is why
we're using the same name so now down
here we're just going to say app cache
and we're going to store this at the
cache key that we assigned as we looked
it up and we're simply going to place
the placeholder into the cache so just
to kind of reiterate if you are new to
cashing again we check if this is in the
cache setting the cache key if it's not
we process the image and store in the
cache and then either way whether it is
in the casual are not in the cache we
return with that image very very simple
let's go over we know that we get in the
time of about 137 to 150 milliseconds
give it a refresh this time around it
will be a little bit slower because it's
the first request but now when we
refresh again and it looks like we've
got a little error so let's go ahead and
just have a look so file name in web
online eight let's have a look here of
course so in this case it's not file
name it is in fact image file name but I
think in this case actually we could
probably just get rid of that I think
the width now is enough to satisfy our
cache key so give this another refresh
and we see again 153 milliseconds but
now when we refresh we're getting a much
lower response time because of course
what's happening now is just being
pulled out the cash not manipulated
anyway and just returned to the user so
there we go that is our caching of our
images done very very simply using that
package very nice to work with and what
we can now move on to is in the next
part looking at if we perhaps one a
specific image to be pulled out so for
example I might want to say image equals
and then give the ID of the image that I
always want then we can use that to
specifically return an image that we
want so at the moment it's not going to
work but we need to do a little bit of
updating to use a specific image if we
want to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
