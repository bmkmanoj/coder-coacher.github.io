new datetime instance which by default
gives us the current date and time now
of course that's not always useful what
we want to be able to do is set our own
times we want to be able to output times
as well and that's exactly what we're
going to be covering in this part so
let's just start by creating a new
datetime instance again you'll always
want to start off by doing this because
from this variable now you can format
the date you can grab a timestamp you
can set the time zone you can get time
zones and you can do a lot of other
things so let's look at a couple of
basics about how we extract some
information from datetime now the first
way and probably the most popular way to
actually format a date is to simply echo
because we'll end up with a string from
that variable we use the format method
and into this we pass a string with a
format now I don't expect you to
remember all of these formatting options
so what you can do is come over to the
date part of the PHP library and if you
have a look down here there are many
different ways to represent different
parts of the date and time so we've got
time just down here and we've got dates
just up here so for example we could say
something like D s and then M Y so that
might look a little bit odd but if we
come over you can see that we get 15th
the th here is represented by this
capital S then we have August which is
the month and then the year obviously
represented by Y so if you ever are
struggling to format our date in a way
that you want head over to this part of
the manual I'll leave a link for you
within the course and you can structure
your output exactly as you want format
the dates exactly as you want so the
other way to do things is sometimes you
want a time stamp so let's say we wanted
to get the current timestamp remember
this represents the current date and
time so to do this we just say date get
timestamp this is a method like this
obviously we don't form at a time stamp
so in this case we just
our the current unix timestamp and you
can see that that increments with each
second so if you're not too short a time
stamp is this is the amount of seconds
since the first of January I think it's
1970 either way this is sometimes useful
so we're going to be looking at time
zones later but while we're here we'll
just talk about how we actually extract
the current time zone so to do this we
can use get time zone like so and if we
just do a VAR dump on this because this
isn't actually going to work at the
moment we'll see exactly what we get
here so you can see we get another
object now so this is returning a new
object and this is a date.timezone
object now from this we have two
properties in here but we also have some
other methods as well so we have a
method called get name you may wish to
grab the current time zone name so in
this case you just say get name and
chain that on and then you get the
current name we already know it's UTC
but that's useful if you do need to
extract the timezone so now that we've
looked at a couple of ways just to grab
the date we're going to be looking at
more of these later throughout the
series but now we want to look at
creating date in a different way now
this obviously sets the date and time to
the current date and time but what
happens if we have a specific format
that we want to create this from so in
this case what we would do is not use
new what we want to do is use a static
method instead which we access by this
thing here called the scope resolution
operator this is just two colons next to
each other and then we say create from
format like so and the first argument
here is going to be the format that we
want to create this from now again this
all comes from the parameters just here
for the dates and times so we can go
ahead and insert this let's say we had
some kind of date they look like this
2016 like so 1116 so let's say this was
submitted via form well if we wanted to
take this day and then later manipulate
it using date time we would look at the
structure of this and say well it's why
it's
separated by a hyphen then it's the
month and the day so m and D lowercase
are just like this so we have the month
in the day and then just in here we go
ahead and pass in the day so let's say
that the date here let's just say date
string is 2016 11 16 we would just pass
that into there and of course you can
pass it straight into here as well so
now if we do a VAR dump on the date you
will see over here that we get the
following so we get 2016 11 16 so for
example this is useful if you wanted to
then go on and maybe check something in
this date manipulator or even out put it
in a completely different way so for
example we might just want to say date
format and then choose a completely
different format so we might want to say
something like d s m and we would get
the following so it's really flexible we
just just really depends on how you want
to do this so the next thing is if we
want to create a date from a timestamp
so to do this we use something called a
setter so we do pretty much what we did
before a new datetime like so but then
what we want to do is say set time stamp
so you may be working with the time
stamp and then you might want to grab a
particular time stamp and then format
that in a way that you want now to get a
timestamp we can come over to a website
that basically just gives you a
timestamp what I'm gonna do is go and
set these manually so I'm just going to
say 1989 go ahead and say human date to
timestamp grab the timestamp and I'm
just going to place it into here like
that now what I can do is if we just do
a VAR dump on date will see that we have
the following so we get 1989 1116 and
obviously from this we can go and format
it how we want so we're just basically
passing in different things but we're
always getting the same result that's
the great thing about this so we can do
what we did before like so now in this
case what you could do if you just
didn't want to do this on to
lines you can be very quick and you can
wrap your instantiation of your date
time class in brackets and then you can
just pull this up like that and that
looks a little bit neater and it works
in exactly the same way just a little
tip there if you want to save some lines
so a couple of other ways of going ahead
and setting the date and time or at
least one other way we're going to go
ahead and just create a new date time
instance here and then what we can do is
we can say something like date set date
and into this take three arguments the
first one is the year like so then it's
the day and then it's the earth so the
month and then it's the day so why would
this be useful why wouldn't we just do
it the other way well in this case if
you for example had a form within HTML
that allowed you to select the year the
month and the day separately this would
be a lot easier to actually pass it into
date time because you just have three
arguments that you pick up maybe via
your post super global array and then
you can just place it in there and of
course we have a very similar method you
may have guessed called set time which
takes the hour the minute and the second
so this will be 1230 and then 30 seconds
so now if we just do a VAR dump on date
you can see here that we get the
following so we've got 12 30 and 30
seconds and then we have that date that
we passed in pretty cool so there are
other ways that we can go about setting
things but we're going to take a look at
them through the rest of the series but
hopefully this should make sense we have
a lot of flexibility in the way that we
can set and we've also looked at a
couple of ways that we can get our dates
out as well specifically using format
which is probably the most popular way
to go ahead and grab a date</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
