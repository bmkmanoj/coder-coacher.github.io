tutorial we're gonna be working with
Adobe Flash now why the hell do we want
to work with Flash well if you just take
a look at this spell what we've done so
far what we've got here this all builds
into a concept called graceful
degradation what our browsers gonna do
is it's gonna say right here's what we
want to do we want to use html5 video
first it's going to say coming exempt
before if it can it will if it can't
I'll move onto the next lines until it
finds a form on that it can use now
assume the user is using either a
browser or a device which can't yet
support it's my five video then we need
to think well how can we deliver this
content to them and this is where flash
comes in so if we can't use the inbuilt
players we will then decide let's use a
plug-in and in this case we're going to
be using flash you could continue going
down this graceful degradation ladder if
you like by sort of adding in the
options to download the video perhaps
you would want to create like a
slideshow with images and text on it
there's a myriad of things that you can
do to ensure that the videos that you
want to be played can be played but in
this instance we're gonna be looking at
flash and how we can use these videos in
flash so that it the user and all
browser can access the content and it's
quite simple but it does require that
you have flash and this is a full
version I do recognize it's not cheap
but in this instance it's necessary so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create a new actionscript 3.0 file and
that's going to give us a blank document
here a blank canvas a couple things you
want to take that off we have this
properties sort of list drop-down list
here with a size value of 550 and 400
pixels that's the size of the canvas
we'll leave that as it is for now
so what we're gonna want to do is to
begin with we're going to want to save
this
file so I'm going to navigate to the
directory where my sort of root
directory is which is here video and
then in the videos I'm gonna put it in
here I'm just going to call it flush
play okay now let's get the skin or the
controls put in here so if I console
window and go to components it brings up
this box here another this component tab
in the video folder you want to use this
FLV playback you click and drag that
onto the canvas we get this this box it
sort of comes up so I'm just going to
get rid of that now and I'm going to
change the width and the height values
here to that of the canvas which is 550
by 400 okay and I'm just going to send
to this yeah just back onto the screen
right now what we can do in this
component parameters menu here you've
got a lot of different properties
there's two important ones here the skin
and the source so in skin if you click
on this little pencil you get this
select skin popup box here and in here
we can sort of select a myriad of
different skins that you can use they'll
look a little bit different here but you
know it's just a play button I'm gonna
use this one though this is actually I
think this is the default one so we'll
stick with this for now and you can also
if you want to change the color so I
know you have a weird red blue whatever
I'll just stick to this sort of default
one here and if I press ok we've we've
got the skin under here anyway so this
is what it looks like now I'm going to
need to select a source and the source
refers to the video that we're going to
use so again if I click on this pencil
here we've got a content path box that
appears
effect click on the folder we're already
in the right directory so we've got two
videos here and this is the AVI one the
video that we already use we don't want
that we want to use this mp4 video here
and if I open that and press ok alright
we've the video size is massive and out
but we'll just change that here in the
position and size box here which was 550
by 400 we'll just send that you're gonna
get a little bit of white space enough
because of the dimensions of the the
video itself so that's why that looks
like that and you can change the canvas
size to fit you go on modify and
document it should bring up a pop-up box
where you can modify the dimensions or
alternative just click click on the
canvas here and not on this object you
can modify it here as we did sort of in
the beginning or looked at in the
beginning I should say so I'll just save
that now and if we go to file and
publish settings or ctrl shift and f12
on the keyboard it brings up this
publish settings dialog box here I'll
make sure two things are ticked and they
already are in this case the flash dot
Swift thing here and this HTML wrapper
and the h1 rough is going to have all
the HTML that we'll need and the flash
is effectively the file itself so if I
press publish I'll publish that I press
ok and we look in our videos directory
we've got a host of new files we've got
this HTML file here the original sort of
flash file that we can play with and
you're gonna want to keep that open the
Swift file which is got the content on
it and this skin here so if I just open
up this in my text editor it's generated
an HTML file and this is obviously you
can tell by the how it's defined it's an
older version of HTML xhtml of things so
or xhtml 1.0 actually
what we're gonna need to do is copy this
object here and we're going to paste it
into our index in the video in the video
element underneath the sources so if I
paste that in now we've got a lot of
lines of code here and this is good
because it means that we don't have to
type all this but there are a few
problems now because of we're flush
published this in the videos folder this
HTML document and all of this assumes
that everything is going to be inside
this same folder so to illustrate this
if I go back into the text editor and on
the first line here underneath the
objects element this parameter says a
value flush play dot Swift this is in
the index file the index file is located
here in the root directory but the Swift
file is located here so you can see
there's an automatic problem there that
this won't play it's going to looking
for something that isn't there the
correct way of doing this is kind of
what we've done up here where the source
is saying safe this OGG file here it's
video slash video DV we want to just
copy this or you could just write it if
you wanted to if I double click here
there's four things that have
highlighted this ID here doesn't matter
because just an object ID but these rest
do so literally just behind these you
want to just either write videos slash
or paste in the directory here prior to
this file you don't do this in all three
instances like I say this object ID it's
not necessary that you do that but as
long as now we've sorted that out so if
I save this index file what should
happen is the video will play but you're
gonna have any skin and I'll explain and
it's the exact same problem so if I just
load this here so okay it's saying I
haven't got flash but it's actually
brought up this ActiveX warning here and
this is a good thing
because what it's doing if we take a
look at the HTML six saying that if we
haven't got any of this we've got a link
here to Adobe's get flush thing and the
image which is obviously online which is
the gift get flush player dot gif and
that's what this is
so if user hasn't got it they can click
that and get flash now we've just got
this ActiveX warning here so we want to
just allow blocked content click yes and
the video hopefully should load and it
does but as you can see we've not gone
the controls because when we selected
this in flash you can see here this this
skin is actually linking to something
it's creating the skin and then linking
to this skin which again is in the same
folder to fix this on the skin you want
to click the pencil so we're back on
this one though again this drop down
list and you want to scroll all the way
down until the bottom you see custom
skin URL and in this video's file this
is what we want to link to this skin
over play stop seek mute vol file it's a
mouthful so if we copy that or the name
of that file go back into flash set the
path which is videos slash that the the
name the file dot SWF press okay it's
going to change this in the flash
document but that's fine if I save that
and we can go and publish this again it
should generate the flash file in the
exact same it'll generate new flash
files I'll generate a new HTML file and
all the rest of it as you can see here
it has generated a new thing because
this has been modified by another
program so it's made all new files we
can reload it yeah that's fine but the
diff
Swift file I don't know what that was
the Swift file is now linking to the
correct location so if we go back open
the index page we go to this ie thing
here will allow the block content and
hopefully we have these skin the player
if you like and music and play that stop
that play it play around with a volume
muted back on whatever and that all
works which is exactly what we wanted it
to do so that's it so we can close flush
now and if we just look in this
directory here the videos directory
there's a couple things we don't need we
don't need the safety mile file anymore
so you can delete that the only things
we need is the Flash Player the skin the
and the you don't need this video thing
I've kept city-owned but the three video
formats that we need the rest of it you
can get rid of so for this tutorial what
we're going to look at in the next
tutorial is some testing in the other
browsers to make sure that it works if
we come across any problems which I'm
actually not sure about we'll be able to
resolve those but for now we know that
in IE
or an old version of ie that this is
working which is great so thank you for
watching guys and I'll see you in the
next to talk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
