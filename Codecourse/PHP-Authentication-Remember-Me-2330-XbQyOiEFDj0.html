logins and by this I mean the remember
me functionality that we can check enter
our details and log in and then we'll be
remembered for a certain amount of time
and this is really up to us how long the
cookie takes to expire so this
functionality requires quite a bit of
security consideration because what
we're doing is Wisc we're going to be
creating a cookie that's going to hold a
value which will authenticate the user
so we need to make sure that this cookie
is as hard as possible to replicate in
any way or brute force in any way so for
that what we're going to be doing is in
our database we're gonna be storing the
remember identifier and the remember
token now what's gonna happen is when
the user clicks remember me on the login
form an identifier is going to be
generated which is a unique or a well it
will be a unique random string and also
a token is going to be generated hashed
and stored in the database so we're
gonna we're gonna generate two strings
and then we're gonna still one in here
hashed and one in here unhatched what
we're then gonna do is we are going to
store that in a cookie when the user
closes their browser and then reopens
their browser we're gonna look up the
user by the identifier we're gonna take
the other hash the other part of that
hash that's stored in a cookie and we
are going to hash that and check it
against this one if they both match
we're going to log the user back in to
their account now when the user logs out
of their account or if someone supplies
the correct identifier but the wrong
token we're going to remove these from
the user table and that's just a
security implication if someone attempts
to try to access someone's out his
account via a cookie we just kill both
of them fields when we set them to null
so we're taking as much as we can into
consideration in terms of the security
here so what we want to do then is first
of all add the element to our login form
so let's open up our views or
login and let's go ahead and out this
just in here so it'll be above this here
so this is going to be a check box the
name is going to be remember the ID is
going to be remember I'm gonna have a
label directly after this for remember
and the text here is going to be
remember me so we have a label next to a
check box so that's gonna look like this
so when we check this and hit login we
can perform a check in our login route
and then go ahead and do everything
we've already spoken about so let's open
our login route then so it's in routes
or login and just at the point here
where the user is successfully
authenticated what we want to do is
check if this remember has been checked
so let's first of all add this to the
list of things that are posted through
to the form so this is going to be
remember and we'll call that remember
and down here we can say if remember is
equal to on so if that has been checked
so we want to create two items here two
randomly generated strings one of which
is going to be the identifier that we're
storing and the other is going to be the
token that we're storing so let's create
a variable called remember identifier
and that's going to be a randomly
generated string from our random Lib
which we've used already so generate
string of 128 and we're going to placate
that down and we're going to do the same
for the remember token and that's going
to be app random live live generate
string so we've got our identifier
randomly generated and our token
randomly generated what we now want to
do is update the users remember
credentials so basically what's stored
inside of the database table so what we
can do to do they
is create a handy method on our user
model to do this so let's write this out
first of all so remember we have our
user object here that we've pulled in
we're gonna say update remember
credentials and into this we're going to
pass two arguments the remember
identifier and we're going to pass in
the remember token but this needs to be
hashed so gonna app hash hash remember
token so let's create this update
remember credentials method on our user
model so we'll go down here and generate
that so we have our identifier and our
token and to store this all you need to
do is say this update pass in an array
of columns we want to update so we have
our remember identifier which is all set
to that identifier that we passed in and
we'll set the remember token to the
token that we pass in let's also quickly
implement the method to remove the
remember credentials as well just so we
don't forget later on this is really
important so we're going to create
remove remember credentials
and all this is going to do is it's
going to call this update remember
credentials and it's gonna pass in null
and now that's pretty much it so this
updates them this removes them by using
the update method so when we log in then
we're now updating the users remember
credentials but what we also need to do
is set a cookie so slim allows us to
easily set a cookie all we need to do is
say app set cookie and in to this we
pass the name of the cookie then we pass
the value and then we passed the expiry
so the name of the cookie let's just
pull this down it's going to be the name
that we set inside of our configuration
so if we go to config development we
have auth remember so that's the name of
the cookie user underscore R so we just
say app config get both dot remember so
the value of this is going to be a
string and we're gonna pass in the
remember identifier we're going to
separate these by three underscores or
you can do more if you want it doesn't
really matter as long as we can find a
way to split these up later on and then
we're going to pass in the remember
token so we'll be the remember
identifier three underscores and then
they remember token so the last argument
for sexfest setting a cookie is the
expiry so this is entirely up to you how
long you want this cookie to be active
and that will be how long your users are
kept logged in for until they're
automatically signed out so we're going
to be using carbon which is a date/time
library for PHP and we're going to parse
one week and we're going to grab the
timestamp from that so to use carbon
which is installed along with some of
our other dependencies we didn't choose
to install this ourselves
we just use carbon carbon like that so
we are now if the remember is being
checked we're setting or generating a
remember identifier remember token we're
hashing the token and storing it with
the user along the identifier and then
we're setting a cookie that's sir the
first step over and done with so if we
attempt to login now and check remember
me and we pull up our element inspector
here sorry our chrome developer tools we
go on the localhost let's log in with
the user we have in our database and
let's check remember me so I'm gonna hit
click login so you are now signed in
we're signed in as normal but we now
have this user our value here this this
cookie here if we hover over that you
can you should be able to see the value
of it and you can see we have quite a
lot of data in there so now that we have
our random string stored in a cookie
let's check out our database so we have
the remember identifier which is
basically the identifier we can see
clearly in the cookie and we have the
room
remember token but this is a hashed
version of the remember token remember
because if for example our database was
compromised and someone had access to
this token they would be able to or the
identify and the plaintext token they'd
be able to just put this into a cookie
and sign in as your user so what we want
to do then is when we end a session we
want to log a user back in if this
cookie is first of all there and second
of all if it matches that users details
in the database and the place that we
need to check this is in our before
middleware we don't have to do in here
we can do it anywhere else really if we
wanted to let's say this check remember
me so let's create a method down here
check
remember me I mean you can call this
anything you want if you want to call it
persistent login that's fine and we'll
be creating all of the functionality
inside of here and that will just be
called before every request to our
application so the first step to start
to check this is to see if we actually
have a cookie available if if we don't
then there's no need to go through all
of these checks so we're gonna say if
this app get cookie and we know the name
of the cookie it's from config so we say
this app config get off dots remember
and we also want to check that the user
isn't signed in if they're signed in we
don't want to sign them in because
that's going to create a redirect loop
so we want to say if this or Thor if not
this app or so if that's the case then
what we can do is just echo attempt
login and we can see here that we don't
see anything but if we log out we're not
removing this cookie at the moment we
will eventually when we log out but here
you can see attempts login because that
cookie has been set so let's delete that
cookie and refresh and we don't see a
temp login so it's only when that
cookies there that we're attempting that
login now what I'm actually gonna be
doing is I'm going to be signing in
using a different browser just so I can
close it and open it a little bit easily
so under login let's log in now as tabi
code course comm and hit remember me and
login perfect so I'm gonna inspect the
page and we're gonna come over to
cookies here we can see that cookie
value this is really useful as well to
use Firebug within Firefox because we
can also edit this value as well if we
want to so now that we've got this we're
in this state let's finish up with the
checking Remember Me functionality
so what we need to do is grab the data
from the cookie so let's say data was
this app yet cookie and again we need to
pass in the configuration key like that
and then we need to extract the
credentials so credentials we're going
to explode the value of the cookie I
three underscores and all that means is
we then end up if we just do a var dump
credentials and we just temporarily
remove this check you'll see the
following so we've got an array with two
elements the first is a is the
identifier and the second is the other
identifier but we that's how token that
we've hashed in our database so let's
add that check back in let's get rid of
that var dump and what we want to do now
is check that the data isn't empty and
we want to check that the credentials
are or have two elements in them so
we're gonna say if empty trimmed version
of our data which is our cookie value or
the count of the credentials which
should be two remember doesn't equal two
then we want to say this app responds
redirect this app URL for home so for
example if we log out we still have our
user cookie here if I edit this value
and I either have some kind of malformed
Al formed version of what we need so
this doesn't exist or we have nothing at
all and we refresh we redirected back
home so we're just stopping the flow of
what we want to do
so otherwise what we want to go ahead
and do and we're nesting a little bit of
here but we could tidy this up at some
point we want to grab the identifiers
which is in your credentials at key zero
and we want to grab the token which is
in the credentials at key one but what
we want to do is hash the credit the
hash the token or hash the token in the
cookie at least so it's the hash in our
database so it potentially matches we're
gonna say this app hash hash that so now
we have the identifier for the user
which is this here and we have a hashed
version of the token which we can also
compare so we're going to grab a user so
we're gonna say this app user where that
remember identifier equals that
identifier and then we're gonna grab the
first record from that so we can pull
this down so it's a little bit readable
so now we should have a user as long as
that identifier matches we should have a
user here so only if this user has been
found are we going to do something so in
this case what we could do is just echo
okay and within Firefox let's just
remove this cookie let's log back in
remember me login we'll go ahead and we
will log out and we see okay here
because this identifier has matched
otherwise if this value was edited for
any reason then it wouldn't match but
that's only the first step of checking
we now need to check that the hashed
version of the token matches the hash in
our database so what we're gonna do is
check the hash in here and again we
really are nesting here so we could make
this a little bit better we're gonna say
this
app hash hash check I'm gonna check the
token that we have here with the token
inside of the users row in the in the
database I'm gonna say user remember
token so if that does match we want to
log the user in now if it doesn't match
so the identifier is correct but the
token is not correct
we want to remove the remember
credentials so remove remember
credentials remember we implement that
method inside of our user model just
here which will just set them both to
null so let's check that this works
first of all that's really important
that that does work because if someone's
attempting to use that cookie to sign
into someone's account we don't to let
them
so we have our correct credentials
inside of this cookie won't modify the
identifier because we know that that's
being looked up properly anything after
these three underscores is our token so
let's let me just chop some of that off
in here okay I'm going to refresh the
page and nothing appears to have
happened well what will have happened is
in the database whether remember
identify remember token were they have
been turned to null or set to null so
now regardless of how much this user is
going to try to access this person's
account it's never going to be found so
we've protected that user against
further attacks so last step is to
actually log the user in if these both
match so we need to do is set a session
as we would normally do so this we're
going to set a session with the
configuration key from our config which
we did above there so it's off session
and we're going to assign user ID to
that so the next thing we want to do is
go ahead and set this app off
to this user where the ID equals the
same value from that session so we can
just copy and paste this or we could
just say user ID we want to grab the
first record and that is pretty much it
so now we should be successfully signing
a user in if both the identifier and the
token are being looked up correctly so
head over to Firefox again and we'll hit
refresh on here unless we edited this
which we did so what I'll do is I'll
just delete this cookie I'll go ahead
and login to my account
I'll check remember me that's gone ahead
and remembered me I'm gonna copy and
paste the URL from here I'm gonna close
Firefox off and I'm gonna open it back
up and we can go and paste that URL in
and there we are our session would have
been terminated but it has now been
reinstated because we have a persistent
login implemented so that is pretty much
it it is a lot to take in
there's a lot to do here but it's you
know something that needs to be taken
into consideration in terms of security
so that's it for the persistent login
but we need to again protect even
further when the user chooses to logout
if a user chooses to let's just open
Firefox chooses to logout what we want
to do is remove their persistent detail
so that identify and they remember token
so what we want to do is under our
logout root you want to go ahead and do
that just here what we also want to do
is remove the cookie as well so if you
we first want to check if that cookie
does exist so
doing the same check as we did now
before middle we're so app.config
get Wharf dot remember so if the cookie
does exist we know that the user has
chosen a persistent login so we can
remove their remember credentials we
know how to do this app or remove
remember credentials and then we want to
delete the cookie so delete cookie app
config yet and this is just the name of
the cookie the key auth dot remember so
not only will that wipe the credentials
from the database it'll also delete the
cookie which is obvious because if they
logout
we don't just keep locking them back in
so let's bring up our cookies in our in
Firebug and let's hit logout you can see
first of all that cookie is gone if we
look inside of our database table you
can see that the identifier and the
token have gone as well so that is
persistent logins complete again it's
been a lot of code and a lot of fiddly
bits to do but by doing it this way you
are protecting against people you know
having their accounts compromised more
so than you would if you were just
storing any old value in a cookie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
