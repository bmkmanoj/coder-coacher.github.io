way that we can vertically center
elements in CSS so let's take a quick
look at how this works and then we'll go
ahead and write the code for this so you
can see that this container here which
isn't vertically aligned as in text is
literally just a container we've
actually vertically aligned this and you
can see that this works responsibly as
well so we'll write little media query
and we'll start off there on mobile
we'll pull out and this will be bigger
so how do we do this well there are lots
of ways that we can do this but we're
going to look at one in particular in
this video this is my preferred method
and it work on most browsers not very
old browsers so let's go ahead and jump
straight into looking at the code so
starting out all I have really here is a
container and I have a stylesheet
LinkedIn which is just setting the font
on the page and this container has a
width of 100% you obviously don't need
this but essentially what I'm trying to
replicate here is some kind of container
whether that's something within a grid
system anything like that that has a
particular width or a particular height
it doesn't really matter so to start
things off we are going to create our
own kind of element and I'm going to
call this no result so say we have this
element which we know has a fixed height
or ends up having a fixed height via
padding or anything like that this is
the container that we're going to
vertically Center something within so
what we're going to do then is just go
ahead and create a no results selector
within CSS and for this we're just going
to text-align:center so our text is now
central we just refresh the page here I
obviously need some text in there so
let's go ahead and I suppose just say
oops
we couldn't find any results so we see
this Center now and it's kind of what we
want and just to finish this off walk
give this a background color something
like a dark grey we'll give it a
foreground color of white I'm going to
give this a fixed height of 200 pixels
so this is a fixed height element so
this is what we need to vertically
Center so to do that what we're going to
do is whatever we want vertically
centered remember trying to ignore the
container here we're just kind of
focusing on this area so we want to put
Center this within this element here so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
have a vertical align class you can call
this whatever you want or if you're
using a CSS preprocessor you could
obviously create some kind of
placeholder or mixing or whatever you
want to do to pull this in for a
particular element so it's entirely up
to you how you do this but for now since
I'm just using vanilla CSS I'm just
going to have a vertical align hook so
our vertical align hook then we'll do
the following it will set the position
to relative and then from this we're
going to set the top to 50% now take a
look what happens here you can see that
it's not quite right so we have this
what we're going to style mobile we have
this 200 pixel height container and
because it's 50% from the top anything
after that is obviously being filled so
if we just have a look in our developer
tools here it's obviously taking up the
rest of the room so this is obviously
gotten a little bit of padding on and of
course it's higher than one pixel so
it's never going to be absolutely
centered it's always going to come down
a little bit so to counteract this we
can actually use the transform property
and we want to translate this so we're
translating on the y-axis
- 50 % this will counteract the top
property and it will actually go ahead
then and send to that content so it's a
pretty neat way to do things and I
really like doing things this way so
finally how is this solution work when
we're talking about responsive design
well let's go ahead and implement a
media query here and we're going to say
minimum width 40 M and essentially now
we're just going to say no results and
we'll give this the height that would
expect to see this is kind of like a
medium up so a tablet view so when we
pull this out now you can see oops
should be no results when we pull this
out now you can see that we consistently
get vertical aligning so there are like
I said many other ways to do this you
could give this container loads of
padding and that would push everything
to the center but I found this solution
to be pretty stable and it works really
well and of course works in really
nicely with responsive design as well so
that's just a quick tip on how to
vertically align something within a
container</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
