short review on an IDE I've recently
come across called code Lobster the
reason I'm doing this review is I came
across this IDE and for beginners just
just sort of going into intermediate I
think it's absolutely brilliant and I'm
gonna go through various reasons why I
think this is as well so this isn't
gonna be a massive review and I'm gonna
look at every single element to this but
we're gonna look at the mainly the
positives for this obviously with ideas
you know you can get too dependent on
one IDE if you're gonna learn with one
IDE and switch over to maybe working
with a group of people that use a
different one that's a you know a
downside generally over ideas and by the
way the acronym idea is integrated
development environment so it's
basically an environment that you can
write in isn't just a plain text editor
we have various things that we can do as
well so we're gonna look at some of the
good points of code lobster PHP Edition
so the first thing that as you'd expect
from any good idea we have type hinting
so if I was to say name equals Alex you
could already see we get some type
hinting up here as well but again if I
was to say STR - we've got some things
like STR to lower function type hinting
stuff like that now that leads me on to
this brilliant index here and we're not
just limited to PHP here it's more than
likely you can you're gonna be using
HTML CSS MySQL you know JavaScript and
again things like jQuery so libraries
for different languages so we've got
jQuery as a library for JavaScript code
ignitor for PHP we've also got things
like WordPress and why I here as well so
this is brilliant and we can filter I've
got my filter set to PHP so if I wanted
to go ahead and look up a function and
you can see we can come and type
something again like STR to lower and
then that's going to give me this and
clicking through to this will go through
to the red
an online manual as well now another
really brilliant thing about this is if
you're a beginner and you're working
with perhaps larger files on multiple
pages we've got this brilliant
collection or here so in the variables
group we've got a name which obviously
would created a variable name if we had
a function somewhere let's just call
this output for example now soon as
we've sorry as soon as we've created
this function we have access to here so
we've got output so this is gonna list
functions variables we've got classes
and interfaces so any interface that
classes can implement based on a method
definition includes which is a really
really useful one as well and as well
for HTML Javascript and CSS with
selectors includes as well with CSS
that's really useful and again for for
JavaScript as well and keeping
management of larger files the last
thing which is brilliant as well is
we've already touched on it slightly
over here and over here but we have
plugin support for really popular
libraries for different languages so
I've already explained jQuery code
ignitor is another one you know a PHP
framework and WordPress again a really
really popular blogging platform if you
like or really a CMS now as it's
probably better known for so that's cold
lobster PHP Edition if you go over to
their official website which will be in
the description for this video go ahead
download it and play around particularly
if you're new or just sort of
intermediate and you need something to
you know better manage your your files
and you know everything that we've
explained in here and it could really
help some some people out so that that's
my review or very short overview rather
of Kolob ster PHP edition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
