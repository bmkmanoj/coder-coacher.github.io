with PHP mailer we're now going to look
at sending an HTML email by telling PHP
mailer that the contents of our email is
HTML most modern clients will pick up on
HTML even if you don't define this
within PHP mailer sometimes it isn't
necessary but we can use the built-in
functionality anyway now at the moment
we are connecting we've done this in the
last the first video and sending a basic
key now in the last video and we're
checking this send method which will
return a boolean true or false and in
this case I'm just echoing email sent so
at the moment when we send an email like
this we can head over to our client and
see that we have this email and this
just says this is the body of an email
now if we want to send an HTML email
let's take a look at how we would do
this so just above here I'm going to say
is HTML true so this is a method it
takes one parameter here this is just
saying we do won't send HTML email so
inside of here we can really do whatever
we want I'm going to create a paragraph
tag here and I'm going to create another
paragraph tag after and say this is a
new paragraph and then I'm going to say
and I am bold and I'm going to wrap this
in strong tags so despite the dodgy
markup let's now test how this does so
I'm going to head over to my script here
and refresh that then sends my email and
I can check my email and see that we've
got a new paragraph here and this part
is actually old with the use of the
strong element so really that's all we
need to do to send email or HTML email
with PHP mailer just a couple of things
to bear in mind when you are writing
markup it might better to store this in
a separate file rather than how to write
the mark-up either in a long line or in
of lines within where you're doing it
obviously the way that we are writing
this is very verbose and it would be
better to maybe have some kind of
wrapper that sent email and did all this
stuff without you having to repeat your
code also bear in mind that the alt body
should be a plain text representation of
whatever you have in your HTML body just
for clients that can't read HTML so
that's how we send HTML email with PHP
