an accordion with pure CSS so if you're
not sure what an accordion is I'll give
you a quick demo of what this does and
then we'll go ahead and look at building
it so we've got a section just open here
and accordions are usually just used to
contain content within a specific area
you can see here that I'm just revealing
content as I click like so so fairly
fairly straightforward but how have we
done this with pure CSS because
obviously we're reacting here with
clicks and we're going to do this using
a special pseudo selector which you
allows us to basically take this hash
part of the URL and apply styles based
on what's been selected here so we'll go
ahead and we'll build the markup first
we're also going to look at this
selector in isolation just so we can
understand exactly how this works and
then we'll go ahead and put this
together and build the final called him
okay so we're not going to start
entirely from scratch I've got a couple
of things already set up here but it's
nothing too tricky
the first thing I'm doing here is
pulling in a stylesheet from the Google
Fonts API and that's giving me this
source sans pro font in 400 and 600
weight if you're not sure how to do this
just google for source sounds Pro Google
Fonts and you'll pretty much get steps
that you can choose to include this on
your site and I'm just doing this just
so it looks a little bit nicer when we
build the accordion
okay so inside of here then I'm linking
in a style sheet which is main CSS and
at the moment all I'm doing is I'm
applying this font to the body of the
page just so everything we write within
our paragraphs or our unordered list
have the source sounds Pro font so at
the moment you can imagine on our page
here we've got absolutely nothing we're
just basically starting off with an
empty page so before we do anything
let's take a look at the target selector
in CSS and this is what's going to allow
us to pull together this functionality
without using JavaScript so let's create
a little example here I'm gonna create
an anchor just so I can click something
I'm gonna say click here now for the
href I'm gonna have this point to hash
and then something so let's just say
first here what I'm gonna do is have a
paragraph and I'm just gonna say this is
some text and then I'm gonna give this
paragraph an ID of first so let's take a
look here inside of our browser we've
just got a link here and this is some
text so clicking there we'll just append
this on to the end of the URL obviously
without refreshing the page so we don't
have a page refresh here with this so
our goal here then is to click this and
without refreshing the page turn this
text read so let's take a look at how we
might do that what I'm gonna do is
target all paragraphs on the page and
then I'm going to use the target
selector to apply a style and that means
that when this hash is present in the
URL anything with the same ID will be
turned red for example so let's do this
now obviously this is a useless example
in in sort of a real life situation so
we're gonna say P and then we're gonna
say oops sorry not after target and then
we're gonna say color red so what this
means is anything any paragraph elements
this is also an element selector that is
targeted so we don't specifically define
the target we just say where the target
matches so because this is a hash of
first and this has an ID of first this
paragraph will then be turned red so
let's take a look at how this works when
I click there that text thing goes red
and like I said before we don't have a
page refresh here which is crucial to
building an accordion because you don't
want the page to refresh so this is the
solution that we're going to use to
build our accordion with pure CSS so
let's get to work on building the markup
let's get rid of what we've already done
and let's get rid of these styles as
well so for the mark-up we're gonna be
using an unordered list to build our
accordion I'm gonna wrap everything in a
container just because I want to limit
the width of this our accordion by
defaults gonna be a hundred
with so can nicely fit into any
container it's placed into so for our
container then let's go ahead and build
the stars for this we want a width of
100% that might seem a little bit odd
but in this case what we're doing is
then we're defining a maximum width of a
pixel amount and that just means that it
will respond nicely as we move our
browser window and make it smaller so
now that we've done that let's get to
work on building the accordion we're
gonna create an unordered list here and
we're gonna give this a class of
accordion like so now within this each
of the list items is going to be the
accordion and content if you like or the
tab at the top and the content and we'll
we'll split them out into separate
separate parts so let's create a list
item quickly here and we are going to
create an anchor at the top of this so
this is where the user is going to click
and this is where our hash comes into
place whatever you name the hash in this
href or in the href attribute it's going
to link up with the actual content
underneath here so let's say first for
this one and inside of the href
attribute let's say hash first much like
we looked at a moment ago so we're gonna
call this we're gonna give this a class
of accordion header just so we can
target that with CSS and style it and
down here we're gonna create a div
called accordion content like so so just
a day of the class of accordion content
now what's important is that we add an
ID attribute here to name this the same
as this one because when we click this
we want this to show so in here let's
create a paragraph and let's just put
some lorem ipsum in there you can just
go ahead and find some lorem ipsum
generators online or if you're using
Emmet like I am you can do that within
your browser your text editor so now
that we've got that let's take a look at
it in our browser so it looks ok the
structures okay and obviously we just
need to apply some stars to this so
before we do that let's duplicate this
list item
and let's add the rest of our content so
we're gonna have three of these this
one's going to be second and that hash
is obviously going to change otherwise
we'll get muddled up and down here we'll
have third third and third so as long as
they're all different it's going to work
properly so now that we've done our
markup let's look at actually styling
this to make it look quite nice it's
gonna be very basic but you can go ahead
and change these around to suit you
so the accordion itself which is
remember just our unordered list we want
a width of a hundred percent here that's
not going to affect anything because its
place within our container remember
we're gonna step adding to zero and
margin to zero just for the reason that
this is in fact an unordered list and it
has padding and margin by default and
we're going to change the list style
type to none and that just means that
the bullets here will go like so so
we've got a nice-looking list now so
inside of the accordion we have
accordion content in fact let's star the
header up first so the accordion header
this is probably the element with the
most Styles it's gonna have a display of
block because at the moment we have an
anchor which is an inline block or an
inline sorry we're gonna set some
padding on this and we will set a
background here of BBB so let's take a
look at how that looks at the moment
okay so it's already looking a little
bit more like our result there's a few
things we can just tidy up here just to
make it look a little bit nicer we can
set the color of this to white so the
text is white we can get rid of that
text decoration which is the underline
on the links you have by default like so
and we'll also change the font size as
well to make this bigger just so it's a
little bit more prominent and we'll also
transform the text to uppercase so we
semantically have correct text so normal
case text and then we transform it
visually with CSS
and we'll add a little text shadow onto
this as well so I have a 1 pixel x and y
offset a 0 spread and we use our GPA to
make this black with a point 1 on the
Alpha Channel so for the accordian
content this is pretty straightforward
I'm gonna buy dish by default remove the
padding I'm going to set the height to 0
and I'm gonna set the overflow to hidden
now the reason I've done this is if we
have any padding and we set the height
to 0 with an overflow hidden we're still
gonna see things peek through so with
our target pseudo selector we'll change
the padding back to say 20 pixels if if
that's what we want or you could change
it to how it whatever you think so at
the moment we get this an actual fact I
do need to add this margin back to the
header on the bottom because that's what
separates this visually from each other
you don't have to do this but feel free
to leave it out otherwise okay so let's
just bring back let's just bring back
our content just so we can see what
we're doing here I'm just gonna alter
the stars for the paragraphs within this
so down or up here I suppose we could
say accordion content P sort of
targeting paragraph elements and we'll
set the margin to zero zero zero zero
and on the bottom we'll do a 20 pixel
had a margin on here so there we go so
what's gonna happen is when we
eventually get around to having an
accordion selected it's going to look
like the following
so accordion content so when an item
should be shown we're gonna add a 20
pixel padding so it'll end up looking
like this it doesn't at the moment
because remember we need that high of
zero so let's get rid of this for now
and let's bring this back so using what
we learned at the start of the video we
can now apply this to make these show
depending on whether hash first is
selected or
second is selected or hash third is
selected or however many you have in
this list so all we do down here then
and this is refreshingly simple we just
say accordion content target much like
we did that anchor a moment ago let's
get rid of that and then we just say
height of auto which will basically
reset or override this style here and
then remember we also need to add the 20
pixel padding back in because we have a
padding of 0 here to help with the
height so now let's get rid of this and
then hit first and that shows because
remember first is now targeting this
with an idea first so you can see that
there and let's just pull this away and
there we go so we can just basically
click through it's as simple as that
so really the hardest part about this is
actually styling the content itself
now we've now completed our pure CSS
accordion but there can be complications
with this depending on what else you
have on your page obviously because we
have our hash first here if your page at
all relies on other hashes being used
then this will automatically be closed
your page probably shouldn't rely on
anything with a hash so I can't see any
problem with this but with a solution
like this there's bound to be some
problems along the way so you might want
to just be careful when you are
implementing this either way if you are
creating a very very simple website that
you don't want to include perhaps jQuery
and as a dependency and this is a really
good way of doing things without
requiring in heavy libraries like jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
