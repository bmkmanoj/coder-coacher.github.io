video streaming from an Amazon s3 bucket
but we're going to pair this with cloud
front to allow us to deliver this a
little bit more efficiently and what
this means is instead of accessing a URL
for a particular file from our s3 bucket
directly what we're going to do is we're
going to use cloud front and this is
going to act as a content delivery for
the contents inside of that bucket so as
well as creating a new bucket we're
going to need to actually set this up
and add some more code to our start file
to actually be able to serve this
properly now you can see that I've set
up a new bucket here so if you are
following along you're going to need to
create a new bucket altogether where you
don't have to but in this case we'll
keep everything nice and separate and
I've called this video that website comm
and I've uploaded quite a large file
here I want a user to be able to stream
on my website so we've got this file in
here that exists and also note that it's
actually at the moment a private file so
we can't access this file normally by
just using the URL and that's entirely
up to you whether you actually want to
do that it doesn't really matter but in
our case we're going to tokenize it and
that's so users can't find the video URL
and give it someone else again if you're
using some kind of membership behind
your website this is going to be really
useful so the first thing that we need
to do then is under your services
section you'll find the cloud front link
when you go ahead and click that you'll
come into cloud front distributions and
you can set up a new distribution so
remember we access accessing this
through our cloud front distribution not
directly on our bucket so what we want
to do then is generate a key pair for
our cloud front distribution so over
under our security credential area you
can find that but just by clicking your
name in the top here we're going to
generate a cloud front key pair and have
a few that I've created that I've
actually deleted so let's go ahead and
create a new key pair so what we can do
here is we can download the private key
which is exactly what we need to be able
to connect up with cloud front so I'm
going to go ahead and click that and
that's going to download that file for
me just down here you can see and you're
going to need to store this inside of
the application that you're working with
now remember do not store it in a
publicly accessible location this is
much better
stored outside of the public directory
that you're working in so just remember
to save it in a location that makes
sense so users cannot access your
private key or their potentially then
going to be able to access your cloud
front distribution that's really really
important so I'm going to head go ahead
and quickly save this over in my
directory here again store it somewhere
completely outside of anywhere that it
can be publicly accessible I'm just
going to quickly copy this over now
okay so I've stored that inside of the
root directory of my application which
isn't a good idea
like I said store it somewhere secure
outside of the public access but we can
now use this to actually connect to
cloud front but we don't have a cloud
front distribution setup so I'm going to
go ahead and click create distribution
on the web I'm going to click get
started and the origin domain name is
basically going to be the domain name of
the bucket that you want to serve
content from so in this case it's going
to be video website com'd
a ps3 or Amazon AWS comm and I'm going
to keep the origin ID exactly the same
so we are eventually going to restrict
bucket access but I'm not going to
enable this just now I'm going to do
that in a moment because what I need to
do is actually set up an Origin access
identity in order to do this and tie it
in with this this cloud front
distribution so there's a few options
that we have here most of these are
consult be left normal or as they are we
can do things like customize the time to
live on the files within that bucket but
we're not going to be doing that we're
just going to be testing how they're
served in just a moment there's a few
other options if you do need to change
anything but all the way down here I'm
going to hit create distribution now
this is going to say in progress for
wait a while so what you're going to
want to do is just leave that to finish
and once that is finished we can carry
on okay so now that this is deployed we
can go ahead and set up an Origin access
identity so if we click create Origin
access I didn't see we can just hit
create on that and we can add a name so
I guess let's just edit this and we'll
say video dot website.com and hit yes
edit okay so now that we've got this
then we can tie this up to the
distribution that we created earlier so
let's edit this one now hit distribution
settings so if we go over to origins we
select this origin that's been created
and edit this we want to restrict the
bucket access so if we click yes here we
can either create a new identity or we
can use an existing identity remember
we've already set that up just a second
ago so we can choose that one and what
we want to do is grant read permissions
on the bucket we want to update the
bucket policy automatically and we'll
see what this entails in just a moment
so I'm going to hit yes edit and that's
going ahead and added that origin access
identity to there now if we head over to
our bucket and just give the page a
refresh we can click on video to website
comm we can head over to properties and
we can look under the permissions once
it's loaded if we go under permissions
here you can see it says edit bucket
policy now normally this would say add
bucket policy but this has been
generated for us already now what we
also want to do is we want to restrict
access to this by signed URLs only which
is with the tokenization so under the
behaviors area we'll want to edit this
default behavior here and we saw this
when we set up our distribution but what
we want to do now is restrict viewer
access and used signed URLs so we hit
yes here we can choose the trusted
signers so we can either use or you can
either specify account or use self in
this case I'm going to yourself which is
the current account I'm using let's go
ahead and edit that and that is pretty
much all done so
now is the domain name that's tied down
to this distribution and we can copy
this so when we go ahead and update
everything inside of our app we can use
this so remember we have our private
keys stored just here all we need to do
now is actually change a few things
inside of start PHP so if we just open
that up we're going to use the SDK to
access cloud front so I'm going to
create a cloud front variable here and
this is cloud front client and again
we're using a factory here and we need
to pass options in much like we did for
the s3 client so we need to specify
where the private key is so we say
private key that's going to be the
location of the private key that you
downloaded earlier when stored and then
we need the key pair ID okay so the
private key then is this file just here
so what we can do is just grab the whole
name of this and this would obviously be
to a path outside of the directory that
you're currently working in so the key
pair ID you can find it over on your
security credentials area where you set
up your cloud front key pairs so this is
the access key ID we just paste that in
there this should be all good to go now
to actually access cloud front from here
so over on video PHP we obviously want
to tokenize this URL our we need to
supply a few settings in our cloud front
config so over here I'm going to create
a new key called cloud front and this is
going to be an array with the URL to my
cloud front distribution okay so
remember that's over inside of here if
we just copy this and paste this in here
we need to append on HTTPS and that's
now the URL we're going to use to access
our bucket content so what we need to do
now then is over in video we need to
find the object that we're at
again this could come from a database or
something like that in this case it's
called pure CSS tabs mp4 we need to set
an expiry on this URL remember we're
tokenizing it or using a signed URL in
this case we're going to use PHP
date/time functionality to provide say
10 minutes of VAX s time for this
remember if your users are streaming a
video and you acts and you maybe provide
one minute for example then that might
be a problem because if it's a 10 minute
video and they pause it what they're
going to have to do then is make another
request to the server to pick up where
they left off or if they were skipping
through the video for more than a minute
this would fail for them so make sure
it's a sufficient amount of time so for
the URL then we're going to use the
cloud front
variable that we've created we're going
to say get signed URL and this takes an
array in here that allows us to provide
the URL that we're accessing in this
case it's going to be the URL name which
I'll call X and the object name which
I'll call Y so we can replace this in we
know that the URL we've just stored in
an config so that's on the cloud front
URL and Y is obviously our object which
we have just stored at the top of that
file and now we need to provide when it
expires and that's pretty
straightforward it's just the expiry
that we stored up there but we want to
call the get timestamp method from our
date/time object to get a timestamp
rather than the actual object itself
because that's not going to work so
let's just echo out URL and see what we
get here make sure we didn't do anything
wrong
so let's refresh and of course so this
is namespaced so under start where we
created this or we use this class here
we actually need to provide a import for
this but it's namespaced so it's on the
AWS cloud front and its cloud front
client so when we refresh now we get
this long URL here which if we just
paste into here we get an access denied
error so let's
check we've set everything up right
under our origins let's go ahead and
read update our bucket policy because
remember we changed the origin axis
identity to use the self account so that
should have gone and updated that we can
check that by just giving this a refresh
returning back to all of our buckets so
if we just edit this bucket policy you
can see that the this has now changed
and it's allowing access through that
origin access identity there so what we
can now actually do is retest this URL
so if we just refresh and paste this
into here you can see that that's
actually allowing me now to download
that file so we don't want to download
it we want to use it inside of a video
so let's go ahead and do this now so
over in our video dot PHP file let's end
this off and create a document and let's
go ahead and just save video and we'll
create an html5 video tag we're not
going to embed the source just in here
we are going to allow controls and in
here we're going to define the source
where it's coming from
I'm also going to define the type as
well in this case is video mp4 you might
have lots of different files and it's aa
resource that should be you might have
lots of different files different types
that's supported on different browsers
in this case I'm just using mp4 and
immediately in here we're just going to
echo out that URL so that will now play
inside of the video player I'm going to
get rid of this echo URL as well as we
don't really need that so now when i
refresh you can see that that loads in
the video let's in fact give this a
width of 768 just temporarily so it
looks a little bit smaller and then
there is the file being loaded so if we
inspect this page then we can actually
see the content being loaded in and
what's happening is if we go on to the
network tab here let's turn the console
off we can actually see that the
contents coming through as partial
content because we're currently
streaming it and when we click to access
different areas of the video you can see
that each request is being cancelled and
a new
request is being sent to that part of
the video that's why the expiry is
really important here because you don't
this to expire otherwise what's going to
happen is as your users are scanning
through here and this is going to be an
expired request so for example if we
were to change this to 10 seconds and we
refresh it's going to work fine here we
can hit play and we can watch this
through however when we try and scan
across eventually after them 10 seconds
or up you can see we get a forbidden
request here to make sure that this is
enough for your fit users to watch the
video I guess it really depends on on
how you want to set this but just tweak
it otherwise we're going to see a
failure here so what we're going to do
now is we're going to check if this is
actually being served through cloud
front or not when I click this request
you can see that we get the tab see that
we can usually navigate through but
under the headers if we come down we can
see this X cache header here and this
has been missed from cloud front so this
hasn't been served from cloud front if
you refresh a couple of times you'll
eventually see a hit from cloud front
which means it's being served via cloud
front and not being requested from the
origin and remember the origin is your
s3 bucket so in my case at the moment
I'm not seeing any hits from cloud from
sometimes this does take a while for it
to actually hit cloud front it depends
on when it's been stored but you can set
additional options for example if we
head over to our origin just here you
can actually sorry now our behaviour you
can actually see you can give this a
customized caching time a minimum time
to live and you can obviously read more
about that by clicking the I just here
so what we've basically done in this
video is we've set up cloud front to
fetch from an origin remember that
origin is our Amazon s3 bucket and it's
pulling this down now from that URL that
we requested and it's serving it vehicle
out front format s3 bucket now I've just
taken the moment to do a couple of
refresh is and you can see that we're
actually now getting hit from cloud
front so that's being immediately loaded
in via the content delivery rather than
being fetched from the origin and
there's a lot more tweaking that you can
actually do with cloud front to actually
better serve files but this has been a
very basic introduction of how you can
serve videos and stream videos from s3
using cloud front</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
