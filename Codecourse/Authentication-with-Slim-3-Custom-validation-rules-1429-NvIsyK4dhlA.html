sign up with the same email address and
let's say you wanted to add a username
to this it's going to be exactly the
same problem you don't want people with
the same username or email signing up it
just doesn't make sense so to do this
how are we gonna do this when inside of
our authentication controller we're
setting the rule here now what we don't
really want to do is start doing things
like if and then checking our database
at this kind of point what we want to do
is basically extract this away from our
controller and instead embed it in our
validation rules and this makes sense
because you are technically validating
that the data is valid and the form can
be properly submitted and the intended
action can be taken so what we do is
with the validation library that we're
using we can very easily create custom
rules and at that point we can hit our
database so all we want to do is inside
of our validation folder we want to
create a new folder for our custom rules
so let's set the first rule up and just
see what this looks like
so this one is going to be called email
available again call this whatever you
want as long as it makes sense to you
and you can't remember it so we're gonna
call this or namespace this under
validation rules and down here we just
call this email available so now what we
want to do is extend respect validations
abstract raw so let's just use respect
validation rules abstract raw and here
we can extend the abstract rule so that
might seem pretty straightforward and of
course the rest of it is even easier all
we need to do in here is implement a
validate method so let's call this
validate of course with anything that we
validate we have some input come through
so we can test this out by just doing a
var dump on input it's really good to
just test these
kind of things out just to see that
everything is working and all we do
within here is we either return a true
value or a false value so let's just
hook this into our form and then we'll
start to think about how we can touch
our database so over in our bootstrap
file in our app file what we want to do
down here is just do something that
allows this validation library to use
out rolls and all we do is say V with
and then we give the name space to where
our rules are kept and we're using back
slashes like this because we're
basically good escaping them now we
don't have V pulled in so let's just do
this at the top here respect validation
validator and we'll call it V so now we
are loading in all of our rules and now
when we just use these rules here
they'll be picked up so the kind of
important thing to note here is that the
name that we give our class is going to
become the name of the row so in our
case we need to say email available like
so so this will then look inside of the
directory that we've specified here or
at least under the namespace we've
specified here it will find this role it
will call the validate method and here
we either return true or false
in actual fact to test this out let's
return false just to assume it fails so
now if we go and check our database we
know that we've got Alex at code course
comm so let's try Billy at Co course
comm hit sign up and we see an error but
we do have this available and we've
called the class the right name so I
think it's probably something to do with
this path here so I think we might need
a forward slash or a back slash rather
on the end of here let's just try this
again let's submit this with Billy at
Code course and this is fine so we're at
a good point here the reason that this
is now errored is because we don't have
an exception found for this role and
really important because you may have
noticed we've not defined any error
messaging or anything like that around
this rule so we can set this up now just
to check that this works so for every
rule that you create you'll need to
create not only the rule but an
exception so this validation library
knows how to handle it
so we're gonna create an exception just
in here and we're gonna call this email
available so the same name is the role
but exception dot PHP so here we can
just give this our namespaces app
validation exceptions and it's called
email available exception so this needs
to extend a validation exception from
the respect validation library so let's
pull this in and it's validation
exception so now we can just extend that
there now in here we just have a
template for the default and the
negative mode now the negative mode just
means that if you are kind of reversing
the check so we're going to kind of
ignore that and we'll just implement the
template for the default error message
so we have a static property here
it's called default templates these can
of course get a little bit more advanced
but you can go ahead and check out the
libraries github page for all the
documentation and of course look through
the code as well and here we have a
default mode what I was talking about
so default mode so this is just an array
and in here we have our error message so
we have to set a standard property here
and we just give the error message so
email is already taken and that is it
that's all we need to do we now have our
exception and the library will handle
this and it will give us that give us
that error back when remember we
actually set up our handling here
so this will just be appended to our
normal errors so now that we've got this
set up let's go and preview this so Alex
or rather Billy at code course comm we
know
this doesn't exist but remember we're
returning false so here and of course we
have a syntax error so that needs to be
like that its refresh and once again
let's fix this up as well there we go
great so we now get email is already
taken but we know that's not the case so
we now need to figure out how we are
going to update this to check our
database of course we already know that
we have eloquent setup so all we really
need to do here is return a user where
the email column is the same as the
input given we need to grab the count
from this and we need to check if it's
zero now if it is zero this will return
true which is what we want we want this
to pass otherwise if this email already
exists we'll get a count of one that
doesn't equal zero and unfortunately
therefore we'll return false so let's
just pull this model in so it is app
models user and we're done we have a
nice clean rule here everything
extracted away from our controller
method so now we can actually test this
out hit sign up we see the normal errors
let's go into my email address hit sign
up email is already taken let's create a
new email that passes which is great and
now we can try and register a new user
and that works we can go over to our
database and see that that's in there so
that is all we need to do now so later
on down the line if we need to set up a
new rule we just create a new rule
create a new exception following the
same templates and we're done but the
key thing here is that our earth
controller is now nice and clean we're
validating checking if it's failed and
then of course just registering the user</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
