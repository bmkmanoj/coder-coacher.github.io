well as pull in eloquent so we can use
that for the rest of the series and what
will also be doing is creating our first
model as well and actually testing that
this works so we know we'll be good to
go with at least our product model so
let's start by looking at the database
schema I just have an empty database
called cart here and I'm going to start
to build up all of the tables that we're
going to need so let's start with the
product table so we're going to go and
call this product and inside of here we
need an ID this needs to be unsigned the
primary key and auto increment that will
be the same for all of the other tables
that we're creating as well if this
isn't automatically inserted view go
ahead and create this now so the next
thing that we need for a product is a
title so this is just going to be a
varchar' and we'll just set the length
of this to 255 and we'll uncheck allow
null because we always want an title in
there now the same for the slugga as
well so this is going to be a varchar'
of 255 and once again we don't allow
null on this either so for the
description then this will be slightly
different this will be a text type and
we can allow null for this because we
might not have a description the next is
going to be the price which will be a
float and we don't allow null on this
one and then we will also have an image
so this will just be a path to an image
and this will obviously be a bar chart
we'll take a look at this when we insert
the data in just a moment now we also
need stock as well so this is just going
to be an integer
we don't allow null on this it will
either be 0 or any positive number and I
think that is about it the only other
two things we need to do are specific to
eloquent and that is a created at
timestamp and an updated at timestamp so
we can create these as well let's do
this and there we go so now that our
products table is done we'll get on with
the rest and we'll come back and we'll
fill in our products in just a moment so
obviously we need an orders table this
will keep track of all of the orders
that we have created when we actually
get to the checkout process this again
will have an ID
we'll also have that hash that we saw
earlier so this will be a long hash that
will identify each order that just means
that the user can come back and see it
later we'll have an order total which
will be a float and we don't allow
another on either of these so we can
uncheck that we will also have an
address ID we'll look at creating the
addresses table in just a moment this
just allows us to relate an address to
an order so make sense and that'll be an
integer as well and here we want to
check if it's paid so we're going to
have a boolean which essentially is just
a tiny integer with a length of 1 and
again we want to uncheck around now on
this one and we'll also have a customer
ID obviously we need to write relate an
order to a particular customer ID so we
can leave this as an integer and uncheck
allow null and again the only other two
things we need here are the created out
date which is a timestamp here and we
need an update to that date as well like
so there we go okay so our orders table
is done how are we going to know for
each order which products we have well
we saw this in the introduction video
we're going to create a table called
orders underscore products and what this
will do is it will take an order ID and
a product ID and relate them two
together so we can get that list of the
products which are part of each order so
let's fill in our order ID let's go and
uncheck around now let's fill in our
Product ID and we'll also fill in the
quantity as well so obviously a user can
check out and pay for more than one item
and this is pretty much it we don't need
a creator that date here and then update
that date this is literally just a
intermediate table between orders and
products so now let's focus on our
customers table so the customers table
will literally just store the name in
the email of the customer that's it and
separate - this will have an address so
we will have a name which will be a
varchar and you can reduce the lengths
of these but I'm just setting them to
255 as default we have an email here
which we will require as well
to uncheck around null and that's pretty
much it for this but we will include I
created at an update to that date now of
course later on what you can do is add
more to these tables if you need to
collect more information about your
customer so that's absolutely fine you
can add to this as you need so for the
addresses then this is very important
because we need to know where to ship
how orders and in here we have slightly
more but it's just to kind of standard
stuff so it's a address which obviously
isn't a timestamp it's a voucher we have
an address too so we have a second dress
line and this will be of our travel as
well and we will allow a null on the
address too because we aren't going to
require that one we have a city here as
well so let's create this as a varchar
and we want that and we will also have a
postal code as well so it's up to you
whether you want to accept the postal
code but probably a good idea we're
going to uncheck allow now so all we
then have is our created update date and
updated at date like so done so the last
thing we want to keep track of our
payments just to check if a particular
payment has failed obviously you'll be
able to see this from the Braintree
sandbox or when you're on production
you'll be able to see this when you sign
in but of course it's good to keep just
a track of this at least we know which
order we've placed or which order
relates to which payment rather and it
just makes it easier to go ahead and
look this up so let's create a payments
table and inside here we want to relate
this to an order ID so we don't allow in
on this that will just be an integer we
will have a failed boolean just to see
if it's failed or you call it success
either one and this will just be a
boolean but obviously that's a tiny
integer of one and we'll uncheck allow
null and we will also have a transaction
ID this will be a voucher and this will
be the transaction ID that comes back
from Braintree in actual fact will allow
null on this if anything goes wrong so
lastly we'll just have created at and
updated at and then we're done with our
database schema we can come back and fix
anything up later if we need to and
course ongoing you can do whatever you
want this add more columns so before we
actually set up our database connection
and all of that good stuff we will add
some products to our products table
now I already have some SQL that I'm
literally going to paste in what I'm
going to do is I'm going to talk to you
a little about the product image as well
just by grabbing that from a website
called place hold dot it so I'm going to
head over to the query tab here and just
paste this query in all that's going to
do is it's going to add in a few
products so if I just refresh you can
see that this is just filled in a load
of products but of course this is all
pretty straightforward stuff you can go
ahead and create two or three test
product make sure you have a slug in
there description obviously a price and
set the stock fairly high so I'm just
going to adjust this one here and I
guess I can adjust a couple of these
other ones as well what you will want to
do is make sure that you have some stock
that is quite low and what that means is
we can test out checking if we have low
or no stock so we can fiddle around with
this a bit later now apart from that
it's all pretty simple we have a price
and we have an image now for the image
we are pulling these from place hold
dots it this just allows you to do
something like this so this is how we
put it in and we have the text size we
have the actual text that we want to
render we have a width and a height here
so feel free to change this around but
this is what I'm using for my product
image and of course you can pull in your
own product images whatever you want to
do while you're building this so that's
where that came from if you want to just
fill them in so that's our database
schema and our product data done that's
all of the data we need because all of
this stuff here is generated when we
actually run code and create orders and
stuff like that so well let me go and
put in eloquent then let's just get rid
of these and we'll head over and we'll
just start to set this up so over in
bootstrap app now we know we already
have eloquent installed via composer so
all we really need to do is just start
to connect here so what we're going to
do is just underneath here we're going
to pull it eloquent in as we do and this
is using capsule so we just say new
capsule here this is just a easy way
just to pull eloquent in and what we can
do is up here just pull in that
namespace so it's under illuminate
database fix that up capsule manager and
we're just going to call this capsule
like so so now that we've done this we
need to add a connection now this is
very similar to PDO essentially all
eloquent is is just an object relational
mapper all this means is that we are
literally just going to be able to
create models we do actually have a
query builder as well which you can use
separately but we're specifically going
to be using models for this and we will
say capsule add connection and then in
here we just specify all of our
connection details now we can choose the
driver so if you're using a different
database solution that's fine but I
happen to be using MySQL so I'm going to
go and choose that we have a host which
is for me obviously localhost it's
probably the same for you as well we
have the database name which for me is
cart remember we saw that and we have a
username and a password so pretty
straightforward stuff so in my case this
is just root and root so for password
that is also root again this might be a
little bit different for you and we have
a couple of additional things like the
character encoding now in this case it
is utf-8 and we also have a collation
here as well which is utf-8 unicode CI
so you can go ahead and add that in we
also have the ability to add prefixes to
our tables and this is important because
when we start to look at things like
relationships eloquent will
automatically pick these up based on the
table names
that's why we've given our table names
very specific names like customers is
like a plural of customer orders is a
plural of order and we'll see that
reflected when we start to create our
models so now all we want to do is set
eloquent as global so we just want to
say capsule set as global or at least
levels data base package is global and
then we want to boot eloquent so we can
start using models and that is all the
set
that we require for our database simple
as that
now in the next part we're going to look
at doing our product index but we're
going to play around with our product
model before we do this just so we know
that everything is working and we're
going to see how we pull out all of our
products from our database table so for
our models then inside of app we want to
create a new folder for all of our
models that make sense and inside of
here
we'll go and create a product dot PHP
file this is just going to be our
product model so the namespace for this
then is obviously cart or whatever then
the namespace you gave and models and
then we have a product class just here
now to create this as an eloquent model
what we need to do is actually give this
a prefix tensional we need to create
this as a subclass of model from
eloquent makes sense so we're just going
to say extends model and this model
class comes from illuminate database
eloquent model simple as that it's just
correct that there so now we have an
eloquent model now let's just examine
this and we're going to do this over in
our home controller now to be able to
use this what we can do is we can say
something like product all for example
this will get all products or we can say
something like product where ID 1
there's low different things we can do
the query builder but what we're going
to be doing is injecting these in with
dependency injection now we know how
this is set up because we did it within
our container earlier so all we need to
do is go over and add this to our
container very quickly so if you come
over to your container dot PHP file up
here we are I'm just going to bump this
up and I'm going to say here use cart
models product and then down here what I
can do is attach this to the container
so I just need to say product class and
here this is going to be a call back
inside of here we're going to do exactly
the same thing we're going to have a
container interface which is the current
state of our container and then all
we're going to do is return
a new product simple as that now we can
inject this onto our or within our home
controller index method so what we can
do here is say product product and here
I'm going to say product equals product
all or we can say product get really
depends so now we can do a var dump on
product and see what we get
will just kill the page there so let's
head over to our browser refresh and
obviously here we see class cart
controller product does not exist we
just need to pull the name spacing up
here so use cart models product and
there we go if we spell database
correctly so let's just go over to
product here you probably notice that
one but now we see our collection so
what this is doing is its returning a
collection of items and all this means
is that we can loop through and each of
the items within that collection will be
a model so what we can do for example is
say products first you can see what we
get back is a product and this will
contain all of the attributes the
methods on our product model that we can
use so for example here I can say title
all that's doing then is just pulling
the first element or the first product
rather out of our table so that's a
little bit about how it works we know
that we can do this now so we'll go
ahead and leave this in here because in
the next part we're going to go and look
at actually creating the product index
we're going to be creating our template
with bootstrap we're going to be
creating our list of products basically
with images that we can eventually click
through to onto the product detail page
so we're all set up without database and
we have a model set up we're ready to go
and start creating some of the pages now
I want to give a huge shout out to our
friends at Braintree payments for
supporting code cause in future there
could be a whole new way to pay brain
treats full stack payment platform is
easily adaptable to whatever the future
holds so with just ten lines of enough
code
it's easy to update to support a new
payment method no staying up all night
with complicated recoding no stress
about keeping ahead with your payments
Braintree payments is here to help you
can learn more at Braintree payments
