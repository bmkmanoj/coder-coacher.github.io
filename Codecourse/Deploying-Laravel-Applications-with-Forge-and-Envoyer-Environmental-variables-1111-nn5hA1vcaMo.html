but we're a little bit stuck here
because we have a lower Valera now the
reason for this is we can't actually
find all or at least our server can't
actually find any of our environmental
variables now if you're familiar with
the laravel which i assume you will be
you'll know that within a larval project
we have this dot EMV far now this
contained environmental variables that
we can use to pull in in outcome fix so
for example under config database for
example you can see here that we're
using the EMV helper to pull in the
value for dbconnection not here it
doesn't exist but it will default to
something if it does so we have all of
our environmental variables we're not
going to go into these too much however
we need these to be available so we're
going to copy these we're going to head
over to on voya over to servers i'm
going to click manage environment what
this will do is allow us to manage our
environmental variables from employer
which will be put onto our server and
then essentially they'll just be loaded
in so we can use them so the first time
you do this you need to be really
careful because this is going to ask you
for a key now this key should be pretty
strong but once you lose this key so if
you forget this then there's no way to
access your environmental variables at
least not easy so I'm going to just type
in something very very basic here but
I'd highly recommend you generate some
long key and you keep that in a very
safe place to unlock your environment so
I've typed in something here and I'm
going to click unlock I'm going to use
that every time I need to re-access this
and now what i can do is i can paste in
the contents of my DMV far so we're
going to sink to insta CAD me prod which
is just our server we're going to hit
update on servers and that's going to go
ahead and sink that we can wait for that
to finish there we go it's done so just
quickly before we check this is working
I'm going to click on this again you can
see it asks me for the same key so make
sure you remember that key and you can
unlock and add any more environmental
variables here ok so now that
done let's go over to our project hit
enter and you can see it's still not
working now why is this what we actually
need to redeploy for these to take
effect so let's go ahead and deploy once
more wait for that to finish and then we
can go ahead and check out the status of
our server so let's keep an eye on this
deployment wait for it to finish so that
looks like it's finished now we can head
over to our domain again and now we have
our application successfully deployed so
although a little bit fiddly now what
you can do is whenever you update your
environment file on your local machine
so when you ever make a change to this
or add something to it rather than you
know keeping all this in your version
control or whatever you can have your
DMV example file which contains
basically non-secret values so for
example if you were using male male gun
and you had a male gun secret you
wouldn't actually add the key here you
would just leave it as it is you don't
want to put that in your version control
and what you can now do is whenever you
do make a change you can head over
unlock your environment you can go ahead
and add it in here update and it will go
ahead and work with your current
application so we've now looked at
environments and we have actually
successfully deployed allow ravel 5
application but pretty much any other
application is roughly the same you
should know how to now set up a forge
server and go ahead and deploy with
envoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
