going to show you how to apply a box
shadow to a square or rectangular
element on our page and we're going to
apply the Box shadow so that it's inside
the element and so that it's curved on
the left and right hand side of the
element so looking like this here where
we have our curved shadows so let's look
at some code for this the first thing
I'm going to do is add a div which is
going to be the box itself and I'm going
to give that a class of shadow five and
that's where the markup will need now I
need to include some styles so first of
all I'm going to style up the body of
the page giving it a background of hash
DDD which is a light gray color then
giving a margin of zero to remove any
default margin from the page next I'm
going to style up the div itself give it
a background color of white and give it
a width of 400 pixels height 200 pixels
and give it some padding give it some
margin
ham float it left now we're going to be
creating the shadows using pseudo
elements and serial elements are
basically elements that will appear as
the first and last child of a parent
element and so I'm going to show you how
to do that now but before we do that I'm
going to select the div with the shadow
5 class and I'm going to position it
relative and I'm gonna give it an
overflow:hidden now the reason I'm doing
this is so that we can style the seeder
elements opposition the pseudo elements
relative to this parent element which is
the div itself and also that
overflow:hidden is crucial so that we
don't see the Box shadow on the seedier
elements which I get to apply we
actually just see the blur of the Box
shadow and that'll all become clear
later on so the next thing I need to do
is create a pseudo element and first
we're going to create first of all we're
going to create it before pseudo element
and this means that I just created an
element which is going to sit as the
first child of the element with the
shadow 5 class now I need to apply
content and the content value is just
going to be an empty value here because
we don't want anything there we just
want to see a box shadow now I'm going
to give it a position:absolute so that I
can choose exactly where I want this to
be positioned then going to give it a
width of 10 pixels I'm going to move it
left from its usual position by 10
pixels so this will mean we don't see
the Box shadow applied to it as I saying
earlier we just see them the blur they
go together of a height of 90%
move it down from the top by five
percent and that's all we need to do in
terms of positioning finally I'm going
to apply book shadow which is going to
have an X offset of zero Y offset of
zero blurred radius of 17 pixels and an
RG be a color zero zero zero or 2.6
there we are let's see what that looks
like on the page here we can see the
shadow of the pseudo element and not the
pseudo element self serve want to open
up developer tools and remove the
overflow:hidden on the shadow you can
see this is the main box shadow on the
pseudo element and this is the blur of
the pseudo element but obviously we
don't want to see this bit we just want
to see the blur and so that's why we
have the overflow:hidden now the final
thing to do is apply an elliptical
border-radius and the reason I'm doing
that is to curve that box shadow we saw
a little bit more and to apply
elliptical border radiuses you just have
two values which are separated by a
forward slash the first value being the
horizontal radius and the second value
being the vertical radius so here I'm
going to have five pixels then 100
pixels so I'm going to save that go back
to the page refresh and you can see
there that it's added a bit of curvature
to that book shadow now finally I want
to apply the same shadow or the opposite
shadow on the right hand side to do that
I'm just going to copy all of these
styles and thus Ted creates an after
pseudo element which is going to be the
last child of the div with class shadow
five and then I'm going to change left
to right to move the shadow 10 pixels to
the right so let's see how that looks
like
there we are we've got our a nice border
radius there as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
