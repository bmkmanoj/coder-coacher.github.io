actually given the user the ability to
log out yet which is pretty annoying
when we want to log out when we're
testing we have to just delete our
session ID so let's login to our
application we're going to go ahead and
implement our logout function
functionality so we're logged in and we
can only see home register and login
agon we know that we've already seen
that but now we want a new link which is
to log out so let's update our
navigation so let's close all of these
off and let's go and update our
templates partials navigation if the
user is authenticated we can now
implement a new link which is going to
be to log out so we can see that here
now log out so we need to create a route
for this so under routes off we're going
to create a new file called logout dot
PHP we are going to say this is logout
create our function here use our app and
we want to process the user logging out
but under routes let's just include
logout so we can now hit logout let's
just echo log out we'll give this a name
as well and we'll go ahead and update
our navigation to include that URL like
so so all done if we just log out we
just see logout when I actually logged
out yet so to actually log user out is
pretty straightforward what we need to
do is unset the session that we create
remember our author session is within
config so it's auth session user ID so
rather than manually put this in we can
just grab that from our config
like so and then we want to flash a
message and redirect the user to the
home page so we say app Flash global you
have been logged out and then we say app
responds redirect and we want to say URL
for home and that is it so now let's
check it out
if I click log out you have been logged
out and we are in fact logged out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
