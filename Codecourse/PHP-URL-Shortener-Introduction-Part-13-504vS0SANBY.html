shortener with PHP so let's take a look
at how this works if I don't enter
anything into here we have validation so
whether you enter an incorrect URL you
don't into something will get this
something wrong message back now if we
do try to enter an incorrect URL we do
have front-end validation here because
I've set the type of this input to URL
so in browsers that support this we will
actually get that front-end validation
otherwise PHP will handle the validation
for us in the backend
so let's enter a valid URL and go ahead
and click shorten and you can see that
we have a short URL generated now at the
moment this URL isn't very short that's
just because I'm using localhost at this
specific port and I have this buried in
a few levels deep so normally you would
see HTTP colon forward slash forward
slash your domain and then forward slash
with this ID here and when I copy and
paste this somewhere or I click on it
that will direct me back to the website
as intended now if we take a look inside
of the database now we have this links
table that's the only table that we're
going to be dealing with you can see
that we have the URL stored and we also
have the code store that you can just
see here now if I enter the same URL
again what's going to happen is we don't
actually generate a new short code and
the reason being is that if we would do
so we would have lots of the same URL
with different codes in our database
table and that's inefficient because we
don't want to keep storing things where
we already have a code available so this
URL shortener is going to work what if
the code already exists it will return
it so it doesn't actually need to insert
any more data so that's the URL
shortener we'll be going ahead and
building the styling for this and then
we'll go ahead and look at building the
back end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
