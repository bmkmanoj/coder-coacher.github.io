really and we need to send an email to a
user when they register so we're gonna
be creating a registered view which is
gonna act as our email we're gonna be
creating a mailer class which sends out
an email and allows us to do that really
easily within our route so we don't have
to write too much code in there and get
make everything messy and we're going to
be using PHP mailer for this and we're
gonna be connecting to an SMTP server to
be able to send the email and the later
on we can add email activation by
sending an email to a user and allowing
them to click a link to activate their
account so I have my email client up
here which is just google mail and I'm
currently logged in so I need to lock
myself out to be able to register again
so if you need to do this you just want
to bring up your chrome developer tools
or whichever tools that you're using via
your web browser and under cookies and
localhost you just want to get rid of
that PHP session ID refresh and you're
back to the original state of being
signed out so let's head over to the
register view I'm gonna register in a
moment but we're gonna build up this
mail functionality first of all so
remember at the start of the series we
pulled in PHP mailer as a dependency in
our project we now need to add this to
our container so if we come down here
and create a singleton and we're going
to call this mail and remember we want
to put a pin that scope here we're gonna
set up a new PHP mailer instance we're
going to add the configuration to it and
then we're going to return a new mailer
object which we're going to build
ourselves the reason that we're building
this mail object in ourselves is so we
can use that nice functionality to be
able to send an email we don't have to
rely on the standard way of sending
email with PHP mailer and this also
means you can switch PHP mailer out for
any other way of sending email and you
can modify that original class
or create a new cast to handle that so
let's get on with this and we'll see how
we get on so I'm going to create a
mailer
variable here that's going to be a new
PHP mailer instance and now we need to
set configuration for this so remember
we have our configuration setup inside
of config development I have the email
address for my Google Mail account and
my password here as well and all the
other information as well like I said
before if you're not using Gmail these
settings will be different but if you
don't test this with these settings you
might just want to set up a Google Mail
account just to test this out so what we
want to do then is part of PHP mailer we
use properties to set our configuration
so we say mailer host is something we
also have whether we're using SMTP
authentication we also have SMTP secure
which is the method of authentication we
have the port we have the username that
will connect into that server with and
we have the password that we're
connecting to that server with so we
know all of this information so the host
comes from our config so we just use the
config object to get mail dot host which
is just pull this up for reference so
it's mail host we can copy and paste
this to save having to type it out again
and again
so that's mail dot SP SMTP auth that
goes in there we have the same thing for
secure so that's SMTP underscore secure
with that option in there TLS we have
the port so it's mail dot port we have
mail dot username and we have mail dot
password so we're nearly there what we
do need to do now is allow HTML email so
I'm gonna say mailer is HTML and this is
a true or false value within this method
so we just say app we can paste this tin
app.config get mail and we have HTML
there so HTML so now what we want to do
is return a new mailer object which we
haven't created yet so return mailer
object we'll do that in just a moment
but we need to create this mailer object
so under code course because we want all
these to be auto loaded in there part of
our project we want to create a new mail
directory so let's create a new mail
folder there and inside of here we're
gonna have a mailer class we namespace
this on the code course mail and our
class is called mailer
so the way this is going to work is
let's just actually take a look at the
syntax of how we want this to work first
of all that will help us build up the
class and kind of know what we're doing
so if we head over to our roots and come
under register what we want to do is if
the remember if the validation passes we
create a user at this point we want to
send an email and this is going to look
like this app mail which is remember the
mail object in our container and then we
want to say send we want to choose the
view that we want to use so we're going
to be storing our email contents in view
as well we're not going to be writing
all the content out within each root
because that's kind of inefficient we
want to have a view that's contains all
the data so for example it will be email
or register dot PHP and then we want to
be able to send through any variables to
that view so think of the view just as a
normal view but we don't see it we just
send it as an email and then what we
have is a call back just here and that
allows us to define our
message and what we do in here is we say
message two and in this case we could
say something like user email because
user isn't in this scope we could just
say use user and then we could say
something like message subject thanks
for registering so this syntax although
it seems a little bit complicated at
first can actually be quite powerful and
it's actually easier to remember and it
allows us to keep things nice and clean
by not having to write out loads of text
content inside of here we just pick the
view that we want to send we attach data
in an array so for example you could say
something like user and pass that user
object to that view and then you could
pick out their first name or last name
or whatever you want to do we then build
up the message like this so this might
seem like it's gonna be really
complicated to build all of this
functionality it's not actually going to
be that difficult
so it's common this out for now because
it doesn't work we need to build up our
mailer class so to be able to send an
email
we need the package reusing to send an
email which is done mailer so let's
create a mailer property at the top here
and we also have a view or an ability to
render views and that's how slim view so
as part of this mailer we inject the
mailer as a dependency and we check
inject the ability to render views so
that's view and mailer so in here we
want to say this mailer equals mailer
we've already seen dependency injection
throughout the series so we should have
know how this works now so we have these
two here so let's just move this one
above here and let's just move this
above here just so they're in the right
order okay so now what we want to do is
implement that send method so remember
over here we have a send method on mail
in fact before that we'll just pass in
or return a new mailer and yeah so we're
returning a new mail which is this class
here but we need to pass in ability to
specify a view and the actual mailer
itself so within here how do we do that
well what we need to do is we need to
say app view this is Slim's way of
rendering views which we've already seen
we're using twig and we pass in the
mailer here so this is how we send the
email asking it through and this is how
we render views passing it through
because remember our email is a view so
mail it is namespace two up here we're
gonna say use code course mail mailer
and let's just put this up here rather
here just then neatly lined up and let's
create that send method so remember to
be able to send what we do is we pass in
a view we pass in data and we pass in a
callback which then attaches the user's
email and the subject and things like
that so we have the template that we
want to render inside of the email data
that we want to pass through to that
template and the callback function so
what we need to do now then is when we
actually send a message we need to
specify who we're sending the email to
and the subject and that's going to come
from our message class which we haven't
created so we're splitting this up just
so we're separating the concerns of this
the message classes role is to build up
a message unique to whatever package
we're using to send email and this means
that we shouldn't have to modify the
mailer class we should only have to
modify the message class so let's build
this class now it lives in that folder
mail so we're gonna namespace under code
course mail and the class is message so
the
message class then is essentially its
job is to deal with sending or building
up the email so to do this we need our
package as a dependency mailer and I'll
tell you why we're doing this a little
bit more about why we're doing this in
just a moment we have a construct on
here to injects that dependency and we
set this mailer to mailer and this is
where we're going to have functionality
like - we're gonna have functionality
like setting the subject and also
setting the body now as I mentioned I'm
going to explain why we're doing this
mailer when we send a message
shouldn't have to change we shouldn't
have to modify this class at all because
what we're doing is we're passing in
which Manor were using that's gonna get
passed off to message which is then
responsible for building up who the
email is to the subject the body
regardless of this is regardless of what
sort of mail package we're using to send
email but this does concern so if we
were to change who we're sending email
with so if we were to change PHP mailer
for something else we could just modify
this class or create a new type of class
in this case we're just assuming we're
sticking with PHP mailer you can modify
this to build up the email in the way
specific to that package
anyway let's carry on with this so to
send an email to someone we want to
provide an address to provide a subject
we need a subject and for the body we
need a body so how do we define within
PHP mailer how we're sending an email or
who we're sending an email to all we do
is we say this mailer which is remember
PHP mailer we say add address
and we pass that address in and you
could also even include their name and
then PHP mailer lets you attach their
name as well this we just need to change
within here so it's you know whatever
you want to do but we won't include it
for now okay so for the subject it's
pretty much the same thing we just say
this mailer but this time it's just a
property subject and then we assign that
subject and then body it's exactly the
same thing mailer body equals body and
we're not using body within let's go
back to register we're not using body
within here but we are using turn
subjects the reason we're not using body
within theirs because women use body
within send because that is how we grab
our template and set the body of the
email so on the message then this is
pretty much done what we need to do
under mailer now is create a new message
instance so it's a message new message
we pass in this mailer which then goes
through to here as the address adds the
subject adds the body when we need to
message needs to be or it doesn't
actually need to be imported because
it's in the same folder here so what is
the next step then because we're not too
far off getting this done now we need to
append the data to the view that we've
passed in so what we do is we say this
view append beta and we pass in the data
that we pass in to the send method which
is here so send we specify the template
we specify the data and then we have a
callback which we'll see how that works
the minute
it's a repenting data to view now we
want to say message body and that's from
our message class remember but how do we
get the body of the email well that's
just rendering the template that we pass
in here so we need to do is say this
view render we've already seen the
render method before so we know how
things are rendered as in normal views
but this time we're passing in the
location to the template which is then
putting that template in the body now we
need to call the closure here along with
the message here so it can build up them
or it can use them functions or their
methods so we use Col user func for this
we're calling the callback with that
message so essentially what happens here
is when we call the send method we can I
guess uncomment this just for now when
we call the same method we pass in the
template we pass in the data and we pass
in a callback so at the template level
we know how this works now we append
data to our view and we set the body
from the rendered template and then we
call the callback which uses the two
method and subject we have a message
argument in here which then calls the
methods here to in subject sets them and
then we can go ahead and send the email
so we just say this mailer
send an idea that is how we're going to
send emails we're all done so what we
can do now is actually create that
template for the message we're sending
so it's e email or three gesture dot PHP
so if you haven't already written this
out at mail send you want to go ahead
and write this out now so we just have
the template data and the callback using
user so we can actually set that
appropriately so let's create this view
then so under views I'm going to create
a new folder called email and inside of
here I'm gonna create a new folder a new
file called off and then I'm gonna
create a new file called register dot
PHP this is the email contents so
because this is a twig template we can
extend a
an email template exactly as we did with
our normal templates so what we're going
to do is we can just test this out for
now you have registered and we can go
and register now let's say tabby code of
course comm will make sure that database
record is removed we can enter a
username password register
okay so undefined variable user in
register dot PHP on line 32 let's just
check this out on line 32 okay so what
we're doing here is we're passing
through user but it doesn't obviously
doesn't exist when we create a record as
long as it was successful if we assign
it the value to a particular variable
we'll get all of that information back
so we can pass that data through to that
view so let's try this just once more
let's delete this record here let's give
that a username and a password hit
register and there we go you have been
registered now we can head over to our
email client and we see this is from
root user but that's just because Gmail
knows I'm sending it from the same email
address or authenticated I'm sending it
from tabut code course com2 tabby echo
course com but now we see thanks for
registering and we see you have
registered so this is our view this is
what we defined in that callback and
we're all good to go
so now what we can do is focus on email
templates to build up a common template
for all of our emails so we can greet
the user maybe within that template or
add a really nice design to it or
anything like that so let's jump on in
the next video and look at building up
nice templates within our emails</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
