is a lot better but still we already
know that we're going to run into
problems later we need lots of events
for lots of models so we solve this with
model observers and we're going to take
a look behind the scenes in aravill as
well to look at kind of how this works
so when we generate an observer we can
actually do this on the command line
laravel doesn't have a command to
generate a model observer so we have to
kind of do this manually but it's not
too much trouble because really all it
is is substituting this callback for a
particular class so in the app directory
what I would typically do and I think
this is the out in the manual as well is
create an observers folder now inside of
here I would create an individual
observer for each type of model now in
this case we have a topic so we would
create a topic observer but in the case
of anything else I post a user you can
do exactly the same thing so we won't be
covering that but once you know how to
do this you know how to do it for any
model you need so let's set up the main
space so it's now on the app and
observers and let's go ahead and fill
this in so topic observer and we're done
so now to actually register this
observer before we create any methods on
here how do we do this well let's go
ahead and get rid of this instead what
we do is we use observe so what we're
now doing is we are replacing this with
the full class path so in this case you
can either import this at the top or say
something like app observers and then
say topic observer now if you were going
ahead and doing this for a user you may
do this following so user and the user
observer maybe you have a post you would
do exactly the same thing you kind of
get the idea the only difference now
though is that however many we register
of these in here it really doesn't
matter too much because we're not adding
all of our logic in here as well as our
individual observers so this makes
things a little bit cleaner it's
unlikely that you're going to have
hundreds of models so really this keeps
things nice and tidy so we're at the
point where we have an eloquent event
service provider completely separate
provider and now we're linking this to a
class so what do we do over in this
class well we just do the same thing but
we define these out as methods it's as
simple as that we're just replacing the
method call that we did earlier with a
class with individual methods so in our
case we would say creating we again
receive a topic into this and we can
type int this as well for a little bit
of strict checking so let's go ahead and
use app topic and then in here we just
do exactly what we want to do but now we
can do anything in here and it doesn't
really matter because we're in a
separate class so in this case all I
would want to do is say topic and set
the slug and just before we do this
let's go ahead and die dump on the topic
just so we can see that this does
actually work so we've set this up all
looks good and we can come over and
check this out give that a refresh and
we get that topic again now if we come
over to the model that we extend when we
create any models this is again part of
the laravel framework and we check out
this observe method let's take a look at
this you can see here that we obviously
pass in that class that we've just
defined and then in this case we are
checking if the event that we're
listening on so in here we are using get
observable events let's just take a look
at this so these are all of the
observable events within laravel so we
can use any of these if we need to so
back to the observe method in the same
class iterating through each of them
observable events if that particular
method exists on the observer that we've
created so for example if a topic is
being restored maybe so we would have a
restored method if it is being restored
but the method doesn't exist there's no
point registering an observer for it and
we register the event just here so again
this is in the same class so we can just
come over to this and all this is doing
is listening for eloquent dot the name
of the event and then going ahead and
running what we've defined inside of
these methods so have a really good look
through this if you are interested in
kind of diving into the the scenes
behind the scenes of any of these
classes within zara it's always a good
idea to do either way we kind of know
how this works now if saya topic is
being created and the observes that
we've registered exists
or the method on the observer we've
registered exists then we know we're
going to run it so in this case then
let's go ahead and say topic slug set
this to STR slug passing in the topic
title it just works in exactly the same
way and we are done so now come over
here give that a refresh and I ruin the
database we get what we need so we
finally ended up at this kind of
solution and this is the best solution
because it allows us to write as much as
logic or code in here that we need to go
ahead and separate it out from either
our app service provider or in fact this
provider here so I think for smaller
applications there's nothing wrong with
doing topic creating in here and passing
in a closure I wouldn't say don't do
that but if things start to get a little
bit crazy break these out into observers
or if you're kind of looking ahead to
the future go ahead and create an
observer now just to keep things easy to
update later on either way that is just
a really simple idea of setting a slug
for a topic every time we create it but
of course now you're free to do anything
you like and of course if you need to
remind yourselves of what is being
observed so what's being listened to all
the different events then of course you
can come over to here follow it down and
we know that we have this get observable
events methods so we can go in just open
this and check these out just here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
