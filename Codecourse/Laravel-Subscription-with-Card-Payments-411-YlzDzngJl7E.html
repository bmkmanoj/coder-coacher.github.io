going to look at templating within
laravel and the actual template that
we're going to set up and this will give
us a clue as to the kind of things that
we're going to be doing so the first
thing that I'm going to do is inside of
my views folder I'm going to create
another folder called template now you
might have just seen a moment ago we're
actually going to be using the
foundation front-end framework to
generate things like buttons forms this
is entirely optional you don't have to
use foundation you may already have your
own design already set up and trying to
integrating this into your own project
so don't worry if you don't use
foundation we're just going to brush
over it so inside of my CSS file you can
actually see I've included the
foundation but Mindel CSS file and I've
also included a custom style sheet and
this custom style sheets just reset one
of the foundation CSS properties and
I've also created this wrapper element
which is going to give us a margin of 20
pixels around our content again this is
entirely optional so feel free to ignore
it if you already have your own stars
so inside template we're just going to
create one template here this is going
to be called default blade PHP and it's
basically just going to be a normal
document layout I'm going to change the
title here and I'm going to indent this
it's the inside of the body we're going
to need that wrapper that I created a
moment ago this is just going to wrap
the content throughout our entire site
and then in here we're going to yield in
any content that we pass to this now we
need to link in our stylesheet so let's
do that now so the link to this will be
the asset helper and it'll be CSS
foundation min dot CSS and then I also
want to load in the custom Star sheet I
created as well now we need to load in
jQuery as well here so let's do this now
and I'm doing this from Google hosted
libraries so the URL looks a little bit
different to what you might expect this
just means it's a little bit faster and
may already be cached for some users now
what you also want to
down here is I want to yield in any
custom script but I pass from any of the
templates that extend this default
template so that's pretty much our
template let's just check that it works
by creating a test view in here we'll
call this test blade of PHP so let's
extend template dot default and here
let's have a section called content and
we'll stop that there and we'll have a
similar thing for our script as well so
in here we could just you know generate
some kind of empty script and in the
content let's just say hello so over in
routes let's just return view make test
and if this hasn't made sense you'll see
exactly why I've done all this we've got
hello there if we just view the page
source here you can see that we've got
the script down here that's been yielded
in we've also got the content in here
which is evident here that's also been
yielded in we've obviously got our star
sheets linked in here too so that's
basically how we create our template
we're going to be using this throughout
the entire series but obviously if you
have your own template that's absolutely
fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
