which basically follows flat design
trends we've got this gray background
with no border so not having adding any
harsh lines here and we've also got this
border on the bottom here and if we just
zoom in you can see that this is curved
slightly and it almost gives a 3d effect
while still maintaining that flat design
look so we're going to be building this
from scratch it's extremely easy we only
really need a few lines of CSS to
achieve this let's go ahead and do it
okay so we'll start by creating our
container notice that I've got this
index.html file open I've got a global
stylesheet here with nothing in it at
all and that's obviously linked in from
my markup so let's create a div for the
class of container so we can reuse this
star wherever we want
obviously this might vary depending on
which design you're working with or your
project but generally you want to make
sure that your stars are as reusable as
possible so I'm just going to call this
container and I want to start off by
giving this a background so let's give
this a background of a nice gray color
so I'm going to choose edie e FF 0 let's
put a little bit of content in here just
so we can test out this background and
you can see that we've got this light
background obviously it's a display of
block by default so we are spanning the
entire width of the parent container at
the moment so we'll sort that out by
adding a width I'm going to add a 280
pixel width and I'm going to add a 180
pixel height and then then going to give
this a padding of 10 pixels so we'll end
up with a 200 pixel height and a 300
pixel width so that's the width and the
height sorted we're pretty much almost
done the only final touches we need to
do is give this a border radius I'm
going to give that a border radius of 5
pixels that just round out the edges
nicely if we just zoom in just so we
don't get as harsh a line on the corners
here so the next thing is adding this
border on the bottom so we say border
bottom we choose a fairly large value we
are
to have this solid and we choose a color
that complements the containers color in
this case it's CTC it's just a sort of
gray color and there we go so with them
two properties all we've really done is
we've rounded out the border radius this
sort of looks like a shadow but could be
seen as some kind of 3d element and
obviously of this darker border it just
looks very very nice so that's how we
create a very simple flat design element
with CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
