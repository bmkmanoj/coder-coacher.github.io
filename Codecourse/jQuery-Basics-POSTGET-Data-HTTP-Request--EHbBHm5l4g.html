welcome to this jquery tutorial on HTTP
requests
now HTTP requests usually found in ajax
are a way to pass data to a page process
and then send back that's the overall
process that we're trying to achieve and
it can be very easily done with jQuery
so we're going to be creating a small
application and we're going to be
integrating PHP into it and essentially
what we're going to do is we're going to
provide the user with an input box we're
going to have them enter their name and
as they're typing their name their name
is going to be processed by PHP we're
going to use the STR read function which
reverses our string and as a user types
they're going to have their name fed
back reversed so this is a really basic
example that we're going to be looking
at however after we've done this you can
see that you can utilize the power of it
in other projects and using other
purposes so the first thing we want to
do because we're going to be cool using
event handling we want to put our j func
j s page at the bottom so this is just a
javascript file that I have included and
I have this open here which is currently
blank so all of our work is going to go
in here and this is at the bottom for
the for the purpose that we are using
event handling and we need to have the
elements initiated before we actually
control the events so let's go ahead and
setup our actual page we're going to
have an input type text and we are going
to have the ID of this as name and I
think that's about it yet so this is our
input field I've given it an ID of name
you notice that I haven't used the name
attribute because that's not required in
this case and essentially this looks
like this on a page so we're going to
type our name and here okay
so now what we want to do is we want to
create an event handler for when the
user actually types keys our characters
rather into this text fear
so in jjs we use a dollar sign and then
two brackets inside this we need to
reference the element name which is name
so use hash name and then we say dot and
we have key up so we are this event is
going to take place when the key has
come up from the keyboard and then we
just literally put a line terminator on
the end of that so this is the function
that we are using now inside of this we
need a callback function so we need
function and then we initiate our or
create our block of code that we're
going to run and then we can pull this
down here so we can write everything
else in here
now to test this works we could just say
alert hello and go over to our page
click in here let's type something so a
and you can see that we've got a pay
dialog coming up saying hello let's just
get rid of that and that will bring that
up again okay so now we need to actually
need to grab the user's name now we
actually need to pass this variable to
PHP so we're going to be doing that a
bit later on and we're going to create a
separate PHP file that's going to help
process this so now we need to create a
new variable and I'm going to call that
name and that's going to be equal to
dollar sign and then in here hash name
as we've done up here so we're just
referencing this element on the page we
then say dot Val and then two brackets
so this function here will take the
value from there so now what we can do
is we can say alert in here sorry name
without any single quotation marks and
what this will do is it'll eart back to
us whatever we've typed in so if I type
in a there then a B then a C you can see
that that's just basically replicating
what we've typed and bringing it up as a
dialog box so now what we actually need
to do is we need to pass this to a PHP
page in order to process it and then
send it back and then we're going to
output it to the user so the PHP page is
going to do all the processing now
you might have already noticed that this
is a useful technique the way I've
explained for actually taking user input
and saving things straight to a database
on the same page it all ties in with
each other jQuery is extremely flexible
and easy to use and therefore taking
just this basic concept will allow you
to expand ok so we are going to use a
dollar sign and then a bit of a
difference we're just going to put a dot
and post ok so this is the we're sending
the data that we specify inside of this
here and we're sending this add post
data similarly similarly you can do get
ok what we're going to be using post now
this is going to take three parameters
the first one is the page here that we
want to submit the data to in curly
brackets in the third parameter L the
variable names that we want to pass and
it works like this so variable name and
then value okay
that's basically it obviously this list
I've just written here won't work
because we're not you know we're not
sending something called variable name
however we are going to send a variable
called name and that's going to be equal
to name
now my variable namings made this
slightly confusing
however this variable here is the name
of the variable that we're passing so in
PHP this will be the name of the
variable much like if you were
processing in a form you would send you
would pick this up as the name attribute
on the field so if you're struggling to
understand this then you need to
understand that this is the name of the
variable we're sending and this is the
value here that we're sending so this is
what it's called and this is the value
of it so the name is the name here that
the users typed in the third is a
callback function so we have a callback
function in a callback function and this
is this function we need to bracket to
get two curly braces again and again
we're going to pull this down slightly
okay so in here is what we're going to
send back now let's choose a file that
we're going to send this to
a tutu I'm going to create a new file in
my text editor and i'm going to save
this oops okay so i'm going to save this
in a foot in a folder called PHP and i'm
going to see this as a process
underscore named PHP so now our
directory structure is as follows we
have index dot PHP which we are working
on over here we then have j s where our
j funky is now jQuery files are located
and we have PHP which is where we're
going to process the data so PHP and
process name dot PHP so enjoy funky is
in here we can write PHP forward slash
process underscore name dot PHP so we're
sending this value here to this file
here so this is the value with a
variable name name which we can pick up
in PHP then we have a function here and
anything we want to do in the callback
in here and if you haven't already looks
at callbacks there is a tutorial in this
series if you haven't already watched it
now there is an a slight difference we
need to make with this callback function
we need to provide a variable name of
the data that's going to be processed or
rather output back from this process
name dot PHP so let's let's go forward
data we'll just call it data so
essentially what we're going to be doing
in here
is we're going to be this will
automatically process for us depending
on what the user has typed into the
field here and this very of this data
variable will actually be the result of
this far here so if we were to echo
hello hello would then be contained
within this data variable so hopefully
that makes sense okay so we're going to
skip actually know we'll continue with
the J func jes file we are essentially
just going to output this data variable
because we're going to process the name
and then just echo something inside this
file which is then going to be sent back
into data
so inside index dot PHP we need to
create a diff area
going to accommodate for this text so
I'm going to call this name feedback
okay
so this is the feedback that's taken
from our file ok so inside here we now
can say dollar and then it here hash
name underscore feedback dot HTML
remember we looked at this in a couple
of videos back and then we are going to
say beta okay so whatever is echoed out
in process name is sent and then put
into named feedback div down here so now
that we've grasped the overall concept
of the jQuery processing we need to go
into process name dot PHP and just write
out a couple of lines that are going to
process this name and then echo back a
result so remember the variable name is
called name
so inside process name dot PHP we can
create an if statement just to check
whether we have got this value so dollar
underscore post name so this variable
name here corresponds to this here and
then the value of this will be this here
so the value of the what's been typed
inside of this box okay so if it is set
then we need to what I'm going to create
a new variable it's really a waste of a
variable space but it doesn't matter
dollar underscore post name so if it is
set we give it a variable called name
and then we can just echo out STR Rev
which is a function built into PHP
already which just reverses a string and
then name that's all we need to do so
before we test it in our browser and
have a look at what the result is let's
go ahead and just catch up and ourselves
and look at the process again so the
user typed something in this text field
here J funk J s picks up on the key up
event so when the user types a character
and then releases the key a function
call back function will be created and
that callback function is all of this
here inside here we then set a variable
called name to the value of the field
that we're typing into so that's using
dot eval function in jQuery
we then use an HTTP request and we're
posting our data we're not using get and
we're posting this data to PHP forward
slash process name dot PHP which we
created earlier we're sending a variable
to this PHP script called name which is
a post variable with the value name
which we've already created up here and
then we're creating another callback
function but this time we are taking
into account the results fed back from
this page here and then we're just
echoing out if you like the results into
this div but we're actually using the
HTML function to a pen or not a pen but
insert this data that's fed back into
the div so hopefully that makes sense to
you if it doesn't then go over your code
see how it works try and change things
around a bit and try and get the hang of
it let's go ahead and test it to see if
it works
so I'm just going to start typing a now
you can see that immediately we've been
fed back a now this result here is
actually from the PHP file so we now
know that PHP is successfully taken into
account our variable and it's processed
and sent it back so now as I start
typing you can see that we actually fed
back the result from the PHP far as a
result of the STR Rev function in PHP so
whatever we type here is just going to
be automatically reversed so obviously
this functionality of reversing a string
upon typing it is pointless but you can
start to see the useful nature of HTTP
requests in jQuery because we're typing
text and we're actually feeding back
something in PHP now this process name
dot PHP file could do anything it could
be taking values from a database a nice
example to mention is let's say this
value here is a password validation tool
for example we want say we wanted the
password to be greater than 6 characters
but no more than say 16 characters and
we wanted it to also contain special
characters as we type a password here
PHP can actually process this and you
can do a variety of if statements or
function
or however you would do such a thing in
PHP and then we can get live information
fed back to us another great example is
the username availability if you have
usernames stored in your database you
might like to use this functionality for
the user to enter a username and it
automatically check whether that
username is available now for this you
might want not want to use an event
handler on KeyUp you might want to
create a button here which actually then
calls this function the functionality
that we've created and you may want to
use a function in JavaScript for that
and you would place your function in Jay
func Jes so hopefully that makes sense
this is a repo awful way of using HTTP
requests extremely easy and really
effective with jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
