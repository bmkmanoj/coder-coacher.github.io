little bit different than bourbon and
meet in the fact in the way that they do
give you output CSS from the on the
start and what they do is you can think
of it kind of as you know in like
bootstraps CSS properties it's gonna
define the style sphere of your forms
here your tables and you know your other
things your code sub stuff all of these
different types of things blockquote
that need styling and even down to
things like flash messages your
headlines buttons and you know things
like that so let's install what does
this oh this is the wrong place let's
install bitters when I say sudo Jim
install bitters
cool successful so we're already in on
plugins directory and I'm gonna say
bitters install bitters files installed
to slash bitters great so when I go back
to my plugins directory I see bitters is
there I should go to my plugins
directory file and say at import bitters
/ bitters now a word about bitters it
doesn't include a reset or normalize
which I'm gonna do myself
I finally minified and normalize and
create a new file click normalize dot
that CSS and I'm gonna make it s CSS so
I could just paste it in and save and
I'm gonna import it here at - done okay
cool
and Ruby tells me that plugins oh I
spelt normalize don't care nor Alliance
there we go and okay we're all good my
output app CSS is gonna have normalized
in it and actually that was my this is
the code from my my my bourbon neat grid
so let's turn that off
visual grid off a false and I'll go back
to a fire okay good
okay our resulting rendered CSS will
have normalized at the top and then did
we import bourbon already I'm sorry do
we import bitters okay bitters and then
after normalize will have bitters which
will be styling for you know things like
Mara H ones are gonna be health edit cut
you know text rendering all these kind
of things that we want to make sure we
do but they're just kind of so tedious
and to do an especially if you go
project a project pretty quickly there's
going to be great
baseline for us to start from now
bidders is going to have a variable
sheet where we can go in and remember
bourbon had Helvetica what if we change
this to mono
is it my own amount of space in a small
space no it'll be above it it's fun huh
cool that would be for the whole site so
our variable she is really powerful and
you can out and you can define the
different colors that are going to be
used like the base text link color you
know the borders and also you can define
what's going to be used in bidders to
set the basis for the profile or for all
of your defaults so the in the example
here we have you know the headings
paragraphs list styles form elements all
this stuff is the stuff is gonna is
gonna be styled and look great it's like
the the base the baseline standardized
styling so for any new element you want
to add a form it's gonna look good it's
not gonna look like the default browser
styles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
