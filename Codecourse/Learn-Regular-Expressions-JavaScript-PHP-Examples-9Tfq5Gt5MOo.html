feel free to skip this video we're not
going to be looking at anything new for
the regular expressions I'm just going
to be demonstrating how to use regular
expressions within PHP and we'll also
look at how we can do it in JavaScript
so here we have this PHP file I'm going
to create a regular expression variable
and I'm going to set that to I will use
the example from last time so we'll set
test and we'll have our group add edy
and Inge and we'll make that optional
and then what we're going to do is we're
going to say match equals preg match and
if I remember rightly the regex comes
first
and then the string and we need to make
the string up here so we're going to
first set the string to I will set it to
testing and then down here we're going
to say if match then echo matched so
let's look at this in a browser a
delimiter ok we need to add a delimiter
I forgot about that so we didn't need to
do this on the Reg exercise because it
does it automatically so the way that we
do that is just fold slash on each side
and we can also use pound signs but I
prefer the the slashes so let's have one
more try and there we go we get match
let's change this to tested match tester
match and finally test so now I'm going
to set the string to something totally
different hit refresh and we don't get
matched so now I created a JavaScript
file and I've just created a self
invoking function and I've created a
string variable and I've also included
this inside of my index file so of
course if we I also opened my developer
tools so if we refresh here now we're
not going to get anything
because we haven't done anything in this
file let's just check that this is
working so console dot log test and
there we go we get out our test message
so let's get rid of that and actually
match some expressions so let's create a
conditional statement and we're going to
say string dot match so if string dot
match and inside here we insert our
expression so let's skip that for now
and just log a message string matches
now in JavaScript unlike PHP we don't
need to have our regular expression
inside quotes so if I add my delimiters
and just enter a string like hello hit
refresh and there we go we get our
string matches if we change this to
something like 1 2 3 4 5 and set our
regular expression to a range of 0 to 5
then we're going to get string matches
because it's matching these characters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
