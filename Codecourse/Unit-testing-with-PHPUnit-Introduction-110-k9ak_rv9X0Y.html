absolutely no idea what unit testing is
or you just need a quick refresher then
this course is going to cover pretty
much everything you need to know about
getting started with testing so in this
part I'm just going to talk about what
unit testing is and then throughout the
course you'll learn how to actually get
started with PHP unit which is a popular
PHP testing package now there are other
packages available that PHP unit is so
widely used and it's a really great
starting point as well as great for what
we're actually looking at in this course
which is unit testing the first thing
though what actually is unit testing
let's take a look at a Wikipedia
definition and this says that unit
testing is a software testing method by
which individual units of source code
are tested to determine whether they are
fit for use so translate it from this a
little bit formal description this
basically means that you're not testing
the user flowing through your site
you're not testing entire controllers
where you'd maybe use lots of different
units to do what you need but you test
individual parts of your code so this is
like different classes very very small
units of code so the smallest parts of
your code we're going to look at testing
now this then makes it easier to go on
and use these different units knowing
that each individual unit works and then
later on you can look at other styles of
testing like acceptance testing which
will test the flow through what you've
built so in this case it's our business
logic which basically means how it
should work from a user's point of view
and you can also test everything maybe
in a controller which is commonly
referred to as integration testing so
either way we're covering unit testing
which is super important and once you
know that the smallest parts of your
application are working you'll be more
confident that your application will
work when you bring these components
together so just quickly and once again
from Wikipedia it says here that the
goal of unit testing is to isolate each
part of the program and show that the
individual parts are correct which is a
much clearer better description so what
we're going to be building in this
course a three small project
each of them getting more complex as we
go so we'll cover different things that
we can test for and you'll be able to
start writing your own tests after that
for any application that you build now
we're also going to be looking at
test-driven development or TDD which is
a style of testing where we write tests
before we write any code at all now this
might seem a little bit odd but it gives
us the opportunity to think about how we
want things to work before we start
writing any code and we'll be following
the cycle of writing tests seeing that
they fail because maybe we don't have
any code then writing the code to make
them pass and then refactoring our code
to make sure they still pass and we'll
be just constantly running our tests
along the way so I've tried to make this
as fun and practical as possible so
let's go and have some fun with unit
testing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
