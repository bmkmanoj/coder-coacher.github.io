selecting data from our database using
different fetch ways of fetching data
and counting the data using the native
PHP count function or actually going to
do now is look at the row count method
and basically all this is going to do is
it's going to allow us to slit a check
whether we actually have a an amount of
count amount of Records and it will
count them for us and then we can
perform an action based on that so you
can see at the moment I've just created
a queries and the query method and
that's just select staff and guestbook
the query works nothing happens at the
moment and what we can actually do is
rather than use the fetch all method so
earlier on what we looked at was saying
results equals query fetch all and in
here we can say PDO fetch I'd know
associative array for example and then
we can do a print our own results and
you'll see here whether we'll get all of
the results back from our database now
this isn't it was feasible what we might
want to do is we might want to check the
row count and then go ahead and loop
through this data so what we can do is
we can say if query row count so using
the row count method on this query here
as part of the actual query that's been
executed then we have results otherwise
echo no results and we'll test that out
in a moment so what we can do here is
we'll just echo out results okay so at
the moment this should return an in a
positive integer so we can actually go
ahead and just echo query row count out
just to prove that we're getting back
number four which is we have four
records in our database so that's that
that works and so it here we could say
we could go ahead and say while our
equals
query fetch
video fetch object for example echo our
message as an example so that would then
go ahead and loop through and output the
results if we have no results so if we
say stick a limit 0 on the M which will
basically just force this return nothing
it will show us no results so that's
just a quick and easy way to detect
whether you actually have any results
and this looks a lot cleaner we can
implement this within our if statement
loop through the results if we have
results and otherwise just return a
message to the user to say that Novas
always exists</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
