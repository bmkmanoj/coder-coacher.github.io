going to look at hashing a password
using the password hash function and
this is part of the password hashing API
in PHP so although this is fairly easy
to just go ahead and use it will
actually be looking at some of the
options we can supply so we can properly
understand how this works and we'll be
looking at examples or options like how
to provide a salt and the algorithmic
cost of actually generating the hash so
let's take a look at first what the
function actually looks like so I'll go
ahead and over my text editor so let's
go ahead and just echo out the result of
this so before we were looking at
examples up with md5 so we can just
provide something like md5 and then a
string in there we're going to look at
pretty much the same thing but we're
going to do password underscore hash so
this is a func this is a function part
of the PHP password hashing API so let's
go ahead and provide a string in here
we'll just be using password as the as
the string and we'll go ahead and would
probably expect to see this hash but we
will actually get this warning and this
says it expects at least two parameters
one given now that other parameter that
we need to pass to this is the algorithm
that we actually want to use so we've
not provided this constant to this
function so we need to discuss which two
at the moment we can use so we've got
two options
password default oops
password default and what this will do
is it will take the default hashing
algorithm that PHP uses and this is
subject to change every time we'll talk
about this in just a moment the other
one that we can use is M crypt and this
is the m crypt algorithm which uses the
Blowfish cipher so let's take a look at
the two in action so let's go back to
password default and we'll actually see
what the hash actually looks like so you
can see it is a little bit more
complicated than what you would expect
to get from back from md5 and also with
the same string when I go ahead and
refresh we actually get a different
value each time
this is still at the same length of 60
characters and we'll discuss the
implications of that in a minute so we
can see that when we refresh we get hash
that looks like this let's go ahead and
change over to bcrypt and see if this of
changes significantly or not okay so you
can see that it hasn't really changed
significantly and that's because we're
actually using you know the same
algorithm here now we can tell which
algorithm we're using by looking at the
start of this actual hash and this hash
contains a lot of information about this
that may not be obvious at first now
this image from the PHP documentation of
the PHP manual shows us the different
parts of this hash and we can see here
that we've got an algorithm identifier
at the start in this case it's dollar 2y
dollar and that's what we're using at
the moment we've also got the cost which
we'll talk about in a moment the salt
which we'll also talk about and the
actual hashed password at the end here
so everything about the actual hash
itself or the options for the hash which
is this are stored within this hash if
you like here you can just I guess you
can just refer to this as a hash so if
you use password default what's the
difference well let's go ahead and just
take a look at password default and
we'll go ahead and we use STR Len to get
the string length for this and you can
see that this is 60 so however many
times I refresh this is always 60 and
that's just the you know that's just
nature of hashes it will generate the
same length so what's the problem here
well basically if you use password
default your let you're sort of opening
yourself up to changes when PHP is
updated and this algorithms changed and
that means that you should probably go
ahead and store these password values in
a in a 255 character which is
recommended column in your database
instead of just 60 because obviously the
last thing you want is to be truncating
password hashes and not allowing people
to sign in once they've registered so
we've looked at the fact that this is a
string length of 60 now what we'll do is
we'll go ahead and look at some of the
options we can provide here and we
already know that we've got out of hash
if you like this generated contain some
of these options so we'll go ahead and
change these and talk about what we're
changing and why maybe we shouldn't
change some of them so let's first of
all look at the salt now if you don't
provide a salt to this function it's
automatically generated for you however
you can go ahead and we can provide an
array as the third parameter to this
function and we can go ahead and it's an
associative array with values based on
what you want to change so well first of
all discuss the salt and we'll see how
how this actually works let's just bring
this down a little bit it's a little bit
easier to read okay so we can go ahead
and provide a salt ourselves so there is
no need to actually provide one for
yourself that's really really important
to understand with this you might be
thinking all you know this isn't secure
because I'm not providing a salt nor
storing a salt separately salts are
stored within the hash so we've seen
this from this image so there's no need
to provide your own salt that's really
really important and it can actually be
worse if you do provide your own soul so
this is really really great that it does
generate a salt for you because it means
that you don't need to store so in a
separate database column in your
database you don't need to put it out
separately or construct queries to
combine it before you go ahead and sign
a user in the password verify function
takes all of the work out of this so
this it'll pick up the salt that's
stored within this value and we'll be
looking at that in the next video so
let's go ahead and provide a test salt
let's just type tests in there and we'll
see what problems we we see with this it
says provided salt is too short at four
characters expecting 22 so the expected
value of the salt is 22 so let's just do
something bigger than 22 it will go
ahead and truncate this for us but we
can now see that when we refresh we've
actually got this salt here provided in
there in here now the reason it's at 22
is as you can see this here it's a
little
misleading we've got a dot here but this
dassault is always 22 characters this is
22 characters there for anything after
that is the hashed password so although
you know there's no identify to say this
is the hash this is the hash pass this
is the salt this is the hash password
it's 22 characters so up to there is the
salt we we know that because we can see
we've entered a value ourselves but
obviously in this case it's not a good
idea to provide your own salt and why is
it not a good idea to provide your own
salt
now the PHP password hashing API is
there for a reason and it takes all of
the sort of difficult security tasks
like generating a truly random you know
salt and then it you know it does it for
you
so really unless it's absolutely
required there's no need to go ahead and
provide your own salt because you know
all the works been done for you already
it securely generates this random salt
so you're better off letting the
functionality that's been built
specifically just to handle this for you
unless you can think of a scenario where
you would need to provide the salt so
we've looked at salt now let's go ahead
and look at the algorithmic cost so the
algorithm if the algorithmic cost is an
integer and by default this is ten so
although you can't see that it's ten
it's actually 10 and oh actually yet we
can see this is ten by this value here
so we know that this is the salt this
ten value here so here is ten so we can
go ahead and actually provide this in
the options as well just as a often
off-topic but you can actually provide a
salt and the cost in here as well if you
absolutely needed to but let's go ahead
and just talk about the cost now it's by
default is 10 so when I go ahead and
refresh here you know just sort of
refreshes and regenerates a hash now as
we increase this value you actually
start to see depending on your hardware
a slower page load time you can see that
twelves been updated there as well now
all this cost is is it's the is it's the
expense that's used to actually generate
this hash
so obviously the the more you know round
it does or water
you get a stronger hash due to more
Hardware power generating something
that's harder to crack so taking this
value up to something like 14 you can
see that on my computer there's a lot of
heart it's significantly longer to load
when i refresh it takes a couple of
seconds so taking this value up
something like 14 you can see there's a
much larger delay yes that means a
secure hash however do you really want
to make your users wait around or cause
too much load on your server if 10 is
all that your hardware can handle that's
perfectly acceptable and you know it it
can just be tweaked however but 10 is
obviously the default and this should be
absolutely fine so the value that we've
generated here is now good enough to go
ahead and store within a database
alongside all of the other user
information you collect so user name
email or whatever you can go ahead and
you can store this in a single column in
your database bearing in mind the length
of the column depending on which
algorithm you're using as we've already
said it's probably best to just go ahead
and use password bcrypt you know that
that's going to be 60 characters now
always and you can go ahead and increase
the cost to however much you think your
hardware can handle so now I feel
comfortable I can go ahead and store
this in the password field in my
database table and in the next video
we'll look at how to check this hash
against a plaintext value in the next
part
so that will then go ahead and just
verify that against a plaintext value
and tell us if the hash matches or not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
