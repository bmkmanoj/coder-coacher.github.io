in this video I'll be covering how to
force a download so as you can see if we
look over in our HT index dot HTML page
it's just a very basic HTML page
it's html5 even they would answer
doctype setup and and you'll see we've
got a head section really don't really
need anything in there never got the
body and inside the body section we are
just going to add an anchor tag so I
hate ref and then we're going to just do
download HTML and then from there we
have one attribute to do which is going
to be download people to true and the
reason why we haven't downloaded sequel
to true is if it's so that we can fast
for download of whatever page it links
to
but normally when you have a HTML page
it'll load it up in a browser and I'll
show you that first actually so leave
that there and then just do if we
download a page inside and close the
anchor tag save that if we refresh this
page you'll see we get a link and inside
I'll download the HTML page which you
need to create I've just got the same
setup but inside the body tag I've got a
simple simple statement just so we can
see if it's different page so refresh
and click on this link you'll see we go
straight to a simple download dot HTML
page and if I open up here you can see
we've got download and dot HTML so now
if we go back and we add that download
is equal to true refresh this page and
click it you'll see that we get the page
download it and if we okay that's
something I don't know and whatever
value you put in here is the name but
the page will be called it will not be
called what it was originally called
they'll be called whatever value is
inside of here so you can call this just
by having it saved as download without
any attributes and it will download it
as download by HTML you can see there
but if you put them attribute or you put
a value to this attribute rather so if I
change this to whatever before then we
would and we read download of this page
you'll see we get one two three four dot
HTML
so the way that this works is if you
want it to have a specific name you can
set that name within this area that's
the end of this tutorial I hope you've
enjoyed watching this video and and
