pure CSS drop down navigation so at the
top of the screen you can see that we've
got these options much like you'd see on
a website but when I click these we get
a drop down so we have a sort of two
teardrop bounce system now this is all
done using pure CSS so we've also got a
hover effect which you can imagine is
pretty straightforward using CSS but the
fact that we can click this drop this
down move our mouse around and then when
we want to dismiss it we can click
anywhere else on the page and that will
just disappear so this acts exactly like
you would find a normal JavaScript
solution to this let's go ahead and
build up the styling for this and then
we'll look at how we get this nice
functionality to drop down all right so
we're not starting off with too much
code at all this is a pretty blank
document the only two things I have done
is obviously laid my document out with
an html5 doctype and I've linked in this
global dot CSS stylesheet which is
within this CSS folder just here and
that's obviously empty because we're
going to be writing everything from
scratch here the second thing I've done
is I've linked in a stylesheet from
Google font API which provides me with a
font of my choice really easily so we
can just make this look a little bit
nicer while we're working with it and
I'm working with open sans but feel free
to pull in whatever font you want or you
can just use the default browser font
for this web page so what we're going to
do then is start with the markup we're
going to take a look at how this is
structured start to make it look nice
and then add the functionality at the
end including the nice transitions and
obviously the ability to click so we
need to define our navigation for this
I'm just going to create an empty nav
element and I'm going to give this a
class of nav main just so we can target
that with CSS now you can include a logo
of your choice whatever you're doing
here but in this case just to speed
things up I'm going to create just some
text within a div and that has a class
of logo now each of the navigation items
we're going to add at the
top of the page are going to be
contained within an unordered list so
this just gives us the following
so unordered list and then each list
item and then we can position these how
we want by default these will have
bullet points and padding and margin
will get rid of all of that and make it
look nice so inside of each of these
list items we want to include an anchor
we want that to go off either to
somewhere if you just want this to be a
single click link at the top or if you
want this to be a drop-down just stick
it hash in the href because that's not
obviously going anywhere the sub
navigation will deal with that I'm going
to give this a class of nav item and
obviously within this you're just going
to have the text that you want so we're
just going to say amazing for the first
one and we'll deal with the content in
just a bit let's make sure we at least
get the look of this and the feel of
this nice before we go anywhere else so
I'm going to do this four times in fact
let's stick with three just to speed
things up I'm just going to write CSS
here and then I'll just link off to a
website here so I can actually test
having an actual single click link at
the top rather than it pulling a drop
down so we've got the flexibility
between drop downs and going through to
website so let's take a look at the page
at the moment it obviously doesn't look
exactly how we want it to be this is
very plain as I mentioned we've just got
our bullet points for Arnold on Arnold
list but let's add some content onto the
page just so you can see how this reacts
so I'm just going to add a div here with
a class of content and I'm going to
generate I know three or four paragraphs
of lorem ipsum just so we've got
something on the page that we can work
with okay so let's start styling this up
we'll start to style up the nav main
we'll style up the logo the unordered
list here and each of the items within
this just so it looks a little bit nicer
the first thing I want to do is I want
to change the font on the page so I'm
just going to do this very quickly I'm
actually going to set the margin on the
page to zero as well just to get rid of
any margin so it sits nicely at the top
and I'm going to set the font to 1m I'm
using open sans and I have a sans serif
here so the content that did that we
just created a moment ago I'm just going
to give a padding of 30 pixels and let's
start to style up the nav main now just
so we can get this looking nice so this
is obviously going to have a width of a
hundred percent we're going to give this
a background color so I'm going to
choose a dark grey like two two two and
we can give this some padding as well I
know let's give it a fixed height you
can obviously play around with these
styles after we're done to see you so
I'm going to give it a foreground color
of white and we have the following so
it's already looking starting to look a
little bit nicer so then what we want to
do is just position the logo get that
out the way and done with so now the
main I'm going to target the logo you
don't obviously need to include it
inside of nav main you could just have
logo like that and for this we want to
float this left walls are going to be
floating that unordered list left as
well we're going to give this a height
of 40 pixels and we're going to give
this a bit of padding so we're going to
do 15 pixels on the top and the bottom
and 30 pixels on the left and the right
and we're going to give this slightly
larger font size than the rest of the
content just so it stands out I'm also
going to give this a line height of 40
pixels that just means it's going to sit
central here you might have noticed that
we've got this gap at the top here if we
just right-click and inspect element on
this unordered list you can see it comes
with some default padding and margin
that's the orange and the slightly green
bit that you see towards the left of
that so we need to fix this as well as
floating it and styling up each of these
items as well so let's go ahead and do
this I'm going to say nav main I'm going
to target the unordered list within
there and we're going to set the margin
on this to zero as I mentioned and the
padding to 0 because our unordered list
has these by default and we're going to
float this left as well I'm also going
to change the list style type to none
okay so now what we want to do is style
each of the list items
let's go ahead and just refresh and see
what difference this is made you can see
it's starting to look a little bit
better so let's go ahead now and float
each of the list items left so let's say
nav main unordered list and each list
item within there will float that left
so you'll now see these just sat next to
each other so now we've got the freedom
to target that nav item class that we
gave to each of our anchors we're
styling up the anchor because this is
going to give us the widest area for a
user to hover and click we don't want to
style up the actual list item we are
going to be putting some more content in
here as well so it's a good idea to
target the anchors and that meat just
means that's the clickable area for the
user so these are going to be a display
of inline-block the reason we're doing
this is because we want them to sit in
line but we want to be able to give them
a padding height and things like that
so let's go ahead and give these the
same top and bottom padding as our logo
so they're even and will slightly reduce
the size of the padding on the left and
the right hand side because we obviously
don't too much spacing between each item
obviously this is up to you we're going
to give these a fixed height of 40
pixels the same as our logo and we're
going to give these a same line height
as well just so they sit nice and even
with the logo so you can now see they
sitting pretty much even but we want to
change the color of these so let's
change that to white and we'll get rid
of the default text decoration that
links are given so that's basically the
underline of the link so we now have the
following so looking much better so what
we want to do now is just quickly do the
hover effect
so we'll say nav item hover and we will
set the background color to something a
little bit lighter so 444 and that's
pretty much it that's what we need to do
so we've now got the following so we've
got that nice wide area that users can
click on ok so what we now want to do is
look at styling the nav content this is
what's going to drop down when we go
ahead and click one of these at the
moment they're obviously just not going
anywhere except for the last link which
directly goes off to a website so we're
going to start either up so they're
visible here then we're going to hide
them and then we're going to add some
transitions on them as well as the
effect that we get when we click on one
of these links and that's relatively
straightforward so where are we creating
this nav content well we're going to
create it within the list item so it's
next to the list item that's really
really important because this CSS
selectors that we're going to be using I
mean it has to be next to it or
somewhere along the same level as it to
be able to style it we can also target
elements within elements but in this
case because we're using an anchor we
don't want to put all of our content
within this anchor it'd be a bit silly
so I'm going to create a div then called
nav content that's going to house all of
our content and I'm also going to create
another div called nav sub and the
reason I'm doing this is because we're
going to be giving a maximum height to
nav content and that maximum height is
going to be 0 now what that means is
that the elements not going to be shown
but then when we add a transition we can
increase the max height which means that
it nicely flows down now if we just
plunk everything we need inside of here
without an element containing it things
can get a little bit messy so we're
adding a little bit of extra markup just
so we can achieve this FET effect a
little bit easier there are other ways
around this but we'll stick to the
easiest way for now so inside of this
then we're going to create more
unordered lists and list items of just
literally sub navigation so we can say
anything about us we can say do you
really care what is here so something a
bit longer and we're just being silly
here so just so of course you do
so we can duplicate this down you can
add literally anything you want inside
of a nav content you can add text you
can add whatever you want images it
really doesn't matter so I'm just going
to say now sub here and I'm just going
to say
some text so play around with this
obviously it will vary depending on what
your what your site is but you can see
here we've got this kind of drop-down
sitting next to each of these at the
moment and it's pulling things away but
we're obviously going to fix that up
with a bit of styling and this text here
is white because remember we gave a
white foreground color to the whole of
the navigation so let's start them with
just styling up these nav content
elements so now content and inside of
here what we're going to do is change
the positioning so we're going to say
position we want this to be absolutely
positioned the reason we're doing that
is so we can position them properly so
you don't get this kind of problem here
so it's a little bit messy so I'm going
to set the top to 70 pixels just so it
sits nicely under our navigation element
if you are adding orders to your
navigation you're going to need to
increase this value but otherwise we
just have a fix empty pixel height with
no borders or anything like that or any
padding on the actual element so we're
going to set the overflow here to hidden
just in case anything comes anything is
sort of larger than the max height that
we give it it shouldn't do but we'll add
it just in case so it doesn't mess up
anything and I'm going to set a
background color here to the same color
as my main navigation and we could
change the foreground color again but
really that should have taken effect are
in our nav main here but if you do have
any problems you can fiddle around with
this so at the moment then we have the
following so we've got our CSS drop-down
just here which is in the correct
position obviously everything looks a
little bit messy because we're showing
both dropdowns at once and this
unordered list with these links needs
sorting as well so what we want to do
then is we're going to say nav content
and any anchor inside of there we want
to give this a color of white and I'm
also going to remove the text decoration
as well but obviously this is entirely
up to you what you do and then I'm going
to say nav content and I'm going to
apply a:hover pseudo element to that and
I'm going to say I want the text
decoration back
underline so that's basically going to
give us the following so just when we
hover over we get an underline and
obviously now the text is white so the
navigation sub then that nav subclass we
created and this is the whole reason we
needed to do this with the max height is
because we need some padding on here if
we apply padding to the nav content and
we transition on the max height on the
nav content what that's going to do is
it's going to screw things up a little
bit we're not going to get that max
height with the padding in there so we
apply the padding instead to that
element within it so we now have some
nice padding in there let's fix up these
unordered lists so nav sub unordered
list and let's get rid of the padding
let's get rid of the margin and let's
change the list style type to none much
like we did for the top menu the first
level so I'm just going to fix up the
anchors within here we can see at the
moment it's already looking a little bit
nicer but what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say nav sub ul we can say Li a
or you can just literally target a if
you want and then I'm going to say I
want this to be a display of inline
block and that means we can go ahead and
give it a little bit of padding 5 pixels
on the top and bottom and 0 on left and
right and that just spaces things out
nicely so we've now got these two
dropdowns we can go ahead and just hide
one if we wanted to so if we just stick
a display:none on that that shows what
the drop-down for this will be here so
we've got the look of our dropdowns
working but we now need to only show
them when we click on them so how are we
going to do this without JavaScript
usually you'd apply some kind of click
event add maybe a class to the
navigation content that's next to that
and then you'd show your navigation but
we can actually do this with the focus
pseudo element on our anchor here so
let's go ahead and apply this now our
the first thing we want to do is
actually by default hide these drop
downs we obviously don't and display
initially so all we need to do is for
now
content we need to give this a max
height of zero you can imagine giving
something a max height of zero means it
doesn't show with the exception of if it
has padding so for example if we did
have a padding of 20 pixels on this nav
content it still shows that's why
remember we created this nav sub so what
we now need to do then is we're going to
st. nav item focus you can move this
this line of code just up to your nav
item area if you want to keep everything
nicely organized but we'll leave it down
here for now
what we're going to do is we're going to
say background color 444 essentially all
this is doing is when we click on one of
these watch that stays so it focused now
on this anchor that's a focus event or
or state which means that that anchor is
now in focus and therefore we can do the
same for any of these it's already
starting to see functionality that could
be achieved with JavaScript them purely
with CSS but now we need to tackle the
problem of how do we show this nav
content by just having this focused what
we can do is we can say nav item focus
we can use the tilt which basically
means target any element along the same
level of element so it's not nested
elements or anything like that it's
basically any element along this set of
elements so the only other element we
have along the same level as this anchor
is this div here with nav content so
what we can do is we can say nav content
so we're basically saying when this is
focused target this nav content along
the same level so what we can do then is
do something like max high 400 pixels
which is going to increase the max
height of the nav content which remember
is zero and therefore when we click
these that's going to show them elements
cool so this is looking really good
naturally if we click anywhere else on
the page that anchor is now not in focus
it
which is the term for that therefore it
disappears because our CSS is no longer
applicable so we've done that but let's
add a couple of transitions just to make
this look a little bit nicer so we're
going to use the transition property and
with the transition property we choose
an element to transition on and we
obviously transitioning on the max
height being increased from 0 to 400
pixels and we choose a speed so in this
case we can say something like naught
point 4 seconds or you could say 400
milliseconds any speed you want really
and then we have the type of transition
so this can be things like ease in
easing out it can be linear but I like
ease in for this this particular
application so I'm going to duplicate
this down because at the time of
recording
I need the WebKit vendor prefix and I
need the Moz vendor prefix this is just
how different browsers implement them so
they should be included just while
they're fully standardized across all
browsers then they can be removed and
WebKit obviously targets Chrome and
Safari Moz obviousiy targets Firefox so
let's take a look at this if we refresh
and click you can see we get a nice drop
down now because remember we're
transitioning from that nought on the
max height to 400 on the max height so
that is pretty much it
we've created a CSS drop down navigation
no JavaScript at all works perfectly
we can click links here now we can
dismiss them and of course we've still
got the option to have non drop down
links which we can click and go through
