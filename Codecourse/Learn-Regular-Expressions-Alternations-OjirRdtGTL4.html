so if I just put the following strings
into our text area and let's say I want
to match all of them while they all
contain the string test so let's add
that and then what we could do is we
could just do tons of optionals again
but of course that wouldn't be very
practical so instead what we're going to
do is we're going to add a group like we
learned before and we will be looking
into groups in more detail later on but
for now just recognize that this is a
group and then what we're going to do is
we're going to add these little prefixes
and they're going to be separated by a
pipe so the first one is in there we go
add a pipe we have a add a pipe and we
have ed and there we go and then what we
can do is we can set that group to
optional and then the first string will
be matched also and we can look in our
little cheat sheet again and at the
alternation and here's an example let's
put that in we have bad bud bud bed bid
and we have these alternations inside of
this group so just for the sake of
practice let's match these are the two
strings so we'll add the U and we'll
also add the O and there we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
