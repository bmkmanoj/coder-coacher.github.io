effect on this box that we can see here
it basically simulates the corner of the
container being bent over or peeled over
so we're gonna go ahead and create this
box first we're gonna fill it with some
text and then we're gonna create this
dog-ear effect the reason that we're
adding text in here is because the
nature of how this works if we have too
much text it can actually overlap the
dog-ear and that basically just removes
the entire effect because you have text
over the overlapping piece so this is
fairly simple it falls back to not
having a dog-ear in older browsers that
don't support it and it does have very
good cross browser compatibility and
there's also not a lot of CSS involved
so let's go ahead and create the markup
and container for this and then we'll
start to create the dog-ear effect okay
so in my text editor I have a basic
document layout and I have included a
global CSS stylesheet I've just linked
that in here so let's create the
container now for the actual box itself
so we'll give this a class of box and
we'll be chaining on the dog ear class
which the reason we're doing this is
because it'd be reusable so it'll look
like this we can add this to pretty much
any container we want and you can go
ahead and add additional classes to make
this word different colors different
sizes and things like that so I'm gonna
say this is my favorite box and I love
it so we now have this on the page if we
just refresh we have this on the page so
we've got just nothing basically so
inside of our global CSS file let's make
the styles for the box this is fairly
straightforward but there are a couple
of things we need to do on any container
that we do include a dog ear on simply
because we're going to be using absolute
positioning so the container that you
add the dog ear to must have a position
of relative to ensure that the dog ear
that we're gonna put to the top right
doesn't float off to outside of this
container so let's give this a
background well
the background of e d e f f:0
that's just a nice of gray color there
and for the width will do 180 for the
height will also do 180 and we will give
this a padding of 10 pixels so that's
basically pushing this out now to be 200
and width and 200 in height so we now
have this effect
cool so temporarily let's just give this
a margin of 20 pixels that just pushes
it away from the edge of the page just
so we can focus on that a little bit
better and there's a couple of other
things we want to do we want to give
this a border radius I'll just do 5
pixels this will just round the edges
out and we'll give this a border autumn
of 4 pixels solid and CCC so now that
we've done this let's take a look here
cool so there are some other properties
that we want to add to this later we're
gonna add a padding right to this so
let's go ahead and comment this out and
we're going to add a padding I'm say 25
pixels so once we've created the actual
dog-ear we're gonna do that so that this
text here doesn't overlap the dog-ear
okay so now we want to create the
generic reusable doggy class so that is
dog-ear now we're gonna be using pseudo
elements we're gonna be using the before
and after pseudo element and the purpose
of this is we need to create a triangle
here so the if I just zoom in the
triangle will be from here to here then
out here and then in here so we'll
create a triangle shape there for the
pillar over piece of paper but what we
also want to do is we want an after
pseudo element to blank out this part
here and we're going to match that with
the color of the background of whatever
container you're placing this on in this
case it will be white and if this
doesn't make too much sense don't worry
you will see why we need to do this in
just a moment let's keep this zoomed in
at 175 so the dog ear before and dog ear
after pseudo elements
need to have a few properties and these
are shared between both so we can just
use a double selector here so the
content is going to be empty we're not
adding any content in here we're gonna
have a display or block on both of these
elements and these are going to be
positioned to the right and the top so
it's top right we want these and as I
mentioned earlier these are going to be
absolute positioned and that just means
that we can use these properties to
place them where we want so if I just
type a in in the content you can see
that when we inspect this and have a
look inside oh sorry we have nabbed it
so let's add the dog-ear class on so
we've got the a now and if we inspect
this you can actually see that we've got
the before and after pseudo elements
here so now to go ahead and star these
so let's get rid of that a for the dog
ear after this is basically going to be
the actual triangle that looks like it's
peeled over so we're going to use some
CSS basically just to create a triangle
and this is this can be used just on a
normal page it's not specific to pseudo
elements but we say a border top of 20
pixels solid and transparent and this is
a little bit hacky ah this triangle
tricks been used for quite a while now
all we're doing is we're basically
creating a border on the top and a
border again on the left well this is
gonna do is it's gonna push this border
through and it's gonna create a point so
when I say 20 pixels solid and give this
a color in this case the color I'm gonna
give this is a RGB value with an alpha
Channel and the Alpha is gonna be point
eight this can be a dark as you want you
could choose one two three whatever you
want but point-a looks like nice with
this color so we can leave it as that
you can of course and give this
color of your choice it doesn't matter
so let's take a look at what this is
done you can see now that's created the
triangle now we're halfway there but
obviously we don't want this bit in the
background so we create another pseudo
element dog ear before and basically
this will let us do the same thing this
time gonna have a border bottom and a
border right basically the opposite of
what we've already done with top and
left and this will gives us give us a
triangle in the opposite direction so
let's do this now but we'll give it a
color like black just so we can see
where the positioning is for this so
we're gonna say border bottom this is
again gonna be 20 pixels solid and
transparent for the for the bottom
border and for the order that we
actually want to see this is going to be
20 pixels again solid we're going to
change this to white in a minute but for
now let's just change this to black and
you can now see we've got a triangle in
the opposite direction and if the
container in the background or the other
area you're placing this on was black in
the background then you would obviously
choose this color as black in my case
the background is white by default so I
just choose white for this color and
that gives us that effect
so we've now achieved a doggy effect
with CSS extremely easily so now is the
time when we start to play around with
this text because what's going to happen
is if we change this text let's just
change this so add another bean here
there so now we're actually starting to
see if we have one less be that this is
overlapping this so it's time to look at
you know a bit rubbish because that
wouldn't actually happen so if we
introduced this padding right that we
commented out earlier that will actually
push all the content inward so what's
going to happen now is when we
have this that's as far as it will get
because if we look at the padding here
you can see that the green area on the
right hand side is pushing that content
away from it you do get slightly their
space here and it may start to look a
little bit odd however you could
alternatively increase the entire
padding of the whole container so for
example you could get rid of the padding
on the right and you can change the
padding to 20 pixels and that would then
push everything away naturally and
equally on each side so you can see that
the green area now represents the
padding and that is far away from the
dog-ear so that's how we create a
dog-ear effect with CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
