see our database up just so we know
exactly what we need to store and this
isn't a lot at all the only two things
that we really need to store is the
source to the video because remember
we're going to be using that html5 video
player to serve that video from amazon
s3 which clip champ will upload to
amazon s3 for us and we also need a
unique hash to identify each video now
the reason we're choosing a unique hash
is because if we were to choose an ID
these are incremental so they're very
easy to get so I don't have a database
setup at the moment so we're going to go
and add a database I'm going to call
this video fi so inside of here we need
a 1 table and this is just going to be
videos and we have an auto incrementing
ID that's fine it's a primary key of the
table it's unsigned we have a length of
11 here by default and of course more
important is auto increment so although
we're not going to be using this to
reference each video that's uploaded
this is useful to have anyway so the two
we want to create then is the source
this is our video source and I'm going
to create this as a varchar at a length
of 255 that should be plenty we're not
going to allow null for this because we
always want this to be filled we're also
going to create a hash column as well
this is going to be 64 characters in
length we're later going to be using the
PHP random bytes function to generate a
random string here for us and of course
we don't allow null on this either so
that is pretty much it really simple
database let's jump over and start to
look at how we code out the video upload
button</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
