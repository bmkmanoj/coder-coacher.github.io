content editable attribute to make HTML
elements editable I'm also going to look
at storing this as an example with local
storage in the browser so let's take a
look at how this works at the moment you
can see I've got this text on the page
this is a actually in fact a div element
with the content editable attribute set
to true so what I can actually do is
edit this content so I can go ahead and
write this is a new line for example now
when I come away from this I have some
JavaScript set up here which we'll look
at in a moment that actually stores the
new content that you've typed into local
storage so when i refresh now you see
that this stays the same because it's
pulling from my browser's local storage
and we can find that under the resources
tab and you can see that the key is edit
that's just what I called it and the
value here you can see is what matches
up here so we're going to take a look at
creating an element with the content
edit or attribute and then we'll look at
a quick example with JavaScript to store
this in local storage so the first thing
we're going to want to do is create this
element here I'm going to give this an
ID of edit just so I can pick it up
easily with JavaScript and I'm gonna set
content editable to true so any text we
now enter in here means that this
element will now be editable whereas
before obviously a div element isn't
editable like this so we can now edit
this and say this is a new line now the
only problem is when we refresh this is
just gonna set back to the original
value that we gave this this hard-coded
value here so let's pull this back up
and we'll create some JavaScript just to
test out local storage now there is a
point this because when you're creating
a web app you may want to utilize
JavaScript to actually go ahead and
store perhaps in the local storage of
the of the browser current browser the
users using all you may want to go and
send an ajax request and store this
edited edited volume in a database for
now we'll look at using local storage
but obviously depending on your use this
could go either way you can use this
within an app or something so I'm gonna
target the ID of edit this div element
that we've created so let's say edit is
document dot get element by ID just
selecting that now just quickly we're
creating Global's here but this is in
fact it's just an example so obviously
in the real world you'd probably write
better JavaScript in this let's start
out by just saying edit dot inner HTML
and let's just set some text and you
could of course use set text but we'll
see why we're not going to use that in a
moment so for now let's set this to just
hello and let's check this out there we
go so we've got no change the contents
of this div is now hello based on this
JavaScript we've written now what I'm
going to do is add an event listener
which is going to be on blur this is
probably not the best idea you may want
to come up with a better solution you
might want a Save button or something
like that if you were doing this within
a project depending on how this suits
you but we'll add an event listener here
and this takes two parameters one is the
actual event and the second is the
callback and this case will just create
the function here so what we're going to
do is we're going to utilize local
storage bear in mind I'm not checking
for support here you may want to go
ahead and check with support with either
checking this exists or using something
like moderniser and we're gonna set an
item and this is going to be the key
which we saw earlier in the example and
then we refer to this meaning this
element here because we are attaching
the event listener and we say this dot
inner HTML so we're grabbing what's in
this element and then storing it in
local storage under edit and this is all
well and good we can refresh now and say
this is a newline but nothing works in
terms of bringing the content back you
can see that this is stored here but
what we're not doing is we're not
switching this to local storage dot yet
item rather than set item and then we
use the key here so edit
so that will go ahead and pull in the
local storage so now when we type
another line and blow away from this and
hit refresh we pull out what's been
stored in local storage so that's just a
short introduction to the content
editable attribute and a quick example
of storing what's edited in here using
JavaScript local storage now I did
mention earlier that if we use the inner
text just set the content of this you'll
notice that the way this is stored
markup has been generated for us for
this content so if I were to refresh
with the using the inner text property
of this element by storing this or
applying this stored content you can now
see that this just doesn't look great
it's just literally outputting you know
the elements that is generated that's
why we use in HTML now apart from this
it's also good to bear in mind that this
actually does work like a text editor so
I'm gonna hit command + B which is how I
set items bold and you can see that that
has actually stored something in bold
and you can see the appropriate markup
here as well obviously it's using the
legacy tags like B but I don't think
there's probably a better way to do this
without CSS
either way though we can edit this like
we would a text editor we can blow away
and that content is stored for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
