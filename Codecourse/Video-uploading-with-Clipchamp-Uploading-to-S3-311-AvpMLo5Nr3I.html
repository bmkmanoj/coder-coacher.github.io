button onto our page and working is a
very straightforward process but of
course clip champ via that API give you
lots of control over what you can do how
many seconds you are going to allow for
your webcam upload so we're going to
have a brief run-through probably the
most important settings and more
importantly we're going to focus on our
target which is currently s3 but we'll
be covering the YouTube option in the
next part so the first thing we want to
do is just set our page up so it's ready
to have the clip chat button injected in
so let's just create a container we're
not working with any styles here but
we'll just imagine we're integrating
this into some kind of front-end
framework we have an href of hash we
don't need this to go any where
everything is handled on the same page
we're going to give this an ID because
of course we need to target it with
JavaScript so the idea is going to be
video upload and I'm just gonna pop some
text in here although this won't display
the clip chat button will be shown so
now that we've got that that's pretty
much all of that done what we now need
to do is just pull in a couple of
dependencies and the first one we're
going to pull in is jQuery and the
second one is the clip champ JavaScript
so first things first let's just pull in
jquery i'm going to go over to CD njs
just search for jquery hit this here and
i'm going to go ahead and choose to
point to point to so i'm going to pull
in the minified version just copy that
location let's go over and just pop this
into here so that's done we've got that
out of the way so next we need to head
over to clip champs documentation which
will under the embedding instructions
give you everything you really need to
know about implementing this and it's
very very straightforward gives you lots
of examples and very very descriptive of
each of the options we have here so will
very briefly run through these and just
take a look at what we can do and then
we'll just start to put that onto our
page so we're ready to use this okay so
first things first obviously we need to
pull in
javascript from click chat we need to
use this so we're going to go ahead and
pop that in there and I'm just going to
create an opening and closing script tag
so we can write all of our code in here
now there's a couple of ways that we can
use clip champ we can either just do
this on our own or we can go ahead and
use jquery this works well it is just a
jquery plugin so you're probably used to
using jquery plugins pretty
straightforward so we just have a
selector we use clip champ and we have
an object of options so this is pretty
straightforward we know what our
selector is it is up here video upload
and then we just say clip champ pass our
options in and that's it so let's take a
look at some of the options so if we
scroll down we've got label here the
clip champ button label this is the text
that appears in the button which is
placed into rapper element so in here
let's just go ahead and implement this I
will just say upload a video pretty
straightforward of course you can change
this whatever you want so we also have
size which is the size of the button so
let's go ahead and say medium and we
have a title as well all this is is the
title of the window that will appear so
I'm just going to say get your video
upload it and more interestingly we have
a preset option so this is the
conversion preset which causes clip
champ to produce an output video is
optimized for a particular usage
scenario or device so of course if you
know the majority of you users are going
to be doing this on the web of course
choose web otherwise we can do things
like mobile or of course you can
optimize for windows devices if that's
the case of course this is going to
change for you for me I'm going to go
ahead and do this for Moe Bock's I find
that part of clip champ the most
interesting that we have great mobile
compatibility here and likewise we're
going to set the format to
mp4 so if we go down you can see here we
have different options we have web M of
the flv asf and even gif or gif so this
is really cool but I'm going to choose
mp4 because for me I'd be placing this
into an html5 video player and that
would work out perfectly cross-browser
so I prefer this option but of course
you can also choose between these
completely depends so next we're going
to look at the resolution so obviously
we can keep the resolution that it
uploaded that of course we can choose a
resolution so for this demo I'm just
going to do 480p but of course feel free
to bump this up if you want to so let's
go ahead and use this resolution here
pretty straightforward so we also now
have compression again let's say I am in
the scenario where I want people to use
this on a mobile of course we can choose
high compression so here you can see the
compression ratio for the output results
and you obviously compromise quality
when you go for a high compression but
of course what I'm going to do is just
imagine myself in the situation where
I'm going to use this for mobile maybe
people around about and don't have very
high speed ok so again really
interestingly we have an input option so
you probably already guess the inputs
option can either be file or camera so
obviously we've already spoken about
this but we can upload from the camera
so we can record audio and video from
our webcam and of course we can drag and
drop files or choose files from our
computer so we would be silly not to
allow both so of course if you have a
reason why you didn't want to do this
you can switch between these so the next
is the output so let's go ahead in fact
let's cover the camera limit so we can
of course limit the length of time that
we have here so in the range of one to
three hundred so this is the number of
seconds so let's go ahead and limit this
and I'm going to say limited to one
minute great so now we can focus on the
output so we can choose the output here
we can have dummy which will just kind
of do everything normally but it won't
produce a file so either a blob it won't
upload to as your s3 or YouTube it's
just a kind of test run but of course in
this part we're going to be looking at
uploading to s3 so I'm going to go ahead
and choose s3 here now of course because
we are working with s3 what we need to
do is go ahead and apply some settings
to this so if you scroll down here you
can see the settings for the different
services in our case we want the bucket
and the folder to be specified because
we know we want to upload to this bucket
and this folder so all we need to do is
hearsay s3 and here we choose our bucket
and here we choose our folder so our
bucket of course we know it is video
upload code course com obviously it's
going to be different for you and then
the folder is videos so one last option
of course there are loads of other
options you can go ahead and explore
this and it's entirely up to you how you
kind of put this an implement this into
your site what we want to do though is
just come down or rather up to enable so
this will allow you to enable different
kind of things so in this case we can
have no branding so we can remove the
clip champ branding of course that's
really useful if you want to kind of use
clip champs powerful functionality but
brand it with your own site brand which
is really cool of course we have loads
of others no pop out but we're going to
just use the no thank you option all
this will do is it will disable the
thank you message that we see at the end
so let's go ahead and enable this but of
course feel free to just play around
with the other settings let's go ahead
and paste this in and we are done so
we're finally just going to talk about
thee on
video uploaded call back so let's go
ahead and implement this of course this
is a call backs it's a function and
basically this callback will receive the
video so going to do a console log on
this we won't show this straight away
we'll look at it in just a moment but
this will give us an idea about the kind
of things that we might be able to store
we might be able to use later on and
we'll dive into this in much more detail
later so we've got all of these settings
in there we've not even previewed this
on the page so let's give this a refresh
and you can see that now we have a brand
new clip champ button let's go ahead and
click this and you can see we get our
nice video upload screen we can go ahead
and record from the webcam if we want to
this is really cool so if we just go
ahead and click on this you can see that
we have a view of our webcam so this
will allow us to go ahead and start
recording pretty straightforward and why
don't we just try this out we'll see if
this is uploaded to s3 will see if we've
got everything set up correctly so let's
go ahead and click start recording you
can see you get a nice count down here
as well and you can see that we are now
recording as indicated by a little red
dot up here the great thing about this
as well is we can pause it if we want to
and then continue recording either by
clicking this or hitting the spacebar so
let's go ahead and continue recording
just for a couple more seconds and once
we are happy with the video we can go
ahead and finish so there we go we're
just doing a little bit of
post-processing there and now we have
our video so if we don't like it we can
click record again but let's go ahead
and submit this and see what we get this
is going to go ahead and upload it's
already processed it so it's just
uploading now it will finalize this will
close off we don't see the thank you
message because we disabled that and
hopefully if we've set up amazon
correctly we can go ahead and refresh
here and we should see that video in
there perfect and it's in there so let's
go ahead and open this let's just go
ahead and open this in the new tab and
why don't we just go and set this is
public just very quickly and we'll go
over here just open it up again and
there we go you can see we've got our
video we can play it back
and it's all well and good obviously not
much moving here but of course you'll
see the subject moving so that's really
straightforward we've not had to do any
work ourselves all of its handled on
clip champ like I said and of course
this is really nice and private because
clip champ will never see this video
straight up to Amazon s3 let's just go
and look at what happens when we drag a
video in so let's pull this over you can
see this is pretty nice this will go
ahead and give you a preview of the
video as well so you can have a look at
it so we can go ahead and play this and
it's just a little video here that i put
together we're going to go ahead and
submit this it's going to go ahead and
upload it it will finalize and again if
we head over to s3 and refresh we see
that video in there as well could not be
simpler so have a little play around
with the settings there's loads here
that you can do and I'd encourage you to
just go through this familiarize
yourself with the API and you can go
ahead and adjust this button to however
you want now that we've seen this in
action we want to take a look at the
developer console if we go over to the
console area we're going to upload a
video I'm going to check out what's
returned when we did this console log
here so this is really important because
this is how you'll take either the blob
if you are uploading as a blob format or
it would take the Amazon s3 URL or the
YouTube URL and it would give you this
back and then you can do what you want
with it so let's test this out just by
pulling over this video again and
submitting it wait for to prepare and
then it'll obviously go and upload and
there we go with done and in the console
now of course if we actually get this
correct so let's go back to the
documentation and it should be on video
well on video creatives for blog which
we can look at it on upload complete so
let's go ahead and put that in their
head over here give that a refresh and
we will upload another video just to
test this out so we'll submit that wait
for it to prepare and wait for it to
upload
and there we go so here we have a nice
object and in here we have the kind so
we know this is s3 the key which is
essentially just the path to your video
so if you wanted to store this in a
database you can go ahead and do that
we'll be doing that in the project that
will see in the next section and of
course the original file name as well
which can really help so there we go
we've very basically implemented the
clip champ button let's jump over to the
next part where we look at doing this
with YouTube which is even easier no s 3
sets are required this is more your
thing it's going to work really well for
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
