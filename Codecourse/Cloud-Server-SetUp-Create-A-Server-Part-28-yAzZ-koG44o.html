ahead and hit the create droplet button
which will give you all of the options
available to setting up your droplet now
digitalocean gives you the ability to
choose the size of your droplet it shows
you the cost you can then go ahead and
choose your location etc etc so let's go
ahead and just fill out all of this
information as we normally would so I'm
gonna call this server tester that's the
host name I'm gonna give this and as I
mentioned just a moment ago here are the
different options you've got for
choosing a droplet so the cost here says
5 per monthly or pointy reserved 7
hourly so I'm happy with that this is
just a test account or test droplet so
the region is important based on where
you think your users or the majority of
your users are going to be so you can
avoid as much latency as possible so of
course you can use a content delivery
network but that's beyond the scope for
this tutorial so for now I'm just gonna
choose New York it set as the default so
what you can now do is go ahead and
choose a Linux distribution now we'll
stick with a bin - and we'll leave the
default version as well now it's
entirely up to you what you choose but
make sure that if you're making a
different selection you understand why
you're doing so now you could
technically end the video here and
choose a lamp stack on Ubuntu here like
it would just you know mean that you
wouldn't have to follow the rest of the
tutorial however if you're interesting
and understand how to take each step to
set your server up then carry on and
it's probably a good idea to do so
because it's a good idea to understand
how to work with your server a bit
better we'll also be covering SSH which
is extremely important so it's a
probably another good reason to follow
the video so we're nearly done all we
need to do is just scroll down and hit
create droplet and that now creates the
droplet so it takes roughly 60 seconds
usually less and basically what will
happen is once the droplets being
created will receive an email
with the root account password so what
we can then do is go ahead and with the
IP address start SSH into the server
which we'll look at next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
