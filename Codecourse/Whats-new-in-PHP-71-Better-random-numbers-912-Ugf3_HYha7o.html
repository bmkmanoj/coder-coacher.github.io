the scenes change but it's worth
bringing up anyway so you may know that
in PHP we can use r and to generate a
random number so let's say we were
picking out a random card from a deck of
cards we would go ahead and use round
giving the lower and the upper limit
just in here so if we check this out in
the browser we get say 37 and it goes
ahead and generates a random number now
depending on what you're using this for
R and it uses the system random number
generator so the output of this is
system dependent and some systems this
will generate a week random number so
really this is just depending on how
you're using this now the change in PHP
7.1 fixes and you may not have seen this
function before mt r and which is a
better random number generator so this
will work much better in terms of
security than the round function what
also happened though is that rand has
now been aliased to mt r and which is a
really nice addition because if you are
using rand anywhere this will
automatically be alias to mt round which
is a much better way to generate random
numbers so aside from this a very very
simple change that is pretty much it any
kind of random number function within
PHP has also be improved so let's say we
had some kind of an array with just any
values in it really really doesn't
matter we may know that we can use a
method called array round which will
pluck out a random key of an array so if
you were showing a random value from an
array then you would go ahead and pass
in the name of the array and you would
get out the key so random kids you can
see here that this is changing now to do
this we would just basically go ahead
and echo out names like so array Rand
names and that would give us a random
name from that array now any function
like this that would generate a random
number has been updated to use better
random number generation so it's really
as simple as that
so like I said this is a
behind-the-scenes change but naturally
with any language you work with it's
always a good idea to understand what is
happening here so we know that Rand has
been alias to mt r &amp;amp; mt round has been
fixed to work better and generate more
secure round numbers or better sorry
random numbers and of course any other
function that uses random numbers has
also been updated to be improved and you
can actually check this out over on the
RFC that I've left in the course links
if you want to read more about this
particular change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
