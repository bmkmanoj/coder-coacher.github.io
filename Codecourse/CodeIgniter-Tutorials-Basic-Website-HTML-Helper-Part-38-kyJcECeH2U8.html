number 14 in my new series called
introduction do CodeIgniter introduction
to CodeIgniter yes that's what this
video series is in this video we'll be
talking about helpers we're going to
autoload a helper and we're going to the
HTML helper I'll teach you guys about
the HTML helper it's pretty basic it's
not exactly useless but it's actually
kind of cool so why don't we just get
get right into it first thing we want to
do is we want to auto load it because
I'm going to use this in multiple views
and I don't want to have to load it
every time so what I'll do is I'll go to
config auto load actually I'm going to
clean this up a bit
excuse me for my mess
okay
now ignore that okay the HTML helper is
loaded
simply by HTML that's all we need to put
in there so save this next thing we want
to do is we'll go into our content
sections no first thing we'll do the
header and I'll show you why
so go site underscore header this
doctype HTML this is for html5 but code
Nutter does have its own function for
this it's kind of cool and I'll show you
what it looks like so instead of putting
doctype HTML we put
open our PHP tags and we will go doctype
we'll actually echo this
and here
html5
save it up and now if we go to say our
about page and this should be loading
that header view and into the page
source you can actually see that it's
loading doctype HTML so we're using code
nutter
this it's echoing out the doctype for
html5 if you didn't know what it was and
this actually works for HTML for strict
HTML for transitional like xhtml 1.0 1.0
strict and things like that for more
information check out the user guide on
codeigniter aside from that there's
actually a couple other couple of the
things we can use for use the HTML
helper for and I'll show you what that
is if we go into the content and about
content about and content home pages you
can see that this is full of header or
it has some header one tags in it
instead of header one we can actually
use something different I'll straight
enough our PHP tags
instead of having header or h1 tags we
can actually do this straight echo
heading
above page it takes two parameters the
first is the or I can take three of them
yeah
the first one is the actual text that
goes inside the heading tag so the
content of it the second is what type is
it in h1 and h2 and h3 in this case it's
an h1 so all we do is put 1 the second
would be any external styling we have or
any external attributes so like if we
had an h1 with a class of something in a
style to something we could actually go
like name the class right here and it
would be like class is equal to big h1
or you know whatever you want to do
there but in this case we don't have to
worry about that will save this up
delete about page and I'm actually just
going to copy this on to the home page
too so we have consistent C and stuff
just call this home save them both and
we'll check it out see if it actually
works
sure enough that function that were the
function that we're using there is if we
check out the page source
that h1 take is right here and it's an
h1 and the content is in there so this
function works exactly the same as
typing in h1 take I know a lot of you
are probably thinking well why wouldn't
I just put an h1 tag the reason is the
plain reason for that is is you can
actually put variables in here if you
were to say
call this title say title is equal to a
boat page save that it that makes it a
lot easier to pass in variables into
this view and use them without having to
echo out any variables no that's a
difficult thing to do but this is just
another way to do it
so we'll test this out on the about page
and sure enough it's loading that
lowercase stuff that you just typed into
that variable and then pass the variable
into this function so hopefully that's a
pretty good explanation or that'll get
you started with the HTML helper for
more information things like that
there's like you can do break tags you
can do image tags things like that but
check out the user guide on code Metacom
that'll take you to the next level with
the HTML helper and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
