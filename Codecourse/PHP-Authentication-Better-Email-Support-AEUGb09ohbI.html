out emails within this application and
what we want to do now is switch that
over to another service now this isn't
going to take long at all because you're
not going to have to update every route
we're going to use the same
functionality we're going to be using
the mailer class that we built as part
of this series this mailer class just
here and message we'll have to slightly
modify but all together there's not
gonna be much to do so the service that
we're gonna be using is mailgun and if
you've not used mail gun before that's
fine go ahead and sign up for it and
you'll need to either create a domain or
use the sandbox domain that we have here
so once you're set up with mail gun we
can carry on with this if you're worried
about being charged for a service like
this mail gun at the time of recording
has a free policy for under ten thousand
email sent so it's very unlikely that
you will actually be charged for this
but obviously what you can do is once
you're finished with this if you find
another service which is free or cheaper
then you can go ahead and switch over to
that one I just prefer mail gun so the
first thing that we're going to need to
do is install mail guns PHP library
because we're going to be obviously
sending email from our PHP application
so what we need to do then is switch
over to a terminal under authentication
and we can go ahead and require this in
we're also going to remove PHP mailer so
under the github page we use require and
then the vendor names mailgun in the
package name is mailgun PHP so all we do
here is composer
require and just paste that in and we'll
wait for that to download so now that's
finished we can go ahead and get rid of
PHP mailer so mailgun is just a beard
here we'll go ahead and get rid of this
line so we don't need it anymore
and we'll just do a composer update here
so that's gone ahead and removed PHP
mailer ok so now what we need to do then
is look inside of our start file so just
in here so remember what we were doing
is for this mail item in the container
we were Craine a new instance of PHP
mailer setting all the settings and then
returning mailer passing in that PHP
mailer in
we're actually gonna get rid of all of
this I'm gonna create a new instance of
mailgun using our our mailgun domain and
our API key and for this we're gonna
need to update our configuration so if
we head over to config and development
most of this now isn't required in fact
none of this is required we're going to
create a few more keys here so the first
one is the secret this will be the our
API key we also have a our mailgun
domain and then we have who we want this
email to be from so for me this is just
gonna be hello that code course comm
obviously you can change that so let's
pop in our secret and domain and then
we'll copy the configuration files over
to production so they reflected there
too so if we head over to the mail comm
website where we have our domain setup
and they go ahead and copy and paste
this in and then we also need our API
key which is this just down here so I'm
going to go ahead and paste that in as
well
so we're ready now we can actually copy
these over to the production
configuration like so okay so now what
we want to do is update this container
dependency so to create a new mailgun
instance we just say mail equals new
mail gun and we need to pass in our API
key and that comes from app config
obviously and then we say get mail dot
secret so we now have a new instance of
mail gun setup we actually can now use
mail gun may all go and just import
that's it's under the name space of mail
gun and we are now ready to start using
mail gun but what we also want to do is
because we need a few other
configuration options inside of mailer
we're actually going to pass through app
config as well so now that we've got
this up-to-date we don't need to do
anything else here this is pretty much
all we need to do here all we need to do
now is update our mailer and message
classes so over on mailer we now have
this new dependency which is our config
because we need to grab the from address
inside of here
so we can create a new property for this
protects a conflict that would be and
we'll go ahead and pull this in here as
well like so okay so now that we've got
that we need to update this main send
method and we need to work out how we
can first of all kind of build up a
message in the same way that we did here
with PHP mailer so using the methods or
properties that we have so if we head
over to the mailgun github page under
source mailgun and then under messages
you can see this usage for the message
builder there are other ways to send
email but since we have a kind of
message builder built within our system
we're going to use this functionality so
to grab a new instance or create a new
instance of message builder we use this
message build a method so let's first of
all do that so up here I'm going to say
builder equals this mailer message
builder and then instead of passing in
this mailer instance we're actually
going to pass through the Builder and
that will allow that message class to
build up the message and what we need to
do before we do that is set the from
address and that comes from our config
which we've pulled into this class it's
all we do is say builder set from
address and then we pass in the from
address and that's from our
configuration so we have our config here
we just say this config get mail dot
from like so and we're now nearly good
to go we just need to update our message
class and then we didn't need to do
something different down here for when
we say send on mailer so over to the
message class then we have pretty much
the same thing we don't need to add or
remove anything in terms of methods all
we need to do is change the to subject
and Bali calls so instead of saying add
address we say add to recipient and we
pass in the address there for the
subject
this is different as well it's set
subjects are a little bit nicer than PHP
mailer and we just passed the subject in
and the body is exactly the same as well
this time what we can do is we can
either set a plain text body or we can
set an HTML body and we do that like
that so that is done that is our message
class that is our mail class we now just
need to send the message so to do this
what we need to do is grab our domain
because we're going to be sending a post
request through to mail guns API and we
need to supply the domain so we'll grab
the domain first that's just this config
get mail dot domain and then to send the
message we say this mailer post we need
to pass in the domain here and then we
need to hit the messages endpoint and
then in here we just have the stuff that
we've set within the message builder so
this is just builder get message so
let's just quickly recap and then we'll
test that this works we've modified our
start file simply because we're not
using PHP mailer anymore instead what
we're doing need to be using the mailgun
PHP library and we've obviously passed
our secret in there so we can access the
API and then all we're doing is
returning a new instance of our custom
mailer class passing in the config we
need some additional conflict within
that class so we're just dependency
injected that in so over on our melee
class then we obviously have that config
that's been pulled in we've used male
guns message builder rather than the
kind of message builder that we got from
the PHP mailer and we've set the from
address which is pretty self-explanatory
we've then instead of passing the actual
mailer instance in we've passed in the
builder instance into the new message
class or our message class which means
we can just update it as normal and just
use the mail gum method rather than PHP
mailers methods we're doing the same
thing here appending data we're setting
the body we're calling that callback so
we can actually
set them from in that closure when we
actually send email so for example when
we are over an hour off register we do
exactly the same thing just here and it
does everything so it sets the two and
the subject and stuff and then we grab
the domain we hit the messages endpoint
on mail gun passing in our domain and we
just grab all of the properties from the
Builder that we set using both our
message class and this set from address
just here so you could actually go ahead
and put this into the message class here
so you could create a new method in fact
there's why not do that now we'll just
go ahead and say from address and all
we'd need to do is grab this code here
put that in here and say this mailer set
from address and then we could actually
go ahead and pull out conf again so we
could say here get rid of this pass in
address and then over on here all we
need to do now is say message from and
then put our configuration in so let's
just grab that value here and paste that
in so now what we're doing is we've just
taken this placed it within our message
class and it looks a little bit cleaner
and that also means we can access the
from method within that closure when we
actually send an email as well
if it's set so now that we've done this
all we need to do is go ahead and test
this out so the first thing that we want
to do then to test this out is just get
rid of any users we have in our database
and then we can go ahead and register
with that same email address without
it's throwing a validation error so
let's enter these normal details in here
we'll go ahead and hit register and okay
so we've got a little error here okay so
what we've done I'm guessing is okay so
I called this mail gun and I'm passing
it in as mailer so what I'm gonna do is
I'm just gonna either update this to
mail gun or update this to mailer or
you could do the opposite it's really up
to you so let's just hope we don't get
any more errors will delete this one go
ahead and enter the email hit register
and that looks like it's worked so we
can head over to our email account and
you can see that we have got that email
there through we can go ahead and
activate our account using the link as
normal so there we go we've updated our
messaging functionality to use mailgun
like I said if you want to use a
different provider just go ahead and as
long as you can build up a message like
this you can go ahead and modify this to
use the service you want but now
anywhere we're sending emails in our
application will work because we're
using exactly the same functionality
that we built
we're just modifying who sends the
message</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
