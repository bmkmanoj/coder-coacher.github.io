applying a box shadow to a square or
rectangular element on our page and
we're going to be making use of the
insect keyword that comes with a box
shadow we're also going to be applying
multiple shadows in one the CSS
attributes and we're going to end up
with something like this on the page
here which has a button appearance to it
I am going to create that using box
shadow only so let's look at some code
for this the first thing we'll need is a
div tag and we're just going to give the
div tag a class of shadow 3 and that's
all the markup we'll need really
everything else is just the standard
html5 code that's required for any page
and as you can see we put a link here to
our style sheet which is we're going to
write our Styles which is this file here
so let's save that and moved on to some
Styles first of all I'm just going to
apply some styles to the body of the
page provide a background color the gray
color and remove any margin that's added
to the page by default then I'm going to
style the div itself with the shadow a
class just by giving it a background
color white background color in this
case and a width of 400 pixels height of
200 pixels some padding a width sorry
some margin and float it left now I'm
going to move on to adding this the
shadow itself so I'll need a shadow
three selector before I put anything in
the selector let's look at what we have
on the page at the moment so moment just
have the empty white div there with no
shadow honors our tool so let's start
deploying the shadow so obviously first
of all need book shadow and then I'm
going to apply the first of the two
shadows and the way to apply multiple
shadows is just by comma separating the
shadow values so you'll see that in a
second so I'm using the insect keyword
as well and the insect keyword comes
first so I say insert to tell the Box
shadow and instructed the page to render
the shadow inside the box not outside
the border of the box and then I'm going
to apply an X offset a Y offset and a
blur radius and a color from my first
shadow okay so let's see what that first
shadow it looks like just the basic
shadow at the top left now let's apply
the second shadow and as I said it's
just calmer separate the shadows again
I'm going to use the insect keyword and
provide a x offset Y offset their radius
and a color and that's my second shadow
let's see what that looks like
there we are we're starting to build
that button up nicely using the inset
box shadows the final thing I'm going to
do is just give a border radius which is
a real simple property you just instruct
the the page to render a slight radius
on the edges of the element and then and
I'm going to provide ten pixels to that
and you can see now we have the button
effect that we were trying to achieve
using box shadow
and focusing on the inset box shadows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
