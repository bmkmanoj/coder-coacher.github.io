this Java series for beginners in this
tutorial we're going to be looking at
loops loops is where Java starts
becoming really dynamic and we can
actually control the code that we're
using and we can make it repeat itself
and do different things on each
iteration of it so the first thing we're
going to be looking at is the while loop
and the while look look looks like this
you just write the word while and then
you have the open normal brackets much
like the if statement and then you have
the spiking brackets like so you can see
it looks exactly the same as an if
statement except we were in the word
while now the difference between this
while a the while loop and a what we
were doing with the if statement is with
both of them take the boolean condition
inside these brackets here except the
while loop what it's going to do if this
condition is true it's going to run the
code inside here much like the if
statement except it's not just going to
run it once it's going to keep running
it over and over again until this
condition in here somehow meets a false
so each iteration it's going to check
the condition see if it's still true and
if it's still true it's going to run it
over and over again it's basically a
repeating if statement so let's go ahead
and write while true in here and then
we're going to say system.out.print line
and we'll write hello world in there and
what this is going to do is it's going
to say okay let's check the condition
that can did the boolean condition is
true obviously that is the condition is
true so it's going to run the code here
then it's going to check if the
statements still true obviously it's
still true and this will this true
statement here would never become false
because this isn't a variable it's just
the literal value of true so basically
what this program is going to do is it's
going to infinitely print out a hello
world to the console and we can see this
if we hit run you can see the scroll bar
here just going further and further down
and this is just going to print out
indefinitely until we go ahead and
manually hit stop so obviously that's
not really practical in an actual
program because you
usually you want it to stop at some
point you don't want it to just be
infinitely running so let's do a let's
do an example here let's make an integer
called a and we're going to set it equal
to zero now the condition we're going to
make we're going to say well a is less
than 100 so that's our boolean condition
whilst a is less than 100 we're going to
print out something let's go ahead and
print out the value for a here so a is
obviously less than 100 so if we print
this out we're just going to see zero
printed out infinitely much like the
hello world thing that's because this a
variable is never changing now that
we've introduced a variable into the
condition of the while loop we can
actually change the while loop and what
it does so what we'll do is we'll print
out the value of a each time and then
we're going to add one to it and I
haven't introduced this this concept yet
so to add numbers to increment a number
of the same amount you can say a is
equal to a plus 1 for example and that's
perfectly valid we're saying set the
variable a equal to itself just plus 1
and that basically increments it 1
there's an easier way to do it than that
we can simply just put 2 plus signs and
then finish off with a semicolon this
basically just says add 1 to a that's
the simple way of doing it so now this
well loop has actually become more
dynamic because each iteration we're
going to add 1 to a and each time it's
going to check if a is equal to 100 so
this loop is actually going to run a
hundred times until finally when we're
on the when a is equal to 99 we're going
to add 1 to 100 then 100 isn't less than
100 which means that the loop will have
finished let's go ahead and add a system
dot out dot print line down here and
then we'll just write loop finished
so when we hit run here it did that
pretty quickly obviously so we can see
in the console we've printed out 0 1 2 3
4 etc and we've printed this out all the
way up to 99 and then the loop finishes
here so you can see how we can make our
programs dynamic using these loops you
can make it a bigger number printout
obviously up to that amount there
include all the numbers in between and
you're not limited to adding just one
you can add whatever amount so you can
see how using these loops the programs
are starting to become more dynamic so
there's actually an easier way to do
this thing we've done here for example
while a number condition is met and then
add one or add to add 3 each time and
then do something there's actually an
easier way to do that it's called a for
loop so let's go ahead and we'll just
remove this what we've done so far so
we'll keep this variable a here equal to
0 actually we'll delete that a variable
because what we're going to do is we're
going to do we're going to sub the for
loop the for loop looks like so we write
4 with the brackets and then do the
spike brackets like that and then this
the difference of the for loop is it
doesn't actually take a boolean value in
here the for loop needs to take three
parameters each separated by semicolons
so the first parameter it's going to
take is either an existing variable and
an initial value or we can initialize a
variable inside the for loop so we can
make an integer called a and set it
equal to 0 then we'll put a semicolon
that's the first condition we need to
setup so the first condition inside the
for loop is setting up a variable and
making it equal to something
the second condition inside a for loop
is setting the condition for the loop to
run for example in that while loop just
now we said whilst a is less than 100
and then we did a is less than 1000 we
can go ahead and write whilst a
is less than 100 for example and then
another semicolon and then the final
parameter we have to do is not it's not
necessary but obviously if we don't want
the loop to run infinitely the final
parameter is in what way we want to
increment or decrement the value that
we've initialized here so we're going to
say a plus plus so this is our fully
functioning for loop so the first thing
we do is initialize a variable give it a
value the second thing we do is give a
condition for the loop to run and the
third thing we do is increment or
decrement the number so let's go ahead
and just system.out.print line
print out the value of a and you'll see
we don't need to increment it manually
because it's doing in the for loop each
iteration of the for loop it's going to
check for this condition here and then
at the end of each loop at the end of
the code running in here it's just going
to increment it the way we've told it to
so you can see it did the exact same
thing but just in a different form of
syntax here and there's four loops
useful for when we start looking at
arrays which we will do soon but for now
this example is good enough we
initialize a variable we give it a
condition and then we can plus or minus
values to it and you're not limited to
adding one there's another way you can
increment numbers if you just want to
increment one you do the plus plus if
you want to increment a certain value to
it you can put plus equals and then a
number and that's basically this plus
equals here you can also do minus equals
the plus equals basically says adds the
number on the Left add the number of the
right sorry to the number led to the
variable on the left and if we run this
here adding two at a time you'll see we
only get the even numbers here because
we're adding two at time obviously so
that's how we do the for loop and
there's one final loop going back to the
first while loop that we had there's one
final loop I want to show you and that
is the do-while loop and the do-while
loop is slightly different from the
I loop the dowhile loop basically make
sure the code inside the while loop is
run at least once regardless of whether
the condition is met or not so let's go
ahead and make an integer a equal to ten
and let's go ahead and set that do-while
loop so we can say do with note the the
word do doesn't need any parameters here
we just have the spiked brackets but
then at the end of the spiked brackets
here we do need to setup the wild
condition so after this ending spoke
bracket we can write while and then give
a condition so we can say while a is
less than ten and then we can put a
semicolon so you can read this as do the
code inside the brackets here while this
condition is equal to true so why is
this one useful compared to the normal
while loop or like I said it's because
the code is run regardless of whether
the initial condition was met or not so
let's go ahead an add system.out.print
line would write hello world let's
remove this loop finish down here so as
you can see if this was a normal while
loop the condition a is less than ten
would be false because a is equal to 10
and 10 is not less than 10 so if this
was a normal while loop if this was up
here for example let's go ahead and run
that you can see that nothing appears
because while this condition is met and
this condition isn't met because 10 is
not less than 10
this code never runs here so if we just
move that back down there the do part of
the loop basically ensures this code is
run at least once before checking this
it basically means the code is run and
then the condition is checked as opposed
to the condition checked and then the
code is run so if we run this we'll see
we get the hello world printed out so we
say do the hello world statement here
and now check if this statement is true
and then it says okay this condition
isn't met we're not going to do the loop
again and then we move to the code down
here so that is the
prints between the while loop and the
duo loop and also the for loop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
