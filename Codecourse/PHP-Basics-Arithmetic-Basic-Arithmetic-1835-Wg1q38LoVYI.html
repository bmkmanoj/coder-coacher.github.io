to calculate certain values with PHP and
as with most languages PHP allows you to
add subtract divide multiply and perform
other arithmetic as well now we'll start
with some basic examples we'll move on
to some more complex operators and of
course along the way we will look at
some practical examples so let's start
with the example where we have a
variable called views and I'm going to
assign this initially the value 0 now
let's imagine we have a view count
stored somewhere for perhaps an article
on a website or anything like that in
this case every time the article is
viewed we would want to increment this
now obviously at the moment this is just
stored within our code we would have to
store this in a database but let's take
a look at how we would do this and then
later on you'll be able to learn how to
do things like store things in databases
so normally what we would do is say
something like views and then we would
reassign this the value now what we
haven't discussed is that we can
reassign a variable the same value so if
we were to do this and then echo out
views over in the browser
we would see we get 0 so we get exactly
the same result but what we can do now
is we can sign it the same value but at
the same time we can add a number on to
it and this would obviously give us 1 so
we can change this around to any number
we want of course we can change this
around to a float as well despite the
fact that this is an integer to start
with let's have a look at this and you
can see that that just works in exactly
the same way now what happens when we
add a string now you wouldn't normally
do this but you can see that it has the
same effect and that's the concept that
we spoke about earlier of typecasting
PHP will automatically cast this to a
number because it sees that we are
trying to add it on so for now let's
just stick to +1 now of course what we
can also do is down here we could say
views again equals views +1 and what
this would do is it would reassign it to
the value 1 because 0 at 1 is obviously
1 and then what it would do is it would
reassign it again this part variable
here is now 1 so we just carry on doing
it so you can see here we get
- so this is pretty straightforward but
there is a slightly easier way to do
this if you only wanted to add one onto
a number and that is to use plus plus so
what this will do is it will set views
to views plus plus but we don't actually
need to do this we'll have a look in a
moment now you can see here we've got 0
now what is happening here is we are
assigning it the value but all we really
need to do here is start off with a
variable say views plus plus and we end
up with 1 so it might be a little bit
confusing that we don't really all we're
doing here is we're telling PHP to
increment this by 1 and we could do this
multiple times as well so if we were to
do it three times you can see we end up
with three so pretty straightforward
okay so now that we know the basics of
adding let's take a look at a more
real-world example and we'll dive into
some other operators so let's say we
wanted to find out if we were running
some kind of website like code course
the percentage of an entire course that
had been completed so let's say we start
out with a variable called total lessons
and let's say that as part of that we
had say 30 lessons or 30 courses
whatever and we had a completed lessons
value and this is how many lessons or
parts the user has completed now what we
want to do down here is work out the
percentage of lessons that have been
completed so as we know the formula for
calculating the percentage of seven
inside of 30 is seven divided by 30 and
then it's multiplied by 100 now I've
already given you a clue as to some of
the operators we've used here so we can
go ahead and apply this to a new
variable so we're gonna say percentage
complete and we're gonna set this to and
we're going to use parentheses here
because remember the order of things
that we do if we have them in
parentheses they are run first now if we
weren't to use these we would get an odd
result and we'll take a look at that in
a minute so we just say completed
lessons and as we said it's divided by
the total amount so in this case it's
total lessons and then after this we
multiply this by a hundred now this
might seem odd but the asterisk symbol
is from
multiplying and the forward-slash here
is for dividing so as long as you
remember that then you're good to go
okay so now what we can do is we can
echo out you've completed and I'm using
double quotes here so we can place this
variable directly within it and we're
gonna say percentage complete and
remember we're using curly braces here
because we want a percentage symbol
directly after the variable and if we
didn't include that in there PHP would
show us an error and we'll just say of
this course or of all of our courses or
whatever we were going to say so let's
give this a refresh and you can see here
you've completed 23.3 recurring percent
of this course now obviously this value
here isn't anything that you would want
to output to a user because obviously
you would want to kind of round this
down now let's just take a very quick
look at what happens if we don't include
this percentage or these parentheses
sorry and if we come over you can see we
do get exactly the same result here so
it looks like what's happening here is
this divided by operation is being
completed first but in more advanced
cases it's usually a good idea to
include parentheses I like to do this
anyway just so I know exactly what
operation is being completed first
despite the fact that PHP picked up on
that for us okay so what we want to do
now is fix this problem with 22 23.3
recurring so we can do a couple of
things we can round this down or we can
use a handy PHP function called number
format and I would recommend using this
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
wrap the value that we get back from
this operation inside of that number
format variable we could create a new
variable if we wanted to or we could
just reassign it so let's go ahead and
reassign it and then I'll show you how
to inline this so it's a little bit
tidier so here we're gonna say number
format you can see that my text editor
has already given me that function for
me but that's pretty much it and then
all we do is we place in the percentage
complete so what that's done is it's
used number format this would have
returned to us a formatted number and
then it would have reassigned it to
percentage complete which we're using
down here so we should be good to go and
there we go so what this is done is it's
remove
all of the decimal places but what we
can do if you want it to be a little bit
more specific you can pass another
argument to this now we haven't looked
at functions yet but we will be later on
hopefully this isn't too confusing so if
I wanted to say well I want two decimal
places on here
you can see that it's given me
twenty-two twenty-three point three
three if I was to do one you can imagine
we get the same result you can
explicitly pass the arrow through to
here and we get the same result but
usually it's just a bit tidier to leave
that off and you can see that we get 23%
brilliant so let's look at inlining this
just so it's a little bit tidier there's
not really much need to create a new
variable here because this is a pretty
simple operation so what we would do in
this case then is we don't need this
line anymore
we can just go ahead and say number
format and then we can start our
parenthesis here and end just here so
we've basically wrapped that operation
we had before
inside the number format function give
that a refresh and we get exactly the
same result okay so we've covered
division and multiplication subtraction
is really simple you probably have
already guessed the operator for this
let's go ahead and look at a very basic
example so let's get rid of this one and
we're gonna say balance equals 500 just
imagine this is some kind of bank
balance and we have a cost of an item
and let's say that's 25 so we know that
in this case we would get 475 if we were
to subtract the cost and we can go ahead
and just echo the balance out and we can
assign this at the same time remember we
looked earlier that we can do that and
we're gonna say balance minor so it's
just a hyphen here and then minus the
cost like that so here we get 475 and of
course we can go ahead and get rid of
the echo there and do it on a new line
if we need to and we get exactly the
same result okay so we've already
covered incrementing but let's just
remind ourselves of doing something like
views equals zero and then saying views
plus plus and go ahead and echo views
because we're also gonna look at
decrementing the number as well
decreasing it by one if we need to now
we get one because we've added a view
count on here and the same pretty much
goes for decrementing we know that the
Plus symbol is to add now what we can do
is go ahead and use - - or - - to go
ahead and decrement view and naturally
because we started with the zero we now
know that - 1 we get the value minus 1
ok so now that we've looked at that this
brings me on to if we need to be a
little bit quicker and cleaner about
adding or subtracting larger numbers
than 1 we know that by doing something
like views equals 0 if we wanted to add
2 on to this we would have to say views
equals views plus 2 and sometimes when
you're programming it's just about being
a little bit quicker and a little bit
cleaner so let's say that we had some
kind of point system maybe we were
building a game and we wanted to add 10
points onto the score that the user has
accumulated well in this case we would
have to say points equals points and
then plus 10 a little bit long - right
what we can actually do here is we can
get rid of most of this and instead we
can say plus equals which is pretty much
the same as what we just did here so
that's a little bit shorter and a little
bit cleaner and just tends to be a
little bit faster to type so let's go
ahead and echo points and you can see
that we've got 10 so it's worked pretty
much in the same way and it's nice and
quick we can do the same for minus as
well so say if we wanted to add 10
points on and then maybe we want to do
remove two points we know that we would
end up with eight and that's exactly
what we get okay then so to finish
things off we're going to look at two
less frequently used but equally
important operators the first one is
modulus which will return the remainder
of a number when it's divided by another
so this is pretty useful in some
circumstances but if you are doing
calculations then this might be very
useful so I'm going to create two
variables a and B now to use the modulus
operator or we go ahead and do is either
assign this to a variable or echo it out
in this case I'm going to go ahead and
echo it out and we use a percentage sign
so if we do a mod or modulus B typically
we would call it mod then we'll see the
result here which
- so we know that the remainder here is
going to be - now this is obviously just
useful if you're interested in the
remainder of a number for any specific
reason but it also has other uses now
let's imagine that you were building
some kind of table and you wanted a
different color for each row of the
table within HTML if you know HTML
you'll know that you can apply classes
or styles to a table now we're going to
look at an example that uses a loop
don't worry we haven't looked at loops
yet but we will be covering that soon so
let's go ahead and look at this example
then let's say we wanted to output ten
rows within a table now we're gonna say
for now this is called a for loop which
allows us to initialize a number and
then go ahead and loop so run this block
we already know what a block is a
specific amount of times under a certain
condition so the first thing that we do
is we say row equals one so we're
creating a new variable that's not to be
confused with rows and then we're saying
while the row that we are looping in is
less than or equal to rows so that's the
amount of rows we want to loop and this
is where everything comes together when
we say rows plus plus so just to recap
what we're doing here we will be getting
one two loops but we're incrementing the
rows or rather row variable that we've
assigned here so it starts off at one
we're incrementing it and this is the
condition that this block continues to
run so while row which we're
incrementing is less than or equal to
rows then we go ahead and run this block
all this means in this case is we're
counting or rather looping ten times so
to test this out we can echo out let's
just echo one out and go ahead and apply
a HTML break if we go ahead and refresh
you can see we've got one two three four
five six seven eight nine and ten so
that's pretty much how you would count
from one to ten within a loop now what
we need to do is work out if a row is
even or odd and give it a color
specifically now we're not going to be
doing that because we'll dive into some
more practical examples later but all we
would want to do in here is use an if
statement to say or does the current row
number
maude two equals zero that means that we
have an even row that we can go ahead
and color otherwise we're gonna echo out
odd so you would apply a specific color
here all this means then is if we go
ahead and refresh you see odd even odd
even odd even odd even and so on and so
forth so we go ahead and increase the
value here and it would go ahead and
just continue to work you can bump this
up to any number as well so it's pretty
long here okay so hopefully that makes
sense but if it doesn't don't worry
we're gonna get two loops later and look
all that kind of stuff okay so the last
operator we're going to look at is the
exponentiation operator this will simply
raise a number to a specific power
personally I've never found a use for
this while programming but if you are
building something that does require
this then this is going to be really
useful and it's worth just knowing about
it anyway so I'm gonna create a variable
called a and obviously if we wanted to
raise this to a power of two we just use
two multiplied symbols two Asterix is so
in this case this would be ten times ten
because we've applied two we're raising
it to a power of two and obviously we
get the value 100 okay so next we're
going to just try this out with
something like nine and obviously this
means 10 times 10 times 10 nine times
and we know that this is a billion so we
end up with a billion we've got three
three and three so we know that that's a
billion so that is just an operator if
you do need it but day to day
development if you're building a product
it never really gets used okay so you
now have everything you need to work
with arithmetic in PHP you won't like I
said always need to use all of this but
specifically adding subtracting
incrementing decrementing are really
important and you'll probably be doing
that a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
