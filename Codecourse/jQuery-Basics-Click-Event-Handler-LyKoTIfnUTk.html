this jquery tutorial we're going to be
looking at the jquery click event
handler now in previous tutorials we've
looked at clicking a button to produce a
result and also with the paragraphs now
you need to bear in mind that you're
going you want to minimize in-line
scripting completely really with jQuery
jQuery provides easy functionality to
allow you to do this now the first thing
to bear in mind is that we want to take
our scripts our declarations where we've
actually included our scripts and
actually put these at the bottom very
bottom of our page and this allows our
page content to be loaded before we
actually make use of these scripts so
the first thing I'm going to do is take
these both here you can just take this
one here if you want but we can take
both of them and just put them at the
very bottom of our page here so we can
start to write our code in here so the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to create a button ok so the input type
is going to be button and we're going to
assign an ID to this button which is
very important now I'm just going to
call this click or let's save button
yeah button will be fine ok so now we're
not actually going to add an on-click
event in here and then call a function
here we're actually just going to remove
this completely and in our Jay func JS
file which we've included here we can
actually use a handler to handle the
clicking of this button so the first
thing I'm going to do is go ahead and
just create a div down here that we're
going to assign some text to or append
some text to using the HTML function in
jQuery so I'm just going to call this
button feedback so we're going to leave
this blank because jQuery is going to
handle the insert a ssin of some code
item text into here in Jay func we need
to actually set up the handler so to do
this we use a dollar sign and our two
brackets and we need to reference the
object that we want to be clicked which
is button or the handler that we want to
to look out for the event handle that we
want to look out for
so that's button hash button now we want
to say dot click and then inside of here
we can actually create a function that's
going to allow us to handle this and
this is called a callback function so
function we open up our curly bracket
and now curly bracket and then we can
just bring this down a bit okay so
simple as that now inside here is what's
going to happen when the button is
clicked so for example alert hello so
let's go back to our index dot PHP page
so when this button is clicked with the
idea of button obviously this is the
variable name it can be whatever you
choose when we click the button we're
going to get an alert to saying hello so
let's go ahead and test this in our
browser now we didn't give a value to
the button probably best to do that just
quickly click me so let's go back over
to our page and click click me and you
can see that we have a page or a dialog
box coming up saying hello so you'll see
that we haven't actually specified any
one click on this button but our
JavaScript file j4j s has actually
handled this for us so now what we can
do is we could say hash sorry dollar
sign in here hash button underscore
feedback dot HTML and this function will
just insert some data into our div
because we've referenced it button
feedback and in here we can just put
anything so button has been clicked okay
so now we're going to go back to our
page and refresh when we click this you
can see that we get the text up so we
eliminated the use of inline JavaScript
completely we haven't even called a
function from this button we've just
used our handler to do so now let's say
you had a couple of buttons on our page
let's just go ahead and copy and paste
these down and I'm going to call this
one here and say button two and button
three
an actual fact that sorry I've I need to
modify the ID rather than the actual
type sorry my mistake there that's
probably a key sort of tip to name your
ID something relatively different to
your type so you don't get confused okay
so now that we've done that we have a
button or three buttons and they are
called button button two and button
three now what I'm trying to do is I'm
trying to get the page to show the
feedback in this div with whatever
button I click on so if we head over to
our page and this is the result of me
adding these buttons so now if I was to
click on button one the event handlers
been triggered triggered because we have
the first button with reference with a
hash there and button so we've
referenced that ID if we then click the
second button nothing happens and the
third button nothing happens so there is
a long way you can do this and then a
short way now the long way would be to
copy and paste each of these down words
like this and then just change this here
however this is messy and there's too
much code with replicated code three
well twice from the original so what
we're going to do is we're going to
actually reference the element as
opposed to the actual ID so we're going
to say in here instead of hash button
we're going to remove the hash and we're
going to say input and then a colon
button and what this will look for is an
input field with your ID button so now
what's going to happen is this a event
handler is going to pick up on any
button that's pressed and then it's
going to give us our button feedback now
you might be wondering why would you
need such a technique well let's say you
had any amount of buttons down your page
and you wanted to say log when the
button has been clicked or something
like that for example if you wanted to
just log when someone had actually
clicked a button you could then use this
so it's just a general a general means
of checking if a button has been pressed
you'll probably find that when you are
writing in jQuery you'll probably find
some use for this in the future
okay so now we've got button one we can
click on that we get the result that
we've always seen but now if we click on
button two we get exactly the same
result if we refresh again click button
three we get that again so as you can
see we've eliminated the need for inline
JavaScript completely and we've just
allowed jQuery to pick up on these
events</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
