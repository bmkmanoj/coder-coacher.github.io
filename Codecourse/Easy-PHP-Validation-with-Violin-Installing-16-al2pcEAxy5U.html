looking at how we can easily validate
within PHP using the violin validation
library and this is a library that I've
created and in this series I'm going to
take you through all the steps you need
to get up and running with this and use
it in your own projects today so the
first step is to go ahead and install it
so we are going to be installing it
using composer if you don't already have
composer it works on multiple operating
systems you're just going to need to
head over to get composer dork to
download it and if you head over to the
violent github page you can actually see
the documentation here already so if you
want to play around with it yourself all
the information that you need should be
here otherwise
in this series we're just going to be
downloading this with packages so using
composer and then we'll get going with
it so the first thing that we want to do
then is inside of our text editor we're
going to create a composer JSON file to
pull this in as a dependency for our
project and this way we know that when
we host our files on a server we can
just run a command and have everything
pulled down for us much easier way of
installing things and we'll just be
looking at the examples in this on this
page here in our browser so the first
thing that we want to do then is like I
said create this composer JSON file so
we're going to create this just in here
and we're going to define the
requirements for our project and if we
had a head over to packages we can see
the versions that we have for violin now
bear in mind depending on when you are
watching this video the versions may
change things with that throughout the
code may change so you might find this a
little bit different to this series but
if that is the case you can just head
over to the documentation and refer to
that as well so we want to pull in
version 2.1 but 0 which is the latest
version so we can just click on this
copy that
and go ahead and just paste that into
here and if we open up a terminal within
the directory that we're in we can go
ahead and use composer installed to
download that so once that's done we can
go ahead and start using it and looking
at the basic you
search for it so that's downloaded let's
just instantiate this just so we know
how to work with violin and then in the
next video we'll look at some very basic
usage of this and then as we progress
through the series we'll start looking
at some more advanced ways to use this
so to actually pull our composer
dependencies in we require within the
vendor folder auto load dot PHP and if
you're not sure about this let's just
dive into here to see what's been
downloaded with composer
you can see that we have violin
downloaded you can view all of the
source code here so you can go ahead and
look through this and get familiar with
it if you want to you can also see a
list of the base rules within this rules
directory here these are all the rules
that are available so you can also dive
into these and see how these work - but
what we're interested in is creating a
new violin instance so we can start
using the validate method to actually
validate some data within our
application so all I'm gonna do here is
create a new instance of violin now this
is namespaced so you can either import
this at the top by saying use violin
violin or you can just replicate this
down here like that however you want to
do this I'm gonna do it this way so now
that we've done that we're ready to move
on to the next video where we're going
to be looking at some very basic usage
of violin and how you can use in your
project to make validation really easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
