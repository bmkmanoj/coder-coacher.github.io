endpoint for our application which is
going to allow us to submit a URL to
this end point it's going to generate a
link if the link doesn't already exist
and it's going to return us the full URL
and the code as well so I'm actually
going to change this 24 / API for test
generate just so it's a little bit more
appropriate we don't mix this in with
any of the other URLs that we've already
created here so we need to use a rest
client and I'm using poor for mac which
is a really good rest client it's just
super easy to use but there are other
alternatives if you want to go ahead and
google it and just have a look at what's
going to be good for you but generally
the concept is the same so you should be
able to follow along in the same way so
what we need to do is we need to create
a new request to a some endpoint and i'm
going to call this generate like so now
we're sending a post request remember
here to this API generate URL it's
inside of poor i'm going to paste the
full URL of my application just in there
then i'm going to set api generate now
what we can do and if you're not using
poor you can ignore this part you can do
it in other rest clients is I can set
environment variables so for example I
could set the host to this and then I
could hit done and I could type host
here and then do that and it would work
in exactly the same way so what we can
do now is actually send the request
through and you notice we get a 200 okay
so that's the HTTP code 200 everything's
gone fine we don't have any response
from this endpoint and that's because we
don't have any code in here if for
example we were to echo out hello and we
were to run that request again you can
see that we're under the webview we get
hello here but we don't want to do that
we want to only send back JSON which
means that it can be read within another
language so for example if you're
accessing this endpoint from within
another PHP application or another
back-end application it will work or
even JavaScript and then you can pass
that JSON and use that as you need so
we're only going to be outputting JSON
here okay so what do we need to do here
like how do we even get started well
what we want to do is pull in the
request body and the request body is
going to look like this if you come into
the body tab if you are using poor or
any other client we can start to write
JSON in here so i'm going to say URL and
then i'm going to say soco course com
I'm going to hit this that's going to
take this URL it's going to look it up
in the database if it does exist it's
going to return us a response with the
full shortened URL if it does already
exists it will do the same but just pull
that from the database so either way it
will create a record or it will return
the same record but if we don't have
this we want to give an error or if the
URL is invalid we also want to give an
error so let's focus on that first but
obviously the first thing we need to is
actually pulling this payload by payload
I mean the load of data that's sent from
our client to our server so I'm going to
create a payload variable and we need to
json decode something and that is the
body of the request so we can say app
request get body simple as that so let's
do a VAR dump on payload and all that
means is when we send a request here we
get back an object with that URL in
there so this is remember our
application and this is what we're
sending through to out through to our
application so we can now use payload
URL like that we send it through again
we see a string Co course com so from
this payload the first thing we want to
do is check does the URL actually exist
in here because without a URL we can't
shorten so going to check if
empty haloed URL and I guess we could
also trim this as well just to make sure
you can obviously add any validation or
modify this validation it's entirely up
to you so if that does happen we want to
respond with an error code so we want to
say app response set status 400 that's a
bad request so 400 means add request so
let's check this out in here if we get
rid of this and send that through we get
a 500 internal error oh I see trying to
get property of non-object let's check
this out so if we say empty payload or
the URL is empty then we just see 400
bad request there and we under the
headers we can see everything here but
we don't actually have a response so we
need to deal with the actual response
now so to do this again we use slim to
write a response here and inside of here
this needs to be a JSON encoded array
pull this in and what we want to do is
output error and another array in here
we're going to say code and we're going
to choose a code for this so we can say
anything 10,000 or 1,000 a message we'll
just say something like a URL is
required so now what we get is when we
don't send that through if you head over
to the sort of JSON view of this you'll
see that as well as the 400 bad request
we also have the error information so
whoever's using this API endpoint knows
what is wrong so that's our first check
we are going to refactor this because
we're going to be duplicating a lot of
code we're going to be working with
presenters but for now we will just run
along with this more refactor that in
the next video so the next thing we need
to do is check if the
given URL is valid so to do this we're
going to say if not built a vast if
filter vile whatever we're doing with it
returns false and we're doing or we're
checking payload URL and we're checking
for a valid URL now of course you can
use any method to validate the URL
filter Val's a very basic one but this
will accept things like FTP will accept
things like localhost so it really
depends on how much control you want but
you can feel free to update this so if
this does return folks that means we
don't have a valid URL so we're going to
set the response code again which is 400
I'm going to do pretty much the same
thing here so for now I'm just going to
copy and paste this down you can see
with duplicating a lot of code here I'm
going to change the error code and just
stick a one on the end and I'm going to
say a valid URL is required so by
sending this through with no URL we see
a URL is required but now if we do send
through a URL we can send an empty URL
as well we get the same response we send
a load of rubbish through we get a valid
URL is required may have a unique error
code for that as well so after this
everything's fine you can run more
checks if you want but after this
because we're returning from this
function this won't carry on until we
pass both these checks so what we want
to do now is attempt to look up an
already existing URL so if i say link
equals link where we did this earlier so
we know how this works payload URL and
then we'll grab the first record so we
don't actually have linked imported so
again at the top let's say that use
shorty models link and this now should
contain and the point in which we found
a URL or we've not found a URL so what
we can do is we can say if link that
means that we have found a link we've
found the link so we want to return
current code so that
if i was to type in DuckDuckGo it would
just return this code to us otherwise
what we would do is we would create a
new record so let's deal with this first
of all so we want to set the status at
201 which is created obviously we're not
actually creating anything but it gives
the illusion that we are creating a
record so let's just run this and test
this out so let's type in Duck Duck Go
com there we go so we get 201 created we
don't have any response body just yet
but we can go ahead and set that now so
what we want to do in here then is we
want to present the user the URL that
they've given just in case they need it
we want to present them the generated
URL and then the code itself just in
case they need that separately you can
obviously update this and do what you
want so we have pretty much the same
thing again here we're just copying and
pasting this code but this time we don't
want an error we want to say URL we're
just going to give them back the URL
that they passed in so that is payload
URL and here I'm going to create a
generated section 2 this and that is
going to contain the URL the full URL
and it's been going to contain the code
from that link so the code is easy we
can just say link code the URL slightly
more difficult so we'll tackle that in
just a minute so if i send this request
again you can see here that we get the
URL at the user sent through generated
we're not giving a generated URL at the
moment but we are giving the code back
from the API so we need to tackle this
URL part here then so what we need to do
is from app we can grab our base URL
that we set earlier and that is just
here just to fill your route all we need
to do is stick the code on the end then
so to do that we just say app config
ace URL we append on a /p remember we
remove the trailing slash here and then
we append on link code that's here so
when i refresh now not only do we get
the URL and the code we get the full URL
as well so imagine someone coming to
your API and saying right I want to
generate short URL for this they get
back they get a URL which i guess is
pointless but it just shows that we can
output this they get the generated
object here with the URL in which they
can then use to do whatever they want
with and then that will when we visit
this that will redirect them this whole
thing here we just paste it into our
browser will redirect them off to go so
we're now at the point where we have
returned if something already exists but
what if it doesn't already exist we need
to create a new link record so let's
create a new link variable and this is
going to be linked create this is all
part of eloquent we pass in an array of
the properties or the column names that
we want to store in this case it's just
the URL at the moment because we're
going to be generating the code after
this has been created because we need to
generate it from the unique ID in the
table so this is just payload URL we
don't need to sanitize this because it's
already done all with an eloquent for us
and now what we want to do is update the
code so all this will do is insert a new
record which we don't just want we want
the code that's the most important part
so we're going to set a new link update
and we're updating the code here so
we're updating this part of it so the
first command is going or the first line
of code here is going to create a new
record without the code and then the
second part here is going to upload that
code now to update that code we're going
to use the new link ID our we're going
to convert the base from 10 which is
obviously just the decimal system to
base 36 and this will give us a unique
code
every time because we know that our IDs
are never going to be the same they
increment from one up to whatever number
so we're always going to be generating a
unique ID unique code here but there is
a slight issue with this and we'll see
what that is just a moment so let's wrap
this in base convert it's already giving
us that helper there we want to convert
this number from base 10 to just our
decimal system to base 36 and it's as
simple as that and what we now want to
do is return to the user that something
has been created so we want to return
app sponsor right and we do exactly the
same as we've done here so let's just
pull back in paste that in there and all
this is now is new link code a new link
code like that that's pretty much it so
let's run this and see what happens
let's choose a different URL so let's go
for google code at UK let's send this
request through and there we go we get
google doc your code at UK the URL now
notice that we have code to now this
isn't necessarily an issue if you were
to build this and host it somewhere and
people were to start submitting their
app their URLs through to your app this
is still a unique code the problem here
is that converting to from base 10 to
base 36 is that it still stays at two
there's a way that you can remedy this
if you want to you can always append
additional characters on but that's
going to leave you with really ugly
codes what you can do is let's just
delete this record and let's go to our
table info here and let's change our
auto increment to a hundred thousand for
example so what's going to happen now is
when we create a new record the ID is
going to be at 100,000 now rather than
one two three four five so
all this is going to do is is going to
convert 100,000 from base 10 to base 36
and we will get a slightly better code
so let's run this again and there we go
so we get 2 55's so as you get more URLs
in your application this will grow and I
think this is actually a good thing if
you were to start at one you're your
auto increment starting at one that's a
sensible thing to do within a database
table and then you're a user who first
submitted would get a very unique URL
that get your URL and then forward slash
one and I think that's a good thing but
it's entirely up to you i wouldn't
recommend doing this and setting your
auto increment really high it sir it's
not an ideal solution really so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to delete this
record and I'm going to go ahead and
just change this back 22 so our next
record is going to be created at I adeeb
with an idea of two and I'll let you
decide how you're going to handle that
so let's do this once again and then we
there we go we get /to so now that we
have allowed ourselves to generate URLs
this looks a little bit messy so in the
next video we're going to start to
refactor this with presenters you don't
need to do this but here we're jus
placate in a large chunk of code here
we're droop leting a large chunk of code
and here as well which means we've had
to copy and paste a lot of code we can't
reuse this same response through other
routes easily we're just going to have
to come back here and copy and paste it
so we're going to look at how we can use
presenters to make this a lot easier and
a lot more reusable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
