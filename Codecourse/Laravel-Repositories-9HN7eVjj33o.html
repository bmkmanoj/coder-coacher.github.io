about repositories with laravel now as
you can see here I've got a very basic
blog I've got two blog posts and when we
click on the title we get the full view
and we can also return home now let's
take a quick look at the code here if we
go in the routes file we have our route
for the list which is just the home page
and then we have view ID which is the
route for the article view so in the
controller we have get list which just
displays all the articles on the home
page which is what you see here we're
just getting all articles from the
article model and we're returning a view
and passing those articles in now the
get view is when we open up an article
and read the full body so we're taking
in an ID we're finding it or failing it
with the article model and then we're
returning a view again now that's all
well and good but what if I wanted to
change the functionality of this so we
were retrieving articles from a file
instead of a database well I have a file
model here note that it doesn't extend
eloquent because it has nothing to do
with the database and instead of reading
from a file I've just written a very
very simple class here with storing
articles in the protected property and
then we can get all and then we can get
a single article not the best code but
it will work for this demonstration so
typically what we'd have to do is go
here we'd have to we'd have to change
the name with that model I'd have to do
the same here and change the method hit
refresh and we get there we get what we
want but it's not very practical if we
had a larger application with much more
code they would have to go through all
of that changing all the models and the
methods in that kind of stuff so I'm
just going to revert those changes and
we're going to look at how we can fix
that so the first thing that we need to
do is we need to create somewhere to
store our repositories
so typically to do this we create a
directory inside the app folder I'm
going to call it Acme and then here I'm
going to create another folder called
repository now inside of here I'm going
to create a new file and I'm going to
call this article repository interface
and in fact because we're using
namespaces we probably don't need that
repository in there so I'm going to set
the namespace to Acme repository I'm
going to say interface add call
interface and this is going to contain
two methods get and public function
actually we'll call this all and recall
this one get don't worry too much of
this doesn't make sense to you yet we're
going to be going over it in just a few
moments so the next thing that we need
to do is auto load our Acme folder all
the classes inside our Acme folder so to
do this we go to our composer Jason and
then the auto load I'm just going to
create a new object called psi zero and
then here I'm going to have Acme and I'm
going to set that to app so the next
thing that we need to do is run composer
update and that'll take a few seconds
and there we go so now what we're going
to do is we're going to close all of
this and we're going to create a new
folder inside of our repository
directory and we're going to call this
eloquent inside here we're going to
create a file called add called the PHP
and we're going to use the namespace
Acme repository eloquent going to have
class add call extends a add call
interface and we're going to have to use
that up here so Acme repository how to
call interface and we're going to have
to implement these methods
so let's think about this how are we
going to return all articles from the
database now we could just return
article all like so but I prefer to
inject my models using the ioc container
so i'm going to add a constructor I'm
going to expect an article Excel and I'm
going to store that up here so this
article equals article and in our all
method I'm just going to return this
article all I didn't get I'm just going
to return this article where a D equals
ID get okay so let's go to our
controller we're going to create a
constructor we're going to inject an
article interface so we need to copy
this namespace and we need to use it so
use Acme repository I call interface and
now we can type in this and say add call
repo store it in a property okay the
next thing that we need to do is bind
the class to the interface in the ioc
container now the best way to do this
will probably be to use a provider but
the save time we're going to declare
this an hour routes file so we're going
to say app bind we need to provide the
full name space so Acme repository
article interface and we're going to
bind this to our eloquent class
like so ok so I must yep this should be
implements try it one more time and
there we go so now what we can do
instead of calling article all we can
call this article repo all hit refresh
and we get the same result so now we
just have to change this one so this
article repo get ID and we're getting
another error let's have a look okay
this should be first hit refresh and
there we have it our our same as for our
blog works exactly the same now here is
the fun part let's say I want to use my
file model this instead of our article
model so all we have to do is create
that repository so file dot PHP will
have we have to copy this namespace
class file implement article interface
we'll just copy all of this for now we
want to change this to file file all now
very quickly I'm just going to change
I'm just going to remove all of this
static that was just for demonstration
purposes so get rid of this okay and
then we'll just copy the contents of
this article class and we'll change some
of this stuff
and we also need to change this method
down here to get ID okay so now all we
have to do is change this one onward
here to file hit refresh and we get our
file storage and if we use your
repository inside all of our controllers
you can imagine how easy that's going to
be to switch your storage system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
