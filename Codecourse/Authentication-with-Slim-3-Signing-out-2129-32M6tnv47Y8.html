console to sign ourselves out and test
this stuff we're going to go ahead and
implement signing out so this as you'd
imagine is very straightforward really
quick a method on our earth controller
we go ahead and create the route for it
and we can update our navigation as well
and we also need to update our class so
over in our earth controller we need a
method to be able to sign out obviously
we only need one because we just click
this and we're signed out so let's go
ahead and pop this at the top just here
so we have get sign out and into here as
usual we have our request and our
response so here all we need to do is
sign the user out and then redirect them
off so we can redirect them to the home
page or any way you like really ok so
let's just create our route for this
then we just grab one of these so maybe
it's sign-in route and we can just
change this to sign out simple as that
and of course here get to sign out and
we'll change the name of it so we can
use the path for method ok so now that
we have this let's just hook up our
navigation why not while we're at it so
down here for sign out just here
we'll grab this and we'll paste it over
here and change this to sign out so now
we should see we can click on sign out
we get a blank page but we can deal with
these signing out now ok so we want to
update our earth class and create a sign
out method here so why don't we do do
this down here I just want to we'll call
this logout actually it makes a little
bit more sense so in here all we need to
do is unset the session that we created
like so easy as that and now of course
over an hour Earth controller we know
that we can use auth because it's on our
container so we just need to say this or
logout simple as that so now we want to
redirect the user back so we want to
return a response with a redirect
and this of course will be coming from
our Rooter or use path for and pop them
off to the homepage so now hopefully
when we go and sign out
we are signed out and we redirected back
to the home page where ever we were
previously easy as that to sign the user
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
