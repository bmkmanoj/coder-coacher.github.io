do for the add category dot PHP page as
you now see when we try to add on
categorized again it does not actually
get gree added to the categories table
however we're not getting some sort of
message so we're gonna go inside add
category of PHP and here we are going to
say whoops PHP if it sets let's put that
on a separate line if is set error so if
there is actually an error now we're
going to echo whoops be error and then
we're gonna close that and that's it so
we can go here and when we add
Uncategorized again we get take care
category sorry already exists if we make
is more than 24 characters category
names can only be up to 24 characters
and when we submit an empty field we see
that that also works okay now we can
move on to the category list this will
simply list all the categories in well
the order doesn't matter so we're not
gonna order it but basically what we're
gonna do here is inside here we're gonna
open up new PHP block and we're gonna
say for each get categories as category
so again we have not made this get
categories function yet so we're gonna
do that now so here we just need all the
categories we don't need to retrieve any
specific categories so what we're gonna
do here is we're gonna start very basic
and I'm going to say categories equals
array so we're going to stored the
category data in an array and we'll just
do my sequel query select ID and name
from the categories table oops
there we go then we do while row equals
my sequel fetch Assos query categories
and then we're going to add another
element to it and that will be the same
as row basically what this does is it
makes categories which is an array and
we store a category in it and that has
an ID as well as a name if we would have
another one say test that would have an
ID of two and test and then we can
simply loop over this and easily display
the data of course we also need to
return categories so that's fine for now
let's see if this works so I'm just
going to echo category name with
a break again just to see if it works
going back to the index oh of course I
emptied the index so that's not going to
work I'm going to category list.php
undefined function up here we go again
of course I need to include in its
don'ts PHP now refresh and we see on
categorize so let's add another category
say PHP and now when we go to the
category list we get both of them good
now of course this needs to be a bit
more expanded on again my English is
good enough but not top-notch so I don't
know exactly how to say some things I
just hope you understand anyway we are
going to provide a link to the category
so we're just gonna put every category
in a in its own paragraph just to make
it a bit easier to look at I'm gonna say
a or F equals I'm just going to do
category dot PHP ID equals and then we
echo category ID and in here we will
echo oops
PHP echo category 9 and now when we view
this we get them as links and here we
see the ID equals
and here it's two now for every category
we also want to be able to delete it so
we're going to add that behind it a rap
equals I'm immediately gonna close it
again we're gonna say deletes category
dot php' ID equals and then once again
echo category ID and in here we're just
going to say deletes refresh it's now we
have to delete links so that's the next
thing we're going to do we're going to
delete category dot PHP and in it we're
going to as usual include in its dot PHP
now we're going to check if the ID was
actually set so in other words if a
category is specified and this could be
expanded upon a lot but this gives you
basically how it should work and if no
ID was specified in the URL that's what
get does we're going to redirect the
user to index dot PHP and we'll kill the
script now otherwise we're going to
delete something and then once again
will redirect to index dot PHP so delete
a new function it takes two parameters
field of course since we're using it in
a query hoops my sequel real escape
string field and for the ID since it's
supposed to be an integer we can just
cast it to an integer and then we use
the delete syntax
so we'll say delete from and here we say
field should be table just making it a
bit more semantic table select or delete
from table so we're using a sort of more
dynamic query people often seem to
forget that this is also possible it's
very useful so delete from table where
ID equals ID and that finishes that up
and now of course we need to say here to
lead from categories where ID equals
gets ID so let's add another desk
category so test and we'll go to
category list or PHP and now let's
alright let's redirect to category
list.php now when I hit delete here Oh
still redirects to index doesn't matter
we'll look at that later category list
or PHP and we see it's still there
once again I made a mistake that's good
it shows you debugging but I pass the
10-minute mark so I'm gonna stop it here
and in the next video we're going to
sort this out so body</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
