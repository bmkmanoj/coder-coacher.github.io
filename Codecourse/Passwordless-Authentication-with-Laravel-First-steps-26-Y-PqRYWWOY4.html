need a completely fresh laravel project
if you are working on an existing
project don't worry this is going to be
very easy to integrate because we're not
going to be interfering with the normal
authentication flow so I'm currently in
Homestead I don't have a project
installed so I'm gonna use composer to
go ahead and just create a laravel
project in here and I happen to just be
calling this fresh so we'll wait for
this to finish and we'll get the rest of
laravel set up and then we can move on
to create that all-important new login
view okay so now that that's finished
let's open the project in our text
editor and we're gonna start to do
things like generate our authentication
we're gonna run our migrations now
without migrations we don't need to
modify the default migrations that come
with laravel so we know that we have a
user's table and we have a password
resets table this pretty much will work
in exactly the same way like I said
before we're not going to be tinkering
with anything to do with the normal or
flow we're just gonna be kind of adding
a new layer on to this and then falling
back to the normal authentication flow
if the user chooses to go ahead and run
this so let's just run our migrations
just before we do that heading over and
making sure our database settings are
sorted so in my case I'm using homestead
and all I've done is just created a new
database over here called fresh and it's
completely empty at the moment so
running our migrations if we just CD
into that directory first and there we
go so next thing is generating our auth
so we just run PHP artisan make auth and
then is pretty much it so heading over
to the browser
give that a refresh and we have our
project set up so we have our login root
we have our register root and we can
just go ahead and register as normal and
it will just work so just to test this
I'm gonna go ahead and create an account
anyway because we'll need that for later
and there we go I am signed in brilliant
so I'm going to sign out because what we
want to do is rather than this linking
through to this page we want it to link
through to something like login slash
magic or whatever you want to call it I
happen to be calling it a magic link but
of course feel free to call this
whatever you want so really what we want
to do then is start to modify
yes now to change the link over
obviously we want to come over to the
app blade PHP far and this is found over
in our templates if we just open this up
because we're going to need to create a
new view so it's under layouts and app
so when we click the login link just
here we want this to go through to login
magic rather than the normal login flow
so hopefully this makes sense we don't
really kind of want to modify this
because really if you think about it
it's part of the normal laravel
authentication routes and we don't have
to kind of pull these over and modify
much we're just kind of putting this on
top of what we already have so obviously
this page doesn't exist at the moment
but the only problem here is that we
when we say access slash home which is a
protected route and if we just come over
to our controllers we know that we have
by default a home controller just here
and this happens to be protected by
author middleware so when we do go over
to this we're redirected over to forward
slash login so what we want to do is
change this so it redirects to login
slash magic now this is slightly
different in laravel 5.3 which is the
version we're using now this is actually
now under our exceptions and handler so
basically down here we have an
unauthenticated method just here and
this will allow us to forward to a
particular page now in our case it's
login slash magic and that's pretty much
all we need to update and that's pretty
much done so now when I go over to slash
home we redirected over to login slash
magic so you user can click this thing
here I think on the home page with the
welcome view this probably won't be
updated so let's just quickly come over
to that and update that as well of
course you'll probably be replacing this
with your own home page but let's just
update that to login such magic sorry
okay so all pretty much good to go we
can hit login and we come through - if
we just refresh that login such magic so
the next step then is to create our
magic login controller which we're going
to put under auth and of course set up
our routes as well so if we just come
over to routes web we
want to just create a basic route to go
through to this page so we can render
out our new view so this is just gonna
be login slash magic and the controller
we're gonna create is inside of auth
because obviously it is auth and we're
gonna call this magic login controller
and I'm just gonna say show like so ok
so now that we have this let's generate
this magic login controller from the
command line so PHP artisan make
controller we're gonna stick this under
auth so we can just do that and there we
go so that is our controller generated
so we obviously need that show method so
let's just create this now and obviously
this is just responsible for returning a
view so if we return a view here we can
just stick this in author magic login
and if we come down to here we already
have an auth folder let's create a new
one for our kind of magic login stuff so
inside of here then login blade PHP and
what we're gonna do is steal the
template from the normal login because
it's pretty much going to be the same so
if we just paste this in we can start to
change things around here first thing
I'm gonna do is get rid of forgot your
password because we don't really need
that on a her magic lookin controller or
view because these doesn't need their
password and obviously we're gonna get
rid of the password field as well so
let's just take a look at this just so
we can see what it's about and it looks
like that's not working and I've called
this logic for some unknown reason there
we go
so we've got an email address which we
obviously need we have Remember Me which
we also need but the login button isn't
gonna say login because obviously what
we're not doing is instantly locking the
user in so instead what we're going to
do is modify this just to say send magic
link but what we kind of also want to do
is down here create an anchor which
allows the user to login with their
password instead now this is entirely
optional you don't have to do this but
asking around generally I found that
people do actually want the option to
log in with a password as well so we're
gonna say login with password instead
and we're just going to do a right arrow
in there
and for the class for this we're just
gonna set this to a button and a button
link and then for the href this is just
gonna go through to the normal login
page so we can just use the URL helper
to generate the full path and just say
forward slash login so now we should see
the following brilliant so we can login
with a password instead if we prefer or
we can just enter our email address
hit Send magic link and that will email
the link off to us so pretty
straightforward stuff now we also need
to consider validation because I copied
this over from the standard login page
we already have all of our validation
stuff in here so really we just need to
handle that over on our controller when
we actually go ahead and submit this
through so the last thing I just want to
do is just update the login dot PHP that
we've just created to just go through to
login slash magic and of course what
we'll be doing in the next part is
creating our post root which will allow
us to request a magic login link</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
