building a URL shortener with laravel so
let's jump in and take a look at how
this is going to work first of all you
can see that I have a database with the
following fields we've got an ID URL
code and laravel x' created and updated
at fields we'll be using this table
structure to store our URL and codes so
there's nothing in there at the moment
let's go ahead and shorten the URL and
hit shorten and you can see that that's
given me a short URL well in this case
it's not short but if you were working
on a domain this would just be your
domain name slash and then this code at
the end but for the sake of having to do
this within this directory when we go
ahead and click on this that's going to
take us through to Google and you can
obviously copy and paste this to
wherever you wanted so inside of the
database now if we select everything
from this links table you can see that
we've got a URL a code and we've also
got a high number for the auto
incrementing ID this is optional because
we're gonna be using base convert to
actually generate the code so it's
unique and you'll notice that if I type
in the same URL and hit shorten we get
exactly the same value back so what
we're not doing is we're not duplicating
content inside of our database table if
a URL has already been shortened we'll
return the same code to the user so
we're not duplicating URL content so
that's the URL shortener that we're
gonna be building also including things
like validation if I were to type in
something in here that wasn't a URL
we've got front end validation as well
with the html5 input type of URL but
we're also doing your URL validation on
laravel side as well with the validator
so we'll learn about that too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
