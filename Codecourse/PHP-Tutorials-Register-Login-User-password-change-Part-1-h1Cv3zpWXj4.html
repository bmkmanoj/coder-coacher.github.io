of the user login we're going to need to
know how the user can change their
password or we need to know how to give
the user the option to change their
password if they need to need to so this
shouldn't take too many parts of video
probably two parts I think of Emacs but
what we're basically going to do is
we're going to give the user a form
we're going to say to them type your old
password in the new password twice we're
going to check the role password to the
one that's in the database remember
they're encrypted and we're going to
compare their two new passwords to see
if they match so if I haven't made any
mistakes and then we're going to update
the database which we're going to use
some new SQL code so this is useful for
that s QR code if you already know how
to do the rest of it okay it's slow
the first thing I'm going to do is start
my session so we can see in our member
page we've got session start here I'm
just going to copy and paste that to the
top of my page so we've started our
session we're going to need this because
women going to need to set a variable
good user and that's going to be equal
to the session that we've set amongst
the pages now we need to check that the
user is logged in first this is the code
I was talking about before we start to
change their password or let them change
their password so I'm going to set this
as my user variable as my session
username which is here okay now we're
going to just do is say if the user
exists we're going to give them the
option to change the password otherwise
we're just going to say kill the page
and say you must be logged in to change
your password so mister nothing to
change
your your password okay so here is user
is logged in okay so the first thing we
need to do and presumably user has
logged in so check for the existence of
the login we need to give them a form to
fill out so I'm just going to echo out
some code and this is going to be a form
it's a self it's a self submitting form
so it's going to go back to password
change password at PHP so back to the
page we're already on and we're going to
use a check inside this page to check
all our details as a method of the form
is going to be post because we don't
know any possible information into the
URL bar and we're going to create a few
input boxes so I will password and I'm
going to do this isn't going to be
increase isn't going to be a password
type so it's not going to blank out the
users entry so input type equals text
and then equals old password password
and I'm going to do a paragraph break
and I'm going to say new password and
create a input type as a password so
that's hidden from everyone and the name
of this is going to be new password and
then a break after that we can just
basically copy this line down and just
change a few things
so repeat you password and we just need
to change the variable name of this to
repeat new already Oh new password so
repeat new password and then finally one
will ask paragraph break and we need a
submit button name of that is just going
to be submits we're going to need to
check if that's be impressed and the
value is going to be changed password
okay so let's go to our page and
mystical link in
the members page in order for us to
change our password I'll just log in
using the details my password at the
moment that's ABC my user name is Alex
as soon as I log in it says you're in
and here we go here's the member page
our sessions been set
we need logout we can already logout but
we need another option to change our
password so I'm going to go back back to
our member member dot PHP page and I'm
going to create another link so that is
going to be change or change password
and this is going to be linking to
change password dot PHP so if we refresh
this we've got another option click it
and the graph form that we've just
created up our old password to type in
here and my new password here okay now
at the moment nothing happens we click
the form nothing at all happens and what
we want to do is we want to check for
the fact has this been submitted or not
so let's tidy this up a bit what we need
to do here is create a if statement to
say if post submit this basically means
has the user pressed this submit button
and the name is submit therefore we've
got submit written here and if the user
has submitted we're going to start
changing our password otherwise if the
user hasn't submitted all we're going to
just do is echo out our code here
because if the user hasn't already
submitted then they're going to need to
be presented with the form here in order
to submit form so let's just give it a
check and here what we're going to do is
just echo out test' to check that this
works and we can go back and we can fill
in so while we don't even need to fill
in data at this time but if I click the
submit button we get a echo out of test
to show that our form has been submitted
successfully ok so we need to start
changing the password in fact what we
need to start doing at the moment is
feels okay so we've got our a couple of
variables we need to set we've got our
old password and that's going to be
equal to posting the variable name of
our password as you can see down here in
our form and I'm just going to replicate
these for each value that we've been
term in the next one's new password and
then we've got repeat new password and
we'll just change these just being quite
lazy so okay so to make sure these were
working and I do recommend you do this
all the time is old password new
password' and 'repeat new password what
this basically does is just after we've
submitted the form it checks for the
form existence has it been submitted and
then we gal variables into our variable
name we get out get a post variable into
our variable names and I'm just going to
echo out what we've typed in the box
just to check that everything's working
so no more possibilities ABC or more a
new password to be one two three change
the password and we've got ABC one two
three and one two three so all the form
information has been submitted I know I
haven't spell anything wrong and from
here I can be confident I'm going to go
on and just get my user cell with a new
password okay I'm going to stop the
video here I'm doing short shorter time
videos now it's quite long and ten
minutes from one video and I'm also
getting a bit of a time lag on these
videos so I'm going to stop it here and
in the next part we are going to check
for the old password against the
password in the database I'm also going
to check that the new password and the
repeated password match and then from
there on we can go and straight ahead
change the users password for them okay
so I'll see you in the next part this
