until now you've probably been using the
UNIX timestamp so if we just echo time
go to our browser hit refresh this is a
UNIX timestamp now obviously if we want
to accept date of birth and now our user
registration for example if the user is
maybe 50 years old then they won't be
able to input their data birth because
the date of birth was obviously before
1970 so how do we remedy this well we
use PHP date/time so if we set DT to new
big time and we echo DT format why which
means echo the year just to demonstrate
that this is working refresh we get 2014
which is the year that this video was
recorded so if we replace this with
something like day month year refresh we
get first of the first of the fifth of
2014 which is today's date we can also
output that the hours in the minutes and
even the seconds this is just PHP date
format which you can look up in the
manual so just to demonstrate that this
allows dates before the before 1970 I'm
going to uncomment this actually I'm
going to add a parameter and I'm just
going to say first of May 1948 1949 teen
40 so if we go to our browser and
refresh we get the first of May 1940
which is perfect that's what we just
entered in our constructor and the
reason that we're not getting in or this
is a valid time the reason that we're
getting midnight here is because we
didn't add a time we were to enter for
example 11 p.m. then we'd get 11 p.m.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
