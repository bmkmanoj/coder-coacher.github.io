to our database but what we didn't look
at is actually removing column names if
we don't need them so this is equally as
important because if you've got
redundant columns in your database table
that you don't need it's probably a good
idea to go ahead and remove them if it's
safe to do so
so what we can do is go ahead and
describe our current articles table
articles and we can see that we've got
name description created and ID so let's
say I wanted to go ahead and create a
new field called updated just to give
maybe an updated date of when the
article was last updated I can go ahead
and alter table articles add column and
then I choose the column name so updated
and then the type date time so that's
going to go ahead and update that and
give this updated column with the type
of date/time and blah blah blah now
let's just say you know times gone by
and I want to go ahead and remove this
how do I go ahead and do this well we
use the same command we use alter table
and then we choose the table name that
we want to alter which is articles but
this time instead of adding a column we
use the drop keyword so he dropped
you're often finding MySQL that drop
means just get rid of so drop column and
then we choose the name of the column
that we want to drop in this case it's
updated and that's as simple as that we
just hit enter that's gonna go ahead and
drop it now bear in mind this is again a
very dangerous command if you want to go
ahead and drop a column and it contains
data that data will be lost so you're
dropping a column and your data is gone
so you know you won't have that data you
know kept somewhere it'll just be gone
with the column removal so now let's go
ahead and describe the articles table
and you can see that the table we get
back no longer has the updated column
we've successfully added and then
removed a column name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
