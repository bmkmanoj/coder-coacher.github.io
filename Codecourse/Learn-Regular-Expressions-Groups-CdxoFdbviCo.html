at groups how they capture and how we
can set a group so it doesn't capture so
in this regular expression up here I'm
going to match an email so let me add
some emails in here oh I'll add Alex's
and I'll add just a sample one and let's
have another one example that will set
Jane example calm
okay so let's match some of these well
the first thing that we want to match is
these characters here so we do that with
the dot sign if you remember but what if
a user enters a special character as
this email address we obviously don't
want that so instead we're going to use
a character set and this is going to be
a to z 8 to Z and 0 to 9 and we also
want to allow the user to enter
underscores like so so we're also going
to add that in there
next we want to match this and symbol or
this add simple and we should probably
make this character class multiple okay
so next we want to match this domain
name so let's say what we'll create a
new character class again or say a to z
a to z 0 to 9 and we'll set that the
plus and then we want to add a dot and
because this dot matches all characters
we need to escape it so now we can just
copy this and paste that in there and
that will work but what if a user enters
a some sort of gibberish domain name so
like that well we don't want note so
instead I'm going to create a group and
I'm going to set some domains in here
and I'll just change this to net for
this example so we're going to have Aqua
Alex we need to add our pipe we're going
to have comm for Joan for John sorry
pipe and we're also going to have net
for Jane and of course you'd want to
sorry at net and of course you'd want to
add some more domain names if you were
using this in production but for this
example this works
fine now one thing that we haven't
looked at in regular expressions yet is
substitution so if we go down here and
click the substitution tab what we're
going to do is we're going to replace
these emails with something else so if I
say foo all of these emails are going to
be replaced with foo now what we can do
is we can use the dollar symbol and then
specify a number so in this case 1 then
we get the match from our group and
because we're getting a match this is
called a capturing group but it's a
little bit pointless just to get the
domain or the TLD so what we want to do
instead is get the whole email address
so what we're going to do is we're just
going to encase this inside of a group
like so and now our first result is the
email itself now we could just leave it
like that but if we put dollar two then
we're still getting these two your DS
and to be honest that's fine but for the
sake of practice I want to get rid of
these so we are only going to have one
match so to do that we need to make this
group non capturing and we do that by
adding question mark colon after the
opening print parenthesis so now you can
see that we get dollar two so no second
group has been captured if we change
this back to dollar one then we get the
full email address</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
