project is about and often includes some
level of documentation now you don't
have to include the entire documentation
here because github has a wiki feature
for this which is a lot more organized
now as you can already see we already
have a readme file from when we first
created our repo but we're going to add
some content to it and then push it up
readme files are written in markdown
which is a text HTML language and it's
really popular and widely supported
basically you write the text and it's
parsed to HTML like you can see here if
you already know markdown you can
probably skip this as I mainly just
going to be adding some markdown and
pushing the changes up to github so
let's look at what we have now readme by
default it's just a title here which is
above these equal signs and a short
paragraph which is the description that
we provided when we created our repo now
I'm going to add another paragraph and
I'm going to add some examples so here's
another paragraph and let's add a code
example
and let's add a numbered list so this is
a list and we can do bullet points like
so you get the idea so you can go ahead
and look up the markdown syntax which
will let you format the readme for your
project than any way you want you can
include links as well so like so and
they'll be passed automatically to links
that you can click
unless you want text-based links in
which case you do some square brackets
what you want the link to appear as and
then in curly normal parentheses you
just put the link in there so Iran get
status so we can go ahead and add this
check that's been committed at check
that's been staged and then we can go
ahead and commit there we are so if we
push this into our details
Oh so we've now pushed this up if we
head over to our repo and check you can
see that we have nicely formatted
content great so now we've added a
readme file to our repo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
