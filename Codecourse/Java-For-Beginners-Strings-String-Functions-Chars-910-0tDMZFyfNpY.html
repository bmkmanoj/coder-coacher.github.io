this Java series for beginners in this
video we're going to be looking at
strings and characters so the first
thing we're going to do is look at the
string variable type so we've seen a
literal string usage if we just do
system dot out dot print line you can
see right in here we can put speech
marks and write stuff like hello world
so it's all very well using these
literal values here but what if we want
to make a string variable what if we
want this hello world to be equal to a
variable so we can use it in other
places so let's go ahead and take a look
at the most basic form of this if we go
ahead and write the word string make
sure it's a capital S because it's not
actually a primitive type built into
Java is actually an object and we'll be
looking at that later on but for now
just write a string with a capital S so
this is going to declare a string
variable type we can give it a name as
usual we're going to call it message and
then set it equal to we can just copy
and paste this so exactly the same as if
you are declaring an integer or whatever
just slightly different syntax we're
declaring a string variable type not an
integer
obviously we give the variable a name as
in every other case and then we set it
equal to a string and bear in mind it
has to be in the speech marks here you
can't you can't not have these speech
marks you need them in there to make
sure the Java compiler can read it
properly so if we go ahead in
system.out.print line and we print out
the message you can see we get the same
effect because we've set hello world
equal to this message here and then
we're printing out that message so let's
look at some of the functions we can do
with strings so let's go ahead and make
space between these and let's do
different things with this string
message here and then print them out see
what happens so if we go ahead and write
message and then put the . we can see
all of these functions to do with the
string and there is a lot of them a lot
of them won't be we won't be using like
ever but a lot of them we can you
so let's go ahead and do the first one
we'll go ahead and do concatenate here
you may have seen this in other
programming languages but um if you
don't know what concatenate means it
basically means sort of add on to the
end a different string is basically like
adding numbers together except you're
adding strings together so if we have
this hello world here and then we say
message dot concatenate and then go
ahead and write a different message so
we can add that on to the end of this
hello world message here and this
message what this does this string does
here it doesn't actually set the value
of this message equal to this plus the
string added on here it's actually just
going to return the value of what it
would be if if this was added on to this
here so we're going to actually need to
set message equal to that so we can say
message equals that so what we're doing
is we're initializing a string variable
called message equal to hello world then
we're setting message equal to this mess
the message itself and then we're
concatenated on this string of text here
so when we hit run we can see we get
that concatenated string we've merged
this string with this string using this
concat method so there's another method
we can use it's called there's two
methods actually going to show you
called to upper case and to lower case
and these have various uses first of all
we're going to say message again we're
going to say equal to message dot and
then we can say you can see them here to
lowercase to uppercase and you probably
guess what they do already you can just
click them and then do a semicolon when
we hit run you can see every character
that was capitalized changes to
lowercase and then vice versa if we say
to uppercase we could see everything
goes all caps
so those were three pretty simple
functions that I've showed you we're not
going to go in depth on each of these
functions just because they're pretty
simple and I'm literally just showing
you them so just for sort of educational
purposes well I mean this is a tutorial
that's what I'm doing for everything
obviously but this is a basically pretty
simple and it's not that hard to grasp
so that's why I'm just going over it
pretty quickly so let's remove these
ones we had here and now let's see how
we can um let's see how we can use
individual characters inside the string
and how we can manipulate them so you
remember there's an inbuilt variable
type called char for character and we
can set this equal to any individual
character that we have on our keyboard
and we use the single quotation marks
instead of double quotation marks so
what we can do with a message is we can
break it down into its character parts
we can break it down into the H that e
the lvl etc so let's see what we can do
using individual characters the first
one we can do or another easy function I
can show you is replace and it replaces
one character a character that you
specify with another character so if I
say message is equal to message replace
and it's the second one here with the
characters it takes two parameters the
first one is which character do you want
to replace and the second parameter is
with what do you want it to replace it
with so in the single quotation marks we
can say for example let's replace the
the lowercase O's with zeros and then
let's copy this line down and then we
could say replace the ease with threes
and we can replace the ELLs with ones so
this doing these three functions here
all the O's it finds it will replace
with zeros is replaced with threes and
elves replace with ones and you'll see
if we run this
we get a hello world with the numbers
change four letters so the replace
function again pretty simple we're
setting message the variable here equal
to itself but replacing different
characters within it and then when we
print out at the end we end up with this
so let's now break the string down into
its character elements and we're going
to use the for loop that we learn in
previous tutorials to do to make arrays
of characters and then we're going to
loop through them so let's go ahead and
start with our hello world message that
we have here so we're going to break
this hello world message down into an
array of characters and we're going to
do this by saying char array like so and
then we're going to call it characters
and it's going to be equal to the
message dot and then the method here to
char array and it's as simple as that
we now have an array of characters here
which is pretty much the same as doing a
like so this character array actually
let's not delete all of that we'll just
comment it out quickly this is basically
the same as having this the H comma
separated e komo separated L comma
separated L etc and then it would say
hello world all spread out with each
individual character being a separate
slot in this array so with this
character array let's go ahead and loop
through it using the for loop so with
from last tutorial we're going to write
four and then we're actually going to do
it a slightly different way this is a
different way you can use for loops and
it's a pretty cool way it's an there's a
way you can loop through it so it's an
easy way to loop through arrays when you
know you're not going to need the value
of the the integer that's incrementing
each time and a lot of practical cases
in Java you will need the D integer this
incrementing you're going to need the
value of it the specific iteration now
you're on of the loop but in this case
if we just want to print these out we
don't actually need the
value we can go ahead and do this new
syntax for the for loop and the syntax
is we first say a variable type and then
just give it a name so we'll just say
char C and then we do a colon and then
write the array we wish to loop through
so let's go ahead and do characters and
then we're going to do the spoke
brackets like so and what this basically
says it says loop through every value in
the array characters and on each
iteration assign the value of that
iteration to this variable C so the
first loop C is going to the first
iteration C will be equal to H the
second one it will be equal to e the
third one L fourth one L etc so if we go
ahead and system dot out dot print line
these and do see paths in this variable
will see that it prints out each
character individually like so and if we
actually change it to print instead of
print me to a new line you'll see that
it prints out the message normally just
individual characters being printed out
so this was just this two video we're
showing you some basic string functions
we can use how we can change a string
down into its core components of the
individual characters and also the new
way that you can write the for loop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
