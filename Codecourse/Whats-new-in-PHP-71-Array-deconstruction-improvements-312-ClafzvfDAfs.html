array deconstructing or deconstructing
arrays however you want to say it and
you may or may not be familiar with the
list method now this is existed way
before PHP seven I think even before
php5 so we're going to take a look at
how we use this first of all and then
we're going to look at some of the
improvements that have been made on this
as well so generally the way this works
is let's say that we have some kind of
response back maybe from an API or from
our database and we had a few values in
here like so now this isn't really that
helpful because if we wanted to output
say the user's name we would have to say
something like response zero which
really isn't that helpful now if we know
the structure of the response is always
going to be the same this works but what
we can actually do and like I said this
is existed previously is we can list out
what we want in the correct order and
then they become variables so what we
would do for the syntax is say list
equals response we assign this and then
inside of here we give each of these in
order what we need so for example name
age and color so in this case I could
just go ahead and air current name and
this is a little bit more convenient now
you can see we get exactly the same
result the same for age as well like so
and of course the same for color so this
is really useful on its own just to kind
of clear things up and tidy things up
otherwise you would have to do things
like name equals response zero and do
that for anything else now the
improvements that have been made to this
are very simply going back to when array
was changed to the square bracket
notation so you may know that to create
an array you can use the array keyword
or you can create an array using the
square brackets as we've done here so
you may see it like this but really this
is just kind of too much code to write
so the improvement was good there but it
doesn't apply to list what we can now do
though is do a similar thing to this and
let's just comment this out but we can
use square bracket notation here so it's
a lot cleaner so you can see that this
will work in exactly the same way like
so so we get
p the same result so much faster to type
much easier to kind of look at and
cleaner to look at and i think this
makes a lot of sense now the other
improvement is more of a kind of
flexibility improvement let's go ahead
and get rid of this and change the
response to actually have keys so we may
get a response back like I said from an
API or a database that has maybe actual
keys for this array so maybe you have a
color here which is blue ages 27 name is
Alex now in this case if we were to try
and do this previously and let's just go
over to PHP version 7 to check this out
if we were to do say list name age and
color and assign response here and we
try and echo out name let's take a look
at what we get so let's come over to PHP
7 give that a refreshing we get an
undefined offset 0 undefined offset one
under find offset to now naturally
there's a problem with this because now
we're kind of back to square one it's
going to be a little bit more difficult
to extract these out of course what you
can do is go ahead and assign or either
echo out response and then name but
sometimes you still want to use list so
let's get rid of this go back over to
PHP 7.1 and see how this is improved now
we know that we can use square bracket
notation to do this instead so I'm going
to go ahead and roll with that what we
can now do though is say well we want to
extract out from this here the name and
give it the variable name name and then
we can do the same with age so we could
grab that and call it age and we can do
the same with color and we could call
that color and the beauty of this is we
don't need to do it in this particular
order so for example I could get rid of
this and I could put it just before age
if I wanted to really how it makes sense
for you now what i can do is echo out
name and it's taken from this key that
value and it's assigned it to name so
now if we hop back over to PHP 7.1 we
get the same result and we can try this
with color and age despite the fact that
we've switched them round so this just
works really nicely so a nice flexible
change here as well as a syntax change
to make this a little bit
cleaner and a little bit easier to write
but this is really really helpful and if
you didn't know about list before then
maybe you'll find a use for it now or
into the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
