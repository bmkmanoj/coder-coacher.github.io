show you how to implement a navigation
for your website what we're looking to
achieve is something like this where we
have a number of headings at the top of
our page and when we hover over one of
these headings we get a number of Link's
appearing in a drop down below that
particular heading if we then hover over
another heading we get another set of
dropdowns and so on for each of the
headings if you hover inside the drop
down the drop down will stay there and
you hover outside of it'll disappear
this is all going to be done in HTML and
CSS there's no JavaScript at all so it's
going to be nice and sleek and it's
gonna be nice and quick so let's start
writing the the mark-up that we need for
this and then we'll move on to its
styling afterwards the first thing we'll
need is a nav element and for those of
you that aren't familiar with it it's
just a new element in html5 it's
basically exactly the same as div except
it's got a different name so that's
going to be our container for the entire
navigation and then what we want is an
unordered list and inside this we're
going to have a list item per heading
and that's going to have it that list
item is going to have an anchor inside
of it for the actual heading so if you
click on that heading it was wrecked you
to that page with the website and it's
also going to have an another hundred
list within each user list item which is
going to get to be the drop-down so
let's let's mark up one of those and
show you what it looks like and then
we'll mark up another one for each
heading that we want so let's have a
list item within my icon ordered list
and an anchor which as I said is going
to be the heading that you see all the
time and let's just give the HF of a
hash for now because we don't want we
don't have any other pages in this
example but you can just replace that
with a page on the website that you want
to directiy and it's closed off that
heading and close off the list item
and let's put some text inside there
heading one will do nicely okay
and spaced this out a little bit see
there we go
okay and also within this list item were
want an unordered list which as I said
is going to be a drop-down itself here
we go
and on the drop-down we're going to want
list item link for the drop-down and
obviously we need a anchor inside each
list item that's going to be a link
because we want that to direct to a
specific part of the website too so it's
mark that up close off everything and
let's put a name in here so the link a
will do fine for now okay so I think
this will done nicely and let's let's
copy that and have five links on the
drop-down and just slightly change the
name for all of those just so we can see
it and obviously you can change the name
to anything and change the link to
anything okay let's close off the
unordered list for the drop down and
there we go we have one heading now
mocked up with this drop down so if I
they go to this blank page which is just
where the content is going there you can
see it and we'll need one of those for
each each heading so I'm just going to
copy that list item and paste it out one
two three four five additional times and
just change the name of the heading
there for each of the of these list
items
as I said you can change it to anything
you want and also change the paths in
the H refs to anything you want okay so
that is all the mark-up done let's see
what it looks like on the page so it
looks pretty rubbish at the moment but
that's what we're going to need and
we're just going to style that up for
the styling phase of this tutorial I'm
going to have my browser on the left
hand side of the page like this and then
my text edge on the right side of the
page and that will just mean that I can
show you exactly what's happening as I
update the CSS so in the CSS the first
thing we need to do is create a nav
selector and that's just going to target
the navigation itself the whole thing
and it gimmicky and I'm going to give it
a fix with say a thousand pixels and the
reason I'm doing that is say that the
navigation won't respond to the size of
the browser so they wouldn't get any
issues with headings heading titles
dropping down below each other and
moving out of position which is not what
we want for a navigation and the next
thing I'm going to do is target the the
headings themselves and their list items
within unordered lists and just float
them left just to get them all on the
same page like that sorry on the same
line and ferd to help with development
I'm just going to hide all of the
dropdowns by default because they're
getting in the way mount and also we'll
need them hidden by default anyway so
this seems like a good time to do it
since do I select those hey this is the
selector to get the dropdowns as I
explained earlier and with the mark up
and so let's just do display on by
default
okay and now let's start styling this
header up
well sorry these headings up so I'm
going to give the headings a padding in
between each other and the reason I'm
giving them a padding like this is
because if we were to give them just
fixed widths then if you had one really
long title and one really short title
then they'd still be the same size so
the box containing the text would still
be the same size but having padding
allows the box to respond to the size of
the area the amount of text inside it so
there we go and it's got a bit of a gap
here which is not what we want so I'm
just going to get rid of that and that's
because of a bit of padding
let's put by default on unordered list a
padding:0 so there we are we can see all
of those and let's remove the
underlining and give that a different
color
hooray give each heading a different
color so to do that I'm going to need to
tell against the anchors within the list
items within the unordered lists which
are going to be which is where this
Texas whole held basically just do
text-decoration:none and color of hash
666 which is just a grayish color so
there we go that's what we have there so
starting to look a little bit like what
we have I'm in the final product let's
also give a border left to these
headings so the dashboard of the you can
see and the final product and so that's
just going to be using border left and
border
takes three parameters the first being
the size of the border so I'm just going
to have one pixel then the second one
being this style which is dashed and the
third one being the color in this case
so there we go that's looking good
all right but of course we want the
dropdowns to appear and let's let's do
that now let's let's draw let's make the
dropdowns appear when we hover over have
a heading and the way to do that is to
use a pseudo selector which is a
selector there's only activated under a
certain condition and this case is going
to be hover so let me write out the
selector and then talk you through it a
little bit so this is this is the full
selector and what this means is that
when you hover over a list item then an
unordered list within your nav element
then Styles stars inside these brackets
will be applied to the unordered list
which is a direct descendant of that
element
you've hovered over so basically when I
hover over one of these headings the
styles are being applied to the
unordered list that contains the
drop-down that is the drop-down and the
first thing I want to do is obviously
show that drop-down so it's have display
block inside of there on display:none
and never to show that working today you
guys are as I hover over a heading the
drop-down appears obviously the
drop-down that's not looking like quite
like what we wanted at the moment it's
pushing aside all the other headers and
it's got a border and so on so it's not
looking quite right and to stop it from
pushing aside the other headers we're
going to give it a position absolutely
and that allows us to put the drop down
exactly where we want it to and serve us
today to show you what happened now for
a refresh you can see it is appearing in
the same places but it's not pushing the
headings aside now which is good but
with position:absolute what you need to
do is give a position well position
relative to a parent element and that
allows us to position the absolutely
positioned element relative to the
element with position relative so if I
give position relative to this list item
here
I can start to position this drop down
relative to that element and I want the
drop down to appear next to that list
item right aligning up to the left of it
so I'm going to have a nav unordered
list list item unordered list left zero
pixels and say that means the left-hand
side of my drop-down will always be
lined up with the left-hand side of the
heading so there we go
it's always lining up for the left-hand
side of the heading which is great but
now we want to star that up a little bit
to make it look like we had on the
finished product so I'm going to do some
of these styles and the styles will be
applied to the Unruh this selector here
because that selected represents the
drop-down first do width of 403 pixels
and say that'll define the exact width
of it like that but obviously they're
all grinding and rendering in the line
now these links which is not what we
want I say let's give those a width as
well where's my selector for they
haven't got one yet so let's set one up
which is now analyst list item unordered
list list item and that'll select all of
the links within my drop-down
and I'm going to give those width of 143
pixels yeah there we are starting to
look a bit more like what we want but we
need to get rid of the border and we
need to push them down a little bit so
I'm going to do that now by having by
having some styles in this selector here
so if I do margin top 12 pixels they'll
push it down to the padding top left
padding top 10 pixels will push the the
links down within that actual drop-down
and I want to give it a box shadow for
the sort of border for that drop-down
and I'm going to give it a 0 1 pixel on
pixel and then the color which is RGB a
and an RGB a color selector means you
type in four values the red value green
value blue value and halfa value which
is the opacity so I save that show you
what that looks like now starting to
look like what we had before in the full
example but I need to again get rid of
that border and put a border on the top
so I'm going to do that now it's have
order zero there and then
and I actually we need to bought a top
there so one pixel dashed
Asch da da da han border:0 on the list
items because that's where the board is
being applied to at the moment which is
not what we want so it save that look at
our navigation and they're starting to
look really good but it's one subtle
difference between our product here and
the final product and that is that when
we hover over four headings four five
and six on the final product he dropped
down renders in a slightly different
place
the right-hand side of the drop down
lines up with the right-hand side of the
heading and that's what we want to get
now so the way to do that is to apply a
clasp to these three headings and then
and then what we can do with that class
is command this drop down to align to
the right of the heading element that
has the class so if we go back to our
HTML now we're going to apply this class
to heading four five and six and the the
class is going to go on the the
unordered list for the drop-down so
let's call this give it a class of a
line right it's a nice descriptive class
name and make sure we give that to you
each of these drop downs that we want
this to happen for
save that then we need to build a
selector for the drop downs that we want
to align up with the right hand side of
the heading element so if we do if you
select that class but this selects it
here and then say for these ones we
don't want them to align up with the
left like they usually would so deer
left or to get rid of that style and
instead to make them line up with the
right hand side of the heading element
so you give it a right of zero pixels
and it's thick of that and that works
really nicely on our heading elements
there now here you have the final
product a navigation for your website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
