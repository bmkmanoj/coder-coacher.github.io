take a look exactly what this simple
social network can do and we're going to
be demonstrating that using two
different browsers so I have Chrome and
Firefox both open and I'm going to be
switching between them so we can see how
we can interact between users so the
first thing I want to do is just sign up
for an account this is very
straightforward just going to go ahead
and enter my email address choose a
username and enter a password and hit
sign up so our accounts been created and
go ahead and sign in so let's do that
now and we'll sign in a password
we have remembered me functionality here
as well so we're now signed in let's
just take a look around here and see
what we have so we've got our time line
which contains all of our friends posts
as well as replies and also all of our
posts as well we can see replies to our
own posts we can update our status using
this form just here now we can see a
list of our friends on this tab at the
moment I don't have any friends and we
can also see friend requests as well
here and we can find people as well if I
type in my name here you can see that I
can just see myself there and this is my
profile now this will be the same for
other users too it lists my friends here
and it will tell me if I've posted and
show me any posts here too so I can also
update my profile so I can go ahead and
enter a first name and a last name and I
can give myself a location as well if I
want when I update that and go over to
my profile you can see that all of that
information has been updated and this up
here has been updated too now the
profile images are coming from Gravatar
at the moment of course you could change
that later on to be able to upload a
photo if you wanted to so let's sign up
for a new account now in a different
browser and we'll see how different
users will be able to interact so let's
just sign up here with billiot code
course comm choose the username Billy
and of course these forms have
validation too so if I were to type Alex
and hit sign up it wouldn't let me do it
because the usernames already been taken
so we can go ahead and enter a password
and hit sign up and we are nearly in we
just need to sign in now of course you
can do it so
automatically signed in and there we go
we're in so on the timeline again we see
exactly the same thing at the moment
there's not much going on here between
our friends because we don't have any so
I'm going to search for Billie just over
here I can find Billie there and because
this isn't my profile I can go ahead and
add Billie as a friend and the friend
request was sent so over on my other
browser if I go over to my friends
section you can see I have a list of my
friends requests and click on this
profile and I can accept this friend
request so I can just click that and we
are now friends so over on Billy's Pro
or over on Alex's profile we have Billy
as a friend and on Billy's profile we
now have Alex as a friend
so let's pop back to the timeline on
both of these and I'm going to go ahead
and post something so had a great day
and hit update status and you can see
that adds a post here with the ability
to reply and I can reply to my own
statuses as well but of course you could
change that if you didn't want to and
this currently has zero likes so we have
like functionality as well I can't
obviously like my own status again you
can change that so you could so now that
I'm friends with Alex on the Billy
profile you can see that this pops up in
my timeline too
I can like this if I want so now has one
like and if I pop back and just refresh
you can see that that now shows one like
as well and I can comment on this too so
I can say that's great and hit reply and
there we go I've posted a reply and
again here we see that's great now I can
like that from here because Billy isn't
me it's a different account so this
might not seem that complicated but
behind the scenes there is actually
quite a lot going on here it's not
really complicated to create something
like this but we want to build it in a
way that we can add more features later
on so we're going to be building this
within the laravel framework and we're
going to be creating obviously models
that represent now users represent our
posts and we're going to be tying these
together in a nice structured way so we
can update this later on if we want to
so let's head over to the next video
where we look at setting
our laravel app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
