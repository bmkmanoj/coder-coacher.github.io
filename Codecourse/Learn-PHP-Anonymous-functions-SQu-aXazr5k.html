anonymous functions and what it means to
be an anonymous function in PHP now
anonymous function is essentially a
function without a name so it hasn't
been given a specific name we've already
seen that we can do something like
function name and then define a block
and we can return something inside of
here
but with an anonymous function it's
perfectly valid to say function return
something remembering that we need to
semicolon instead on the end of this so
what happens now is this perfectly valid
syntax it doesn't make too much sense in
this case because we have no way to call
this function now what we can do however
is we can assign the function a name
through a variable so I'm just going to
say five so now what I can do is I can
actually call this variable as if it's a
function because technically is a
function but we've just said that we're
putting a function within this we're not
actually giving the function a name so
now I'm going to go ahead and refresh we
also haven't echoed anything out we will
see if we echo five like this we get the
value five and we can do exactly the
same thing with things like returning
parameters or we can do anything with
parameters that we want so we'll just
keep that as five we'll just say 50 in
there for example we can do everything
that we would normally do with a
function as an anonymous function but
there are benefits to anonymous
functions and that's when we start
looking at callbacks and having closures
an anonymous function is actually a
closure it just doesn't have a name
that's it so yeah like I said cool boxes
is a good thing to do in the case of PHP
5 in onwards let's take a look quick
look now at a bit more of this so we can
sort of pass these things around so what
we could do is we could in fact say
another equals 5 then what we have
effectively done now is allowed us to
call
reference the same function with another
variable so now this works in exactly
the same way when we refresh with a
normal very normal function we won't be
able to do this so if you need to reuse
functionality but store it in different
with different variable names then
that's a use for closure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
