properties to our JavaScript files in
different properties to our CSS files
well let's look at a basic example of
selecting specific files with fire with
patterns and applying these properties
so patterns are wrapped in square
brackets we use the asterisks before
just to target everything but now I'm
going to create a selector that targets
just JavaScript and just CSS separately
so I'm gonna first of all create a
selector for everything and I'm gonna
define some basic rules so we could say
charset utf-8 we could say insert final
newline to true
and we could say trim trailing
whitespace and set that to true as well
now however I want to target things in
the JavaScript directory and I want to
target everything with a javascript
extension a bear in mind this won't
target everything with a javascript
extension outside of the jeaious
directories in that case you just leave
this blank and there are obviously other
selectors you can use their more
advanced selectors but generally for a
project all files you know probably
should remain the same you can target
things as you need and it's good to know
that these filters or patterns rather
are there anyway so I'm gonna set the
indent size to 2 here and I'm gonna set
the indent style to a space but if I
wanted to say change this for the CSS
files or all CSS files in my CSS
directory I can do indent style equals
tab for example or I could say indent
style equals space and I could do indent
size is 4 so like I said there are
patterns listed in the official website
so go and check them out if you need
something more unique like I said though
is unlikely that you would ever really
need to specifically fine-tune how you
want to target these different files and
many projects that use ernet it's a
config file just simply use the asterisk
pattern</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
