very likely used filters and these are
or were convenient ways to go ahead and
apply things next to say a like count
you'd be able to pluralize that sooty
like if it was one like or likes if it
was two likes so what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to basically talk you through
what I'm doing here which is not coming
course you can obviously follow this
when it's out and then I'm gonna show
you a two alternative ways to get around
using filters or at least filters with
packages and filters with your own
custom functions as well so the way that
this works then is I have a public
timeline here this is a series on event
broadcasting with laravel so we're using
the Ravel echo to do this and what I can
actually do is go ahead and write
something over here what that will do is
not only post it but it will broadcast
it to all clients over WebSockets so you
can see here I can now like this and
when I go ahead and click that the like
button goes and that sends a request
through to like that now inside of the
posts that I have I actually have a
light count and this is just an
attribute set on the post model within
an hour eval so this will return me the
light count but the problem is I want to
output likes here but I can't do this in
the traditional sense now let's just
take a look at how this works I'm gonna
say post like count and by the way this
is a post component which is being
included on this timeline component just
here just to keep things nice and tidy
so I can output post light count and if
we give that a refresh we will actually
see at the like account here we've got
none for this one and one for each of
these however what I used to be able to
do is something like the following so I
used to be able to say post that like
count and then I used to be able to use
the PluralEyes filter like so and then
just give in the singular version of
this or in this case it would be a like
so let's give this a refresh and we will
see or we should see an error there we
go so failed to resolve filter
PluralEyes so the problem here is that
quite simply these have been removed
we're not gonna go into the reasons
there's a huge github thread on there so
you can go ahead and have a
but what we want to do is still be able
to do this and in the cleanest most
convenient way possible so first of all
let's take a look at this pluralize
library we can install this obviously
via NPM so this will basically pluralize
and singular lies any word so very very
simple and it's very very easy to use
there's some usage notes down here as
well now the first thing we would
obviously do is go ahead and install
this I happen to already have this
pulled into my dependencies list and
it's already installed with NPM so let's
take a look at how we may think about
using this and then we're going to look
at how we we actually make this work
so I would say import to pluralize from
PluralEyes and you may think well what
we can actually do in this case is just
go ahead and call it like this so the
usage of this if we just take another
look is to basically passed in passing
the singular version and then the count
so really really straightforward to use
this so in this case I would say like
and then I would go and pass in Post
like count okay so let's take a look at
this and we will see an error and that
is pretty much because we can't go ahead
and just directly use imported items
here within templates so the question is
how do we do this well it's actually
very simple you may already know that we
have the ability to define out methods
inside of our components so for example
over on the like button this is again a
separate component I have a method here
which like something when this button
here is clicked so very very
straightforward now in here all we
actually need to do is go ahead and
define out what we've imported and that
will then put it in the scope of this
template so we can go ahead and use it
so it really is that simple but stick
around if you want to see how to create
your own custom filters as well so now
I've done this obviously what we can do
as well is create other methods here as
well so just create them as you normally
would and do whatever you need you can
call these from your templates as well
okay so now I've done this then let's go
and take a look our browser and you can
see here that this happens to have work
so we've got zero light
here and obviously we've got the
singular version of it just here
brilliant so that's all well and good
but what happens if you are not pulling
in a library well let's get rid of this
and let's create a silly example so we
can see how we might define our own
custom filters so what I would typically
do in this case and you can separate
these out further I would create some
kind of a filters JSF are just inside of
here and of course separate this out if
you need them if this starts to get too
long you'd probably want to break them
up what we can now do is start to define
out just normal functions because that's
pretty much what filters were anyway we
won't go too much into it but that's
pretty much what they were so what I can
do now then is go ahead and let's just
find to find out a greeting function
just to be quick and let's accept a name
in here and go ahead and return hello
and then just go ahead and concatenate
on the name so really simple now to use
this elsewhere we're going to go ahead
and export greeting and if you were to
define others you can go ahead and
define these in here as well okay so now
all we need to do is just go over to the
template we want to use this in and we
want to import and then import the name
of that function from and then just
choose that file so we go back a
directory because we're commenting
components and we just put in filters we
don't need the jeaious extension there
now what we can do is in here define out
that filter go ahead and use it in here
and we are good to go so let's go ahead
and do this so greeting and let's say
Alex so come over here give that a
refresh and you'll see hello Alex
so hopefully that's helpful if you are
using view js2 now you know how to pull
in filters in a similar way to how we
could use them before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
