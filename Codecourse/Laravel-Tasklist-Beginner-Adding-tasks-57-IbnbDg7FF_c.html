move on to actually creating our task
which is very straightforward and I'm
going to show you two different ways
that we can create a task from here now
we'll cover this more in the more
intermediate version of this to do list
or task list but for now we'll just get
this done so we're actually storing
something over in our database so to
start things out then we want to at this
point just create a new task so we're
gonna do this the traditional kind of
way and then we'll look a slightly
easier way so we're gonna create a new
task instance remember this is our task
model that we created just over here and
of course what we want to do is import
this namespace at the top because this
file wouldn't have no idea where this
model is so we just say use app task
because obviously over here we have a
namespace of app so now that we've done
that let's just kill the page on task
and we'll see what this looks like so
let's just refresh hit add task after
we've typed a valid task in and we now
see a task model so now the next step is
to set the properties that we want on
this model which correspond with the
data in our database or the columns in
our database so we know that the column
for the name is just called name so we
just set this as a property we say task
name and then we say request which
remember is the request that we have up
here that we passed into our validator
and we just say name like that so let's
take a look at our task model again
there's kill the page here and you can
see here that this is added on to the
attributes property just here and the
name is now learned laravel now when we
call the save method on this task this
will be inserted into our database now
before I do that I just want to talk a
little bit about how does this know that
our database is called tasks how does
this model know where to insert well
laravel is clever enough to take the
singular version of whatever model name
you have and map it
- the plural version of a database table
so here for example this class was
called my task not that you would do
that but if it was called my task this
wouldn't work it wouldn't be able to
find the table now in the case that you
have models that have different names
what you would have to do is create in
here a protected table property and you
just give the name of the table so in
this case I would create tasks if my
model was called my task now in our case
we don't need to do that because task is
pretty simple it's just a plural version
of tasks so we can leave it as it is but
it's important to realize that that is
how all of this is working so to
actually save this then we just say task
save and that is it now after we've done
with this we want to redirect so we just
return redirect and we go back to the
home page so let's go over to the home
page so we can add a task and let's
create learn laravel make sure our
database is definitely empty before we
get started and it is hit add task and
there we go
so we've been redirected back obviously
we're not out putting any tasks just yet
but over in the database we now have
that task created how simple was that
well we're gonna look at another method
as well and you'll see this quite often
it's probably the most preferred way of
creating things and that is to do
something like tasks create and then
pass an array of the data you want to
add so in this case we would say name is
request name so you may see this around
you might prefer this way of doing
things it really depends on how you're
building up the data that you want to
insert if you want to use the
traditional way of creating a new task
model and then going ahead and assigning
properties this makes sense if you have
maybe if statements that you want to
change things around but either way I'll
leave it up to you to decide what you
want to do now if you do want to do it
this way you're going to come across a
problem so let's just try this again so
let's say learn PHP hit add task and we
see a mass assignment exception now this
is because this is a slightly different
way
of creating a record to get around this
we just need to set some billable
property our fillable columns let's go
and create a fillable protected property
and in here we're going to give the name
and that's it so any other columns you
have that you want to be fillable you
just add them in here and now when we
refresh and send this request through
again we're redirected back and we have
a new record created so we're gonna
stick then for the rest of the series
just with the following example like so
but of course you can feel free to use
this as well I'm gonna go ahead and get
rid of that so we've now created a task
but obviously what we want to do is
display them on this page once they've
been created so we're going to go over
to the next part and do that now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
