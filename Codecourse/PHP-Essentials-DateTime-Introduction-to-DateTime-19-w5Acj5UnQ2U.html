always have to at some point work with
dates and times and sometimes these can
be a little bit frustrating there's a
lot going on with dates and times and
really we just want a solution to be
able to work with them very easily so in
this part of the PHP essential series
we're going to be looking at the
date/time class which is built into PHP
for us so we don't need to install
anything we don't need to set anything
up as long as you're using PHP version
5.2 or greater then you can start to use
this so this is a class so it's an
object-oriented concept it works exactly
as you would expect if you are not
familiar with object-oriented
programming don't worry at all we are
going to go through how to use this and
if you're still working with procedural
code that's absolutely fine you can
still integrate this into your project
so essentially what the date/time class
is is a class that allows you to work
with dates you can create new dates you
can modify existing dates you can work
with date intervals which involves some
other classes and we're going to be
covering this in this part of the series
so we're gonna start out this video just
by playing around with this we're going
to create a new date time instance and
we're gonna see exactly what we get from
this so head over to your text editor
make sure you're using PHP you five
points or greater like I said you can
either find this out from the terminal
by doing PHP - V or you can use PHP info
within a file come over to your browser
and you'll see your version number just
up here okay so to start with then we
would normally just assign to a variable
a new because this is a class date/time
and this will create an object for us so
we're gonna take a look at what we have
in here and to do this we can use var
dump if you've not used var dump before
this is pretty straightforward it will
just dump the contents of a variable so
if we refresh you can see here we get an
object now this is obviously a date/time
object and we have three properties just
in here so the first one by default is
the current
date and time so it's currently 943 if I
go ahead and refresh that you can see
that the seconds have just updated that
so this is the date it's a string here
but we can actually manipulate this and
we're gonna be looking at this
throughout the series we have a timezone
type as well and then we have a time
zone so at the moment this is by default
UTC but we are going to cover how we
change time zones because that's pretty
important depending on your application
you may need to change the time zone to
be a local time zone or even allow the
user to choose their own time zone so in
a nutshell that is pretty much date time
that's as simple as it gets from this we
can start formatting dates we can start
modifying dates and that is exactly what
we're gonna cover in this series so now
that you know what date time is let's
move on and start to look at some other
things that we can do with this just to
make your life a lot easier when you're
working with dates and times</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
