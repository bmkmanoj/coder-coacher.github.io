show you how to create a slide out menu
for a website and this is going to use
CSS transitions and we're going to get a
pretty cool effect like this so what's
actually happening is this is sliding
out and the content is overflowing onto
you know sort of away from the page so
this is a navigation that you would
access just by tapping on this toggle
here and this is part of the header of
the page so this could be a little icon
that sort of signifies you know I want
to show menu and then this goes out and
you can see here we've got a side menu
and this will work nicely on mobile and
tablet devices as well
or you could just include this
functionality on mobile and tablet
devices but yeah this this functionality
basically uses CSS transitions so we're
not using javascript to animate this
we're going to have a nice smooth as you
can see nice smooth CSS transition and
then you can go ahead and control the
speed and the easing as you as you need
to this is basically what we're going to
be building so we can head over to our
text editor now to star this up okay so
over in our text editor we're going to
go ahead and mark up the page create the
elements that we need and see how these
look and then we're gonna go ahead and
start this so we get the effect that we
want to see both when this is in and out
so slid in and or sliding out and then
back in again so we'll go ahead and
creating the styles for this and then
we'll go ahead and add the animation and
also create the job as a very small
piece of JavaScript functionality we
need to go ahead and toggle the menu so
let's go ahead and create our markup for
our page so we use an html5 doctype
we're going to be using html5 elements
here we'll go ahead and create a head
and the body
and inside of the head let's go ahead
and add a few things the first thing
being a title obviously this is entirely
up to you or this will be on your site
I'm just going to call this slide-out
menu we're also going to need is to link
in our stylesheet
now at the moment we don't have any
stylesheet so let's create a new folder
called CSS and then we'll go ahead and
create a new file within this called
main CSS and then we'll go ahead and
link these link this starchy in so we
can actually go ahead and use the Styles
within this so we say link and we use
the rel attribute to tell the page what
this is and it's a style sheet and then
we use href to point to the style sheet
so that's in CSS forward slash main door
CSS
also then going to go ahead and create a
meta tag and the name the attribute a
name attribute for this is viewport and
we give we specify the content so we
specify a width and a scale as well and
this allows our page to be viewed nicely
on a on a smaller device like a mobile
or something like that so we'll go ahead
and say meta name viewport so that's the
name attribute and the content for this
is going to be width equals device width
so that would sort of give a sort of
standard width to this and then we say
initial scale is 1 we can go ahead and
add other properties to this but we'll
we'll just include this now because it
then allows you to sort preview this on
your phone okay so what what we're going
to go ahead and do now is create header
within that create our toggle at anchor
element and then go ahead and crown nav
as well and then we'll start to star
these up so header
and inside here we need to go ahead and
create our nav so use the nav element
and this is just going to you know
contain this is a side menu or something
like that you would obviously go ahead
and include your actual menu items here
and we need to go ahead and create this
toggle so this is going to just say
toggle although of course this could be
an image or an icon a font icon or
something like that
so the hrf is just going hash we're not
you know this doesn't need to actually
lead anywhere and we'll go ahead and
specify a class for this as well so this
is going to be menu toggle and basically
what this class allows us to do is
pinpoint this anchor so we can actually
trigger the sliding of the menu now to
be able to do this we also want to give
the nav a class as well so we want to
give this a class of menu side just so
we can target this with CSS we want to
go ahead and star this up now we also
need to give a class to the body and
what this is basically going to allow us
to do is it's going to allow us to set
specific CSS properties on the body
because remember with the body we need
to have this slide over with the nav so
as the nav slides over we're on the body
to slide over as well and then hide the
content on the right hand side so it
self has a slot whole page sliding
effect so we need to add a class to that
and we'll be adding a class to this with
JavaScript to sort of signify the action
of we want the menu to appear and then
we'll go ahead and we'll as you know use
transitions to start there to animate
this so we've got the classes we need
for now we don't need to do anything
else here so let's hop over to main CSS
and start to actually you know write
some content here and install this up so
the navigation let's go ahead and
starless first turn a menu side and we
basically want to give this a fixed
position so it's always on the left hand
side and you know a page can be scrolled
down as necessary and we also want to go
ahead and give this a background color
and things
that so let's go ahead and just do that
first so background color I'm going to
give this a background color of just
three three three so like a dark grey if
you like we'll also go ahead and give
this a right border of one pixel solid
and black just sort of to find the
border and we'll need to bear this
border in mind when we do our
positioning because it's one pixel more
than the actual width of this item so we
need to include that extra pixel as well
so that's quite important we'll also go
ahead and set a color of whites to this
so anything with in it will be white so
it's go ahead and refresh now it doesn't
look great at the moment because we've
got a few additional things to do and
we'll go ahead and we'll do these within
the browser just because it makes it a
little bit easier to see what we're
doing so we're not stuck in our text
editor so at the moment with menu side
you can see the Stars that we've already
written here the last one we did was
color what we now want to do is go ahead
and start looking at the positioning and
where this is going to be positioned so
I'm going to save position fixed and
that hasn't done much but when we go
ahead and take top zero and we say left
zero which we'll be changing in just a
moment you can see that now stacks at
the top left what we also want to do is
go ahead and give this a width so I'm
going to choose a width of 210 pixels
that looks a you know good a good width
for that and we also want to go ahead
and set the height to 100% so it fills
the entire high of the page now let's go
ahead and give this some padding as well
of 10 pixels now the reason I've given
this a height of 210 is this now has a
total sorry a width of 210 this now has
a total width of 230 because we've got
padding 10 pixels left and 10 pixels
right if we go ahead and check out the
the sort of box model of this you can
see that we've got padding of 10 to 10
and then the total size of this if we
just inspect it and hover over is to 3
once we've now got a 230 pixel wide menu
with a one pixel border so remember we
have to bear that one pixel in mind so
now that we've got our Styles let's go
ahead and just
copy these and paste these into our star
sheet okay so there's a couple of things
that we need to do here because we don't
want the menu to appear like this by
default we want the menu to appear
basically hidden so what we do is we're
going to go ahead and modify the left
property and we're not going to include
this we're not going to have this as
zero we're going to have this as a minus
value that's going to be minus two three
one pixels two three one so what that
does is it means that it's now hidden
right down to just before the body so if
I was to do that as two thirty you can
just see it appearing at the side there
so we want it - two three one that just
nicely hides it so let's go ahead and
amend our style sheet so minus two three
one pixels and now we have a navigation
that looks nice but is hidden so that's
fine that's what we want we only want it
to appear when we hit the toggle now
what we need to bear in mind is things
like the body so I'm going to go ahead
and create a class here called menu now
when our body shifts over to the left so
we're going to give a left value of two
three one to the body when a specific
class is applied so we'll just look at
how this works for now so for the menu
I'm going to say overflow I want to be
or overflow X rather to be hidden so on
the x-axis when this cannot fit within
its container which is the body
it will hide itself so it will just hide
any data as we saw earlier there was a
lot of text on the page and I've just
got hidden we also want to go ahead and
set a relative positioning to this and
we want to go ahead and set left to zero
so let's go ahead and take a look at
what this is done okay so nothing's
happened at the moment if we hover over
body these properties have been applied
because we've got a value of left zero
nothing's happened it stayed in exactly
the same place if we were to go ahead
and set a value of two three one pixels
to this you'll see that the whole body
shifts over now let's go ahead and play
some text within the body just so we can
see how this overflow works so I'm going
to go ahead and just on
my header I'm going to put these two
paragraphs of text you can go ahead and
generate them or put your own text in
but now we see that this naturally just
sort of fits within the page but when we
go ahead and change this value to 231
you see that this basically essentially
cuts off it doesn't wrap down it cuts
off and we can see that by just
adjusting this so that's the
overflow:hidden property if we didn't
have that there you'd see we get this
horrible scrollbar and that's not what
we want so now that we've got that we
want to make a class that specifically
applies this left value and that will
basically be the trigger of when we use
JavaScript so we say menu open and
that's going to be applied to the body
so we say left 2 3 1 pixels so now
what's going to happen is when we have
menu menu open that's going to shift the
body across like that so that's the sort
of menu open state and when this is
removed it goes back to normal so
obviously what we now need to do is when
we've got the menu open state there we
want to go ahead and we want to show
this nav so that's fairly
straightforward we just do a descendant
selector on this so what we're going to
do is we're going to say menu open which
remember is the cost that supplies to
the body and an element called menu side
within that which is our lovely menu
we've built will then have a left of 0
which will mean that it will then be
visible so now when we hit refresh you
can see that we've got this as a as a
left property of 0 here because we've
got the menu open class attached to here
we've still got all our padding nicely
here but this has moved over to 3-1
pixels so now what's going to happen is
when I remove this menu item class it
all just goes back to normal so what we
really need to do is toggle now needs to
add this menu open or toggle this menu
open class on the body element so that's
basically what we need to do on that
side of things now we have our menu
styled and our body styles so
we've shifted over we're going to move
on to actually animating this slide-out
menu</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
