now then is once we hit an individual
break go ahead and increment our score
now just to kind of give you a reminders
to what we did earlier when we set
everything up we set this state just in
here with our score our level in our
lives which we know that we can access
if we just remind ourselves with this
game global score now if we do this
inside of the update method so if we
update any of these values in here of
course because we're repainting the
canvas on here that's gonna go ahead and
update the text for us because we've
changed that specific value now of
course when we go ahead and hit a brick
the first thing that we're gonna want to
do is say this game global score +10 now
or plus equals 10 so we can increment it
now we're not going ahead and resetting
the score text at the moment so if we
just give this a refresh and click
notice that that's not doing anything it
is incrementing the score but because
we're doing this setting up about text
just here outside of our update method
it's not going ahead and updating now
you could say well why don't we just
move to the creation of the text over to
the update method which we have just
here so we could go ahead and move that
over but the only issue with that is we
don't keep repainting the text we only
want to update certain parts of it so
what we can do is down here after we've
incremented the score we can say this
score text equals or text in here equals
and then we can just repaint on the
score re giving the score that's gonna
go ahead and actually update that so we
can say this game global score now we
need to make sure that we've assigned
this to score text so if we just come up
to here it looks like we didn't do this
so let's go ahead and say this score
text equals this so we can reference
that this lives text equals this and
we'll do the same for our level text as
well just so we have a reference to each
of them and we can go ahead and access
and update them so now that we're doing
this inside of our update method
effectively because we are calling ball
hit brick from inside of there what's
going to happen is when I go ahead and
hit one that's going to go ahead and
increment the score and it's going
I hadn't repaint the parts that need to
be painted eg the text inside of here so
there we go
that is pretty much it how we keep track
of our score and a little bit of
information about how that works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
