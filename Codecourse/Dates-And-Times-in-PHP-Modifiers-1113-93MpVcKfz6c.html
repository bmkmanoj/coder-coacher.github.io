things like adding days on to a carbon
date we've done things like Maya Singh
days- in weeks and things like that but
what if we want to modify the day in
such a way that we want to go ahead and
grab say the start of a particular day
regardless of which time we are
currently on on that day the start of
the week the start of the month the end
of the month and things like the end of
the century or decade and everything
like this we can do within carbon so
that's first of all go ahead and create
our standard carbon instance here in
fact what we could do is just go ahead
and say carbon pars or we could just say
carbon now actually we can work with
this so let's do a VAR dump on sea again
and you'll see we have the following so
we've got the current date and time now
at the moment we're on the fifteenth of
April but what we can do is we can say
well I want to get this time but I want
to get the start of this day or this
date and time but I want to get the
start of the day so what we can do with
this is we can say start of day and then
we can go ahead and refresh and we get
just the start of the day this leaves us
with a date we can go ahead and get the
end of the day which gives us 23 59 59
and we can also do things like start of
week and end of week as well which can
be really useful and the reason this is
useful is if you're constructing some
kind of or constructing the application
that deals with dates in such a way that
you perhaps need to get the start of the
week and then work out some kind of cost
or price of something than these
modifiers on our carbon object work
really well to just modify lots of
different things and then make
comparisons between them perhaps and
then eventually you can go ahead and
format them or you know whatever you
need to do so for example the end of the
week let's go ahead and check this out
you can see that we're back on the night
where while we've come forward to the
19th now and you can see that because
it's the end of the week we're getting
the 20
3 59 59 again and obviously there are
things like the start of the week as
well like so and we can obviously do
things like the start of the year there
we go so we've got the first of the
first which is obvious and then 0 0 0
here for the time and there are even
things like start of the century like so
so we've got two thousand here and of
course we can also do end of the century
as well if we wanted to usually though
you'd find yourself if you were creating
these dates to try and work out
something in terms of maybe pricing for
something you can go ahead and use
things that start and end of the day in
week month they're probably the more
appropriate ones so we're also going to
go ahead and now look at doing a VAR
dump let's go ahead and just VAR dump on
sea again so we can just pull this up
and compare and we're going to use the
next method and what this will give us
is the next week but on the same day so
that could be useful as well so we could
say something like next and if we go
ahead and just compare this date here
we're currently on the 15th when we
refresh we get the 22nd so that's just
given us the next week but on the same
day so it's just next Wednesday and what
we can also do with this next method if
we go ahead and look inside of carbon
let's go ahead and pull up the next
method you can see here that we have an
argument which is by default null and
this is day of week so what we can do is
we can get the next day of the week so
for example we could say next Wednesday
we could say next Tuesday Monday
whatever you want to do next sunday so
I'm gonna say I won the day next friday
and when i go ahead and refresh there we
go that is the date for next friday
which is as i'm recording on a wednesday
in just two days time now you might be
thinking what if i want to get the
previous week
well that's easy we just use the
previous and there we go so we get the
day here for the previous Friday so
that's it for modifiers you can
obviously use these in conjunction with
any other methods as with the carbon
library and just build up the
functionality that you need to work with
dates in this time these are really
useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
