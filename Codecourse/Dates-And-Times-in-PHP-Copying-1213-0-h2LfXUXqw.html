method within carbon which really is
crucial to putting everything together
that you've already learned it in order
to manipulate eight compare different
things just basically set everything up
in the right way and if you don't use
the copy method you're going to find
yourself really really stuck and this is
probably the cause of most problems if
you don't use the copy method you'll
probably get very confused so we're
going to start with an incorrect example
of how we add a week on to a date and
then maybe compare it for example so
what we can do is go ahead and create a
variable called see as we've been doing
throughout and let's just set that to
carbon now so if we do a VAR dump on C
will get the current day and let's pay
attention to what they were on so we're
on the fifteenth of April now let's say
we wanted to create a new variable and
we can imagine for now that carbon now
has come from a user submitted value or
generated value within our database and
we want to go ahead and add a week on to
this maybe to calculate the cost of
something or anything else so the usual
way you would think about doing this
would be to say C add week so all we've
done here is we've created the current
date and time we've created a new
variable and we're setting that equal to
C adding a week on well let's take a
look at VAR dumping see now and see
what's happened so remember this is the
carbon now static method and watch how
this changes you can see it's changed to
22 even though we're referencing carbon
now well what's happened here is the way
that carbon works is because we've used
this method it is automatically updated
this original variable here this
original value within carbon now if we
do seed too we get the same result
because all we're doing here is we're
adding week on to see and then we're
setting c2 c2 so we're in a bit of a
trouble here if we wanted to
compare this so for example if we wanted
to say C is same day as c2 we know it's
well we could say add days to for
example we know that adding two days on
to the current date isn't going to be
the same day so if we go ahead and
refresh we get true which is not right
adding two days on to the current date
is not the same day so what we need to
do here is copy the original instance of
carbon and then do something to it so
all we do here is instead of directly
saying see at days to we say C copy
which is going to return you in New or
the same in the same value of this but a
different instance of it and then we can
say add days to and then we'll see false
as we expect so whenever you are taking
an original value and you're
manipulating it in some way you need to
use the copy method to do this otherwise
it's just not going to work so that is a
really useful method that's pretty much
crucial to working with carbon beyond
it's very basic methods and just using
them on their own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
