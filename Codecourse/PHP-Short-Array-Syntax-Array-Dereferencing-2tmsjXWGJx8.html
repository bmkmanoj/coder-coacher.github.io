around for quite a while now since
version 5.4 but we're gonna take just a
little look at what this is if you're
not already familiar with it so we're
gonna create a couple of examples here
obviously when you begin to create an
array you would usually use the array
syntax you would still use this if you
wanted to support previous versions of
PHP it doesn't mean now that you
shouldn't use the shorthand syntax it
just means that it is available if you
know you can always use it and you are
always on version 5.4 so we would just
declare an array like this and then we
would fill it up with lots of items what
we can do now however is use the
shorthand syntax like this and if you've
written ever written code in JavaScript
you probably recognize this array
literal from JavaScript so what we can
do is just do exactly the same thing
here but with our shorthand syntax and
the reason that I like this is because
previously when we used array and we
pulled this down it did look a little
bit messy it tends to just be a little
bit annoying that this array keyword is
here so now that we can actually replace
this and we can add items in here it
just makes it that little bit easier
when we want to pull this down like this
it just looks a lot neater now I'm also
going to briefly talk about array
dereferencing let's just create a
function here this could be a method in
a class it could be anything I'm just
gonna say return items and here I'm just
gonna return a couple of items like so
now what we would have to do previously
is say items equals return items echo
items 1 for example 0 so this would give
us the following like that
now previous to version 5.4 we could
do something like this and this makes
things really easy because you can see
just by doing that we've gotten rid of a
lot of code here so we can just use a
raid referencing to make things a lot
shorter still as well as using array
literals we can do this so that gives us
exactly the same result so there's a
little bit about the shorthand syntax
from 5.4 if you didn't already know
about it and then following on just
relating that to a raid referencing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
