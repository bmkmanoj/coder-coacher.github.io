video on Google hosted libraries and and
why you should probably should be using
them or why you should be using them on
your site so majority of sites use a
collection of libraries jQuery probably
being amongst the most popular if your
if your web developing so essentially
Google will host the latest versions of
of these different libraries and you can
see them just down here so for example
we've got jQuery if we pop over to that
we've got the the snippet to include the
the the JavaScript and then it gives a
Google CDN URL now mmm I've already
mentioned see the end so that's one of
the benefits that we get from this a
content delivery network if you're
serving it from a content delivery
network it essentially allows the
majority of the time for that far to be
delivered to that user quick up because
it's based on location it will be served
from the most efficient location
possible it's also a lot faster as well
is it's entirely likely that the server
that this is coming from would be faster
than yours so you'll experience all your
users will experience a better download
time on this file
second of all sort of ties into that in
the fact that you're not you're not
performing an additional request to your
server so you know that the request for
this file is outside of the scope of
your server you you're requesting it
from from a Google server wherever this
may be coming from again the content
delivery network so that's another
reason the second reason is the fact
that because this file is more than
likely cached or if the or if a lot of
developers did actually use this file it
would be cached in the instance of
people visiting one web site coming to
another web site that uses the same file
and then it's highly likely that the
user won't even need to download the
file because it'll already be cached so
here we've got three very good reasons
to include a snippet now if
you're you know quickly developing this
also makes it a lot quicker and easier
because we literally just come in copy
and paste this line and we're ready to
go
there's no hopping over to jQuery
downloading it and including it
there are obviously cases where you
might need to include a local copy if
you have an uncompressed production
version and you want to go ahead and
modify some bits or look at the source
this is going to be a minified version
so that's essentially a few reasons why
you should use use Google hosted
libraries and you can see there's you
know most popular libraries that that
you're likely to use and including your
website so yeah there we are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
