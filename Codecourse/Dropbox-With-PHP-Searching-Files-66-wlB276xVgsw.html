really easy for you to search files
using its PHP SDK and now I've created a
few example files within a couple of
folders within my Dropbox which
obviously synced up to the server and we
can see these within my text editor
because I have this folder open I have a
folder called documents which has a
couple of text files in here and I also
have a folder called fun which has a
couple of files in here as well two
photos so what we can do now is use the
Dropbox API to search for files either
within a specific folder or in the root
directory so let's first of all define a
variable called query that's going to
contain a query string of what we want
to search for and then as you'd imagine
we can just access a method on clients
called search filenames and this takes a
base path so that can either be a folder
within your Dropbox directory or it can
be just the root path so just a forward
slash you then provide the query whether
you want to limit it or not so this is
an optional argument and also whether
you want to include deleted files so
let's go ahead and implement this and
all we're gonna do is just echo out some
pretax just to preserve the formatting
of print our and then we use print our
and obviously you wouldn't do this in
reality is just to demonstrate so here
we use the search file names method we
want to pass in the directory we're
looking in so for example that could be
documents it could be fun or just the
root directory we want to pass the query
in the limit so that's an integer could
be 5 10 whatever you want in my case
I'll just do 5 and whether we want to
include deleted files if you don't you
can just leave this argument or we could
say well I do want to look for deleted
files as well
so inside of the query then let's just
type in cats
we've got one folder here that contains
the word cat one file here sorry that
contains the word cats so when we go
ahead and refresh on here we get an
array back similar to what we saw when
we did the yet meta or get meta with
children or get metadata with children
sorry we got all of the information
about this whether it's a directory
obviously it's not going to because
we're searching for files specifically
and you can see here that it's giving us
the path to that file if we were to
update this to say Earth Day
we have two files called birthday so as
you'd expect we get an array with two
elements in and one is here one is here
we can see the full path and all the
information so this is really really
cool because if you do need to provide
the ability for users to search within
what they've created on their Dropbox
folder then you can do that really
really easily return what you get back
from the search and then do whatever you
need to with these files so there we go
that's how easy it is to search inside
of your Dropbox folder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
