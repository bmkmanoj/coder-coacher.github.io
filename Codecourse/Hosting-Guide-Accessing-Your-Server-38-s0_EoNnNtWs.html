already know this we've taken a look
around the control panel how do we
access the server well the first thing
I'm going to do is go ahead and copy
this IP address and go ahead and paste
it just up here so let's go ahead and
paste this in and we'll see what we can
see so we get here the Apache to burden
to default page so this is basically the
webserver entry into our server
obviously at the moment we're accessing
it on port 80 which is the default
server port this is all you're gonna get
when you hit your domain name or your IP
address and we'll look at attaching a
domain name a bit later so it gives you
some instructions here so you can go
ahead and read these if you want but
what we're going to be doing now is
connecting to our server via SSH now
however you generated your key whether
you you are on a Mac or you're on
Windows like we saw before you'll have a
public key and you'll have a private key
so if you are using putty you would have
generated a public and a private key and
you as long as you have these ready to
go you can connect via parties so if you
are using Windows fire party up now
and you can go ahead and connect with
your IP address and using your private
key but again I'm on a Mac so I'm going
to be using my terminal to do this so
I'm currently within my SSH directory
you don't need to be within here but
it's just a little bit easier to specify
our private key if we need to so to SSH
into our server I'm going to use the SSH
command I'm going to choose the key I
want to use in this case it's just
called Project and when we connect to
our server the user that we use is root
and then we say at and then we give the
IP address so here I'm gonna go ahead
and grab this IP address I'm going to
paste it in here I'm going to hit enter
and that's gone ahead and connected us
to our server so we're now within our
server so there's a couple of things
here that we can note we get the default
bun to output so just gives our system
information etc but digitalocean
when we install a lamp stack also gives
us information about this too so the
first thing to note is your web root is
located at VAR w W HTML and can be seen
by and then your IP address so we
already know this we've seen this just
here what's also interesting is we have
details of your PHP installation we have
this file called info dot PHP which at
the moment just contains the PHP info
function which outputs installation
details of our PHP installation we also
have our MySQL root user password just
here so we can use this to actually
connect to MySQL if we need to build up
our database or etc so we can go ahead
and run MySQL secure installation to
basically make our server ready for
production in terms of MySQL so let's go
ahead and just copy this command first
of all and paste this in now enter
current password for root we already
know this so let's go ahead and copy
this and just paste this in here do we
want to change the root password you can
go ahead and change the root password to
a stronger password if you want then I'm
going to hit now do we want to remove
anonymous users yes we do that's really
important
do we want to disallow root log in
remotely so do we want to disallow this
disallow other people or ourselves when
we're not inside of our server to log in
well this is a little bit of a tricky
one because basically if we want to use
some software outside of our
installation to connect we're not going
to be able to if we disallow root login
what you can do is use something like
PHP myadmin from inside of your server
to connect but for now I'm going to say
no I don't want to because we might use
some external software you can always go
ahead and disable this later
do we want to remove the test database
and access to it yep
should we reload privileges table now
yes and there we go so we're all done
let's just clear this again and what
we're gonna do now is just take a look
managing our server from inside of here
so we're just within a Linux
installation so we can use Linux
commands if you're not used to these you
can go ahead and look them up so LS is
going to list a directory CD is the same
as on Windows so we can go back a
directory so we're now within our sort
of root directory of our server now
remember our web files are located
within far so we can CD into var enlist
the directory again we've got this
dub-dub-dub folder so we can go ahead
and CD into that and then we have this
HTML folder so we can CD into that don't
worry this isn't going to be the way
that you do manage your files we're
gonna look at using SFTP to connect to
our server so you can easily upload all
of your project files using your
favorite FTP client so we'll look at
that
in a later video but here we can see
index.html an info dot PHP so index.html
is this far that we're currently on and
we also have that info dot PHP far which
basically gives us installation details
and configuration details of our PHP
installation so that's really useful but
you do not want to keep this file in
your web directory there's no way that
you want anyone to be able to access
this so the first thing I'm going to do
is go ahead and remove that you can
always add it in later we can also just
take a look at this so we can say cat
info dot PHP all it contains is a
starting PHP tag the PHP info function
are closing PHP tag as well let's just
remove this and no one can get access to
it so it's removed now and when we
refresh we see a not found error so
returning to this page here that's
basically our index to HTML file that we
saw in here and we can modify this later
when we do FTP so a couple of things
that we might want to do what happens if
we want to restart our web server say we
write a script that like completely
crashes everything and we we just want
to restart Apache well what we can do is
say service Apache to
start so that'll go ahead and restart ER
and there you go done so we can also do
a host of other things say we want to go
ahead and update our PHP settings now if
we go back to our root directory you see
we have this Etsy folder here so let's
go into this and let's list this
directory so we've got a lot in here but
if we go ahead and CD to PHP 5 and just
list this we've got Apache 2 so we can
go ahead and find our PHP ini file and
we can do this using FTP later so don't
worry too much but for example if we did
want to update this in the terminal we
can use vim to do this so we can save in
PHP dot ini and that's going to give us
our PHP configuration so you can go
through this you can update anything you
need to do we can hit I on the keyboard
to insert so we can go ahead and just
type anything in here whatever we want
to do and then to save it I'm going to
hit the Escape key I'm gonna hit shift
and colon and then WQ now if this is
confusing you don't worry we can do all
this using FTP and then once we're done
we can go ahead and say service Apache
to restart and that will go ahead and
take out PHP settings back into into
configuration so that's basically done
so we are currently within our server
from here you can install things you can
update anything you want
you basically have full control over
your server which is a massive benefit
over standard hosting again don't worry
if this is too confusing for you it's
unlikely you're gonna need to update
your PHP version anytime soon you're not
going to need to manage your server too
much if you do you know you can find
help online and you can go ahead and SSH
straight into your server and go ahead
and update whatever you want so in the
next video we're going to jump straight
into ft peeing into our server to go
ahead and upload project files
which is really the main reason you want
to host</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
