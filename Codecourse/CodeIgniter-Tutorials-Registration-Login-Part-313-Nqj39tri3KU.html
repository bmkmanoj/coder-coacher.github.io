welcome to video number three in the in
this new video tutorial series where I'm
building a login registration system in
CodeIgniter in this video series I'm
actually going to actually going to be
building the form at the login form
using the form helper and I also have to
apologize I notice when I was watching
the last video and just previewing it
that the mouse didn't show up and then
the most wasn't showing but I was
actually able to find find that problem
and fix it so I apologize for that
cool so why don't you get started right
away first thing we'll do open up my PHP
tags and then just do a echo form
underscore open now this receives one
parameter but we're just going to leave
it empty for now I'll show you the
reason why I just case you want to use
it for a different function or show you
bit more about it so if I save this and
run it you can see a la I'll be my page
source and it's not actually showing it
oh you know connect one of the things I
did was restart my computer so to fix
the mouse problem and that seemed to
work so now if we view the page source
see we have the form and this is
interesting actually when we leave the
print when we don't insert a parameter
into the form option form open function
what it does it just assumes that it's a
self submitting form similar similarly
tab your action attribute does in your
form form tag so if you leave it blank
only CodeIgniter will actually fill this
out for you and put and set it as as the
URL that you're currently at and then
just resubmit it to that okay so let's
go and go ahead and build our form
elements so what I'll do is I'll put it
inside a P tag close P tag and then echo
form underscore input now this receives
two parameters and
in this instance we'll only be dealing
with it with the form input form
password important submit with two two
input fields parameter sorry the the
first type we're going to use it like
the first parameter is the name the
actual like name attribute in the HTML
the second is the value so in this case
actually we're just going to leave it
blank but I will show you how to have
that autocomplete afterwards once
they've already submitted the form
saying they have errors next we will go
for a password will form underscore
password is another function and I'm
sure you can guess what it does and
lastly we have form underscore submit
which creates a submit button we'll call
this a login underscore submit in the
second the second parameter like I said
is the value in this case we actually do
need it so we can have it just say login
because as you know the value attribute
in a button or in an in an HTML button
or a submit button is the actual text
that shows up on the button so I'll just
clean up some of these view it there we
go this is auto-completed because it's
probably just another form that I've
done and I guess one thing I can do
really quick is uh put on some labels so
why don't I do that we'll go email and
save it and run it there real here's our
login form looking good as ever and now
you can see if I actually try and submit
this and go like hello welcome comm for
email and just password for password you
can see that it just resubmits to the
same URL in this case that we don't want
it to do that we actually do want to
specify the controller and the function
of the and the function in that
controller that we want to handle the
validation so in this case we'll go main
slash login
score validation which is a function
that we haven't actually created yet so
now if i refresh this page and then
submit it again
hello welcome comm and then password now
it actually redirects me to the main
controller and the login function of
that so I want to actually go ahead and
create that right now I could go public
function believe it was login underscore
validation and then we'll just load a
actually we'll just leave this empty
just so that it's there you can see it
is submitting to this and now that
controllers been created that's where it
goes so I'll leave it there for the for
this video in the next video I'll show
you the form validation and we'll
validate all that content thanks for
