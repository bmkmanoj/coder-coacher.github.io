around the most used part of chrome
developer tools and ultimately this is
going to be the very basics you need to
improve your development and this is
mainly for front-end development but it
also comes into things like making Ajax
calls which is obviously on the
front-end but it also allows you to then
inspect content you're getting through
on the back end so generally we're going
to go over the four things that you're
most likely to use within chrome
developer tools and the other thing to
note is that this is the same kind of
concept for tools like Firebug for
Firefox so even if you are not using
chrome this should still be helpful so
we're going to kick things off with the
element inspector the element Explorer
which basically allows you to look at
all of the markup on your page how its
constructed I'm also going to be looking
at styles as well so first of all let's
just take a look at what kind of files
that we're working with so in my text
editor I just have a document laid out
here I have a paragraph we obviously
have all the basic tags that we would
use we have a title here and I also have
this stylesheet just here within this
CSS directory so I'm going to go ahead
and just link this stylesheet in so it's
in CSS in its app dot CSS and I'm going
to go ahead and refresh the page so
let's change the background color to a
gray color and we also have a style
attached to our paragraph here as well
now when you are developing and you are
changing styles around or you're
changing markup around sometimes it's
easier to do this within chrome so
change all of the styles that you need
to within chrome you can go ahead and
copy and paste those styles back over to
your style sheet or you can just edit
elements on your page just to see what
happens so let's take a look at the very
basics of bringing up your element
Explorer now the main way I do this is
just to right-click on the page and hit
inspect element that's the quick way to
do that but you can also access it from
this menu just up
so obviously right-clicking and hitting
inspect element is going to bring up
your element tab just here so this panel
here is going to show all of the
elements on your page so for example we
can go into the head we can go to our
meta tags title and our Linkedin
resources just here although these are a
little bit less important to what we're
going to be doing here so we can sort of
traverse through these we can modify
this content as well so let's just take
a quick look at doing that and then
we'll move over to this area here where
we can see all of our Styles so for
example if I wanted to change this text
just here
I can double click it and I can go ahead
and how to add an extra exclamation mark
hit enter and that will automatically be
reflected in the browser area just here
so what we can also do is we can delete
elements so I'm just going to hit the
backspace key that goes ahead and get
rid of that element for a refresher
obviously that comes back because it's
being served from the file and what we
can also do is right-click here and edit
text which we've already seen but we can
also do things like edit as HTML so we
could go here if we wanted to and add an
additional element in so we could add a
span tag just in here and we could just
say hello in there so we click away from
this area and that's automatically
updated so it's added that markup in
there for you so now that we've taken a
little look around this we're going to
move over to this area here which you're
most commonly going to use for styles so
for example the paragraph tag has a
style attached to it we can see that
inside of the style sheet just here the
body has a background color as well but
we're going to be focusing on this
paragraph element so the paragraph
element here we can see here first of
all the user agent styles and these are
the default Styles applied to this
element by the browser we also have the
computed styles as well and we'll talk
about
this thing here in just a moment but you
can see that we have a display of block
on this element we have an automatic
height we have a margin and we have a
width to this as well so these are just
what's being computed in terms of the
styles now this here shows the box model
if you're not familiar with the box
model that's okay I guess I'll just
explain what each of these represents as
we go along so this part in the middle
is the width and the height of this
element as it sits on the page if we go
up one we see any padding on this at the
moment we don't actually have any
padding on this element now if we were
to go ahead and add say a padding left
of 20 pixels and we go ahead and refresh
here you can see that the padding now
represents as a green item or green box
just here a 20 pixel white box and this
is also updated here as well to show you
the sizing this is really useful when
you're working with positioning elements
within CSS you can see each of these as
you sort of move your mouse cursor over
them so the border here we don't have a
border but if we were to we would see
that border and we'd see the sizing on
this as well and notice the positioning
of this as well so we've got 20 pixels
padding on the left if we were to add a
right or a top border we would see that
here in place of these hyphens now we do
have margin on this paragraph we have a
margin top of 16 pixels I've actually
removed the bottom margin so we see that
as nothing down here but if we were to
leave that as a default we would see
that so this is a well and good but
really this doesn't help us in everyday
life
what does help us is if we want to add
additional styles to this paragraph we
can actually do that from this area here
so we can see the styles here that have
been applied via app dot CSS and what it
also does is after the colon it gives us
the line number of these styles as well
we can actually click this and it will
take us through to our sources tab which
we're not exclusive
looking out in this series but it's
useful to know that it's here it just
contains all of the files that are
basically being served from this page so
we can actually see this file now and we
were automatically taken to line five
where these Styles have been applied so
it'll be on the selector level so going
back over to our element explorer how do
we add or modify styles within this area
well we can do this by either clicking
the value of this sir of this style and
we can modify the value so we can say
well we want a 20 pixel margin on the
bottom
if we click away from this that then
adds a 20 pixel margin on the bottom and
you can see that represented by the
orange area on the page just there and
we can even add new styles so say we
wanted to just revert this back to zero
and we wanted to do just a few more
things on this paragraph so let's say
for some reason we wanted to say we want
to the width of 50% let's say we want
there to be a one pixel border and that
we solid and black we can do that and
then we could go ahead and say well
let's give this a foreground color of
red so just something really ugly we've
now got all of our styles we're not
going to want to refresh the page
because that what that'll do is it will
pull through the app dot CSS stylesheet
and reapply the styles that we actually
have but this is a really useful way to
develop within the browser so you can
actually see your changes live on the
page and what you can then do is just go
ahead and copy all of these or just the
ones that you want so I'm going to copy
them to the clipboard I'm going to go
here and I'm just going to paste them in
you can just align these up if we want
to and there we go so we've now got them
styles in here so everything has come
through as expected we can go ahead and
refresh and the same styles are
obviously applied because we've just
copied them over to our style sheet so
that's a really useful way of developing
what about this part just up here well
all this means is inline styles
so we could for example go ahead and set
the height of this to a hundred pixels
that will apply this on here but you can
see that this added this style attribute
in here so you won't often use this but
it's useful to know that it's there just
in case so we're now going to go ahead
and look at these items just here but
for that what I'm going to go ahead and
do is I'm going to get rid of this star
here I'm going to remove this paragraph
and create an anchor and let's go ahead
and say click me and we'll add a class
in here as well just so we can see what
we do with classes so I'm just going to
give this a class of link you obviously
would do this but we'll just use it as
an example so I've got this class here
called link I'm not going to add any
styles to it we just have this click
mean link just here so if I click on
this you can see that we've got that
selector in here we can just do exactly
what we want with it so we can change
the color to red everyone all that kind
of stuff and we can just go ahead and
copy and paste these in as normal so it
works in exactly the same way with
classes or IDs any selectors you already
have set up really but what we're going
to look at now is this button just here
this allows us to add a style in so
basically create a new style rule so if
for example you had on your page know or
in your CSS file no styles are told but
you had a class of link here an easy way
to just create a selector for this would
be to click on this click on this here
it will automatically append the element
type as well you don't really need this
in there but what you could then go
ahead and do is just say well I want
that to be color red you can go ahead
and copy that head over here and just
paste that in so it's as easy as that so
it just makes it a little bit easier and
you could of course just then go ahead
and get rid of the element there and
just include the class if you wanted to
so pretty straightforward now the reason
I've chosen a link here is because we
have this button just here
and this allows us to toggle different
pseudo selectors on our element so for
example if we were to do to just get rid
of this and return to our standard link
we know that when we clicked on link it
will turn a purple color by default
usually in browsers so for example if we
were to toggle the visited state you can
see you might not be able to see this
but very very slightly that's changing
the color of that to from blue to purple
so we can also toggle hover which
doesn't do anything in this case we can
toggle active in this case it's going
red so when I click this and hold my
cursor in you can see that that's going
red that's an active State and we also
have a focus state as well which by
default gives this blue border type
thing around here so this allows you to
toggle different states so for example
what you could do is over in your
stylesheet you could say link hover now
when I hover over this
I want the font weight to be bold silly
example but just to demonstrate so with
your predefined CSS style so we've got
our hover pseudo-celebrity R so we've
got hover font-weight:bold so now when I
toggle a hover that toggles the styles
that are within my stylesheet so
whatever you've defined in your
stylesheet if you've overridden the
default behavior here is going to toggle
them and you'll notice that that's being
made visible as well
so if somewhere in your Styles you have
this and you wanted to go ahead and
modify this you select the item here you
click hover you go ahead and add styles
to this as you want so we can change the
color to red if we wanted to we could go
ahead and copy and paste any styles that
we had added as part of that as we saw
before go ahead and refresh and then we
have exactly the same result here so in
terms of the element Explorer there is a
lot more that you can do within this
but generally when you are doing
front-end development you're going to
use what I've showed you just now the
most these are the most used areas of
this area here which is mainly markup
and all of your markup on your page and
then this area here which relates to
your styles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
