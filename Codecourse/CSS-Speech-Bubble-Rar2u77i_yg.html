speech bubble effect here you can see
that we've got a container with slight
border radius here and then we've got a
little triangle on the left hand side
just to finish it off so we're going to
look at doing this within something like
a comment system so for example you
might have lots of different comments
and that would produce an effect like
this so we'll be doing that and then you
can literally just take the effect and
do whatever you want with it so let's
get started on building this effect so
to start things off we'll build the
Marquardt you can see I've just
basically got a html5 document layout
here and I've got main dot CSS
stylesheet which I've linked in here
obviously if you're incorporating this
into your website as it is at the moment
you'll probably already have a star
sheet so let's create the mark-up that
we need then I'm going to create a
wrapper for all of these comments the
reason that we're doing this is we're
not going to tie the bubble down to only
have an effect in it as itself so it
means that you might have a comment list
or something else and you can
incorporate the class into this which
will then transform that list and give
you the effect if that doesn't make too
much sense don't worry we'll look at how
how we're going to do this in a moment
so I've created a comment wrapper on the
outside and then I've created a comment
wrapper on the inside for my paragraph
of text so I'm just going to say this is
a paragraph of text so this can be
duplicated so we can have multiple
instances of this and this will give you
an effect like this so we've just got
normal text down the page so we'll just
work on one for now and you can
duplicate this afterwards over in our
main dot CSS let's just change the
background color to a gray just so we
can create this white effect here and so
we'll just change this to a nice gray
and then we're going to set the comments
wrapper to just a fixed width this can
change depending on with your site's
responsive or not
and we'll also then star the comment
within them comments so we'll give these
a width of 100% just so they fill the
container and we'll also give a margin
bottom of 20 pixels so that's how I now
looks there's nothing really much change
except the background but we've now got
if we just inspect this a padding on
bottom of 20 pixels so what we're now
going to do is actually quickly we could
probably remove the paragraph within
them comments so let's just have a just
a 10 pixel on the bottom of that
paragraph so we're going to create this
bubble class now and this can be applied
to any container really and that will
transform that into a speech bubble so
we can reuse this effect so we're just
going to create a bubble class what we
can now do is apply this to here which
will then transform each of these
comments into a speech bubble rather
than just tying this down to the comment
class it doesn't make sense then if you
need to reuse it for say a forum post
and you have a class of post or
something like that so we'll create this
in isolation so it can be reused the
first thing I'm going to do is set the
positioning of this and that's because
what we're going to be doing is we're
going to be creating the triangle as an
absolutely positioned element now what
that means is we can place it anywhere
we want and that's the little point on
the speech bubble so because we need to
place this as an absolute position this
absolute it means that the outer
container needs to be positioned
relative in order to contain that
element if you're not too sure about
this we'll see how this works in a
moment so we're going to set the
position to relative on the on the
bubble we're also going to set the
background to white and this will just
give us a good idea of how things are
looking there we are so we need to add
some padding in here and we need to
change the border radius as well there's
not really much to do in terms of the
main container styling so let's give
this 20 pixels padding let's change the
color to maybe a light lighter black if
that makes sense and we'll go ahead and
the border-radius as well so two three
pixels and we'll also set the margin
left to 20 pixels now the reason I'm
doing this is because at the moment we
don't have enough room on this side to
contain the point that we're going to
need so if I just take this and I remove
the margin on the left we're not going
to have enough space for that point you
might even want to incorporate a user's
avatar in here or let profile image
whatever you want to call it so we're
done with that now we're done with the
main bubble container what we're now
going to use is a pseudo element and
that's after so we say bubble and then
we use a colon and we say after what
this does is it allow us to place
content after the element immediately
after the element so I'm going to say
content empty now we need to do this but
I could actually just say test for
example and you'll see what this does it
places element it places content at the
end of this element so we can see the
element here in our element inspector
we've got the paragraph and then we've
got this pseudo after element here the
reason it shows a double colon is we can
actually use double codon notation in
here it doesn't really make too much of
a difference it does the same thing so
we've now got this what we now need to
do though rather than entering text as
the content we want to start styling
this up to create a triangle with CSS
and that will become our point so the
first thing I want to do is I want to
give this a display of block I then want
to position this absolutely now this is
what I spoke about before so if I just
return to entering content test content
in there you can see that the position
absolute it's not moving outside of the
container but if I go ahead and get rid
of the position relative from the main
bubble that when we add things like left
0 and top 0 it comes all the way outside
of here let's just put back our
position:relative and that's then stays
inside so we want to keep that control
here so we're not going to be saying
left 0 and top 0 we'll set them in a
moment we do
left and top properties but what we're
going to do is we're going to set the
width to zero and the height to zero I'm
just going to pull this down a bit
because this just relates to the
creation of the triangle and what we do
here is we use the borders to basically
create a border and then push it through
the element that basically forms a
triangle it's just a common way of
creating triangles with CSS so we're
going to set the top and the bottom
border to transparent in color and we'll
give these I played around with these
measurements but you can basically
choose whatever you want to change the
shape of the triangle the general size
of it so we're going to use the border
shorthand property and this is going to
be 8 pixels solid and transparent I'm
also going to set the border bottom to
exactly the same thing so transparent
now what we do to actually create the
triangle effect because this is done
nothing really in fact let's get rid of
tests this has done nothing at all
really if we just take a look at the
element it's just nothing at the moment
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to
set this to a black triangle just so you
can see it against the white so what we
now need to do is we need to decide
which way the triangle is pointing
because it's pointing left we need to
set the border on the right to something
like 15 pixels again I just played
around this property and we need to set
that then to an actual color and that
will push through and it will create our
triangle effect so now that we've got
this we can position this so it sits
here and we obviously need to change it
to white so let's change the positioning
of this so we'll say left we want to be
minus 15 pixels the reason its minus 15
pixels is because we've got the width of
the triangle set to 15 pixels so that
will just sit nicely on the edge then
and then we obviously want to set a top
property for it to maybe come down 15
pixels just to keep things even then
that sits nicely there so now what we
can do is we can change this to white
and there we go we've got our CSS speech
