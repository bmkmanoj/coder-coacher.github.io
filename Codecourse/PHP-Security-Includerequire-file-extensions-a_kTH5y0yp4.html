part of a framework and you're creating
the application structure yourself it's
likely that you're going to break code
up into smaller files just so you can
require them in when you need now
regardless of what you're using this for
it really doesn't matter we're going to
focus in this video on how we properly
named files that we want to include so
we're going to take a look at an example
just here so I have a folder here just
called security and I'm going to create
a new file just within this directory
and I'm going to call that index.php now
one thing you might do is have a
database connection that you can then
share across different files so for
example you might have a folder called
app here and inside of here you might
have a new file called DB PHP so let's
create a database connection new PDO
and we'll use MySQL the host is one two
seven dot dot dot one the DB name is
website and then we have our username
and our password now naturally we don't
want anyone to see this information and
you probably already know that if we
were to going to app and DB PHP we
wouldn't actually see any code at all
because it's being compiled on the
server now if in index dot PHP we need
to require in app DB PHP that's fine we
can then write some code down here that
we'll go ahead and access our database
via our connection now there was a trend
of naming files something like DB Inc
for example so just rename DB PHP to DVD
that just signifies it's an include file
and this will work in exactly the same
way we can still now use our database
connection however the difference being
that whereas before we went into app DB
PHP which obviously doesn't exist
anymore we couldn't see the contents of
it because it's a PHP file Apache is
seeing that and it's actually being
compared with PHP but in Inc
file might not be recognized as a file
that needs to be compared with PHP and
therefore regardless of the fact that it
works when we include it on our index
dot PHP page we can now see this as a
kind of plain text file and this is
dangerous because obviously what we're
doing is we're revealing some
information about our connection and
this could be a full file of code that
you wouldn't want anyone to see wouldn't
want anyone to see the code anyway but
now what we're doing is we're giving
away our database hostname and we're
giving away our username and the
password we use to access it so to take
anything away from this it would be to
always include files that are named with
a PHP extension and that way you know
that even if people can access them
files they can never see the exact
contents of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
