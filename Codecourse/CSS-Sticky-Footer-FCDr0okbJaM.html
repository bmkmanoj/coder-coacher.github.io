building a sticky footer like you can
see here so we've got the site content
at the top and the footer at the bottom
will always remain sticky as long as
it's not being pushed down by the
content in here so let's jump straight
over to the code and start building this
okay so over to my text editor now I've
got a blank document here nothing in the
body we're going to get going in and
filling in a couple of containers here
and in global dot CSS which is LinkedIn
on this page there's also no content so
at the moment this doesn't look like
anything in the browser we've not
written much code so let's go ahead and
define the containers for both our
content and the actual footer itself now
I'm just going to be using you know
classes that I feel suitable for this
video but obviously in your application
you'd go ahead and use you know perhaps
give it your footer a specific class or
something but I'm just going to go ahead
and call the generic container that
we're going to contain everything in I'm
going to call that wrapper so all of
your site main body content will go in
here and obviously this depends on you
know if you're adding this to your page
at the moment but I'm going to go ahead
and also add a footer here I'm not going
to assign a class or an ID to it you
might you know it's a good idea to go
ahead and do that because a footer but
could be a footer of an article it could
be a footer of your main site so it
might be a good idea to go ahead add a
class here if you want so let's go ahead
and just fill some content in here so
here's the site content and it's go
ahead and fill in some footer content
here's the footer content so at the
moment this doesn't look like much it
will just appear one above the other so
what we need to do is go ahead and in
global dot CSS like I said I've linked
this in we're going to go ahead and
start writing the code out here so first
of all I'm going to target the HTML and
Oddie elements and I'm going to set the
height of both of these to 100% I'm also
going to go ahead and set the margin to
zero so you won't see the result of the
hundreds in height but you will see that
the margins are now gone and that's just
squashed against the side we don't need
to do this to achieve this hack but it
does just make the content sit against
the edges let's go ahead and just change
the color of the footer so I'm going to
say background color and I'm going to
choose cornflower blue for this just so
we can distinguish between the main site
content and the footer so that's changed
that color there so now we're going to
go on to start looking at some of the
hacks so I'm going to target the wrapper
class that we gave to our main content
area and this will basically just go
ahead and set a minimum height of 100%
if we have a minimum height of 100%
obviously that means that it always has
to be at you know at least a hundred
percent let's go ahead and check out
what this is done so you can see now
that that's pushed that content down
there now we're not quite done yet
because this isn't actually sticky you
can see it's been pushed off of the page
and we've got scroll bars here we want
to aim for having no scrub scroll bars
at all so what I'm going to go ahead and
do now is I'm going to target the pseudo
element after and this is just going to
let me go ahead and place blank content
after and I'm going to say display block
and we're also going to target the
wrapper after and the footer and we're
going to go ahead and give these both a
height of 100 pixels and then we'll go
back to the wrapper and explain what we
need to do here let's just go ahead and
look at what this may have done so you
can see there's not much changed at all
here but what we're actually doing is
we're setting the after pseudo element
to display block rather than its default
so what we can now do is say wrapper
after but we can also go ahead and
target the footer and what's going to
happen here is we're going to give these
a height of 100 pixels and that's just
going to obviously push the footer down
by 100 pixels and also set the height of
the footer to 100 pixels let's go ahead
and examine this here so you can see
that the footer has been set to 100
pixels if we just go ahead and inspect
this you can see that the wrapper we
have the wrapper here and we have the
after pseudo element as worth we just
scroll up a little bit we can hover over
this and see that the after pseudo
element has a high of 100 pixels and
that's what's responsible for pushing
this down but as well as keeping space
between the footer and the content
within this element so what we're going
to go ahead and do now is go back to the
wrapper and actually set a star
which allows us to bring the foot up and
remain sticky so if I go ahead and close
this and refresh you can see that at the
moment it's been pushed down here what
we need to do is we need to go ahead and
set the wrapper to have a margin bottom
of a - value which will then bring this
footer upwards let's go ahead and do
this now
so margin bottom - 100 pixels and we can
go ahead and refresh and you can see
that that is now sticky to the bottom of
the page so that's how we create a fixed
height sticky footer with CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
