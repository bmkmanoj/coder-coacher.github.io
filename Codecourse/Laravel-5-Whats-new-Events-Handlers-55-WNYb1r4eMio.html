looking at events in laravel continuing
on from the last video I've actually
implemented the functionality for
products to be created if we go to my
database you'll see this products table
it doesn't have anything in it yet
but if we just test this out for example
name and description and click create
we'll get the success message and it
will also be added to our database it
shouldn't be too hard to implement if
you want to follow along if you're
watching this video I'm assuming that
you're familiar with level 4 so you
shouldn't have any problem with that
what we wanted to do have just closed
the file all we want to do in this
command handler is fire an event so we
could do something simple like event
fire product was created and we could
pass in the product well we're going to
do this the object-oriented way so we're
going to go to our terminal
and we're going to create an event using
the make event command which is here PHP
artisan make event we're going to call
this product was created event we always
name your events in the past tense so
here in the events directory directory
we have this event let's just clear this
up a bit and basically this is just
another data transfer object if you
don't know what that is then watch the
previous video so all we have to do is
pass in a product that was created so
this product equals product public
product and we're done all we need to do
is fire the event so first we're going
to add a user statement so use Acme
events product was created then down
here we're going to new up that event so
event equals new product was created
event and then we're going to say event
via event and we're just going to add a
user statement for that event facade
okay so if we run this will just say
fubar some description hit enter and
we're getting an error
Acme events product was created event
was not found we named this room the
product was created event we forgot the
event so let's try that again through by
two and defined variable event whoops
that should be product try this one more
time okay we didn't add a you statement
for product product was created event
use Acme product and if it doesn't work
now I'm going to rip my hair out there
we go
now obviously events are pretty useless
if you don't have handlers before we do
that we need to decide what the handler
is going to do and while we're here
let's just put that in line let's say
that when a product is created we want
to email all users to tell them that the
product was actually created so we're
going to go into our terminal and say
PHP Addison Handler make notify users of
new product and we need to specify the
event that it's listening for product
was created event we're just going to
copy and paste that and hit enter and
let make a whoops that should be
handling event handler make HP Addison
handler event handler created
successfully so if we're going to handle
his events notify users of product
let's clean this up we don't need a
constructor now we're not going to
actually make this functional we're just
going to simply die in dump users who
are notified okay so let's try this
crate and we're getting a syntax error
on the line 26 okay try that again and
it's not actually all right okay we need
to add it to the service provider I
almost forgot about the most important
part we need to go in to providers and
event service provider but unlike these
comments all over the place with this
color scheme
it looks very messy so this is what we
are looking at we need to specify the
name of the event so instead of
providing the full class the full path
to their class we're going to use PHP
files class constant so to do that we
need to add our use statement I'm going
to use like me events product was
created and we're also going to use Acme
HD no handlers sorry events is that
right notify users of new product so
here will reference this class and here
we will reference that okay so hopefully
this won't work now let's just enter
some gibberish syntax error again come
on where's this in 14
oh right okay double collar let's try
that one more time okay we've done it
again
we need to append events to that class
name so let's try this one more time
just with some gibberish and there we go
users were notified obviously we
wouldn't just dine them that he'd
actually bring in some sort of mailer
and send to all the users but anyway
that's how you create event and handlers
and laravel five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
