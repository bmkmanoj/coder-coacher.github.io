these security regarding droplets and
how we can connect them without having
to use the root password you were
emailed now we could of course changed
the root password to something more
secure however this could still be brute
force the better option would be to use
keys now we'll be looking at each stage
of setting this up so we can make access
to our droplet much more secure and the
only downside to doing this is you can't
apply key protection to already created
servers so you'll need to follow these
steps and then create a new server
choosing the generator key that you want
to be applied it's probably for the best
don't worry because it's better to have
a server that protected than an
unprotected one and wish you'd done all
this in the first place so I'm going to
be using SSH key gen on OS X to generate
public and private keys you can go ahead
and use whatever software you want for
Windows the best option is something
like party gen which you can download
from the putty website now notice I'm
not SSH into my server at the moment
because I'm going to be creating a new
one I'm just on my local machine so I'm
going to go ahead and use SSH key gen
with the T option to specify I want to
generate an RSA key so this will then
prompt you to save your public and
private keys so I'm gonna go ahead and
hit enter now I'm also going to choose a
passphrase which is basically like an
added layer of security prompting for
this password whenever I try and use
these keys to connect so let's go ahead
and into a passphrase and this is
completely optional but I like to always
do it
so we can see that we've got some cool
information about key here now if we
head over to the directory where these
keys have between generated so let's CD
over to users and do a directory listing
there we've got ID RSA which is our
private key an ID RSA dot pub which is
our public key we can go ahead and I
open the public key and see what this
looks
like let's now go ahead and set up a new
key on digital ocean we can go ahead and
paste this in so let's go ahead and copy
this and then go ahead and close this
down so over on digital ocean let's go
over to the SSH keys section and
basically what we're going to be doing
is creating a new SSH key and pasting in
what we just copied let's go ahead and
add a new SSH key and enter a name and
we go ahead and paste the public key in
here let's go ahead and click create SSH
key and it says that the SSH key was
successfully added so now I'm going to
go ahead and create a new droplet so let
me just go ahead and refresh this page
I'm going to go ahead and enter a test
name and under the size I'll choose the
default size I'll choose the default
region and also the default operating
system but this time it says add
optional SSH keys so I'm going to go and
choose Alex here so we get the message
down here that no root password will be
emailed because we've selected SSH key
for access so once you've done this
don't expect a usual email from
digitalocean with your username and
password because we've chosen to access
this using keys so once our servers set
up we can go ahead and use our private
key to actually connect with or to our
server and we'll be doing this with
FileZilla too because because we
previously used F SFTP to connect to our
server using FileZilla we'll also need
to add the key there as well so we'll be
looking at doing a similar thing as well
so let's go ahead and open our SSH
client again I'm going to go ahead and
SSH to root at the IP address of my
server let's go ahead and copy this from
this page and head back over to our
terminal and paste this in
now what's going to happen is because we
have a let's just type yes because we
have a key basically this is
automatically used my public key to
authenticate private key to authenticate
with my public key on the server so
instead of entering a password that
would usually find what I'm entering now
is the passphrase I added to my key
earlier so in an application like party
for Windows you'd have to visit the
earth tab of putty select the private
key from your computer and you would
then use this so let's go ahead and
enter the passphrase I entered earlier
when I generated my key and hit OK and
there we go we're in as usual so the
last thing that we want to do is go
ahead and change our server so root
login isn't possible so we need to just
go ahead and simply change a
configuration here so let's head over to
it cetera
SSH and we want to go ahead and edit a
particular file and this file is sshd
config so let's go ahead and use nano
with a sudo command to edit sshd config
so let's go ahead and scroll down now
where we see the permit root login
option we're going to go ahead and
change this to without password now the
last thing you want to do is change this
to no because then you won't be able to
access using root we just want to go
ahead and add without password now let's
go ahead and save this using command + I
or ctrl + I and let's go ahead and exit
now the last thing we want to do is go
ahead and restart the SSH SSH D process
so
the new configuration will take effect
so we need to find the process ID or PID
with the following command PS aux w and
then we use grep to find SSH so we can
see here we've got a few options but the
top one here is what we need and the
process ID is seven nine one so we're
gonna go ahead and say kill HUP and then
choose the process ID this will be
different for you probably let's say
seven nine one so we're now more secure
against brute force attacks now we'll
look at connecting with SFTP within
FileZilla but providing our private key
to FileZilla so we actually get access
now again inside of FileZilla we don't
actually have a password that we can
enter here so it's no good to go ahead
and just enter the normal details so
let's set this up by entering our
username and our IP address so let's
head over to digitalocean
grab our IP and go ahead and paste this
in choose the username and choose the
correct port as well as I've already
said using a password here isn't gonna
work so we need to go ahead and head
over to the settings of FileZilla so
let's go ahead and head over to the
preferences and click on SFTP now what
we're going to do is go ahead and add
the private key file by clicking add key
file and this allow us to choose a
location in this case I've saved this on
my desktop as SSH RSA I'm gonna go ahead
and hit open now we get prompted with
this message confer key file and
basically this means that because it has
a passphrase
we need to convert it unfortunately to
an unprotected private key now this
isn't a massive deal because the
passphrase is optional so let's go ahead
and just say yes so go ahead and into my
password hit OK and I need to go ahead
and save this so I'm gonna save it as
SSH RSA unprotected hit save and we're
done so I'm gonna click OK and I'm gonna
go ahead and click quick connect now
obviously I don't need to supply a
password I'm gonna click OK here and
that goes ahead and connects me as
normal so you can now manage all of your
files as normal connecting with your key
so that's it for protection of your
droplet as we've said it's highly
recommended that you do this and you
don't leave your server open to
brute-force attack on your password or
have your password root email to you
which is again potentially unsecure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
