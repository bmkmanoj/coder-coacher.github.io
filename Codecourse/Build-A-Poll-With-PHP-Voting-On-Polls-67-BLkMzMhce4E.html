a particular pole we can click an option
hit submit and that goes through to vote
dot PHP we can then check that both the
choice and the pole both within the form
have been submitted through we can then
log that vote or answer so in here we
want to do a couple of checks obviously
the first thing we want to do is require
in our initialization file because that
contains our database connection which
we need because we're logging choices
here so we're going to do an lazy if
statement just to check if Don
underscore Post poll is set and dollar
underscore post choice is set now down
here we're just going to do a header
redirect to index dot PHP so if your
user tries to access vote dot PHP and
doesn't supply either a poll or a choice
which is would naturally be provided if
the user was used in the form correctly
then they're just going to be redirected
to the index page but you can handle
this however you want you can even have
two if statements to check the poll
first of all and then if the choice
isn't supplied you can redirect the poll
page however you want to do it so now
that we're in this position we know that
both these are available we can store
these within variables so pull equals
dollar underscore post poll and down
here we have a choice here so just in
deniz like so so we've stored both of
them now we want what we want to do is
actually query the database all we're
gonna do is one query so I'm gonna
create a vote query or whatever you want
to call it and we're gonna create a
prepared statement here so inside of
here we're gonna do something a little
bit different we're gonna insert into
this time because what we want to insert
into is polls answers and we want to
store the users ID the poll that we're
currently voting on and the actual
choice here so the choice that relates
to
and that gives us all the information
that we need so we want to insert into
polls on sirs and we're going to choose
the fields we want to insert on so that
is user poll and choice we don't need to
insert the ID because it sort of
increment now we need something a little
bit different we're going to select this
time I'm gonna select the data we want
to insert and this allows us to do a
where exists aware not exists and
another where exists to check if these
things actually already exist before we
insert them basically we don't want the
same user to vote twice so you should
get the hang of this as we go along the
query so we're gonna set user poll and
choice so we're gonna bind these a
little bit later when we execute the
query we're gonna select these from
polls now that might seem a little bit
odd because we're not selecting the data
we're inserting from polls but we're
just doing it on a table there are
probably other ways to do this I'm
pretty sure it's you might want to go
ahead and look it up if you want to
structure this slightly differently so
we're gonna say where exists this will
basically if a row is returned by this
sub query that means it exists so it
depends on the row counts that's
returned whether this is true or false
essentially so we're going to be doing
three sub queries in total so all I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna select ID just a
random field IDs probably best from the
polls table where oops sorry from the
polls table where the ID equals poll
down here we're gonna say we can pull
this one up so all that does is it
basically means that this poll actually
exists because we're saying well do a
sub query select from the polls table to
be honest you could probably have this
after this I'm not too sure but we're
basically wanting to make sure this poll
exists before user votes on it because
essentially what our user could do
is submit a post request on their own to
vote dot php' sending along poll as a
hundred which may not exist
we don't insert data that doesn't match
up in our database so we're gonna say
and exists as well we're gonna do
another sub query here so what we
checking for existence here what we're
checking that the choice exists because
again we don't want to use to insert a
choice that doesn't exist on the polls
choices table so here we do a select ID
from polls choices where the ID of the
choice equals choice again our
placeholder and we can pull that up like
so then last is making sure that the
user hasn't already voted so we're
making sure that the user doesn't have a
record in polls answers where the user
ID equals the current user that's logged
in and the poll doesn't equal the
current poll that we're trying to vote
on that might sound a little bit
complicated but let's say and it not
exists and in here again our sub query
is going to be select ID from polls
answers where user equals user and Paul
equals poll so basically if a user ID
exists here with say one and a poll
exists here let's just say one that
means that regardless of what choice
there is the user has voted user one has
voted on poll one and therefore we're
not going to allow them to vote again
which is why we're saying and that not
exists so let's pull this up we also
lastly want to make sure that the poll
is between the start and end date so
users can vote on pulse before they've
officially started so again we use and
date now between polls dot starts
and policy ends and then we're gonna
just do a limit one on the end so we've
not actually executed this query yet
we've prepared it but we need to pass in
the data to fill these placeholders so
we're gonna do is say vote query execute
and then we obviously pass our array in
so we have three this time we have user
which is our dollar underscore session
user ID and we have our poll which is
poll remember from up here and then we
have our choice down here like so which
again comes from here so we insert that
and then what I'm going to do is just do
a header and I'm gonna locate the user
back to poll dot PHP hole equals and
then the poll that's been chosen so
what's gonna happen now is when I submit
my answer we're still gonna get these
bullet points because oh these are radio
fields because we haven't created the
functionality to show the percentage
that will come next so if I just give
this a refresh we're on poll one
remember so after I submit this I expect
to see a record appear here
remember I'm signed in with user one so
I'd expect that to appear too so I'll
hit I love it and I hit submit answer
okay so we've been redirected we don't
know if this is succeeded on let's just
refresh and it looks like it hasn't so
let's just do bug this so let's grab all
of this here and let's paste this into
sequel Pro just here and let's replace
some of this information we could do
this within PHP we could output some
errors I find this a lot quicker so I'm
going to say pull one I'm going to say
option one I'm going to say user one as
well so let's just insert one into each
of these like so and that looks like
to me that's run this okay so we get an
error here it's a select ID from poles
where ID equals 1 yes of course we've
got a comma here where they shouldn't be
1 same with here as well
massive mistake on my part so let's go
ahead and just get rid of these comas
like that and let's go ahead and try
again so I'm gonna choose this pole and
then here I love it
submit that answer and we should
hopefully see that ants be inserted so
the user is 1 the pole is 1 and the
choice is 1 so again if I go to do you
like polls and do I can't stand them
that's going to give me a different
choice and a different poll so we've got
a poll of two and a choice of six so to
make sure these match up hole of two we
know that that is the do you like polls
poll and then for the choice we know
that six is I can't stand them which is
the one I just selected so more
importantly let's now check if I can
vote again on the same poll so let's
head over to here
do you like polls I'm going to choose
this this time hit submit and that
shouldn't have inserted a new record
because we've already voted that's
handled with that in our query there's a
couple of things we need to change about
this query because at the moment what's
happening is we have our check for the
poll start and end date down here in
actual fact we need to copy this and put
this up into this sub query here because
otherwise what's going to happen is this
where exists is going to fail if that
poll hasn't started so we can actually
remove these as well here now there's a
couple of other things we need to do
within this and exists here where we
check that the poll choice exists we
also alongside this need to check if the
poll matches as well and that's because
if we look inside about database under
choices or our yeah under choices we
have a poll column and a name column now
if the if the ID doesn't match whether
Poly's that means that technically a
user could vote on a choice
that doesn't exists on that particular
poll so we say we're ID equals choice
and pole equals pole so we've just
refracted this really just to make sure
that we cover all bases everything else
here should be fine now so Roman boy
inserting this data we're choosing this
data from a dummy table we are doing a
sub-query to check that the pollak cysts
and that it's between the start and end
day as we've discussed earlier also then
doing another sub query and we're
checking if the choice exists but we're
also checking if that choice is linked
to that particular poll and then finally
we're just checking if the user hasn't
already voted on that poll so we've now
given users the ability to actually vote
on polls all that's left to do now is
actually display the total answers once
a user has voted and we'll do that in
the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
