design and we know which parts of our
design
well parts of our markup make up our
overall page we can go ahead and
transfer these into individual include
files and we're also in this video
looking at the directory structure while
we do this as well so don't worry too
much if you're not if you're not sure
about why we've created these folders
I'll try my best to explain as we go
along but really this way is perfect
because it means you have a much better
manageable solution to your site than
just having say 20 files on a patent in
one directory in a bar for each page or
for each include file or database
connection or whatever you're doing so
essentially what we're doing is we're
breaking up this design into fragments
that we would include now this makes it
easier two ways for example a database
connection we create this in a separate
file because we include it in different
scripts we don't have to declare the
same code or write the same code over
and over and over again and it's the
same with this this template as well we
break it up into small parts so it's
more manageable we can also easily say
if the users logged in include this
specific page else include this other
page so it makes it easier in that sense
as well so as we looked at in the last
part of the tutorial we just have this
template here and we're going to be
looking at the directory structure and
breaking this up so let's go ahead and
actually start to create some of the
folders now the folder that the root
directory that I'm going to be working
in is LR as we named our database so we
are going to create all of our folders
and files in here template we're going
to remove eventually because we don't we
won't need this anymore because we will
have created the same thing through
includes and obviously at the end of
this tutorial we're going to have the
same result as you see in the browser
but we're going to have it using
includes and then we can start coding
and doing all the fun stuff so with
sites this is entirely up to you how you
layout but I'm going to be using the
the way I usually write choose the
directory structure and I have a core
directory now the core directory inside
contains functions and initialization
file database connections we're not
going to be looking on that just yet
but I'm going to create it there just so
we know it's there we're also going to
go ahead and we're going to create a
folder called CSS now you should have
downloaded the CSS file for this already
I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going
to copy this across I already have it in
another folder so we've got the CSS file
we've got the template the template
looks within the CSS directory for
screen dot CSS which we now have so
that's that's all good we also need to
create a generic includes folder which
will house things like our template for
example the widgets will have its have
its own directory as well so we're going
to will have a specific section where we
can create widgets so let's go ahead and
create that widgets directory now we
also need a folder for the overall
design and the overall design will be
made up of a header and a footer as
we've already seen in the last part and
then within this general folder we're
going to have things like aside the
footer the header in the menu so in here
let me just create an example create a
new text document as I'm not going to
work let's go ahead and create here
something
so within includes we might have a for
example and I'm going to leave this as
it is because we're going to be using it
header dot PHP header dot PHP doesn't
mean the overall header it means this
here so all of this will go into this
include file and we'll replace this with
include so we've got our we've create an
example of an include but now we need to
go ahead and start chopping this design
up and actually getting it you know into
this include structure so the first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
rename in a template
p i'm going to rename this to index dot
PHP
okay so rename the file we now have an
index file let's go over to our browser
and change this here so we can preview
it as we go along okay so we've got our
template now let's go ahead and just
start cutting it up so the first thing
that we want to do is go ahead and
create an include file called head and
that's obviously going to go in includes
and just we can plunk it in here
somewhere so I'm going to copy or cut
all of this I'm going to create a new
file I'm going to paste that in there
and I'm going to save this inside of
includes so that's going to be head
don't get heckled sorry head don't get
head and header confused heads the sort
of metadata title tag any script
includes anything like that
so head dot PHP saved I can go ahead and
close this and here in place of head
which is extremely important that you do
this as we go along
is go ahead break into PHP tags I'll do
it on two lines just to make it a three
lines just to make it easier for you to
see and we go ahead and we include and
then we specify the file to include now
in this case we're working from the root
directory downwards or upwards note
we'll be downwards so we'll say includes
and then head dot PHP so includes /head
PHP so when I go ahead and refresh now
you see there's no G no difference
however we've actually you know we've
actually changed the code so with an
including it now let's go ahead and just
change something let me just do this as
website title within an exclamation mark
you'll now see that that's changed so
again if I had ten of these pages all I
need to do is come in into here and make
one change and it would be reflected
across the entire website so that's
useful
same with header let's go ahead and cut
that and create an oh we don't need to
create new files we did that a moment
ago so in header let's go ahead and just
paste that in there we'll tidy this up a
bit as well close that we can close that
and we can go ahead and we can do
exactly the same thing let me just put
this all on one line it just makes it a
lot neater
in clewd
and the same directory includes /and
this time is header.php so the we've got
the head the header we now need to do
the aside so I'm going to go ahead and
get rid of this cut that I'm going to
include it before I save it just so you
know different ways of doing things
includes /si PHP go ahead and create a
new file paste the aside data in there
indent that slightly and go ahead and
save this in includes so this is a bit
of a boring task but we you know we're
cutting out signup and it's gradually
getting smaller and it means then we can
just copy something paste it over to a
new file create an entire new anti new
page we'll do the same with the footer
let's go ahead and cut that out and
include it so it includes forward slash
fitted up PHP again paste that in there
tidy up save that in includes as
footer.php let's just see what we've got
left now interestingly we've got the
menu or the navigation and the
navigation is now contained within our
header.php file so when I go ahead and
open the header file I want to save this
in a separate file in itself you can do
so with the logo if you wanted but I'm
not going to bother in this case so I'm
going to cut this out of here create a
new file again just tidy that up and
save this and I'm going to save this as
menu dot PHP or navigation whatever you
whatever you make sense to you close
that off now what we need to do is
include it now where do we include it
because this is already within the
includes directory well the answer is
that we do it relative to the index dot
PHP file so we don't we don't need to go
back a directory we just you know we do
it see in here where in includes here
we're not but we can just say
include includes ford slash menu dot
php' and when we refresh nothing's
changed that's good that's good news
okay so we'll go ahead and close header
now we need to work out where we're
going to store the overall header and
the overall footer so we need to go and
open up our directory on includes we
have our overall folder we're going to
save two files in here once the header
wants the footer the header is going to
consist of all this footer is going to
consist of all of this and we'll just be
left with a page contents and that's
perfect because then we can just you
know knock out the page contents and
we'll have a header and footer that
match every single page so let's go
ahead and just copy all of this and cut
that out create a new page in here save
that in includes overall as header.php
you could call it something like overall
head oh if it makes more sense to in
your you're not going to get you know
confused I can imagine that you would do
but I've saved that now so I can go
ahead and include it up here so include
includes ford slash overall forward
slash header dot PHP I think that's
initially why I did it because it makes
sense to say overall header with the
directory there so do the same with the
footer same process cut that create a
new file save this and going includes
overall and save this as footer.php go
ahead and close that and again we can
just copy and paste this to be quick
because it's more or less the same
directory just footer file is changed
let's go ahead and indent this and there
we go so this is now our page we've
reduced all of that markup to four lines
of code this is your content in here
this is your header this is your footer
so let's go ahead and refresh nothing's
changed it's exactly the same now we're
going to go ahead and create a new file
and this is going to be for example our
register page so let's go ahead and
create a new file I'm just going to save
this as register dot PHP
and I'm going to copy that paste that
and I'll change this to register and
I'll change this to registration page so
now I have two files that are almost
identical except for the content in the
middle I'm going to go ahead and say
register dot PHP we have exactly the
same template with just different
contents so if you've been you know
bored to death while you've been
watching this now you'll see that you'll
reap the reward of breaking this up into
into multiple parts and it's a lot
easier to include now so obviously it's
not entirely necessary to break it up as
much as I've done into individual
fragments like the menu and the widget
or the widgets are quite important but
essentially now we've broken this up now
there's one last thing to do and that is
with regards to the widgets at the
moment we have got nothing inside of our
widgets folder and that's because what
we're going to be doing is in the
sidebar we're going to be creating some
conditional statements one of them is if
the users logged in show this particular
widget that allows the user to login so
it will be a login form the else on that
if statement will be include the page
that greets the user and gives them some
additional options like to change their
password and whatever so we've got these
in inside this widget here so I'm going
to go ahead and and and sort of cut this
out create a new folder file again and
copy this into widgets and I'm going to
call this one let's just say we'll call
this login dot PHP okay
so we've now got a widget that allows us
to login so I'll just say login form
here
okay so inside of a side dot PHP now I'm
going to go ahead and include this login
form now we obviously don't want this to
be shown all the time because our users
will be logged in at once at one point
so this here is
for purposes of breaking the template up
but we're going to have some I'll just
give you a quick demonstration we're
going to have some code in here like
this of it later and what we're going to
be doing is we're going to be saying if
logged in and in here will include sort
of like logged in dot PHP a well we'll
do includes widgets logged in dot PHP so
that will show hello Alex or hello Billy
or whoever's logged in otherwise we'll
we will be including the one we're just
about to include which is login and that
will be the prompt login so you know
don't worry too much about that now but
that's essentially what we're going to
be doing so for now we'll just go ahead
and we'll include includes widgets login
look PHP and when i refresh there we go
we've got login and log in form so
that's going to be our login form
eventually and like I said we're going
to have a conditional statement around
that so we've broken up our design
successfully we've looked somewhat at
the the dwell mostly at the directory
structure and we haven't looked at the
core because that's more of the backend
we've been focusing on this design and
breaking this up so far but essentially
that's it we've got our two pages here
you've seen how easy it is to duplicate
pages and we can actually start to work
on what we all and start working on
which is the Lord login and register
process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
