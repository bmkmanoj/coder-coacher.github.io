statement in our code well that's easy
enough let's go back to our editor octo
view we're going to say if page is over
15 and this inside here we're going to
have a couple of line breaks and we're
going to say you are over the age of 15
so let's test this out perfect if we
change this to something like 10 refresh
and it's gone have it so looping we're
going to also pass in and use this right
here this is going to contain three
arrays will have name equals max age
equals 18 we're going to have two more
of these this this guy can be called
James 22 and this one can be called
Binney until give me 34 so we're going
to say for user and users and info and
we're going to say here we'll say you
said that name is use it of age years
old and we'll also add a line break
there and up here we'll also add a line
break or two in fact let's move this up
here perfect so let's test this out
great
Max is 18 years old James is 22 and
Billy is 34 this is basically the
equivalent of 4h users in the user and
it's a little it's a little complicated
to get used to since it's the Ritz
reversed if that makes sense our n PHP
our array is the first variable that we
pass and the end the variable that we
want to store the value in the second
into a gets deal the way around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
