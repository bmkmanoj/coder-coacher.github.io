user to enter a message in here along
with their name as well and have this
sent to our nodejs server and then
insert subsequently into our MongoDB
database so the first thing that we need
to do is a couple of things just to help
us out along the way by the way we're
going to be doing all of this inside of
our page we can not going to be doing
this an external file just simply
because for the purpose of this video
it's just going to make it easier for us
to look at the elements and work out
things so this is obviously best suited
in in external javascript file once it
goes into production or even during
development so the first thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to create a function
here and this is going to basically wrap
all of our functionality so that's
basically it just so we don't have any
Global's anywhere what I'm going to do
is create a useful function that's going
to be called get node and this is just
going to return a query selector based
on what we pass through to it all this
means is that we don't have to use
jQuery to go ahead and select you know
values or anything so this isn't going
to work on all browsers it's not going
to work on earlier versions of ie it's
entirely up to you whether you want to
use a library for support I'm just doing
this just because you know we're not
really massively interested in browser
compatibility as such with you know
learning the fundamentals behind how
this works so this can obviously be
tweaked to work cross browser so I'm
created this get node function and this
is going to return document query
selector and that's just going to be the
string that we passed through all the
selector rather that we pass through to
it so we now want to go ahead and get
the required nodes and what was this
going to be well we need to select all
of this stuff because we need to know
you know we need the messages area to be
able to input messages we need the text
area and the name but let's go ahead and
just focus on the text area and the name
so text area equals get node
chat names we just passed the class in
there and we're going to say chapped
name equals get node dot chat name oops
sorry that one is chat text area okay so
now that we've done this we can go ahead
and actually access these elements and
go ahead and do it we want with them but
more importantly we want to go ahead and
actually try a connection to our server
so let's go ahead and try that and we'll
catch any errors on the way because if
this fails and we can't connect we can't
really do anything so we want to go
ahead and and display this to the user
eventually so we're going to create a
variable called socket and that's going
to be equal to IO Connect remember
exactly what we did in the console
earlier and this is going to be HTTP 1
27.9 1.1 and that is on port 8080 so
that's that done and we're going to
catch the error and this is basically
just going to set status and to warn
user
we haven't actually created this
functionality yet and we won't do for a
while so where we may as well just
comment that out for now and what we
then want to do is down here check if
socket isn't undefined and if it's not
undefined I'm just going to console.log
okay so let's go ahead over here and
just refresh and it says okay so we
affirm the console to the right-hand
side just so it's easier to see and but
yeah that's okay now you know we don't
need to worry about that it's fine it
works so what do we want to do inside of
here instead well what we want to do is
attach an event listener to our text
area so let's just say listen for key
down so this is going to be where we
actually send our message so here's the
sort of you know run-through I'm going
to go ahead and type a message in here
as well as enter my name in here when
I'm inside of here and I hit enter what
I want that to do is detect that it is
the Enter key pressed I want to have the
exception of holding the control key
which is going to let me go more to the
shift key which is going to let me go
multiple line and when I hit just enter
on its own that's then going to send
that to the server along with the name
up here as well which is why we've
selected the name so when we listen for
key down we just a text area remember
we've already got this node selected up
here we want to say add event listener
and for the event listener we want this
to be key down now the function callback
here is going to store an event or
return an event and we want to go ahead
and save ourself equals this just make
things easier for ourselves and we also
want to say name equals chat name value
because we also want to obtain the value
from the chair the name text area or
text input input field so now what we
want to do is check the event for the
enter key so I'm just going to to test
this out and this is a good tip event
dot which so which is basically which
key is pressed down so when I go ahead
over here and I type in a for example it
gives me the numerical equivalent of
which Kia price so if I hit enter it
comes up with 13 so we know that we can
check for key 13 so here I'm going to
say if event dot which equals 13 and
event dot shift key now shift key is a
property which is going to be true or
false and it basically tells us if the
shift key has been held down so I'm
going to say that but I'm also now just
going to return to my console log of
event which is going to show us this so
let me just test this out so I'm going
to click in here I'm going to press
ENTER and you can see here that we've
got
shift key false here and we've also got
key code 13 and also which 13 as well so
shift key false now I'm going to hold
the shift key and press Enter and we've
got shift key
true so that also says 13 for the witch
because we pressed enter as well so well
this is basically going to allow us to
do is then if we get rid of that we're
going to say console.log send so this is
when the data is going to be sent so if
I'm in here and I type hello and just
hit enter that's going to send that data
if I'm in here and I type hello and then
I hold down the shift key and hit enter
we don't send anything and I'm going to
type hello there again shift shift enter
again and hello
then I'm just going to hit enter on its
own and it says send so that's basically
how we can allow users to do multiple
lines in the air in the text area so if
this is the case what do we want to do
well we want to go ahead and actually
send this data so how do we do this well
we already looked at socket omit the
emit method on the socket that we've
already loaded in here and using socket
IO obviously so we want to go ahead and
say socket emit and we want to pass in
an object here after we specify the name
remember the input is the name I'm
listening for here so we know this
functionality works but we're just
listening for input and this is just
going to be an object I'm going to pull
this down just to make it a little bit
easier to read and we're going to say
name his name remember name is here and
we're going to say message self dot
value now we created self here which
refers to the actual text area and value
is the property which contains the text
that's actually within this text area so
now what we're going to do is test this
out so let's go ahead and just pull over
our this here commit this a little bit
smaller just see what we're doing okay
so this is our no jess server I'm going
to type hello and hit enter and you can
see here in valid invalid yes we know
it's invalid because we haven't entered
into the name we will eventually pass
this through to here but for now we just
get the message inside of here so Alex
hello
hit enter and it says inserted so we can
now take a look over to our database if
I just pull this over and there we go so
we've got Alex message hello we've got
this n character here but this won't be
a problem in future well actually no
this is fine it doesn't really matter
too much for now but we'll be fixing all
this up in a moment so we now know that
we can send data I can send that again
if I want to you know everything works
fine but the only thing that we're
missing is the sort of ability really
this stage to let us know that the
message has been sent and also as well
clear this field when we hit enter now
we're not going to clear this field
within if we return to our code inside
of here the reason being is that
basically what we don't want to do is
clear it here because if there's a
problem we don't it to clear the field
if we want to return the error please
enter your name also I've just
remembered that we need event dot
prevent default in here and that's just
going to prevent the default behavior
for this key down so if I was to type in
Billy hello there hit enter and that
goes ahead which should go ahead and
send that so let's just take a look and
let's just check this yeah there we go
so that's that's been entered that's
absolutely fine but what we're missing
is obviously the ability to you know say
Alex test
I've hit enter that's gone ahead and
inserted but it hasn't cleared this or
passed back of status so what we're
going to do is in the next video just
focus on this status functionality and
this is going to come from nodejs itself
as well and that's just going to provide
us the ability to clear this if it's
been sent successfully and also send
back things like errors and things like
that so we'll go ahead and focus on that
that's a little bit boring but then
we'll get to the fun part and actually
get some messages loaded through here so
we can actually you know start chatting
on this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
