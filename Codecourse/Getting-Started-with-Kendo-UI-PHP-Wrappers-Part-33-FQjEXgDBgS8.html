series on getting started with the PHP
wrappers for kendo UI
in the first two episodes I showed you
how to set up the basic structure for
working with the PHP wrappers walk
through some of the code to generate the
kendo UI controls and showed how to
connect it all to a server API in this
episode then I'm going to look a little
deeper at customizing one of the core
kendo UI components the grid I'll show
you how to get the basic grade
configured with columns that come from
the API data how to create custom column
templates from a nested object in the
data how to set up add edit and delete
functionality for the grid and how to
mix the PHP with a little bit of custom
JavaScript to create a custom editor for
the records that will be working with
if you haven't watched the previous
episodes yet and you're new to the PHP
wrappers and suggest going back and
watching those first I'll be moving
pretty quickly in this episode and only
showing code that's new different or
relevant to the task at hand you'll need
to have a pretty good understanding of
the project structure and they required
PHP calls to set up the can do I rappers
in this episode
you
the first thing that I need to set up is
a data source that connects to my API in
this case the API has four different
endpoints 14 create read update and
destroy
I'll build up my data source transport
fairly quickly here with the request
type set to post and the content type
set to applications / Jason in all cases
the API is located in the / AP I /
products folder with a create read
update and destroy PHP file for each
endpoint
once I have those in place I can assign
the methods to the data source transport
I want to create a data source schema to
tell my data source what the data looks
like i'll start with the data source
schema model and set up all of the
fields that i'll be displaying and
editing each of the fields will be told
what type of data it is straying or
number a date or otherwise and you can
find a complete listing of the field
types in the documentation at doc's
kendo UI com there are two data fields
that don't use a standard data type
though supplier in category for now I'm
just going to leave those type
attributes off of these fields I'll come
back to lees later once i get to the
point where i want to add and edit
records in the grid
next I'll tell the model what field it
uses for an ID then I'll add the fields
to the model the model gets assigned to
the data source schema and the schema
gets assigned to the data source
before I move on to the grid though
there are a few other details that I
need to get into the schema and data
source I know that I want to use
server-side paging because of the amount
of data in my database it's easy to turn
on paging though just set the page size
of the data source and tell it to use
server paging in this case
the API returns data to me with the data
wrapped in some metadata that is data
that describes the response this
metadata is used by the data source and
the grid to tell me how many total
records there are and that's used to
calculate how many pages there are in
the grid the rapper data also includes a
reference to the actual data used for
display and editing of course and I need
to account for all of this in the
configuration
in my case the API returns an object
that has two key fields in it data and
total the total field tells the data
source and grid how many total records
that are in the query results while the
data field gives me the actual data to
display for the current page and page
size with that in mind I've set the
schemas data and total properties
telling the data source how to handle
the results of the API properly there
are still a few more details that need
to be covered for the data source
configuration but I'll come back to
these when I need them for now I'll move
on to the grid and get some data
displayed on the screen
you
getting a grid in place is as easy as
any other control create the grid
instance and echo the render result to
the screen
getting the great to do something more
useful though we'll need a little more
configuration
in this case the columns I want to
display include product name supplier
name categoryname unit price and units
in stock and for the most part getting
these displayed is as simple as adding a
new grid column instance telling it what
field to use from the data set and
giving the column a name
once i have the columns defined i can
add them to my grid and after i've
assigned the data source to the grid and
tell the grid that it is payable i start
to see something more useful although
it's not quite what I had in mind
I set things up so that there should
only be five records per page but
scrolling down I can see that there's
obviously a lot more than five records
in fact i'm showing the entire 80 record
data set at this point although if i do
scroll to the bottom i can see that i
have the correct number of pages listed
the problem is that the data source is
telling my server how to do paging using
a format that my server doesn't
recognize my server expects to have all
of the request parameters passed to it
as a JSON document and if i look at the
network tab and examine the read request
i can see that it's being passed back as
a standard form post instead to fix this
i need to change the transport until it
to serialize everything as json instead
of the standard form encoding
I can do that by setting up
amateur map and pointing it to a
javascript function that converts all of
the data into Jason for me
once I have that in place reloading the
screen shows the correct number of
records on the screen and if I examine
the network tab again I can see that the
read request is being made with a JSON
document instead of a standard form
encoding
you
I still haven't shown all of the columns
that I want though I've left
the supplier name and catagory name
because these are not flat fields with
single values like everything else
if I look at a sample record returned
from the API I can see that supplier in
category are nested objects with their
own set of fields
to get these to display properly I need
to configure the grid column a little
differently the category column will get
a category field and title but I'm also
going to add a custom template to
display the value from category category
name
the result is the category name showing
up in the grid the way I want
I also want to do a little more
formatting of the unit price column I'm
going to call the format function until
it the format the value as currency
the result is the inter press being
displayed in dollars and cents instead
of just a decimal
you
next up I'll add the ability to delete a
record from the product listing to do
this i'm going to add another grid
column that will contain a grid column
command item the command item will have
a name of destroy which is recognized by
the kendo UI grid and it turns this into
a delete button for me
for this button to work though I need to
set the grits editable attribute to true
now I can click the delete button and it
gives me the confirmation dialog to let
me either confirm or cancel the delete
clicking ok deletes the item and it's
removed from the grade
editing a row is almost as easy I'll add
another command item to the same column
as the destroy command to get the edit
button up and running
once again the grid recognizes the Edit
name and it handles it for me
I'm also going to change the editable
setting to the string pop-up this tells
the grid D is a pop-up window for
editing instead of inline editing
directly in the grid
now when I click the edit button I get a
mostly functional editor window
everything except for the supplier and
category fields look pretty good and if
I didn't have any special considerations
for these two fields I'd call this done
but I need to fix this of course and it
all goes back to the supplier and
catagory fields being nested objects and
not simple flat data to handle this then
I'll build a custom editor for each of
them
you
at this point I'm going to step out of
the PHP for a moment and show how easy
it is to make the leap from PHP to
JavaScript and back I want to build a
drop-down list for the supplier in
category editors and I want to have that
drop-down list load data from my server
API now rather than walk through the
entire configuration of a drop-down list
at this point I'm just going to paste in
the to JavaScript functions that I need
with these two functions in place I need
to reference them
the editor setting in the supplier and
category columns of the grid and I can
do that by setting the editor attribute
to the name of the JavaScript function
the grade uses this name to find the
functions and calls them when needed
when i refresh the browser and click the
edit button for one of the records now I
see the drop-down list that I need for
both the supplier and the category
you
the last thing I need to do is add new
products and I want an Add button to do
this I won't be adding another command
to the last column though since I don't
want an Add button on every row instead
i'll create a grid tool bar item with
the name of create then I'll add this
object as a tool bar item instead of a
column
the grid recognizes the create name
again and adds the right button to the
grid for me when I click the add new
record button I get the same form as
editing only I don't have any values in
the product name category or supplier
fields when I fill in the information
and click update though well nothing
happens it turns out my API is not
getting all of the information that it
needs and I haven't put any real error
handling in here to show that there was
a problem on the server
the API expects supplier and category to
be nested objects the same way it
returns data to the page but when
creating a new record the supplier and
category fields don't exist yet
when the drop-down list for the supplier
and category are changed it attempts to
bind the selected name and ID to a
non-existent field and the field remains
undefined
to fix this I need to set the default
value of the supplier and catagory
fields to an empty JavaScript object of
course i'm using PHP to do this so i
need a way to tell the PHP code to use
an empty javascript object
it turns out this is easy as I showed
them the first episode of this series
the PHP rappers will serialize PHP
objects into JavaScript objects for me
I can set the default value of the
supplier field and category field to
empty PHP object instances and when this
gets processed the PHP objects will be
turned into empty JavaScript objects
now when they reload the page add a new
product and set the supplier in category
everything is set and saved correctly
this means I now have a fully functional
grid where i can add new products make
changes to it and delete it when I'm
done with it
you
I hope you've enjoyed the series on the
PHP wrappers for Kendall us web controls
while I haven't covered every last
aspect of every control I've gone
through all of the core concepts that
you'll need to get up and running to
create kendo UI controls with PHP code
connect them to a data source and
integrate them with custom JavaScript
and other configuration to produce the
desired results
for more information on the PHP rappers
or kendo UI in general be sure to check
out kendo UI calm where you'll find
links to the server rappers
documentation and demos for all of the
controls and more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
