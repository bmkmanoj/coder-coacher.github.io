server is really really straightforward
because all you really have to do is
copy over the files that you download
and go ahead and hit them within your
browser now there are important security
considerations when you are uploading
any software like PHP myadmin to your
server because obviously it will then be
publicly available so anyone can go
ahead and access it so again I wouldn't
recommend using PHP myadmin but if you
do need to use it you can password
protect it with an HT password
obviously when you do upload this you
will have you know it be password
protected anyway because you need to
enter your password but if there were
any vulnerabilities in PHP myadmin it
just means there's another entry to your
database so the first thing that you're
gonna want to do then to get PHP myadmin
up and running on your server is go
ahead and download it so if you head
over to the PHP myadmin site you'll be
able to download the latest version once
you have that downloaded you'll
obviously have all of the files that you
need to go ahead and copy over now I've
already copied this over cuz it does
take a while but within your FTP client
you want to create a folder called PHP
myadmin or whatever you want to call it
make sure this is secure or remove it
when you don't need it any longer and
you're gonna want to copy all of them
files that we've just seen over to this
directory so once that's all copied over
you will see your directory within here
or you can just go ahead and type this
in to your web browser and then you'll
see the PHP myadmin Start screen now PHP
myadmin has improved in the sense that
all you really need to do now is go
ahead and enter your username and
password so we can enter root as I use
the name we know that that's our
username and we can remind ourselves of
our password if you didn't set one when
you ran MySQL secure installation and we
can go ahead and just copy this root
password we can paste in here and hit go
and that
takes us directly in obviously if you
are using additional user accounts you
can go ahead and enter that that user
name and password like I recommended you
set up another user that has limited
privileges so you don't run into any
security considerations but obviously
you have the option to manage your users
within here as well so here's that
project database we created earlier with
that users table we can basically just
browse this as we normally would and you
can go ahead and set everything up you
need in here again remember that make
sure that this is secure so don't have
this floating around in your root
directory so go ahead and remove it when
you don't need it or protect it with
some kind of HT passwords so basic HTTP
authentication and that is pretty much
it although I wouldn't wouldn't
recommend using PHP myadmin
that is how easy it is to copy over to
your server and go ahead and manage your
databases this way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
