and we're basically just going to define
a function with a couple of parameters
and we're going to actually return a
value from this function and this
function is going to be adding two
numbers together so nothing too tricky
but you'll understand the fundamentals
of a function in PHP so let's go ahead
and define this function I'm going to go
ahead and give this the name add now you
notice I've used the function keyword
the function name which can't be a
reserved word so for example it couldn't
really be called echo and well we'll
take a look at why let's just load this
up in the browser you see hits as
unexpected echo so you know at that
point that you've used a reserved word
ad isn't is not a reserved word we use
parentheses which are going to contain
our list of arguments or parameters that
we want to pass to the function which
will be accessible from within it and we
use a starting curly brace and an ending
curly brace for the function block so
let's just take a look at how this might
work so let's echo out five and we need
to obviously call the function because
as it stands we've registered the
function but we've not actually called
it so we call the function just by using
the function name and then parentheses
like this so what's now going to happen
is we'll just see the value five now
what we are actually doing here is
echoing five rather than returning five
now functions really should return
values rather than actually echo
anything else so what we want to do is
we want to return five and what this is
going to do is when we call the function
here the function will then contain the
value that's been returned
you can only return once in a function
you can return multiple times but once
you've returned that function will cease
to run the rest of the code underneath
it so if we do something like echo Alex
here you'll notice that when we run this
we don't actually see that output to the
page because we've already returned a
value from this function if I was to
place the echo above the return you
would actually see this so we would see
echoing Alex then we actually return
five so for now let's stick back to
returning five now I'm going to echo
this function so what this is going to
do is it will call the function return
the value five then it will echo out the
value so it's the same as really doing
echo five so let's take a look at that
in the browser and we see that we see
the value five
okay so now let's take this up a little
bit more and we'll say let's define two
parameters that we want to use within
this function now we notice that earlier
when we were talking about variable
scope that we have say for example num
equals five we couldn't do something
like return num because we would have to
use the global keyword to make this num
available now we don't want to do that
because it's messy and it's completely
unnecessary but if we do have a function
we want to take with values that we can
insert into the function or use in the
function and then output so I'm going to
say num1 comma num2 and this tells the
function that we are expecting two
parameters to be passed to this function
so we could return num1 plus num2 for
example now I'm going to go ahead and
run this page without actually defining
any parameters and we'll see what will
we'll see what we get back here we've
got quite a few errors this error here
relates to this and this error here
relates to this and the reason being is
that we have a warning here missing
argument 1 so that's the number 1 for
add and it tells us where it's called
and then we have a missing argument too
and here we have undefined variables
num1 and num2 and that's because we are
trying to access these variables that
haven't been defined yet so what we can
do is then go ahead and pass two numbers
in so I'm going to pass in 5 and 15 and
that will satisfy the requirements for
the function parameter list and
therefore return us with 20 now what we
can actually do to avoid this is we can
actually give default values to
parameters so let's say we want these
but by default to be 0 what happens if
we call add now without defining a
number now we're not actually going to
get the error because we've already
defined the the default values
therefore this will be zero at zero
which is obviously zero so now we just
see the value zero so it might make
sense that when you're building a
function to actually give a default
value whether that be a zero an empty
string or any other data type to then
allow your function to be called with no
parameters and return perhaps some kind
of default value so in this video we've
looked at adding two numbers together
using a function that we've created in
PHP with default values we've returned
the results we've seen what happens
within our function how we can return
things and then we're just echoing out
the return value of this function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
