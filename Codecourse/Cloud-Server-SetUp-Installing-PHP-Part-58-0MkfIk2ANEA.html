we also do it with the apt-get Command
so let's go ahead and use sudo apt-get
and again we need to go ahead and choose
the name of software to install in this
case it's a PHP 5 now we also want to
include the module that allow PHP to
work with Apache otherwise we're just
installing PHP without any tie into our
web server we also want to go ahead and
install m kripp to provide the m kripp
library this is optional but highly
recommended as it will give you access
to algorithms with functions like crypt
and the password hashing API which uses
crypt for secure hashing so anyway let's
go ahead and do that so it's Lib Apache
- mod for module and PHP 5 and we also
we also go ahead and install PHP 5 in
crypt so let's go ahead and run that
oops
so you used the install command here so
that will go through and install we go
ahead and hit yes for this question
and now that's done let's go ahead and
create a new file using the touch
command so let's touch index.php
remember we're still in the VAR dub dub
directory so this will basically just
create a new file an empty new file so
we'll now go ahead and use Nano to edit
that so we do sudo nano index.php and
i'm going to go ahead and start writing
some PHP code so now all do is just go
ahead and just echo out hello this works
so what we'll do now is use the command
+ I or ctrl + O and they'll go ahead and
use ctrl + X to exit and let's hello
everyone and see what that looks like so
I'm going to do forward slash index dot
PHP and you can see that we've used PHP
code and we get the expected output so
you've now installed PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
