that we currently clicked on in here by
using the slug in the URL to lift this
from the database and then go ahead and
output it to the user so at the moment
we can just see page here we're going to
do a very similar thing that we did on
the home view remember we have this home
view here by outputting a header and a
footer but let's first of all just write
the PHP that we need to actually pull
this record out so the first thing that
we want to do then is require in app
start dot PHP remember that's the file
that contains our database connection
and any of our global variables that
we've created and the first thing we
want to do is check if the page key here
is set in the query string and if it
isn't we want to set the page to folks
just so we can check that in our view so
let's create an if statement just here
we're gonna check if something is empty
and that is dollar underscore get which
is a get super global which will contain
all of the values sent in the query
string and we're gonna check if page is
empty if page is empty
we're gonna set page to false otherwise
we want to go ahead and grab the page
and that page will be the value that we
passed in so for now let's just do a var
dump on dollar underscore get I'll get
super global and let's just see what
this looks like so you can see here
we've got an array with one element the
key is page and the value is a string
first page and again if that was second
page we would see this update
accordingly so now that we know what
data we're working with we can go ahead
and create our query but I'm gonna store
here first of all the slug which is
basically just what we saw a moment ago
so now we can create our query and we're
going to do this slow
differently by using a prepared
statement so all this means is we're
going to create a query which isn't
going to run straight away until we
execute it but we're gonna create a
placeholder for the slug and the reason
that we do this is because this is user
control data the user can change this to
whatever they want to so that means that
we're vulnerable to SQL injection if we
just put it into a query and that can
have very bad security implications on
your database so let's create a variable
called page and assign to it a database
prepared statement so in here again we
do exactly the same as we did for the
home page we have a string with the
query in this time we're gonna select
all fields because we're gonna need them
all and we're doing this from the pages
table but this time we have a where
clause and this is going to allow us to
pick out this value so we're gonna say
west' slug equals now ordinarily you'd
have something where slug equals first
page and that's gonna go ahead and bring
back only this record and then the same
if it was second page or any other slug
you would see that but we're not going
to do that what we're gonna do is we're
gonna create a placeholder and that
involves a colon and then the name of
the placeholder so at the moment the
query has not been run we need to
execute it and we need to decide which
value replaces this value here we
already know that that's the slug up
here so let's say page execute and
inside of here we pass an array and the
key to the array is the name of the
placeholder so it must match this here
so in this case it's slug and to that we
assign the value slug which we get from
up here so now that has run the query
and we can go ahead and pull the result
back so to do this I'm just gonna say
page and I'm going to assign page fetch
we don't need to fetch all here because
remember we're only pulling back one
result
we could even demonstrate this by saying
limit one expiry ever'one one result
back from this but to fetch it as an
associative array we do the same thing
we say PDO and then this static fetch a
sock so let's do a quick var dump on
page just so we can see the result of
that that's refresh and now you can see
we get an array of seven that's the ID
label etc etc so all of the fields from
that database table and that row so
again we can choose second page if we
want and we see this and you can
obviously see at this point we can click
this and we get this information we
click this and we'll get this
information so in nicely tying it up now
we're just not outputting it to the user
just yet so let's go ahead and do that
now and then we're going to return to
look at how we can modify the dates so
we can actually output the dates in a
nice format so we need to create the
View for showing a page so in side views
I'm going to create a new folder to
store anything related to pages so I'm
just going to call that page and inside
of here I'm gonna create a new file
called show dot PHP this is gonna be our
show so show page so let's require in
view route much like we did on the home
page and then forward slash page showed
up here sheepy so the path to that file
and now when we see this page we see
show page and show page so let's click
on first page and we'll start seal this
information come out someone showed up
PHP this templating works in exactly the
same way as home so we can copy this and
we can paste it into here we can do the
same for our footer as well we don't
need to retype these and now in here we
want to output the actual page
information so the first thing that we
want to do then is check if the page was
actually found or not remember we set
this to false if the query string was
empty and also the query will return
false if
can't find this page as well so we've
got a false value if it can't be found
either way so we say if not to page or
we could save page equals false
we want our else here and then we want
our end if so if the page cannot be
found or there's no slug provided we
want to say no page found
sorry otherwise we want to go ahead and
output our page so remember we have this
page variable that we can work with here
so I'm going to create an h2 and inside
of here I'm going to echo page title so
let's see what that looks like there we
go so we've got my CMS because we
included the header and the footer and
there is the text for our first page
let's go back and just click on 2nd page
and we can see this is the second page
so it's already starting to come
together now before we go any further we
want to talk about security because what
we're doing here is we're outputting
values from our database table without
escaping this value and by escaping I
basically mean converting special
characters like double and single quotes
to HTML entities now it might sound a
little bit confusing but let's take a
look at why we might want to do this so
let's head over to the first page you
can see the titles there and you might
think well I control of all of this
database data so it doesn't really
matter but if anyone was to gain access
to your database for example what they
could do is go ahead and enter something
like a script tag which can have bad
implications in terms of things like X s
s attacks we won't go into that too much
but you just need to know that it's
pretty bad so we've got a script in here
that's just alerting out the value 1 so
when I go ahead and refresh here you can
actually see that we get this output and
this isn't good because it means
that were allowing code from database
that were outputting to run JavaScript
so let's just go ahead and start to
implement a way to escape data on the
way out
so inside of app I'm gonna create a new
file and this is going to be called
functions.php it's just gonna store some
functions we're just gonna have one in
here so we have function and we're gonna
call this e escape you can call it
escape if you want to be more explicit
and inside of this we want to pass in
some text so this is the argument that
we want to be able to pass in so what
we're going to do here is we're going to
use PHP function called HTML special
chars and all this is going to do is
it's going to convert any special
characters to HTML entities which will
mean that they can't be executed so
script won't be able to be executed
you'll just see them on the page and
we'll see how this works in a moment
so we want to return the result of HTML
special chars
in here we pass in the text that we want
to escape and then what we do is we pass
in the level of escaping so for me I'm
just going to say int quotes you can
look this up on the PHP manual to find
out the different levels of escaping if
you do come across any problems so the
last is going to be the character
encoding and I'm going to set this to
utf-8 because what I've done is if you
didn't notice before inside of the
template in the header the page char set
or character encoding is utf-8 so all
this means is that we're matching the
escaping here to the character encoding
of our page so now what we can do is we
can wrap this or anything we want to
sanitize or escape rather in this a
function so on show we can go ahead and
wrap this like that so it's a pretty
easy function to use but you know then
your
getting against XSS attacks so let's
view the page source of this just to see
what this looks like at the moment it's
just a script tag which the browser will
interpret as a JavaScript tag and it
will go ahead and execute this code but
we don't want that so let's go ahead and
put in our e function again so remember
we're passing this value into the e
function and then it's going ahead and
returning the escaped output now when i
refresh we obviously need to include
this somewhere in our code so inside of
start dot PHP we can require in
functions dot PHP then we won't see this
cool to undefined function error and now
you can actually see the code being
output and this isn't a problem because
if we look at the page source again you
can see that the greater than and less
than signs here have been converted to
entities which mean they are not
interpreting the script tags they're
interpreted as actual characters which
can be output to the page so we can use
this for any data we go ahead and output
to the page and we know that we are just
making this a little bit more secure so
let's go ahead and just get rid of this
for now we know how that works and
that's we're done and let's carry on
with the rest of this page so let's head
over to show the next thing that we want
to output is the body so let's go ahead
and echo out E and inside of ear we're
going to pass in page body so we now
have the body of our page and we are
going to output the created and updated
dates to but we're going to modify these
slightly because what we're not doing is
we're not returning these as date/time
objects that we can modify in the way
that we want at the moment they're just
stored as strings in our database so if
we try to manipulate this in any way
it's not going to work so just under
here then I'm going to modify the
original array that's been returned and
I'm going to check if
the page has been found first of all
because we don't want to modify anything
if the page has not been found and we're
going to say page access the created
column and we're going to reassign this
a new date time object and all we do
here is we pass in page created and
instead of a string we now have a
date/time object inside of this created
key and all that means is we can use the
functionality around date/time to
manipulate the dates in the way that we
want format them in the way that we want
and things like that so we can also go
ahead and do update it as well but we
need to check that the updated date
isn't null so in this case we can just
say if page updated so if there is a
date inside of our updated column we can
go ahead and do exactly the same as we
did here to that so I can just copy and
paste this change that to update it and
change that to update it as well so
there are a lot more efficient ways to
do this but for now this is just a good
example of how we can use date times
instead of strings inside of our dates
so we can output them in the way we want
so this hasn't changed anything at all
but now we can start to look out putting
the date just down here so we have a
class called faded we're going to be
including all of this inside of a
paragraph so we can assign this the
class faded and that's just inside of
app dot CSS if you want to take a look
at that you got color
BBB so that's all we're doing for that
so now inside of here we want to say
created on and let's just try and output
that date/time object so what we would
normally do in this situation is say
echo page created and let's see what
happens just here so you can see here
created catchable fatal error object of
class date/time could not be converted
to a string all that means is we're
trying to
echo out an object and we can only echo
out things like integers strings
anything that can be just immediately
seen you can't echo out an object but
what we can do is because this is now an
object we can go ahead and use the
format method to choose the format that
we want to output this in so I'm gonna
choose j/s this is just going to output
the date and then this th or st
depending on the day of the month then
we have the month and then the year so
that's just capital m capital y when we
refresh we see that so you can chop and
change this around if you just wanted D
like that for example you'd get that out
it's entirely up to you what you do now
but now you've got the flexibility to do
this so what we want to do then is I'm
just going to pull this down to make it
a little bit easier to read and we want
to check if the page has been updated or
not so inside of here we can create an
if statement and we're going to say if
page updated so it's still again we're
checking if that is null because if it
isn't updated we don't want to output a
formatted date because it won't work
because we all have a null value just in
here we're gonna say last updated and
then we can just go ahead I guess and
copy this paste that in there so we have
the same format we just need to change
the key that we access here so at the
moment this isn't going to show us this
it's just created on let's manually add
in an updated date just to see that this
works and let's refresh and there we go
it's last updated 16th of May whatever
we can even go and add in things like
the hours the minutes and then whether
it's a or p.m. like so so 0 31 a.m. ok
so let's just get rid of updated let's
add capital null in there to null that
field again that just gets rid of that
and that is it for our CMS page we can
click on second page and see the
information about
second page so we've come a long way
from the start in the fact that we've
listed out our pages we can click into
that we can see the contents of our page
the next thing we're going to look at is
adding pages through our kind of admin
panel which should remember is this
protected folder just here without HT
access now HT password</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
