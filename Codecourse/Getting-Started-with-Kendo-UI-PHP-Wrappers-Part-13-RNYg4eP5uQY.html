series on getting started with the PHP
wrappers for kendo UI in this episode
I'll walk you through the installation
of the wrappers and show you the basics
of how to use them I'll look at a few of
the PHP objects that the kendo UI
wrappers provide and what these objects
really do for us it will use the
wrappers to add kendo UI widgets to a
web page and populate a widget with data
from a kendo UI data source
to get things rolling I set up a folder
for my web project and added Kendall you
is JavaScript and CSS the JavaScript is
in a je s folder and the style sheets
are in a CSS folder I've also added a
header and footer PHP file that
contained the basic HTML declarations
and kendo UI scripts and style sheet
references this is really just the
standard setup for a kendo UI project so
far a web page with JavaScript and CSS
references
to use the PHP wrappers for kendo UI I
need to copy them for my Kendig you I
download I'm going to grab the lib
folder from the download and paste it
into my project
now the name of this root folder really
matter that much but it's best to stick
with conventions from your team and
preferred server framework I'll stick
with libs since that's what the can do i
download gave me and I'm not going to be
using any frameworks
having copied all of the files that I
need into the folder i want i can open
up my favorite code editor and add an
index PHP file to get started from here
i can start writing PHP code to generate
the kendo UI controls
than PHP web server and then via the
contents of the page I've just created
at localhost colon 5,000
now as I said I'm not going to do
anything fancy with PHP or use a
framework like laravel or symphony or
anything else I'm just going to write
some simple PHP that illustrates the API
for the gun DUI wrappers for your
production app slow you'll want to stick
with whatever framework your team is
chosen and the kendo UI rappers will fit
right in
you
the PHP wrappers for kendo UI provide a
set of classes to wrap up the
configuration of its control sweet now
this is an important point to note these
PHP rappers are just wrapping the
configuration of the controls I'll talk
about this more but to start with I want
to show you how easy it is to get a
control in place that a create a kendo
UI control I need two things i need the
kendo UI autoload script and I need an
instance of the object I want to create
a calendar control for example needs an
instance of the kendo / UI / calendar
object after I've called require once on
the auto load PHP file
eckel the results of the render method
from the calendar control out to the
page and when i refresh the browser i
see the kendo UI calendar control it's
simple enough to get that in place but
what's really going on here how did that
PHP code create the kendo UI calendar
a quick look at the HTML source that was
sent down to the browser will show us
what's going on
as you can see the cost of the PHP
object didn't produce the full HTML
layout CSS or JavaScript to visualize a
calendar on the screen rather it only
produced the JavaScript that was needed
to use the standard kendo UI calendar
control and this is ultimately what the
PHP rappers do
like the asp.net or jasp wrappers the
PHP code that I rate does not render the
kendo UI control on the server it only
produces the necessary JavaScript to run
the control in the browser and then it
lets the existing code for the browser
do its thing this is important to note
and to understand because once I start
dealing with data sources for the
controls I have to remember that I am
NOT iterating a data source on the
server in order to render HTML rather
I'll only be configuring a kendo UI data
source that is used in the browser by
the JavaScript controls
you
to illustrate the point about generating
client-side JavaScript I'll build a
drop-down list with a data source to
populate the list the data for the data
source will be an in memory array of
items instead of an API from a server
for now first I need to build a simple
array of object literals this will be
the data that shows up in the drop-down
list
next I'll create a data source instance
and call the data method passing in the
array of PHP objects
you thinking I said this isn't going to
iterate and render the control on the
server and that's still true it's not
going to do that
what it is going to do though is convert
this PHP array into a JavaScript array
so that our browser will understand it
and be able to use it in a kendo UI data
source for the drop-down list
so with that in place I can create a
drop-down list and assign the data
source to it
now when I Eckel the results of the
drop-down list render method to the page
and refresh the browser I see the
drop-down list that I expect with the
items that I added
and if I look at the source for the page
I can see that the server sent down all
of the JavaScript that I needed to get
this drop-down list up and running
including the array of items that were
serialized from the PHP objects
you
as you can see the PHP wrappers for
Kendra
are fairly straightforward to work with
and in what they produce in the end the
rappers are only generating the
JavaScript that the browser needs so
that the browser can run the standard
kendo UI controls
and what I've shown here is only the
first step in taking the advantage of
these PHP wrappers there's a lot more to
show and a lot of features that can be
facilitated through PHP including the
configuration of remote data sources
lazy loading of hierarchical data server
side paging custom editors for grids and
much more
in the next episode then all
what it takes to load a candle you I
treeview with data from PHP server and
have it lazy load the data hierarchy
when a tree node is expanded
