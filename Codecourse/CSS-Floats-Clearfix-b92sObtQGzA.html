common problem with floating elements in
CSS and that is if we were to float an
element left or an element right in this
case I've got two elements one left one
right that's the two black boxes that
you can see on either side of the page
and we have this gray container in the
background so if we just inspect this
take a look we've got this container
which is the light gray background and
we've got a box that's floated left in
the box that's floated right and we
actually have a clear fixed clasp on
here which is actually preventing this
container from collapsing up to itself
so basically what it's doing is it is
clearing any floats in a cross-browser
friendly way so we don't see this issue
with it with it collapsing and you'll
see now the wall happened is if I get
rid of this clearfix clasp this actually
collapses the containers still there is
just collapsed and if we were to go
ahead and get rid of box right and let's
say with box left remove the float on
this you can see that the container
comes back so if you've ever faced this
problem with floating elements and not
being able to keep control of containers
we'll go ahead and look at implementing
a reusable cross browser friendly way
quite a short way of clearing clutter
clearing floats within containers okay
so I'm over to my text editor we're
going to go ahead and write this markup
from the start just to help us
understand how the floating within this
works and how the clear fix is going to
remedy remedy this I've also attached a
global dot CSS style sheet which there's
nothing in at the moment we're doing
everything here from scratch but the
basic document markup is here so the
first thing I learned is create this
gray container we'll see what this looks
like so go ahead and create this
container so the class here I'm just
going to give container and within here
I'll just type in test for example so
this now has a container around it and
we're going to go ahead and star this
with a light gray background so inside
of global dot CSS let's go ahead and
target this container class and we'll go
ahead and give this a back
round of hash CCC and what this is going
to do is basically just give that a
background so let's go ahead and create
these two elements here and these are
going to be box elements so we're going
to these are going to share a class and
the box element is going to be a width
of a hundred pixels a height of a
hundred pixels and we're going to have a
darker background here so two to two for
example so this is now going to look
like this so you have these two boxes
that are underneath each other now what
we want to do is we want one floater to
the left which sort of this one is by
default but we want this one here
floated to the right and we'll see that
by doing this as we saw in the
introduction we're going to get a
problem so I'm going to go ahead and I'm
going to create a generic float:left
class if you like so this is going to
float this element left and if we just
copy and paste this down change this to
right and change the float to right so
we can now apply this left and right
class to any element and that will float
it left or float it right so in this
case I'm going to float the first box
left and I'm going to float the last box
right now what we see is the gray
background disappear and this is quite
confusing for a lot of people and
understandably it's confusing because
you know we wonder where the where the
containers gone so basically what we
need to do is we need to implement this
clear fix class which we can apply to
our container what this will do is it
will say after this element clear all
floats so it will actually just tidy
everything up and the container will
naturally fit to the elements within it
that are floated so let's go ahead and
actually build this clear fix class
we'll go ahead and take a look at why
we're doing each thing it's very hacky
but it you know provides a solution to
reuse this wherever we need to clear
floats so I'm going to go ahead and
create a
clearfix class here but what I'm
actually going to do is rather than just
have a clearfix class I'm going to use
pseudo elements to go ahead and say I
want this to apply for before this
element and after this element as well
so we go ahead and get rid of this and
after the first thing that we're going
to do is go ahead and add a Content
property and this is just going to be a
space and this just basically allows
this to work in opera and what we're
then going to do is go ahead and display
block so what this is doing is if we go
ahead and ply apply it to this element
we'll take a look in the element
inspector so nothing has changed yet
that's absolutely fine but we can now
see that we've got the pseudo element
before and after and what this is going
to do is just going to allow us to go
ahead and now provide the after on its
own and what we can now do is use the
clear property which may have come
across before and clear:both is going to
go ahead and clear left and right floats
the options for this are clear left
clear right or click both so we're going
to go ahead and clear both and this will
clear all floats now this will work if
we go ahead and refresh that then clears
because what happens is this is being
applied after we click on after just
here you can now see that we've got
content with a space for the opera hack
display block and then we've got the
actual clear:both here if this was say
clear right it wouldn't what it would
work because we've got a right floating
element there and with left it will as
well but we want to clear both so as
with the last thing we've got the before
element here as well so we can actually
select these in the element inspector so
now that we've got that there's a one
last thing to do which is regarding D ie
has has layout property and this is part
of the Internet Explorer rendering
engine and what we basically need to do
is with this we need to trigger the
house layout in Internet Explorer and
this this is for Internet Explorer 6 and
7 and this is quite a well it's a very
hacky rule but basically what this means
is is that this you know clearfix will
work for us in Internet Explorer 6 and
Internet Explorer 7 so what we want to
go ahead and do is say clear fix as
we've done before and we don't use after
or before Hicks it's not supported what
we do to say Asterix zoom and 1 this is
now going to allow this to work in I 6 &amp;amp;
7 so it works perfectly for a modern
browser like chrome and other browsers
as well including opera but we've also
provided support for 6 &amp;amp; 7 so wherever
you need to use this clear fix element
whatever container you're creating we
could create another one down here all
we're really doing is we're adding an
additional class in here to actually
clear fix this and you can go ahead and
call this whatever you want there is a
bit of debate about should this be
called clear fix or should it have a
shorter name so CF or clear or you know
anything else there's there's a variety
of different opinions or preferences
rather and what this should be called
but basically that's how we clear fix in
CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
