controller this is going to be a home
controller and this is going to output
two different things
firstly if we're not signed in we're
just going to output some default text
which is what we're going to be doing in
this part and then later on when we are
signed in we can output our timeline and
as part of this video as well we're
actually gonna be building up our
template for our entire site so we can
just easily include content within our
template and we're gonna be setting up
bootstrap as well and we're gonna be
creating a navigation at the top which
we can add to later and make more
dynamic whether the users signed in etc
so let's start by creating our first
controller so if you have over to app
HTTP controllers you'll want to create a
new file in here and this is going to be
called home controller dot PHP so within
here we need to namespace this where
names facing everything even controllers
so remember this name space under chatty
as our top level and then we have HTTP
and controllers we'll need to do this
for every controller but of course if
you can create any other controllers we
can just copy and paste this later so
the class is home controller and this
extends our base controller which is
just called controller that's this file
just here so we need inside of here a
method which is going to return our home
view which we don't have at the moment
but we'll be creating that in a moment
and I'm just calling this function index
or this method index so we're gonna
return here view home the later on we'll
have some logic in here to return the
timeline if the user is signed in so
you'll notice that this obviously
doesn't change the fact that we see this
view welcome not found and that's
because if we head over to our routes
file which is also under our app HTTP
directory you can see that all we're
doing for our base route is when we hit
our home page we're just returning a
view in here within a closure so I'm
gonna get rid of this and we're gonna
use the controller for this route so
we're going to say route get
/then here this time I'm gonna pass an
array rather than that closure so in
here then what we want to do is say uses
I'm going to specify the name of the
controller but we need to give the full
name space as well so we're going to say
chatty HTTP controllers home controller
and our method name which we put after
this at index I'm also going to give
this a name as well so we can reference
it later when we want to build up links
to it so I'm just going to call that
home of course you can call it whatever
you like so now we're pointing our home
page at this home controller and then we
are running this method here or calling
this method you'll notice that we
actually still get an error here and the
reason being is that we're not pre
fixing our full name space for our
controller with a forward slash and
that's just a name space conflict so we
just do that and there we go but we
still don't have this home view found so
let's quickly create that then we'll
move on to creating our base template so
under resources and views you want to
create a new file and we're gonna be
using the blade templating engine so I'm
gonna call this home blade dot PHP so
laravel notice this is a blade view and
I'm just gonna write home in here for
now you'll see that now we get home
perfect so let's move on now to create
our base template which is really
important so we can just quickly build
pages as we need to so under views I'm
gonna create a new folder called
templates and then inside of here I'm
gonna create a template called default
blade PHP and we can extend this for all
of the pages that we need to build so in
here then we just need some basic
document markup you can go ahead and
just copy this down now and for the
title I'm gonna write chassis so what we
need to do now is we need to yield
content but before I start any of this I
want to just pull in bootstrap as a
dependency because other
why is some of our markup that gonna be
writing isn't gonna work so if you head
over to get bootstrap comm hit the
download button rather than downloading
these files or compiling them using sass
what I'm actually gonna do is just pull
these in from bootstraps content
delivery network and this is from Mac
CDN so this is the latest compiler
minified CSS we have an optional theme
then we also have the JavaScript as well
we're not going to be using bootstrap
JavaScript components so we just need
this latest compiler minified CSS so we
can go and copy this and paste it in the
head and then we are done start writing
markup so I'm gonna create a div with a
class of container and this is going to
contain all of the content that we pass
through from our child templates this
doesn't make sense it will do in a
moment so I'm just gonna say yield
content and over on home deploy PHP I
need to extend this default template so
to do that all I need to do is say
extends template dot default down here
I'm gonna say section content and then
I'm going to stop this and in here we're
gonna just write some content so I'm
gonna say welcome to chatty best social
network like ever so when we refresh
here now you can see that we get that
and you'll notice that this has been
indented a little bit and that's because
the container class is part of
bootstraps framework so this is why this
looks nice we've got a nice font here
we're nearly ready to go the last step
is going to be including the navigation
at the top so to create this we go over
to our default template we want to
include this somewhere within here we
want to keep this as a partial file so
I'm actually going to do is inside of my
templates directory here I'm gonna
create a new folder called partials
that's going to store things like alerts
going to be bringing in later on but for
now I'm gonna create a new file in here
and I'm gonna call this navigation blade
dot PHP it just keeps everything nice
and separate now as part of the course
downloads for this series we have a
navigation dot HTML file so if you
download that you'll find this raw
navigation markup and this is taken
directly from bootstrap but it's
modified for our needs and I'll take you
over this just quickly so you understand
what's going on here so we've got the
main markup that we would normally use
for a bootstrap menu that just floats at
the top you can see we've got chatty as
the brand up here you can obviously
change that and these pick these sort of
HTML comments here aware we're
eventually going to be implementing the
ability to output things based on
whether a user is signed in or not so
you can leave these in here for now your
navigation will look a bit messy but we
can change these up later you can see
even here where we've got this name Dale
this is actually going to be the users
full name if they are signed in so we
have an if and else and an end if here
so what we're going to do now then is
now that we've got this markup inserted
and you can modify this if you want if
you know bootstrap we're going to come
over to our default container and we are
going to include this in so just up here
before the container we're gonna say
include I'm gonna include in template
dot partials don't navigation so we can
go refresh here you can see at the top
we've got this bar up here and if we go
ahead and inspect this you'll be able to
see that we have our nav bar right here
we've got all of our items just in here
and this is actually not displaying this
content which is absolutely fine because
we were going to be modifying this a
little bit later so don't worry too much
about that so we now have our navigation
bar at the top created we've got our
base container here which is going to be
where all of our content is going to sit
eventually and we've created our first
control
that's handling all of this as well as
our templates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
