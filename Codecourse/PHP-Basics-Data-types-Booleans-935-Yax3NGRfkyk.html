values as we've already briefly
discussed now when you're programming
you'll often need to work out if
something is true or false in order to
change the direction of your code using
if statements which we will cover later
for now what we'll do is we'll define
out a boolean value and we'll have a
quick peek at an if statement to see how
this works so the two boolean values as
we've already seen are true and false
simple as that so let's say we were
uploading a file maybe we were uploading
a picture to a website we're gonna say
something like file is uploaded and
again we're gonna use our assignment
operator but this time we're going to
assign either a true or a false value
into here so we can have true or false
simple as that okay so now what we can
do in practice is use an if statement to
check if this value is true or check if
it's false and then run some code based
on that check so let's create an if
statement to do this we say if and then
in brackets we have something called a
condition and this can be one value it
doesn't really have to be a variable it
doesn't have to be some kind of
comparison but for now we'll keep it
really simple so after this we have two
curly braces so we have an opening curly
brace and a closing curly brace and then
in here we call this a block this is a
block of code that you want to run when
this condition evaluates to true
now basically what that means is
whatever we put in here if it ends up
being true then we run the block of code
so let's serve to find out what we want
to output here we're gonna say your file
was uploaded like so and basically into
here if I was to for example just put
false in there
think about this false doesn't evaluate
to true because it's false so if we head
over to the browser we don't see
anything however if I was to hard-code
true into here we know that true does
evaluate to true and therefore we see
that string
okay so rather than actually just
placing true or false values in here
which doesn't always make sense we're
gonna say if file is uploaded or file
was uploaded that makes a lot more sense
we have a value stored in here and we're
basically placing that value into there
so let's give that a refresh and we know
that that's the case because this is
true if we set this to false go ahead
and refresh we know that we don't see
anything
so if statements get a little bit more
complicated than this when we're
checking if something is true or false
or we're putting some kind of comparison
in here to check now just as a word of
warning the number one can be true so if
I was to set file uploaded to one you'll
see that that works and if I was to set
file uploaded to zero notice that that
doesn't work now what happens if I set
this to minus one it still works so what
is going on here we'll be discussing
this a bit more later we'll see the
probably the better way to go ahead and
define a condition out in here but for
now that should make sense in terms of
boolean's and actually how we go ahead
and use them now the key question is
where the boolean's actually come from
for example if we are actually uploading
a file how do we know if it has uploaded
or not now this is kind of beyond the
scope of this video but what will happen
is when you use things like functions in
PHP what will happen is you'll get
returned a value so let's say we had
some kind of function to upload a file
like so this is how we would call a
function and we'll be looking at
functions later this might return a
value so we might say file is uploaded
we may have a function that we've
created to upload a file this would
return to us a true or false value then
we could use it so obviously hard-coding
false or true in here just doesn't make
sense
now let's just take a look at a very
quick example of a function within PHP
that does return a true or false value
and this is where something called var
dump comes in so let's take a look at
this slowly if it doesn't make sense
again we're gonna be covering this in
complete detail later on so let's use a
function called is in
this is a built-in PHP function that
allows us to pass in a value and this
will return true or false if the thing
that we've passed in is an integer now
in this case we know that one is an
integer so let's just assign this to a
value so let's just say is int if you
don't fancy call it something a little
bit better than that and let's go ahead
and create a quick if statement here to
say if is int then we want to say that
is an integer so this function will
return true or false we put it into an
if statement and we change the direction
of our code we run a block if that's the
case so let's go over give that a
refresh and it says that is an integer
okay so what about if I were to pass in
a string here that's not an integer we
know it's a string and therefore we
don't see that block of code run now if
you were wanting to just check this
value and not have to create an if
statement because that can be a little
bit annoying we can get rid of all of
this and we can actually wrap the return
value of this function in something
called var dump so what we're doing is
we're taking this value here we're
placing it inside of our dump what
that's going to do is it's going to dump
out a variable because we can't echo
true or false values we just won't see
anything var dump will actually tell us
what type of variable this is so let's
go ahead give this a refresh and you can
see we have ball as I said sometimes a
boolean is called a ball and we see
false if I were to change this to 1 we
see true so if you are stuck at any
point var dump is very very useful and
we are going to be using this throughout
the series when we're working on things
because it just gives us a kind of
insight into the kind of values that
we're working with because we've done
this we know that this returns a true or
false value and therefore if we wanted
like we've already seen we could create
an if statement so that is pretty much
it for boolean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
