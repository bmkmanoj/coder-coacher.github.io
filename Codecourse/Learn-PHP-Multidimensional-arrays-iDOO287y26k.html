now we're going to look at something
slightly different which is
multi-dimensional arrays and really the
the only the only thing to really
understand here is that we can have
arrays within arrays and we can have
that you know as many levels as we want
really so we're going to modify the
array that we created in the last part
and we're going to change this to
locations rather than location and we're
going to do this slightly differently
instead of providing a string value
we're actually going to provide another
array of values so for example if we
pass a list of places of locations here
what we can do is if we place these just
on another line just so they're a little
bit more readable and we're already
printing our on this person array and we
can go ahead and open our web browser
now and just take a look at what this
looks like so what's happened here now
is that we've provided an array of
values so we've got an associative array
on the very outer level and then as we
come in we've got a string value
assigned to the name key a integer
assigned to the age key and to the
locations key we have another array
which is a numerical array or numeric
array so we've now placed an array
within an array so you know we can do
this another level deep as well so we
could say for example Greenwich array so
we could say something like new Eltham
and central Greenwich so if I go ahead
and refresh now you can see that's gone
another level deep now this I find makes
it you know makes a lot easier to read
in terms of inspecting what levels we
can get to and but let's just remind
ourselves of what it looks like if we
don't include our pre formatted tags and
because actually this does complicate
things a lot so if we just use a print R
it's very difficult to determine where
the different positions of the array
start and which
raise or with within which so remember
that when you're working with any of
rays really using pre formatted HTML
tags makes it extremely easy to see
which level deep you are because we get
the indentation we preserve this
indentation formatting now we want to
know how we can actually access these
certain arrays so let's just say we want
to get the location of this person at
within sort of I know with in Greenwich
for example and then say the first
position of this so in this case what we
can do is we could say let's come down
here and echo out so person and we want
to say locations now remember because
we've assigned a value or if you like or
an array to this this has now become the
key so what we're actually doing is
we're mixing associative and numeric
values but if we knew for for some other
reason and you know when you're looping
through these you can check but if we
know that we want to get the location
first say visited in Greenwich this will
be at position 0 within Greenwich within
locations of the person array so
everything here sort of fits in and
makes sense when we refresh we see this
just outputs new Eltham so you know it's
a good idea to create arrays as complex
as you like arrays are brilliant to
store data of course we can add data to
arrays as well so we really need to do
is say something like let's say we want
to update position two we want to say
outer Greenwich for example what we've
now done is if we were to go ahead and
print our on this after we have assigned
a value to this we can see that we have
a new item added here so we can
manipulate rate arrays as well as you
know create them on the you know like
this you're obviously find as well the
big datasets like database results come
back in an array format often and also
things like if we're working with
Ehsan in PHP if you were to take JSON
and decode it you would find that we'd
get it back in an array form and then we
can work with it as an array so arrays
are extremely useful as in as a sort of
temporary data storage inside of your
code and it just makes it easy to work
with with data so in this we've just
basically looked at multi-dimensional
arrays and assigning a value to an array
which can obviously be done at any
position tool so that pretty much covers
the basics or arrays in PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
