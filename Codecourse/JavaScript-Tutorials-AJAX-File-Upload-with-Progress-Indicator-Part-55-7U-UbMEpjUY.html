doing now is just very simply adding our
file names as links to the page that we
did before so we're going to loop over
the uploaded array so we're going to use
a for loop so four is equal to zero
while I is less than uploaded length yep
pre Cremant I didn't say it wrong Matt
done and then inside of here what we
need to do is create a div element and a
link element so we're going to create
the div and the a put the a inside the
div and then put the div inside the
uploaded so that's the process let's go
back to our script and do it so what we
need to do is create a new development
here and now because this loop is going
to execute a few times we can't use or
we shouldn't use the Far declaration
like this so these need to be declared
above it so we'll create two new
variables here one called div one called
a you can do that with the comma as well
that's just sort of short one-line thing
if you'll be using there loop and then
here we'll do div equals documents dot
create elements which is how you create
a new note well element and then takes
one parameter which is the name of the
element so in this case it's div and we
do the same for the a so document create
element
and then what we need to do is set the
href attribute so in the same way as we
did here we just set this with
JavaScript so in to set its who filed
slash from the name and the name is in
the uploaded the ithe element of the
uploaded array so what we'll do is do a
set attribute and we're going to be
setting the href attribute to files
slash and then the name which is loaded
that right that's right
upload it I like so and then we need to
add the text in between the a so again
if we can look back to our PHP scripts
that's this bit it's just the name of
the file so we do that in the same way
as we did up here we do a append child
we don't need to worry about removing
all the elements from this a tag because
there aren't any we'll just created it
so we're appending a new text node so
document create text node and then their
name which is just this and then we go
then we need to add the link to our div
that we just created
so we'll do div append child a and then
we need to add our div to our links
thing element
so we'll do links dot append child if
there we go
and that is that pretty much done so if
we go back to our browser now hit
refresh and we'll just select some new
files select a lot and then this big one
so we see the percentage Oh that'd be
ridiculous let's not do that
opened and we'll hit upload uploading
and then the links didn't appear because
I've made a bit of a mistake documents
felt wrong okay fine
that's an easy fix let's try again
upload
and again what were done now upload it
it's about wrong okay good so many typos
right final time upload
and there we go we've got a lynx so if I
just click on one of these you can see
if we get linked to the actual page and
that's basically it so that's everything
for this tutorial so thank you watching
and that's it
javascript oh I suppose I should make
one final note if the let's see say the
form data object is not available then
this script will cause an error so what
you should really do is before you do
any of this stuff you could check for
the form data object so you could do
that simply by doing something along the
lines of that or you could also do the
type of so you could do type of form
data is not undefined
which I can't type but that's just a
note about something because say if that
does cause an error you might get a
little warning in the bottom of your
browser window yeah that's something for
you to work out hopefully soon all the
browser's will be supporting this anyway
thank watching and that's everything
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
