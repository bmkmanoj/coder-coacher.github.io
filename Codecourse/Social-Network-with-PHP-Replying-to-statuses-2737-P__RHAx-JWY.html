ability to reply to statuses so we can
type something in here hit reply and it
we rendered indented just under here and
we can reply as many times as we want
and once again we're going to be storing
these replies within the statuses table
but the parent ID will relate to the
status that someone is replying to so
this isn't as tricky as it sounds but we
need to set up our new controller method
and we need to set up our routing and
things like that so let's make sure we
have our status controller open and
inside of here we're gonna have our post
reply method so we're gonna have a
public function post reply and this is
going to take again our request here
because we're posting data through but
it will also take a status ID the status
ID that we're applying to and obviously
we need to make sure that the user that
we're applying to is our friend because
obviously otherwise we'd be able to pass
a number in and reply to anyone status
so we need to take that into account as
well so let's create our route while
we're at it and for this I'm just gonna
copy and paste this a little bit easier
so we're posting to status and then the
status ID so that will be status ID and
then reply so here it will be post reply
status reply and we need our author
middleware on there as well so we can
return to our page here and update our
form so let's just update this so it's
route status reply this is our timeline
remember and we also need to change this
because for validation because we're out
losing everything on the same page we
need to know which ID we're actually
replying to so all we do is we output
the status ID in here so we just say
status ID and then that reply will know
which status were replying to we also
need our hidden input here for our
cross-site request forgery token so
let's do that now so just remember using
the session facade and then the token
method and over in our status controller
let's just do a die dump on the status
ID that we're applying to just so we
know that this works okay so let's try
it and reply to this one hit reply and
we get status IDs this is obviously
wrong let's go over and check our route
what status ID there and in our status
controller of course so what we're not
doing is actually on our timeline we're
not actually passing this in so we need
to do that now status ID status ID so
let's refresh here okay and we'll just
fix this up so obviously that needs to
be an array there we go so just write
test to be quick there we go so status
ID of three so we can pick out that
status we can check if the user the
current user which is me is friends with
this user and then if so we can take the
body from this reply and we can create a
new status we can attach it via the
parent ID and then it will become a
reply and then we can output replies so
our form name or this name here is reply
- and then the status ID so under our
status controller we know that we have
the status ID so we can validate this
and grab the data accordingly so all we
do to validate is this validate we did
the same thing we passed through the
request we pass in our array and this
time the field name is reply - status ID
that's what we're validating because
it's going to be different every time
and we want this to be required and we
want it to be a max of a thousand but
obviously you can change that up so the
next argument I'm passing in is a custom
error message for required because this
will look a bit funny otherwise so I'm
just gonna say the reply body is quiet
that's it
so now that we've got that let's just
kill the page there and once again we'll
say all okay and we'll see what happens
here so if I wanted to reply to this
status I hit reply all okay if I wanted
to replace this status and I didn't
enter anything we're redirected back and
that will give us that error message so
we need to handle the errors that we get
out here and that's simple are we doing
here is we do exactly as we've done
before so we say errors has this is
slightly different because what we need
to do is check if it's reply and then
the number that we're applying so in
this case it will be status ID then we
want to output has error otherwise
nothing empty string so we can check
this by just replying okay so let's
check what's happened just here
of course it's reply - and then the
status ID so let's reply again and that
goes read we can output the error
message as well as down here and we'll
say errors has exactly the same thing
reply - and then the status ID and then
we'll do our spam now help block class
I'm allowed pet errors first
reply and then the status ID that so
let's check this out let's hit reply the
body the reply body is required and then
we get the same for each one and if you
are wondering why we're doing this with
the with the status in here with a reply
- it's because if we didn't and this was
just called reply on this page we would
see the error for all fields because
it's just one field called reply so
there are other ways of structuring this
but for now if you did want to do this
that's the way to go about it so if we
worst type something in here and hit
reply we get all okay so we now need to
look at actually inserting that record
relating it to the reply relating it to
the user checking if this is our friend
first of all and all that kind of stuff
so before we get started with that we
need to update the report the status
model because there are two different
types of statuses in the same table and
we need an easy way to distinguish
between them so what we're going to do
is we're going to use a scope which
allow us using the query builder to
filter out anything we don't want and
that means that we have a scope here
called not reply and this will basically
allow us to chain this on to our query
or our builder and select any any
statuses that aren't replies so we have
our query builder passed in here and we
return query where null remember we have
a nullable parent ID it's a we're null
parent ID so we need to update a couple
of places with for this and we'll do
this quickly now so we don't get into
trouble later on our home controller
where we're pulling in the list of user
statuses let's say I replied to this
status that would then exist in the
database table as another record and
therefore the reply would be pulled
through as a normal status so we need to
filter these out so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna say not reply like
and that will only pull things that are
not replies for our main timeline list
and the reason that the scopes are nice
is because we can just use scope
prepended we can then use the method
name not reply and it will just feel
tracks just a nice way to keep
everything nice and tidy and reusable so
now that we've done that we can go ahead
and actually insert our status and we
also need to use the not reply scope
here too so let's say status equals
status not reply find status ID that's
going to find that status that we need
to reply to and remember up here we need
to go ahead and import our status model
as well so now we have the status that
we are ready to reply to we need to
check if that status exists first of all
so we're gonna say if not status then we
want to return and redirect ID no to the
homepage it you can show an error if you
want it's entirely up to you the next
thing we need to do is check that the
currently authenticated user it's
friends with the user whose status this
is and we already have methods for that
remember we implemented that when we
were creating everything if we just head
over to our user model we'll be able to
see that so let's find it here is
friends with so we know that we have
that available to use so our next check
is going to be if not earth user is
friends with and then the user who owns
the status so he just say status user
because remember we have that
relationship between status and user and
we want to make sure that the auth user
ID doesn't equal the status user ID all
that means is are we trying to reply to
our own status well if we are trying to
reply to our own status we want to allow
that so in that case we're not friends
with ourself but this will then allow us
to reply to our
statuses so if that's the case then we
can just redirect back home like so okay
so now that we've got them checks in
place we might want to just test this so
at the moment I don't know if I'm
friends with Dale I currently am so I'm
just gonna actually manually remove that
so Dale is usually of two so let's get
rid of that so I'm now only friends with
Billy so over on my timeline then I'm
gonna try and reply to this I'm gonna
inspect this element here and under the
status here I'm going to change this to
ten so that doesn't exists currently so
I'm going to say hello hit reply and I'm
redirected back to the home page nothing
has happened we're not doing anything so
now I'm gonna try and reply it to a
status poster by use that I'm not
friends with so over on Firefox let me
just go ahead and sign out I'm gonna
sign in as Dale and we'll go ahead and
post a status either okay so let's check
the status ID of this if we go to
statuses that's status ID four so over
on my account I'm not friends with Dale
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
inspect this again I'm gonna change this
to status four and I'm gonna try and
reply to it and again that's redirected
us back it's not done anything so these
two checks are now working we can
actually reply to the status so I'm
gonna say reply equals status create and
there are lots of different ways to do
this I'll let you decide if you want
later on so we're creating a status with
a body and that is request input and
then again remember it's to reply and
then the status ID because each one is
unique and then what we're going to do
is we're going to say user so regarding
the user of that and we're going the
user relation
and we're going to associate us with
that reply and then we're going to say
status which is the status reporting up
here replies save reply so all this is
doing is it's creating a status
associating it with us and all that
means is that when we do create the
status we have user ID sets or whatever
so in my case everyone and then we save
this reply to the replies relation on
the status so it would just create a
reply from it and that will create a
parent ID from that so then what we want
to do is return want to redirect back
and we are done you can show some
information if you want there so let's
get rid of this and let's try this out
so what's so funny
hit reply okay so we've got
build-it replies out of course so over
on our status we don't actually have a
replies relationship setup so we'll
quickly do that that's really important
and this is basically a relationship
that relates back to the same model so
we're gonna say public function replies
and we're gonna return this has many it
can have many replies and the model is
the same model that we're currently
using which is status so we just say
chatty models status and we relate that
via the parent ID let's just make sure
nothing's been created in here it has so
I'll just delete that so back over to
the timeline what's so funny
hit reply and there we go that's
inserted there won't show at the moment
you can see here that it's been posted
by user ID one and the parent ID has now
been set to three just because of the
way that we saved that over here so now
we have States ID 3 which was law and
then this one's what's so funny so there
we go so we've now successfully replied
to a status but we're not showing the
reply
so we're gonna go ahead and do that in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
