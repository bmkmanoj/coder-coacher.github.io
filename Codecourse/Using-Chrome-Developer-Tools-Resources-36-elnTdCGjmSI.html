on is the resources tab which is
particularly useful if you're working
with things like sessions and cookies
so inside of PHP when we go ahead and
set cookies or sessions these are going
to appear under cookies so let's go
ahead and just take a look at an example
it doesn't really matter what language
you're working with however you're
setting sessions or cookies it's going
to look exactly the same but let's go
ahead and just start sessions in PHP and
we'll go ahead and access the session
superglobal and let's just say user ID
equals 1 so you might be signing a user
in I'm not going to go over the
complexities of how sessions work in PHP
but essentially when we land on index
dot PHP which is the file I've just
modified you can see that this now
contains a table with all of the cookies
that you're storing so because this is a
session if we just open these up a
little bit more we've got PHP sets sess
ID or session ID which is just the
standard name for any PHP session stored
we have a value here which corresponds
to the file stored on your server which
contains that session data we have the
domain here that it served on so if you
had same or more tabs open you would see
lots of different file loss different so
items here that you could click through
and see all of the cookies that are
stored for each domain that you're on we
have a path the expiry this has no
expiry because we are working with a
session and we have the size as well
here so it works in exactly the same way
so what we're now just very quickly look
at is setting a cookie in PHP and this
will reveal a little bit more
information because sessions RFC sorts
towards server-side so let's just
quickly look at an example of setting a
cookie so we can see how this varies so
let's just set one called data we'll
enter some data in here and the third
argument we need an expiry so let's go
ahead and say expiry is a new
date time object and let's say it
expires in two days time so now what we
can do is extract the timestamp so you
can say get time stamp we can go ahead
and refresh and you can see here that's
added a cookie now we'll see these are
this is raw data so we can see this
value in here in plain text which is a
good explanation of why you shouldn't
store secure or personal data in cookies
we see all the same data here so we see
the size we see the expiry this time
because we know expires in two days so
this will represent the date and time in
two days time and the only thing we
can't necessarily do in here is actually
modify the cookie value in tools like
Firebug you can do this but I'm sure
there are extensions available for
chrome that will allow you to modify the
cookie data but what we can do is we can
go ahead and we can delete these so we
can remove cookies as well and we can
also remove the PHP session as well so
when we refresh we don't see that PHP
session ID we just see that cookie again
because we're hitting this this file
again so if you were to dive into other
technologies that allow you to store
data you have things like web SQL you
have index DB you have local storage as
well which is probably more used if
you're using JavaScript API is to store
data and you have things like the
application cache as well but probably
mainly you'll be within this cookies
section either examining the value of
cookies or go ahead and going ahead and
removing them if you don't need them
anymore so it's always useful to know
that you can access all of this
information and that's all through the
resources tab</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
