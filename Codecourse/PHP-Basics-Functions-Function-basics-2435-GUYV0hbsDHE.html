functions allow you to break up your
code into reusable blocks you can think
of it like that now we're going to be
looking at functions and how to use them
and this will help you out when you
start to look at object-oriented
programming
later on and we have a course on that as
well which you can follow as well so
let's define out a function and look at
what happens when we go ahead and use it
so we define a function with the
function keyword and then we give it a
name and typically what we would do is
we would name these in the same way that
we named variables now again there's no
real strict rules as to how you name
these but the important thing is to keep
consistency so for example let's define
out a full name function this is going
to return to us when we use it a full
name now what we do after this is use
two parentheses and we'll look at what
goes in here a bit later and then here
we define a block like so now what we
can do is go ahead and use any other
code inside of a function there's a
really no limitation here and just to
kick things off I'm gonna go ahead and
echo out at my full name now to call a
function we use the name that we defined
for the function so in this case full
name and then to call it again we use
parentheses and we'll look at again
later on what we put inside of here and
we just end the line again with a
semicolon so let's look at what this
does give that a refresh and you can see
it does in fact echo out what we defined
inside of that block now this is all
well and good but the proper way to do
this is to actually return a value
rather than go ahead and echo something
out within a function now we're gonna
run this in the browser and you'll
notice what happens you can see that we
don't see any value that's because
what's happened here is this has a
return value now which we then have to
do something with we're not actually
echoing out we're returning it back from
this so in this case we know that we can
echo out full name because this will
return a string to us and we can echo it
to the page or do whatever else we want
with it so there we go
now again you can do things like assign
this to a new variable so we could
create a variable
called full-name and go ahead and assign
that the value that we get back from
this function and again down here we can
echo out full name so things are pretty
flexible here and you can see it works
in the same way now the correct name for
calling a function is invoking a
function so if you ever hear anyone say
invoke a function then you'll know that
that basically just means do this and
that will go ahead and run it it will
return a value to you and you can do
something with that return value now at
the moment obviously this function is
pretty useless just because it returns a
hard-coded value you could have used for
a hard-coded value but ideally what we
want to do is be able to pass in some
values to a function that are then used
within that function so let's say that
we wanted to construct a full name based
on a first name and a last name well
let's get rid of all of this and let's
get rid of what we returned in here and
now let's define some arguments or
parameters you'll find that they're
called the same thing inside of the
parentheses these are just things that
we can pass into the function when we
invoke it or call it so let's go ahead
and define these out again using the
naming conventions we've already used
we're going to say that we want this
function to accept a first-name and then
we comma separate any arguments we pass
in so we're accepting into this function
a first name in our last name okay so
now what we can do in here is whatever
we want so in this case we'd want to
concatenate the first and the last name
together so we say first-name we append
on a space and then we do the same for
the last name as well so let's try
calling this now so let's assign it to a
new variable called full name and we're
gonna say full name and let's just see
what happens when we try and call this
with no arguments let's go ahead and
refresh the page and you can see here we
have missing argument one for full name
missing argument two for full name and
then we get an undefined variable first
name and an undefined variable last name
that's because the first two errors we
haven't actually passed the values in
here that it requires and
second of all because we haven't passed
in the values it requires we don't have
these variables available so let's go
and pass in a first name and a last name
you can see you pass them in the order
that they're defined and again you use
commas here and you can pass any data
types into a function this could be a
number it really doesn't matter because
again we're working with a loosely typed
language we have the flexibility to pass
any data type into here so let's go and
echo out that full name variable take a
look in the browser and now it works so
you could do this in a variety of ways
it really depends on what you want to do
in this case it might be better to
return double quotes and then in here to
find out the full name of space and then
the last name or rather the first name
sorry let's just correct that it would
work in exactly the same way and like I
said you can do whatever you want inside
of here so when you're building these
functions you can pass as many arguments
as you want into them the important
thing to know is you want to try and
limit the amount of arguments you pass
in as much as possible if you find that
you're passing in say 10 different
arguments into a function you may need
two different functions now we can call
different functions and place the return
value of functions into another function
if we wanted so just as a really quick
example in a kind of useless example
let's say we had a function that
returned my first name so let's return
in here Alex
so we're not passing anything into this
but what we could technically do now is
go ahead and pass in the return value of
that function into another function so
again just by doing this if we just pull
this up a line then we get the same
result so just a note there on how
flexible this is
now just as that said what we can also
do if we just get rid of this example
here we can also pass variables into
functions as the arguments as well so if
somewhere we had a first name here to
find out as Alex and then down here we
had a last name to find out as well we
can go ahead and we can pass these
variables into this function so let's go
ahead and do that now pass in the first
name and in
here we're going to pass in the last
name and you'll see it works in exactly
the same way so again if you think that
it probably can be done then it probably
will be able to be done it's very very
flexible so just following on from this
example let's just get rid of these two
variables just to tidy this up and let's
just pass in string values in here now
what I'm going to show you now is an
optional argument that we can pass
through to a function so let's say that
we had this function and we want to keep
this function that we've built as
flexible as possible let's say that we
might have something else that we want
to pass in other than a space to
basically separate the first and the
last name well what we can do in this
case is we could create a new argument
called a separator maybe and what we can
now do is assign this a default value so
we are allowing this to be passed in as
a third argument but what we're also
doing is assigning it a space so if we
don't pass it in by default it will be a
space so now what we can do here is in
here we can place in that separator and
without adding a third argument to the
call remember before we got an error you
can see it just works in exactly the
same way now though I have the
flexibility to pass in something else
that I want to space this first name and
last name out so let's say an underscore
now because this value has been passed
in this will be replaced by the
underscore and therefore we'll have it
there available so let's give that a
refresh and there we go you can see
that's changed over okay so that should
give you a good grounding as to what a
function is you know that you're going
to return a value here and you can use
that however you want but let's take a
look at some other variations of
functions that you might see now what
you can actually do is assign a function
to a variable so let's say we were to
create a full name variable and we were
to assign this function so it's a little
bit different to how we created it
before and then again we can do the same
thing so in here we can except in a
first name and we can except in a last
name and let's accept in that separator
as well and we're going to set that by
default
to a space and again what you can do is
you can add other things in here as well
with default values but what I always
recommend you do is the optional ones
always leave at the end so always accept
in first what you know you need and then
always add any optional at the end with
that default value so now that we've
done this then we can do exactly the
same thing so in here we're gonna return
the first name with that separator that
we defined in there with the default of
space and then the last name and now we
need a semicolon
on the end because we've defined it out
in a slightly different way okay so
let's echo out but now how do we do this
well we can't say echo full name and
let's just try and see what happens here
and we'll see what error we get so let's
go ahead and define my first and last
name give that a refresh and you can see
here we get a fatal error call two
undefined function full name all that
means is the function cannot be found
now because we've assigned a function to
a variable we need to call this as a
variable so it's not always necessary to
do this but you might see this around
and that's exactly why we're covering it
here so now if we take a look at this
you can see that we get exactly the same
result so this is purely just preference
as to how you're structuring your
project there might be cases where you
may need to do this it might be a little
bit easier and then you may need to
override this function you may need to
use it in a slightly different way the
most important thing to note though is
the ordering of your code because you've
assigned this variable here you need to
call the function
after you've defined it now if we take a
look at this if I go ahead and echo out
full name like this but define the
function down here let's see what
happens now again we get undefined
variable full name because we defined a
variable here but we're trying to access
it before it was defined and we see
function name must be a string so we get
a couple of errors now if we were to
return back to the original example so
that's just very quickly map this out
full name like so and remember into that
we accepted a first and last name so
let's just add these in here first name
last name and then we returned the first
name here and the last name let's now
try and call this down here so we're
gonna echo out full name and then give
them two arguments that we defined in
there now this is gonna work we know
that that works but if I take this and
call it up here now notice that works in
exactly the same way so if you are and
I'll just revert this code so we can see
the example we had before if you are
defining a function like this remember
you can't call it before is defined so
just a really important thing to know so
for the basics of functions that pretty
much covers it we've looked at a couple
of ways that we can do this we've looked
at how to pass arguments into a function
how to return values from a function and
also optional arguments as well just
remember that because this is a block of
code you can do anything you'd like
inside of here and we'll be taking a
look at examples of that a little bit
later on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
