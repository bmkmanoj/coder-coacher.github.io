the roots within our authentication
system and this mainly relates to
redirecting a user now most of the time
this is going to be okay and I'll try
and explain why this is necessary if we
go over to our account and profile route
this is the root remember where we
update our profile details so we have
the root here to display the page and
then we have our post route just here
which allows us to actually update the
users details when they're authenticated
and if we scroll down here we can see if
the validation passes we go ahead and
update the user so using OAuth on our
container and we go ahead and flash a
message and then we redirect the user on
this line now what we didn't do
throughout the series is actually use
return on this and the reason that this
is important is because when we are in a
kind of critical stage of our
application where we have to maybe you
you know do a quick if statement here
and if maybe a token doesn't match we
want to redirect the user off somewhere
if this line fails for any reason or
rather if the script executes beyond
this line then we're in trouble because
we could actually run into some security
considerations here and the reason we
can use return within this is because we
have a closure here which is our
function and obviously within a function
we can return a value as soon as you
return a value within a function nothing
beyond that execute so rather than just
relying on using app response.redirect
we're actually going to go through and
add return anywhere that we redirecting
within our closure just here so I've
just done the first one that's the only
redirect that we're doing with in here
but what we're going to do is go through
to all of the other routes and just
check that we don't have any more of
these and we're going to just add some
more returns so you don't have to follow
along the rest of this video but I'm
going to go through each of the routes
that we've created add these returns in
where they're necessary and I'll kind of
explain along the way why this is
necessary and then you know if you don't
want to follow along
fine you can just go through and
manually add them yourself so in two or
theer this is probably one of the most
important places we can do this because
we've got things like changing the users
password recovering and recovering uses
tokens so let's handle the password
first so we've got password change we
just scroll down here you can see that
we've got a redirect just here if the
validation passes again this one isn't
as important because otherwise you would
just hit this line here and that
wouldn't be too much trouble so we've
cleared up that one there we'll just
make sure that we've got no other
redirects in here we and we don't so for
the password recovery let's go ahead and
just look down here and we'll see here
if the user doesn't exist when we look
them up by the email address that's
that's passed through here we're
actually redirecting off and we need to
add a return here for sure because if
for example this execute beyond this
line we may get into trouble in this
case it wouldn't matter too much because
we're just within an if statement here
and this else would never be hit
otherwise so inside of here we've got
another redirect just here so let's add
a return there and this one looks good
so for resetting the password then if we
just scroll down you can see we've got
quite a few here and these are probably
the most important so we've got if no
user so if the user doesn't exist we're
going to go ahead and return this if the
recovery hash isn't available we're
going to return this and then again
within this more importantly if the hash
doesn't match when we use the hash check
function or method rather then we want
to return the redirect just here and I'm
not testing these out along the way
because it won't make any difference but
feel free to go back and you know test
each of these steps if you just want to
make sure nothing is broken so again
into this part of the password reset
just here we have the same kind of
checks from reduplicate to these down a
little bit and we're just going to
return each of these redirects just in
here and if we scroll down we've got one
more redirect if for validation passes
and there we go we've done that one so
for activation again we're using a hash
identifier just here
to check so we are checking if there is
no user so if the user can't be found or
if the hash doesn't match so we can
return a redirect there and then here we
can also return this redirect so we've
done this one now so for login again
let's scroll down and check what we're
doing in here so we're checking if the
password is valid and we're redirecting
the user off telling them that they're
signed in and here we have could not log
you in and again we can just add a
return on here these don't matter as
much but it's good to have them in there
anyway just for consistency logging out
again not massively important but we'll
keep consistency and out our return just
in there and then for registration as
well we're going to want to update this
redirects just here that should be
everything in there perfect so for
errors we don't need to worry about 40
forks we're just rendering a view here
all users doesn't matter and profile
doesn't matter because we're not
necessarily doing anything in here like
redirecting so they are our route
changes hopefully you understand why
this is important the main thing to
realize is that your script could
execute pass to redirect if you're not
actually returning within this closure
within our route so that's another quick
fix hopefully we'll just add to the
security and consistency of your PHP
authentication application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
