the mark-up that we need to make this
work and what we're gonna be doing is
we're gonna be writing the mark-up as a
sort of template for how we want this to
replicate because it would be very
annoying if we had to you know
specifically build this plugin for one
use we want to be able to change our
markup around in future if we want
without having to change the JavaScript
code so let's go ahead and create a
container and then what we'll do is look
at how we want to use the load more
plugin and then in the next video we're
going to actually build the plugin so
I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to
create a wrapper for everything here so
we'll give this a class of articles and
this is just what we'll target with our
plugin so now what I'm gonna do is
create a generic container which you
would find anywhere you want to use this
and I'm gonna call this items so within
this is going to be each of the items so
the items will duplicate within this as
we click load more so I'm going to
create a nother container in here called
item and within this is going to be all
of the data that we want to display so
in this case I'm gonna create a header
I'm gonna create a paragraph and that's
it so inside of here what do we want to
display we want to display the title and
the ID just so we can keep track of
everything so we need a span in here and
I'm going to create some brackets here
and create another span now what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to add some I'm
gonna add a data attribute to each of
these and what that means is that our
JavaScript can then can then use the
data attributes to fill in the data that
it needs to so I'm gonna say data field
equals title and the same with this as
well
that's the ID and then in here the
paragraph description so these are the
names title ID description of the
basically the properties that we're
bringing back from the back end so
whatever these are output as we want to
go ahead and choose these here and that
will mean that when we Ajax to that file
it will know which or it will know where
to insert data and the reason that we
even spans inside of here is we want two
different bits of data both within the
h3 so we just use spans which are
generic inline containers for this so
we've basically well with nearly
finished writing the mark-up what we
need to do now is actually go ahead and
create our load more button so let's go
ahead and write this down here so the HR
for this is literally just going to be a
hash and the class here so we can target
it within our plugin is going to be
items load and we'll go ahead and give
this whatever label we want to load more
so at the moment this looks like this it
doesn't look great but load more
eventually it's going to load more and
instead of this being two parentheses
like it is now it's going to go ahead
and load the initial to the first two
now you'll also notice that I have
jQuery loaded in here from Google hosted
libraries and I also have the j/s slash
load more J's file loaded in as well so
in the next video we're gonna go ahead
and fill in the JavaScript needed to
start to populate this and then we'll
create the handler to go ahead and
actually fill everything in but let's go
ahead and just quickly look at how we
might want to call this plug-in so
inside of just some script tags on the
page here you'd probably create this in
an external file or something but what
we do is we do a selector on the
articles container and here we go ahead
and we call the plug-in and we're going
to call our plug-in load more and inside
of here we have an
object with different settings it's just
in this so the settings are going to be
the source that's probably the most
important because the source is
obviously the source of the data and in
this case I want this to be articles dot
PHP because articles dot PHP is in a
directory we created the backend in it
loaded the JSON and it output the JSON
and then we want the step so I'm going
to choose the step to be too and this
obviously means that it's going to load
two articles when we hit load more it's
going to load another two articles so
that's the markup that we create what's
going to happen is is this item here is
going to be duplicated with JavaScript
so initially we'll see two of these
duplicated on the page and then
obviously as we click load more they'll
be duplicated another two times and
another two times when we click load
more again so that's basically the
markup and how we call the plug-in let's
jump over and start actually writing
this plugin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
