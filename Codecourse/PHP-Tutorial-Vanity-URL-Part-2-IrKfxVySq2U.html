extracting data specific data from the
database and obviously the data that
we've selected in our query and a good
step would be to test if our username
variable is actually being passed
properly through HT access and it is
actually being passed into this you get
variable here and allowing us to display
otherwise all these commands will be all
these functions sorry will be pretty
much useless as well as this query
because we're using this the variable
here now as long as this code does
actually work and then echoing out the
user name should actually give us what
we've typed in the forward slash of the
of the web page so if we come over to
our web page here like I said we're
going to be typing a username at the end
of here i'm going to type Alex and sure
sure enough Alex does appear now if i
was to type say a jade jade disappear
now i'm going to do is type something
like John now John doesn't appear and
the text John doesn't appear this is
because we haven't actually found a user
in the database called John so you can
see that this here this if statement
here with this MySQL num rows function
has executed this query here or rather
this line has executed this query here
it hasn't returned any rose therefore
the block inside this if statement or
the block following this if statement
won't be executed so we're only echoing
out a username here that does actually
exist in our database which is exactly
what we want in the final product
because we don't be displaying a profile
data of people that don't exist and it
doesn't make sense ok so what we want to
do is we want to grab the data from our
database to do this I'm going to create
a variable called result and this is
going to be mysql fetch associative
array
this stands for associative so it's an
associative array and basically what
this means is it's giving us an array of
the field and then we can select what
field do we want to display now because
we're only returning one row and we
don't usually need to use a while loop
with this as I have done some of my
other tutorials and inside this we're
going to put data so data is the query
that we've executed here and underneath
this we can start to and create
variables for the full of results that
we've taken from this side from this
specific user name was supplied and this
data here so what we need is first of
all the location and that is going to be
result so the variable up here because
it's an array we're going to be using
square brackets and inside two single
quotation marks and location now this
text here location corresponds to the
field name that we've got here so if
remover to type this in here hello for
example silly name for a field but hello
this doesn't correspond to a field name
in our database so nothing is going to
be displayed nothing will be displayed
anyway because we don't have that field
so it's a this is why we're using this
data inside here the next thing is the
description and this is going to be
exactly the same format and but
obviously we're taking out the field
name of description okay so now we've
achieved our results let's run the
script nothing is actually going to
happen at the moment so we're going to
use Alex here and see that nothing's
happened because we're not echoing out
our data we're not displaying the data
to the user and but the first thing we
want to do is we want to handle what's
going to happen if the user isn't found
and there's no better way to do it than
just with an else statement on the Endor
and else on the end of this if statement
here so it's an if-else statement and
what we're going to do is we're going to
send
we're going to send a 404 not found
header to our browser then what we're
going to do is we're going to exit the
script to ensure that none no more of
the page is executed or run rather so
inside a header function what we're
going to do is we're going to type HTTP
and forward slash 1.0 and i'm going to
say 404 not found with a space between
404 and not ok so what this will do is
this will give the browser a4a for
header and now what we're going to do is
we're going to exit the script so this
is all inside this else block and to
demonstrate this let's just come in so
Alex nothing's going to happen because
we're executing the block where we're
simply taking the data from the database
but we're not doing anything with it so
we're not displaying this to the user
but if we're to type a username that
doesn't return a row number of one then
we're going to use or execute this block
here or run this block so let's go back
with the example of Sean John and you
can see that we get a hoops this link
appears to be broken inside Chrome so
you can see that that works there we are
obviously checking for the username that
exists this is a very important step
otherwise we're going to be displaying
data blank data basically blank variable
data this will be blank our and our
application of it would be absolutely
pointless okay so now what we're going
to do is we've completed the PHP code
for this now so what we need to do is we
need to calm down and after our ending
PHP tag we're going to start some HTML
now this is going to be very basic I'm
going to use an h2 and tag
and inside this I'm going to pit open
PHP and PHP all on the same line so what
we can do is we can just embed some of
the PHP variables that we are variables
that we already have and I'm going to
echo out username I'm going to end that
the way I normally would with a
terminator at the end a semicolon at the
end and then I'm going to do in a an
inverted comma so a single quotation
mark and then i'm going to say profile
so already we can test this we can say
and vanity URL blah blah blah for / alex
and we get alex's profile and then we
can say Jade obviously remember that
this exists in our database as well here
and you can see that we've got Jade's
profile and then again if we type John
we have a for a full returned okay so
now what we want to do is we want to
come down and we want to say location
and you pretty much guessed already we
can just start opening up a PHP tag I'm
going to close my PHP tag on the type
echo location and that as well with a
semicolon the way i would i'm going to
do a line break i'm going to come down
and say description and i'm going to
echo out a description
I remember these variables here that I'm
air coming out I'm still cutting cutting
to PHP using my PHP tags and i'm still
using PHP but I'm embedding this inside
mhtml so this is great if you already
have a premade design and you're using
this tutorial to and give the vanity URL
effect on your website but what we're
also doing is with it's just easier to
embed embed the PHP inside your HTML
rather than echoing out your design it
just gets too messy so we were using a
nice clean method here to display the
data so as far as I can see this is
actually going to work yep there we go
and we'll go back to Alex so it's
working exactly how it was and when I
first showed you and we've achieved the
effect that we want and when we do put
nothing in we go back to our obviously
index page if we were to create a folder
inside and our root directory so you
want to say say localhost for / PHP
academy' forward slash tutorials forward
slash vanity URL forward slash foreign
and you did have a folder named coupe
called forum this won't be picked up by
our HT Access file like we have here so
you don't need to worry about any folder
names you might have or folders you may
have created in your as a subdirectory
anyway so okay I hope this tutorial was
be useful to you and I hope it was easy
to understand and follow thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
