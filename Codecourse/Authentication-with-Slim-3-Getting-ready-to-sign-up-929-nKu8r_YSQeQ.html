this is going to be pretty
straightforward at this point because
all we really need to do is create an
authentication controller we need to
create the view create the form that the
user can enter their email address name
and password in and then we're just
going to be inserting the data into the
database
we're not going to look at validation at
this point because that will come later
when we set up the validation library
that we're going to be using so let's
make a start on the view then just so we
know what this is going to look like and
then of course we can set this up to
actually submit so over in our views
we're going to go and create a new
folder here called auth and inside of
this we can create our signup dot twig
file so signup twig and inside of here
of course what we want to do is extend
our base template so we can just copy
this code over into here and all we need
to do now is create the form inside of
here so of course this is all bootstrap
styling so this gets a little bit
complicated but don't worry too much
about this so we start off with a row
this is going to use the bootstrap grid
system and all we're going to do is
create a six column width here and this
is going to have an offset so it's a
column medium and we're going to offset
it by three so it's just a class with
these two just in there pretty
straightforward so let's just type
something in here and we'll go and get
our controller set up and then we'll
finish the rest of the form of we've
pretty much got everything we need here
in terms of the structure it's over in
app and controllers we're going to
create a new folder here for all of our
authentication controllers now this
includes a normal or controller and
later on our password controller for the
user to reset their password so let's
start by creating an auth controller
pretty straightforward and again what we
can do is just borrow the code from our
home controller because it's going to be
pretty straightforward and I'm just
going to get rid of this namespace
import just up there as well so let's
paste this in here let's go ahead
just call this fourth controller and of
course we can get rid of that method
because we don't need that in there
either ok so now that we have this in
here we can get rid of this one as well
we want to create two methods one is for
get signup all this is going to do is
render the view and then here we can
have post signup this is what's going to
happen when we actually submit the form
so in here of course we have our request
and our response we need them because we
need to pass in the response to render
the view so let's just render this view
out and we'll go ahead and hook this up
to our roots in just a moment okay so
here we just returned this view render
passed in our response passing off
signup twig and that is all done so we
can make sure this works now so over in
our routes then we want to set up our
earth controller so let's go ahead and
say auth controller and this is get
sign-up we're going to give this a name
as well so we're going to set a name to
this so we can reference it and this is
Earth signup and of course here we need
to change the URI so we're going to just
set that to off a sign-up so now that
we've got this the last step is just to
add the auth controller to our container
so over in bootstrap ah we can come down
where we've done this for our home
controller and we could actually just
duplicate this down and go ahead and
pass this in so auth controller or 'the
controller remember we always need to
pass our container in so now hopefully
if we go over to auth signup okay so of
course now we need this to have the auth
namespace because we could put it inside
of this earth directory and we'll need
to just correct that there as well and
we should see and I think as well
because we have this in a new directory
we're going to need to import our
controller because it's not within there
with this we could because this here is
inside this directory but now we're
outside of it we just need to say use
app controllers
controller and we should be good to go
perfect so we can see how sign up text
here and this form is just going to be
in the center of the page so let's go
and finish off the form so over to sign
up twig we're going to put this inside
of a panel element within bootstrap and
here we're going to set this to have a
panel of default like that so of course
you can find all of these over on the
bootstrap documentation so now we want a
panel heading this is just going to be
signed up and then down here we want a
panel body so here let's just say signup
and we now see this so we've got a nice
little panel here and we can put our
form just in here so the form then we
need to set the action so how are we
going to do this because we haven't
actually hooked this up in our routes
yet so what we can do is we can take
this and essentially just duplicate it
down and here we can have obviously the
same URI that's important and here we
can say post signup instead so here we
can actually get rid of this name
because this will use the same name as
the earth sign up your eye so we can
only we only need to set the name once
so now over in our signup page here what
we can do is say path 4 and then give
the name of the route so it's just off
dot signup here we can give a method of
post and now we can submit this form so
to test out let's just create an input
type of submit let's go ahead and of
course we need to change this route name
over as well so let's go and set this to
post that's really important and now we
just have this blank button here but you
can see if we just inspect the page that
we actually have authentication public
or sign up so it's pulled that out
despite the fact that we didn't name
both now we can click that and we go
through to that route so that's really
as simple as it is we now have two
routes one for displaying the view one
for handling the data so let's just get
rid of our submit button and in here we
need a class of form
and all we're gonna do in here is create
a label this is going to be for the
email address so in here we can enter
the email and here we want an input type
of email so like that I'm gonna go ahead
and give this a name of email and an
idea of email so the label matches the
ID of the input so we can give it a
placeholder if we want so let's just say
you at domain.com
like that and we also need to give this
a class of form control as well that
will just bring in bootstrap styling so
now we have the following so we have the
ability to enter an email and of course
we can duplicate this down for the name
and the password so let's do exactly
that let's just grab this form group
paste it down here and just change these
over so we'll say name this would just
be the user's name of course the type of
the input will be text let's change this
over this over we can go ahead and get
rid of the placeholder we don't need
that in there and of course it still has
a form control class attached to this so
now we have this so next is the password
last but not least so let's paste this
down
of course the type here is going to be
password so it blanks out the password
and let's just enter the password text
in there change this over go ahead and
change this name over and the ID as well
so now we have our three fields that
we're required to sign up of course what
you can do is have another field in here
to confirm the password if you want to
and you can incorporate that into the
validation rules later on but we'll miss
it out for now just to save a little bit
of time so now we want a button and
we're going to give this a type of
submit we're gonna give this a class of
BTN and BTN default again this is just
bootstrap styling styling and in here we
can have signup so now we have our form
so we can click this and of course that
goes through and submits the form easy
as that and of course when it comes to
signing in we can just copy all of the
HTML we've written for this again just
to save a little bit of time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
