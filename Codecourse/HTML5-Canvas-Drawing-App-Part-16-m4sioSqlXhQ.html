going to start building this very simple
drawing application using the html5
canvas and as you can see it's a whole
lot of fun so let's get started the
first of all you're going to want to
make is your indexed or HTML file so
let's create that and open it up you
want to set your duck type to the html5
doctype which is of course just HTML
then we'll open up our HTML tag open up
a head and we'll give it a title as well
I'll open up our body and then we're
going to make our canvas element so
making the canvas element itself is
really simple it is just opening canvas
tag and then a closing canvas tag it's
also really easy to set fallback content
for the canvas so browsers that support
the canvas won't display whatever's
between these two tags so you know that
if the browser is displaying what's in
between the tags it doesn't support the
canvas so we can leave a message for the
people who are using unsupported
browsers next we're going to want to use
our script tag to include a JavaScript
file so we're going to say go call that
file main go Jas
so let's just a script tag with a source
equal to main j s so let's create that
file the first thing we're going to want
to do is create a few variables to make
it easier to interact with our canvas so
the first variable is just going to be
called canvas and it needs to select the
element that we're using as our canvas
so we're going to give this canvas an ID
of canvas just for simplicity and then
we're going to set this equal to
document dot get element by ID and then
canvas now if you've worked with canvas
before you'll know that most of the
interaction with it comes through what's
called the context so we create this
variable doesn't have to be called
context but I'm going to be calling it
context then we say canvas which is this
variable which I set up here don't get
context 2d next thing we're going to do
is set the width and the height for the
canvas now I want this canvas to span
the entire width of the window and the
entire height of the window so I'm going
to say canvas dot width and then set
that equal to window dot inner width
which is just the width of the window
and we'll do the same for height canvas
dot height equals window dot inner
height so now that the canvas is the
entire size of the window we're also
going to make sure that the body has no
margin on it now usually I wouldn't
recommend doing styling inline but for
this case you might as well so we say
style equals and then in quotations
margin colon zero which just removes all
the margin on the body because otherwise
we have a canvas that is the width of
the window and then margin either side
so we're going to get scroll bars
so that sort out that problem so now we
have fullscreen canvas the next thing
we're going to do is add an event
listener to the canvas to do that we say
canvas dot add event listener and we're
going to attach this to the mouse down
event for now and pass it a reference to
this function put point now this is a
function that we're about to create I
want this function to do is to put down
a circle wherever the user clicks their
mouse so we're going to create a
function obviously call it put point
spell it right as well make sure equals
function and we want it to take a
variable a parameter sorry called e now
event listeners will always pass as the
first parameter to the given function it
will pass the event object now that
event object includes details about the
events so like where it took place so we
can find out where the click was on on
the screen in relation to whatever
you're adding the event listener to so
the event listener will always pass that
as the first parameter all we're doing
here is giving it a name so that we can
use it now we want this function to
place a circle at a given point and for
that we're going to need the context arc
method so let's have a look at how this
works so the context of arc method takes
5 parameters plus an optional 6 so the
first two just define the center point
of your arc so that's this point here
the second is the radius of your arc the
third is the start angle in radians now
if you're used to working with angles in
degrees and don't understand the concept
of a Radian then basically a Radian is 1
radiuses length
around the edge of the circle so if this
is our radius then starting from here we
go that same distance around the edge of
the circle to get to a point where this
angle would be one Radian okay so if you
don't want understand that there's
plenty of information online to help you
so this particular start angle would be
zero radians and in html5 zero radians
is always the rightmost point on your
circle and this end point is let's say
roughly two radians
if you've done any sort of geometry
class you'll know that two PI R is equal
to circumference of the circle the for
circumference so we can say that two pi
radians is equal to 360 degrees and
that's a really useful thing to bear in
mind if you're trying to get used to the
idea of radians so we can also say that
pi radians
maybe spell it right it is equal to 180
degrees and alpha Radian is 90 degrees
so hopefully that makes some sort of
sense final parameter this
anti-clockwise parameter is just saying
which direction you're going to go to
get from the start angle to the end
angle so by default it goes clockwise
and this so this defaults to false but
if you want to go the other way around
you can just change that to true so if
we move back to our code we can put this
into practice so the first thing we want
to do before we use that is say context
dot again path and we'll talk more about
this what this does next time so to use
the arc remember we won our x ry our
radius R start angle our end angle and
we'll leave out that anti-clockwise
parameter so our X is going to be e dot
offset X which means the x-coordinate of
the event our Y is going to be e dot
offset Y our radius is going to be well
actually let's create a variable up here
called radius and we'll set that equal
to 10 for now and then we can use that
in there as is so to start our start
angle will be 0 so I remember zero is
the right of the circle and then to go
all the way around remember we have 360
degrees is two pi radians so we want two
pi and in JavaScript we use math dot pi
to get pi then just times that by 2 so
that's built a path for us that is a
full circle
then all we have to do is fill that with
the method context fill and our function
is complete so let's have a look at that
in our browser and as you can see every
time the user clicks a circle pops up in
that position with a radius of 10 pixels
so we've made a good start and next time
we'll be looking at how to make the
program drawer a smooth line until the
user lifts their mouse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
