email activation to register users into
a database basically what the user has
to do is sign up using the email address
they'll be sent an email with an
activation link they'll have to click
this link and once they've clicked this
link they'll be able to log in now I'm
gonna run through in this first part the
files I'm using the way I've programmed
this and then in the second part we're
going to continue and actually code this
up ourselves now I'm not going to be
coding up everything because it's a
simple login register script which
already have a tutorial on so basically
we're just going to be focusing if you
can see the files here we're going to be
focusing on the actual login itself and
the activation process itself the
registration process does come into it
obviously what we're inputting more
specific things into a database but I'm
just going to working with these files
now the reason this is a change of scene
is because I'm using my hosting to do
this my PHP academy' don't even for
hosting as we're going to be sending
email now it's a lot easier if you have
your own hosting to send the email out
to an address okay so let's get started
now the first thing is I've got the
global dot PHP file I'll just run
through this quickly now basically all
this is is we've got an OB start which
lets us use headers even if we've used
text before headers you may have got the
errors before cannot modify header
information this eliminates this however
it has to be at the very top of your
script and we're going to include this
in every single page we're using so as
long as you've got OB underscore start
that's basically going to help us out
we've got our session start because
we're gonna be using sessions when we're
logging in and we've got our connect to
the database pretty standard two
functions one to connect and want to
select the database I'm using my
username and password here so obviously
a temporary one I'm not going to give
away sensitive parts of information but
yeah this is basically our global header
that we're gonna include in every file
we use
okay so the next thing to know is we've
got our index and register now index
contains the login script if you just
I'm going to pull this up here you can
see we've got a username and password
field
you can try logging in here with a
username and password and we've got
pretty standard functions otherwise if
you're gonna log in with a username that
does exist obviously at the moment I
haven't activated my account but this is
pretty much how it's gonna work so we've
got index dot PHP which lobs us in right
here and then we've got our register dot
PHP which I just grabbed up okay so
we've got choose user name choose
password and email and the way this
works is you choose your username you
choose your password you enter your
email address there we go and what this
does is it then when you click register
it sends an activation email and then
you obviously have to activate that by
email so I'll just show you how it works
if we click register and usually am
already taken okay so Alex one password
and there's my email click register okay
you've been registered successfully
please check your email it gives us our
email address in brackets just to let us
know I'll come to my hotmail and there's
the email just there click on that so it
says activate your account as the
subject hello Alex 1 you're registered
and need to activate your account click
the URL below okay so I'm going to click
it your account has been activated you
can notice that what I've done is if we
then refresh this page it tells us that
we've already activated our account so
let's come back to our login page
and I'm gonna type Alex one I didn't
show you what happened if you if you
don't activate but obviously it gives
out our message and then click that and
then you're logged in and then you can
just log out so it's pretty functional
you can incorporate this into your
website the register process the login
process are pretty much standard to what
you may already know and just with the
added bit of the extra checks and the
extra things we're going to be putting
into the database and obviously this
activate dot PHP file is the most
important what it does is it does take
the unique code that's input next to the
record in the database and then it
compares and then sets this active field
to one just here if the users click this
and there is a valid code so our
database looks somewhat like this we've
got our ID which we're always going to
use an auto increment to keep track of
unique records then we've got a username
we've got a password which is varchar'
32 because we're using md5 encryption
and we've got an email address obviously
this is quite important not so much to
store in the database but we're going to
need this to send the email out then
we've got the code which is where the
code is stored until the user activates
I mean it's stored there forever really
but it needs to be stored in the
database for comparison reasons and then
we've got active which is a tiny int
which is either a 1 or a 0 obviously one
would be that they have activated their
account 0 would be that they haven't if
we just browse this database I'll show
you some example data we've got that
Alex that I tried to log in before you
can see that active set to zero that's
why it wouldn't last
and we've got Alex one which have
recently registered and activated and
we've got active set to one so the code
here will always match this code here
because this is our get variable here so
6 4 2 2 blah blah and then we've got 6 4
2 2 blah blah so it's it's it is a
pretty simple process you've just got to
have a user login and register script
already set up in place and you're
pretty much good to go
you might find it helpful to recode
everything
just to make things simple but for now
I'm just going to show you the actual
email activation process not how to
create the login and register script so
that's probably it for this part in the
next part of the tutorial we're going to
start with showing you how to code up
the activation activation process so
I'll see you in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
