final episode of knots and crosses
intersection games development series
now what we're going to do in this
episode is sort out a graphical display
I'm telling everyone when we've won draw
and lost etc so the first thing we're
going to do is create a new folder in
noughts and crosses i'm going to call
this race now this is a very important
step right click your project come down
to properties go to java build path
libraries add class folder now select
res and you have to make sure it's added
and you'll see it's got a little symbol
there press ok and if you refresh your
project you'll see a nice little symbol
there which shows you you've done it
correctly now we need two images so I've
gone excellent zip at nought and so if
you want to just pause it here and just
quickly make those and what you're going
on to do is copy them going to your
workspace not so crosses res and paste
them there okay so you've now got your
not on cross inside your res folder so
if we come down to int icons what we're
going to actually do is we're going to
set up the icons so that they will
resize to fit the size of the button now
that's actually easier than it sounds or
a soluble complicated than it can also
sound as well so we're going to say
image x equals main sorry because image
io read main dock class stop get
resource a stream my fat no just get get
resource crates full / x dot P and G
okay so now i'm just going to duplicate
this for the why not why not that's of
the game's development we've got not on
the cross so to say not now these are
going to wanted to surround it a try
catch two because an image I oh can
throw exceptions if it doesn't see the
correct / file doesn't exist or anything
like that so we're going to on to catch
is an iop io e exception e ex and you
say hey stop printstacktrace okay so now
we've actually loaded the images so what
we're going to want to do is scale them
to the size so X icon equals new image
icon X dot get scaled instance I'm going
to give it from Sigrid zero dot getwidth
grid 0 dot gets height and the final is
going to be imaged dot scale smooth okay
so what that's going to do is we're
going to set the X icon to a scaled
instance of the X image that we've just
loaded so what we need to do now is
obviously we need to make it for the 0
so 0 icon equals new imageicon oh don't
get scared instance okay so what we want
to do now is set set the board's icon so
if we've rescaled resizer board we want
to update all the image icons on the
board to these new sizes or if they're
done it is to just ignore them so we're
just going to create quickly for low for
int I equals 0 I is less than nine I
plus plus
and we're going to say if grid i dot get
icon doesn't equal null then grid I not
set icon and you're just going to add
another one of these little if segments
so bored i equals one ? X icon colon y
ou icon okay so as gostosas going
through and it will reset all of the
image icons to these new sized ones so
we save that and we want to come back up
here to where we've attempted to change
and we're going to do a very very
similar method to what we've just done
and we're going to set the image icon of
the grid square so grid square dot set
icon current player equals one ? X icon
go on 0i calm ok so just properly
catalyze that now if you've done this
correctly when you run this it should
work so we've got the xnor X naught and
you can't swap the same one and you can
see here it's saying try to play square
431 whatever and it won't actually
change the player so there you go
putting an X naught and there's only one
way to win this now X naught X so now
you see there's a three in a row so
we'll have actually detected that we've
won but it won't do anything because
we've not added the wind method yet so
that's we're going to do now so will we
actual on to doing the wind method is
we're going to set 1 equal to true which
I believe we
we have done that yet so 1 equals true
and then we're going to want to sort out
the winning player and we're going to
give them the option to restart or to
just exit so bring winner equals board
we're equals one fresh mark x or not ok
so now we're going to create a quick j
option pain which is a little message
dialog that gives you a yes no option so
J option k dot show confirm dialog it's
going to be a new jframe and the
parameter going to give the jframe is
winner and rat ulations plus the winner
okay and in here we're going to sleep
player plus winner Plus has one would
you like to play again um now I was that
progress reports okay so now you have to
say if that equals J option painter
option pain dot yes option
so in this case I want to restart so
cool restart else system dot exit 0 okay
so just quickly make a restart method
say public void restart now all the
restart method is going to do is it's
going to just basically reset the game
so one equals false since that bit more
current player equals 1 answers are
going to clear the boards that put in
put in x equals 0 is less than nine i
plus plus board correct brackets at help
board i equals 0 red i got set icon no
ok so that's how we start method done
and we've got an exit method so all
that's left now is draw now the draw is
going to be very similar we're going to
do exactly the same so if we just copy
this if statement here and put it down
here we're going to adjust this and and
change the parameter of the jframe to
it's a draw um so we'll just change this
out it's a draw would you like to play
again I'll just update the type over
there so would you like to play again
which means it's also going to be here
so would you like to play again if they
say yes restart else exit so that's
pretty much it so who run this now all
gone
I love it we get errors width height
must be nonzero that will be why reset
the height okay um if we come up to in
its components just stare just going to
say frame set size 50 comma 50 and now
get rid of that error okay so if we run
home as I'll make it for 56 s besides
we're having it at the end okay so save
that and run so we've got our knots
across this board here so say as a
sounds playing oh look at that play
races one would you like to play again
no game ends okay so do the same thing
again well X claris is one would you
like to click in yes I would it's nice
this time again flourishes one yes play
again and let's let not swim notes as
one would you like to play again yes and
that's essentially how we can do it so
that's actually it for this tutorial
series nice simple one and it does shows
the starts for game programming so
win-win method so you you're running
wind conditions you're running draw
conditions restarting draw conditions
and it does have a bit of nice GUI stuff
and this particularly the scaling the
instances is very helpful in other
projects so thanks for watching guys and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
