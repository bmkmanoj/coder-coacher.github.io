with SSH so you can start to install the
applications that we need so I'm using
OS X so I can simply use the SSH command
from the from the terminal but if you're
using something like Windows I'd
recommend using something like putty
it's fairly easy to you so go ahead and
download that so whatever SSH client
that you're using just go ahead and
connect to the IP that's been that sort
of displayed by your droplet and also
it's been emailed to you and you also
want to connect using the root account
as well so we're gonna say root at 107
170 106 to 3-1 so you may get a warning
that if you do just go ahead and say yes
in this case it's just prompting me for
the password so I can go ahead and copy
that and just paste that in and you can
see we've got open access to our server
so now you're in in this case a button
to has given us some useful information
about the server and you can now provide
standard command here to navigate your
your way around the droplet so for
example if we were to go and this to
list everything know so we can go back a
directory and start listing and then you
see we've got there's the filesystem so
you can see now we're in the root
directory of the server I mean now ready
to start setting everything up so now
that you've set up your droplet and
you've successfully connected we're
gonna go ahead and install Apache and
move on to creating a file viewing it
directly from your browser using this IP
