use within your website you probably
think an image or a font icon or
something like that
but what we're gonna be doing in this
video is dining up what you can see here
spinning around with pure CSS and we're
going to be using css3 animations and a
little bit of trickery just to achieve
this so the actual circular shape you
can see is just normal CSS there's no
magic here at all
some border-radius etc and then we use
the animation to spin this infinitely so
let's jump in and look straight at the
code and build this up it's super easy
so let's first of all look at the markup
we're only gonna have one element here
and that's just going to contain the
entire spinner we don't have any pseudo
elements or any nested elements or
anything like that it is super simple so
I'm just gonna create a div with a class
of spinner now obviously this can be any
element but divs probably probably
appropriate here so we've got this
spinner it's going to be empty here and
as you can see I've got a basic document
layout with a stylesheet linked in at
the top here and that at the moment is
empty so we are completely building this
from scratch so that's first of all
actually build the circular shape to our
spinner so at the moment on our page we
don't have anything but if we go ahead
and take a look at the actual markup
here we can start to play around with
this as we go along so let's target this
spinner class then and let's define a
width and height first of all so let's
say 30 pixels either because we want
this to be a perfect circle obviously at
the moment though you're not going to
get a circle if I temporarily add a
background color just to this you'll be
able to see that we have just a box like
this but what we're going to do is to
get the effect of the outside ring is
we're going to create a border so you
can imagine if I create a fairly thick
border say six pixels this obviously
needs to be solid it doesn't have to be
but probably works best and we'll make
this black so we've now got this border
on all corners like the following so to
make this into a circle that's really
sure
forward we just used the order radius
css3 property which luckily now doesn't
require any vendor prefixes unless you
want to go back to very old versions of
browsers and we've now got a circle so
we've got our circle here it's looking
good so now what we want to do is we
want to change the border left bottom
and right color to create a sort of
gradient effect so we're not going to
have a true gradient here but we are
gonna create a gradient which will look
good enough when it's spinning so let's
change the border left color so let's
actually get rid of this border radius
and put that down there so the border
left color is going to be a slightly
lighter gray if you like or slightly
lighter black so it's a gray color and
then we're going to change the border
bottom color which will be next to the
left obviously and we're gonna again
make that something like five five five
so this is midway between white and
black okay so that's done let's take a
look at this now it's looking a little
bit nicer but what I now want to do is
cut off part of this by making part of
the border transparent so you'll
probably have guessed we want to change
the border right color to transparent so
transparent so now we get the following
like so so we've got an a spinner you
can see if I just zoom in a little bit
here that we've got a black black color
here slightly slightly lighter here and
then again slightly lighter lighter with
transparency so this is good enough it's
it's only a loading spinner and you know
it looks fine
so now what we want to do is actually
apply the animation to this so this is
probably the hardest part particularly
including all of the different vendor
prefixes that we do require with this
experimental technology so the first one
that we're going to include is the
default keyframes rule so we used the @
symbol for rules and this is keyframes
and then we give it a name so this is
the name of our animation we're quite
lucky in this sense that the animation
is actually quite simple all we want to
do is rotate it 360 degrees and make
that infinite so I'm just going to call
this spin and in here we define
stages we want elements to change now
obviously all we need to do here is say
well from zero to 100% we want to rotate
this so we used the transform property
so we say rotate and then we give it
three amount to 360 degrees so all this
is doing just to recap is for the entire
length of the animation it's rotating it
360 degrees which you can imagine starts
at the point it's at rotates 360 degrees
back to the point it's currently out and
then we just start the animation again
so to apply this to our spinner we need
to use the animation property so we
provided the name of the animation the
time in which we want the animation to
complete I'm going to choose 600
milliseconds you can choose second
values or do something like 0.5 seconds
for 500 milliseconds but I'm going to
choose 600 milliseconds we want to
choose how many times we want this to
repeat so you could choose 1 2 3 4
whatever but I'm gonna say infinite we
want this to keep rotating and we're
gonna choose a linear type so basically
we can have things like ease in out
which basically define how the animation
moves from its start to its endpoint
linear you can imagine just keeps it
consistent so at the moment this isn't
actually gonna work because within
Chrome I require the vendor prefix the
WebKit and prefix and this is the same
for Safari as well so let's go ahead and
just copy this and we'll make a few
changes now the most difficult part
about this is deciding how to combine
the actual WebKit vendor prefix
keyframes raw with the properties inside
of this so if that doesn't make sense
I'll explain the vendor prefix here is
WebKit and this allows this to be picked
up by WebKit browsers of their own
implementation so it's just a different
implementation between different
browsers but in here now we might also
want to include WebKit rotate sorry
WebKit transform and that would be
sensible and we might then also include
the standard transform property without
the vendor prefix which makes sense and
we'd also have to modify this rule as
well to say WebKit and
Meishan so now this is spinning because
the WebKit's
version has been picked up and this
version which currently wouldn't be
supported within Chrome doesn't get
picked up so that's how we deal with
things there's a little probably a
little bit of ongoing debate especially
at the time of recording as to whether
you should include the vendor prefix
versions inside of this so for example
WebKit Mozilla etc because if this is
made non vendor prefix so this is
standardized then these may not be so
rotate
sorry transforms might not be so really
it depends but I'm just gonna leave
these as the following I'm actually
gonna remove this from here so I'm
assuming that once this becomes vendor
prefix free then the transform property
will also but you might want to go go
ahead and read up on that or you might
want to include them all in here so
let's get on with our vendor prefix just
so this works in all browsers so we've
got WebKit let's now do mozilla so this
will be for firefox etc mozilla
transform rotate and then the standard
property there again and let's do this
once again but let's do this for opera
and then change this here oh and there
we go
we don't need to include the MS prefix
because it was never prefixed in
Internet Explorer it just uses the
standard key frames whichever version of
Internet Explorer this supports so we've
now got this vendor prefixed here with
the vendor prefix keyframe rule and the
same with Mozilla and WebKit as well as
the non vendor prefix version but we now
need to update these so let's just
duplicate this down so we have WebKit
Moors and OH
obviously in chrome this still works but
you can go ahead and load up opera
Mozilla Safari and this will also work
so that's how we build a very basic CSS
spinner without any need for images
JavaScript or anything else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
