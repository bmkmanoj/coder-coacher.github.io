you're naturally going to want to
protect against cross-site request
forgery attacks and it can get pretty
annoying to have to implement this but
what we're going to be looking at here
is doing this really easily within slim
- with the inclusion of middleware so
we're gonna be building middleware
that's going to generate a token which
will then be available in our views
which we can then use within a forum and
whenever we submit that form the request
will automatically be checked so as long
as you have it included in your form our
middleware will pick that up it will
compare the two tokens and then if they
fail we'll throw an exception so it's
pretty straightforward and then really
easy way to just be able to forget about
having to check this on every one of
your routes
so we'll take a quick look at how this
works and we're going to write the code
that's going to make this possible so
you can see here I have a form with just
a drop down here we can select one of
these options and hit buy this now and
all we get is just a sort of faint
message you just bought product
obviously like all other forms this is
susceptible to cross-site request
forgery attacks if we don't protect
against it but inside of this form
you'll see I have a hidden input here
the name of this is cross-site request
forgery token so CSRF token and then we
have an Sh one hash just here which will
be generating a bit later so obviously
when I go ahead and submit this
everything's gone well but if an attack
was in place and this was completely
different I've just removed part of that
hash and I hit by this now you see we
get an exception thrown and the message
here is CS a CSRF token mismatch so
that's going to protect you so we'll
move on now just to look at the
application structure and then we'll
jump into writing this middleware so
over in my text editor then let's take a
quick look around my application
structure yours is likely going to be
different this is gin generally the way
I layout slim to projects
so let's ignore this folder here for now
important to note I am psr-4
Auto loading this code course folder
here so this is my sort of vendor name
but obviously you might not be so you
might have to manually include the
middleware I'm also obviously pulling in
slim I'm pulling in slim views as well
which I'm using Twix I'm using Twix for
my templates if you're not using
twitting you're gonna have to implement
this very slightly differently when you
include your token but it shouldn't be
too much different so over then in my
routes I have products by so I have this
by route here and all this does is the
get request to this just renders out
this products by view so this is in my
views folder just here and that's just
the form you can see I'm including my
token just in here which we'll look at
later but when we submit this through
you can see if at request post product
so if the product exists in the post
request we just kill the page so that's
all we're doing there so in my start
file then this is slightly different
what we're doing here is obviously
starting sessions because we need to
make use of sessions so we'll need
sessions enabled just pulling in
composers also loader creating a new
instance of slim with obviously my twig
few in there we're adding our middleware
which is obviously the subject of this
video and then I'm doing things like
setting my templates directory and I'm
adding part of extensions as well for
twig so I can use things like URL and
for which we can see just here so most
of that shouldn't really matter what
we're gonna be focused on is inside of
our vendor folder we have this
middleware folder which contains our
middleware so this is the middleware
that we're going to be writing and
including into our application and then
all you'll need to do is in any of your
forms just include this line so
regardless of how your application setup
this should just be easy to implement as
we go so that's enough about the actual
application that we're working with
let's jump straight in and write this
middleware so we're now back in the
state with no cross-site request forgery
protection at all the form still works
as normal but we aren't protecting
this form submission or any other form
submissions so let's create some new
middleware like I said in psr-4 so
loading this so this will be
automatically available to me under the
namespace but if you're not you can just
include that farm manually so under
middleware let's create a new file them
and let's go ahead and call this
cross-site request forgery middleware
dot PHP and let's start to write our
middleware and that we can include that
when we create our app instance
so let's namespace this obviously you
don't have to depending on how you're
structuring things but we're gonna
namespace that under code course
middleware the class name is obvious
CSRF middleware and we need to obviously
extend slim middleware so what we're
gonna do now then is choose a name for
our session key this can come from
config so you can load it from any
configuration that you're using but for
now all I'm gonna do is just create this
just up here so I'm gonna call this CSRF
token and we're going to pass this to
our views as well so when we include in
our form if we ever do update this all
of our forms will be updated as well so
we have our call method as part of our
slim middleware and for this what we're
gonna be doing is just hooking on
another method which will just create
our now we're going to be hooking on
this method to be run before every
request to our application is made so
we'll say this app hook I'm gonna hook
it on before every request and we're
calling this object and we're calling
the check method and we obviously have
our next call as well for our middleware
so now we can focus on this check method
which is going to be the bulk of what
we're writing the first thing we need to
do is before every request to an
application we need to set a session and
that session is going to contain
fairly random token you can obviously
choose how to generate this however you
want I'm just going to be using PHP
sha-1 function so let's first of all
check if that isn't set so we obviously
use our session superglobal and we pass
in this case so we're checking if CSF
CSRF token is set and if it isn't set we
want to go ahead and generate a new
token and we're going to store that
within session and the key that we've
chosen so like I said I'm really using
the sha-1 function I'm gonna pass micro
time into this that's a UNIX timestamp
with micro seconds and I'm just going to
append on to that random number between
10,000 and 99999 so obviously feel free
to update this in this case it's just an
example what we want to do now is just
grab it up and grab that token so let's
grab that so we can locally easily use
it within this method so this key and
now what we want to do is just before we
do anything I'm gonna pass it through to
our views so we can include it in our
form and see that it works and then what
we'll do is implement the actual check
when we submit the form so what we need
to do is share this without views so we
say this app view I'm gonna append data
on we have an array just in here I'm
gonna pass in CSRF key like so that's
going to be a string and we're gonna
pass in the token as well so we can
include that in our form so the key is
just going to be the key that we set in
that property at the top of our object
and the token is just going to be that
token
so we now need to include this
middleware into our application so you
can run it before every request we've
obviously added that hook there so under
where over you're starting up slim
you're going to want to say app add and
then you're going to want to include a
new instance of that middleware so we're
gonna say new code course middleware
cross-site request forgery middleware
and that's pretty much it so when we
refresh now nothing's really changed
because we're not doing anything we're
not including that token within our form
and even if we were our middleware isn't
checking anything but we know that these
have been shared without view now so
what we can do is under our form we can
implement a hidden input the name of
this is going to be cross-site request
forgery key like I mentioned earlier if
you change the name of the key for any
reason this will automatically update
all of your forms then we have the value
which is the actual token itself so CSRF
token so when i refresh now we see that
key that we set in our class and we see
the value of the key and that's
obviously going to change with every
request so we've got these values now
form but we're not actually checking
them at all so even if we were Sam
modify this value here nothing's gonna
happen we're not checking anything we're
not throwing any errors so inside of our
middleware then just above here we are
going to check the method that we're
receiving for submissions so for example
post put delete or whatever else and
once that's done we'll compare the two
so we can obviously just say this app
requests get or post rather
CSRF token we'd obviously substitute
this key in here but this isn't good
enough because it's not protecting
against the methods that we choose we
want to have multiple methods so what we
can do is we can use this app we can use
request get method so we'll check for
the request method in an array of
methods that we want to protect against
so that sounds a lot more complicated
than it actually is we're just going to
use in array to check this app request
get method so the get method method will
return something like post get put
delete whatever and here's our array of
what we want to check against so for
example post put delete we don't want to
check against get because it doesn't
make sense to we're not actually doing
anything there which just be rendering a
view or something but in this case now
what's going to happen is if we just
write something in here when we hit this
we obviously don't see that and when we
click that we see that message output so
we know that this is working and you can
go ahead and test it with any put or
deep delete requests as well so we need
our submitted token and this basically
comes from our request so we have post
and then this key so let's test this out
now let's just kill this and output our
submitted token so when I hit that we
see that token if for example this was
delete
we still get that so it's it looks like
it's all well and good obviously if this
was a get it would work but we just
stick with post for the moment so now we
want to throw an error if these don't
match and this is pretty straightforward
all we want to do is check that the
token that we have stored up here
doesn't equal the submitted token so if
they do not match we have a cross-site
request forgery attack potentially and
for now I'm just gonna throw a new
exception nothing interesting here but
obviously you can do whatever you want
here you could log an issue if you
wanted just to show that this has
happened entirely up to you but for now
I'm just throwing a new exception so
let's now check it it works as normal
but if we go ahead and modify the value
here and we hit that we see it our slim
application error and we get our message
for our exception so that is pretty much
how easy it is to add cross-site request
forgery protection to your slim to
application using middleware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
