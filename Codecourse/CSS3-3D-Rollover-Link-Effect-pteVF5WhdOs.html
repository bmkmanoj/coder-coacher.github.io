this effect you can see on this link
here I found this on web designer de
piyo this disor transformation so we're
gonna be recreating what I saw on here
so this is what the effect looks like
we're going to be using some transitions
we're gonna be talking about 3d we're
gonna be talking about transforming
elements rotating things I'm also gonna
look at some cool tricks that actually
let us get away with effects like this
so this is very new this isn't gonna
work on Internet Explorer we're going to
add in vendor prefixes for WebKit only
but then you might go ahead and consider
doing it from Mozilla and opera as well
so we'll build this and we'll head over
to the code and start doing it okay so
we're over to the text editor the first
thing that I want to just point out is
that I'm using a font called
open sans as a popular font in 400 and
600 weights from the Google font library
so you can see that this I've opened
this here just to show you you can use
any font you want this isn't doesn't
necessarily work with open sans but it
does look very nice with a nice font is
nice to you know create these fonts
these effects with nice fonts so go
ahead and grab that if you want to but
for now we'll go ahead and start
building this so I've also linked in a
global CSS stylesheet which is in a CSS
directory there's absolutely nothing in
here at the moment I'm just working with
index dot HTML which has our basic
document layout let's get started so
what I want to do first is obviously
create this anchor which is going to
allow me to style everything up properly
so I'm gonna create a paragraph element
here and inside of here I'm gonna say
you can find some cool stuff around here
or whatever you want
right so I'm going to choose some cool
stuff to link up and I'll set the HOF to
hash for now it doesn't you know we
don't need this to link anywhere so this
is what its gonna look like
first of all playing pretty plain pretty
normal now what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to create a span within
this anchor and the reason we want to do
this is because we're going to be
creating a pseudo element for the span
and it's the span that we're gonna be
changing when we hover over this anchor
so we need to be able to target this
anchor so I'm gonna give this a class of
role link now with the span we'll look
at why we do this later and actually why
this is necessary but we need to create
a data attribute so we can read this in
with CSS and all like I said look at
yourself how we do this later so we're
gonna call this title now this needs to
match exactly or it doesn't have to
match exactly but it's ideally it would
match exactly what's within your actual
span element so this is some cool stuff
so briefly this is because we need to
take this content and add it to the
pseudo element and really the only way
we're gonna be able to do that unless
we're hard coding the value into our CSS
file which I'm assuming you don't want
to do you're gonna need the data
attribute here so now that we've got our
markup let's head over to global dot CSS
and start to actually star this out so
the body what was he gonna incorporate
the open sans font that we included from
the Google font library or web fonts
whatever you want to call it so we'll
say open sans so that's going to change
the font of what we have perfect so now
I want to style all the anchors so the
color I want for all anchors is
basically going to be e93 a30
this is just taken directly from
webdesigner Depot it's just this nice
red color the next thing I want to do is
set the font weight to 600 remember we
included that from the font from Google
and I want the text decoration to be
none I don't any underlining here so
that's how our fonts our anchors are
currently looking at the moment so for
the role link itself we need to apply a
few properties here the well mainly
we're not going to see the benefit of
why we're doing these yet until later on
let's do them now anyway just because we
want to get these out these so boring
properties out the way and done with we
want this to display as an inline block
because we want to be able to apply
certain attributes to this that won't
allow us to do it if it's an inline
element and we want to set the overflow
to hidden this is just going to ensure
that any of the transformations that
don't that take place aren't shown
underneath the link so we get that nice
box flipping effect try at the end of
the tutorial playing around with some of
these and removing them and you'll see
why we actually add them and we want a
vertical line to top that should be
pretty self-explanatory so now let's
check this out
cool so if we remove any of these at the
moment you can see that we have sort of
a few problems here so that's why we do
it
so now let's focus on applying stars to
the span within the rolling we want to
display this as a block as currently is
displayed as an inline element and we
want to give this a little bit of
padding on the oops not 20 a little bit
of padding on the left and the right
hand side this is just shorthand for top
and bottom or north and south and east
and west or left and right what we also
want to do here in fact we'll leave that
for now so what we now want to do is we
want to say roll link and we want to
apply a hover effect now or a hover
action on that we want to set the span
properties so we're gonna say we want
the background color to be the same as
the link color that we had before so
remember this is hash een ein three a
three zero let's check out what this
does first of all okay so that's pretty
straightforward it just turns the
background color red not very useful and
not really getting the effect that we
want to be honest now what I'm going to
do now is I'm gonna style the pseudo
element for this and what this is going
to do is it's going to add this but
because we've got overflow set to hidden
this isn't gonna work
so let's what it's gonna work but it's
not going to show us so let's comment
that out for now and now let's go ahead
and say roll link span and we star the
after pseudo element so what this is
going to do is if we just pull up our
element inspector which is going to be
handy later on once we start styling
this or adding content you'll see the
pseudo element appear under here so for
the content we oops the content we
supply a string value now in this case I
could just write Alex for example I
could really want anything you can see
now that we've got this pseudo element
here and in fact the text has appeared
there we obviously don't want that now
what we want is we want the content to
be what's within this data title because
we want to mimic this so when the box
effect rolls up it contains the same
text so we use the attribute function
and we supply which attribute oops
tie so which attribute we want to pull
out from and in this case it's data
title so here that clever trick will
basically just give us the same text
that we set in that data title so now we
want to also display this as a block
because a pseudo element won't be by
default and we want to set the position
of this to absolute so we can give it a
left and a top value both of these are
going to be 0
so we'll do the same as we did for the
normal span not the pseudo-element and
we'll give this a padding of zero and
two pixel again 20 pixels two pixels on
the left and right hand side and what
we'll also do is we'll set the color to
white and the background to red so the
background color will just copy and
paste this down for just the second
being quick and we'll set the color here
to white so that's it for these sort of
stylistic properties here you can see
that we're not quite getting the effect
that we want if we just set the span to
position:relative what that will do is
that will contain that within there so
you can see that that's sort of
containing that within there it's not
floating off them off to the page it
doesn't really matter because when it
comes to overflow:hidden this will hide
anyway but we'll keep this here for now
so let's just set overflow:hidden back
let's get rid of this position:relative
so you can see that this has floated up
here we've given it the absolute
position so the reason for this is we
need to do some or basically add some
more properties to this span and that is
stuff like the transform origin the
transform style and then we'll go ahead
and add a transition on this as well so
we can actually see a transition as a
particular speed so let's start with the
transform origin and transform style and
we'll briefly talk about what these mean
so the property for this is oops not
text transform transform origin and this
basically transforms the origin of our
transformations on an x and y value in
this case we'll do 50% in 0 that's x and
y and we also want to change the
transform style and this is preserve 3d
and this basically means that
we indicate that the children of the
element should be positioned in the 3d
space and this is really important for
the translations and rotations we'll be
doing so we're also going to add WebKit
then the prefixes as I mentioned earlier
so let's add them now some of these
won't actually work at the time of
recording without the WebKit prefix so
now you can see that's been positioned
more or less correctly so now what we
want to do is we want to add the
transition here because we have the
hover effect this transition will take
place when we actually hover over so
we're gonna say WebKit transition now we
want this to be on all properties we
want it to be 400 milliseconds and we
want this to ease in we'll do exactly
the same thing here for the non prefixed
so basically now that will transition so
now that we've got the transition in
let's just change some of the properties
on this span here so I'm going to use
the transform property and this is going
to rotate on the x-axis at an angle of
90 degrees so we'll also add the WebKit
transform in here and we'll see what
this does so when we refresh cool so now
you can see that this is sort of
flipping up like this so now what we
want to do is we want to add some
properties to the actual pseudo element
that we've created here and this is
going to do exactly the same thing as
you can see at the moment we've got the
red with the red block by default and
this is flipping up it doesn't really
make much sense so if we apply this here
we're gonna change the transform origin
so exactly the same thing on the X&amp;amp;Y
yes and we do exactly the same for the
WebKit prefix with the vendor prefix on
and now what we want to do is we want to
change the actual transform of this so
we want to use the translate 3d function
which is going to the move the position
of an element in this case it's the
pseudo element we're going to move a
hundred percent on the y-axis so let's
just take a look at this we'll use the
transform property what what's going to
do is rotate it on the x axis minus 90
degrees so we use the translate 3d
function this is the X Y and Zed axis
and we can chain on rotate X we already
saw rotate X up here of a 90 degree
angle this time we're choosing a minus
90 degree angle and we want to do the
same thing with the WebKit then the
prefix so now that goes because we've
transformed it we've used the translate
3d in the rotate X function and now when
we hover you can see that that takes
place so with a few simple
transformations we've achieved this
effect with fairly little CSS depending
on the time of recording you're
obviously going to want to go ahead and
add the other vendor prefixes for these
if it's not supported remember this
isn't supported in IE at all yet but
what I would suggest you do is just play
around with this if you do want to
change any sort of the way this works
remember you've got the element
inspector if you don't quite understand
what any of these different properties
mean you can use this to just change
things around so for example if you want
to change this and see what happened
you could but you can have a fiddle
around here and see what else you can
Shivam this you can obviously increase
the speed of the transition as well with
this you can use second values if you
want this to be slower you could say no
point five seconds if you wanted or the
equivalent 500 milliseconds you can do
whatever ready here but generally have a
play around with these different CSS
properties and see what you can do with
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
