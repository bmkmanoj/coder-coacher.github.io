lower fell 5 application it's not
entirely necessary because obviously you
can host whatever you want unfortunate
apply whatever you want with on voya but
it would be useful to be able to access
a laravel 5 or any kind of application
on your local machine we're gonna be
working with is just empty laravel 5
project so I'm using laravel homestead
at the moment but of course you can use
whatever you want as long as you can
push it up to a github account or a
bitbucket account then you're good to go
so more importantly you are going to
need a forge account so you'll need to
sign up and you'll need to link your
digital ocean account that's another
thing that you're going to need to be
able to do this
basically what Forge does is it allows
you to create ready-made servers with
all of the software you need and this
will be on digital ocean so you will
need a digital ocean account as well if
you don't already have one once you have
signed up for forge you can link your
account it's very straightforward to get
it set up and then you're ready to go so
the other thing that you're going to
need is on voya so this is basically the
deployment stage of things which is
essentially going to pull our code from
github and it's going to place it onto
our server and this is zero downtime
deployment I'm gonna be talking a little
bit about what that means a bit later on
so make sure you again signed up for
Envoy you need to link your github
account or your bitbucket account or any
other version control it support we're
exclusive
exclusively going to be working with
github which is the preferred option for
most people but going on to that you
will need some kind of version control
so I like online account so in this case
I'm using github and we're going to be
creating a repository and then we're
going to be deploying the code from that
repository so this at the moment is on
my local machine we're gonna be pushing
it up to github we're gonna be creating
a server and then we're gonna be
deploying the code onto that server
using envoy so that's pretty much
everything you need there's probably a
couple of other things you may need
along the way but we'll make that very
clear and once you have all this ready
to go we're ready to continue and get
set up to host and deploy our
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
