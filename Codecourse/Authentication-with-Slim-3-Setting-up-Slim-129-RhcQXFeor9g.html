is install slim and set up our base
framework structure now if you already
know how to work with slim 3 that's
absolutely fine you can go ahead and
skip this entire section and you can
just download the starter files from the
course downloads and follow along from
there so if you aren't familiar with
slim or if you just like to learn how
this is all set up we can go ahead and
pull down slim using composer so first
step is to grab composer now I have
composer installed globally on my
machine so I can just run composer like
that but you might not and if you follow
the instructions on composer here you'll
find you'll have a composer dot phor
file downloaded so in that case you want
to run PHP compose the dot PHP R and
then any of the commands that we'll be
running so let's head over to the slim
github page and if we just scroll down
we can see that to install slim this is
the package name and this is the version
name so let's go ahead and just copy
this and do a composer require on this
and remember if you're downloading
composer you want to be in this
directory and of course if you're
running these commands you also want to
be in this directory so once this is
finished we will have it ready to go and
we can start to build our application
structure so over in my text editor
which was an empty folder
I now have vendor composer JSON which
just lists all of our dependencies and
any other configuration and we have this
vendor folder so basically what we want
to do is load in all of our dependencies
we can do that using the auto load file
so a little bit about the structure of
the application let's think where the
user will land what I'm going to do is
create a public folder within here and
this is where the user is going to land
to get to our application so within your
web server you'll want this to point to
the public directory and then everything
else will just work so what now that
we've got this public directory let's go
and Cree
eight a file that the user will land on
that's obviously going to be called
index.php so once we have this up and
running we want some kind of file to
bootstrap our application so this can go
anywhere but I'm going to create a
bootstrap directory just in here and
then within here I'm going to create an
app dot PHP file so within this we want
to basically do a few things we're going
to require in all of our dependencies so
let's start by requiring in we're going
to go back a directory vendor autoload
dot PHP so that will just pull in all of
our dependencies for us pretty
straightforward so now what we want to
do is start to instantiate slim so we're
going to create a new application
instance and from this we can do
everything that we need to do so to do
this all we do is create an app variable
and we create a new slim app instance so
let's just take a look back to index dot
PHP we're not doing anything in here at
the moment so of course what we want to
do is requiring our bootstrap file so
I'll explain more about why we're doing
this in just a moment so we're going to
go into bootstrap and then we're going
to load an app PHP now from here we want
to run our application so of course you
can structure your project however you
want but this is generally just the
minimum amount that you want to put into
index.php all of your bootstrapping and
adding to your container which we'll
learn about in a moment will go in your
bootstrap file here so now that we have
this what we can do is start to do
things like just load up sessions so why
don't we just starve sessions in fact we
can bump that up and what we can also do
is pass in some configuration options to
slim so for example while I'm developing
I want errors to be displayed so you
want to make sure that you turn this off
during production
here I'm going to say display error
details and I'm going to set that to
true okay so now that we've done this we
can actually start to test if everything
is working and if you don't know about
concept of routes we'll take a look at
creating a very simple route here so
let's create a route by saying app get
we provide the URI which is just the URL
that the user land on and then we have a
callback so this will be what is run
when the user lands on this page so in
here we have a request and a response
now the request deals with things like
request data and anything else like that
so for example when you post a form this
is how you'll pick up them form values
and a response is how we respond to the
request so whether that's setting some
kind of status code or whether it's
responding with a view so now all we
need to do to test this out is do
something like return home so we'll
check out this in the browser let's go
ahead and hit this and it probably made
a mistake somewhere let's just go and
check here looks like I haven't appended
that properly so now we see home perfect
so that is your first route if you're
not work with routes before that's how
simple it is now we're actually going to
be working with controllers through the
series but it's a very simple concept
all we do is we create a class instead
of this closure just here
okay so now that that's up and running
let's start to look at the other
directories that we might have well I
have usually when I'm working on small
projects an app folder which contains my
routes whether these point to
controllers or not so all this means is
that we're just keeping things nice and
separate and we didn't need to do down
here is require this in so let's go and
require in app routes PHP simple so if
we create a route in here this will work
as normal so why don't we just go and
this simple route back just here let's
return home and then we go works just as
normal now if I were to change this to
something like /home you'd expect this
to work but it actually says not found
that's because Apache which is the
webserver I'm currently running is
looking for a folder called home so to
counteract this all we do is we create
an HT access file that will go ahead and
turn URL rewriting on and of course that
needs to be inside of the public
directory let's just go and create this
again like so okay so inside of here
you'll need to place the following you
can go ahead and grab this from the
course downloads or you can find it on
Slim's documentation as well so now this
will work because it picks this up
passes it back through to index.php what
we then do is from here
bootstrap our application and we know
that we're loading in our routes from
here which will then respond to that
request so pretty straightforward
hopefully that makes sense
so now that we've got the basic
structure set up what about any CSS or
JavaScript files that we might create
well of course these are publicly
accessible resources remember our web
server will point to public so inside of
here this is where we can create things
like CSS or JavaScript or put any images
so that's pretty much it for our very
basic directory structure in the next
video we're going to look at going ahead
and setting up twig view which is a slim
package that allows us to work with twig
within slim so let's jump over and set
that up as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
