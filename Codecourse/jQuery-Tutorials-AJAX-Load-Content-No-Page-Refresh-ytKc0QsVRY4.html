this tutorial we're going to be learning
how to load content into your page
so essentially loading link content from
a navigation without refreshing the page
so we're going to be using Ajax to do
this and we're going to use be using an
extremely simplified way of doing this
using jQuery so it's probably easier
than you think already to actually do
this so if you don't have any knowledge
about jQuery go ahead and take a look at
that we're going to be looking at the
site in just a moment how to download
and use jQuery and but first of all
we're going to go ahead and build a page
get it how we want it to look we're
going to be filling in all these pages
here it's not complicated whatsoever so
let me just go ahead and explain what
pages we're going to be using the first
is index dot PHP which is obviously
gonna be our landing page we're going to
be using about contact and index dot PHP
let's just put them in order so index
about and contact they're just going to
be content pages so these are going to
be the pages that we're going to be
loading in we're going to be using stars
dot CSS which is obviously a stylesheet
that's just going to be to style the
menu that's not really important it's
only just because it's going to look a
bit a bit silly if we don't and we've
got general J s which is going to handle
our JavaScript and we're going to be
using the jQuery JavaScript library so
let's go ahead to index dot PHP and
start to write our page are now at the
moment you can see that there is nothing
on the page I've got jQuery comm open so
if you want to go ahead and navigate
over to jQuery comm we're going to be
downloading j.crew jQuery or at least
using the URL from jQuery to make use of
the library so inside our text editor
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to
set a doctype to this
and just essentially create a page as
we've normally would so I'm going to
have a head in there and the body and
we'll give it a nice title as well we'll
just say our site so up here we're going
to be including the stylesheet just here
so the stylesheet will go here and down
here just before the ending of the body
we're going to be including our scripts
as well so we're not going to be
including scripts in the head of our
page let's go ahead and just include our
style sheet so link rel equals style
sheet she and then we need an href and
that will just link to that now the
ending tag isn't required with html5 so
you don't need to put that in but I
always and doing it so the href is going
to be CSS forward slash style.css let's
just take a look at our directory
structure obviously it's going to look a
bit different in our text editor we need
to know sort of where everything is
going
index dot PHP against our landing page
that's the page we're working on at the
moment
J s is where gem wood at J s is going to
go you can actually see the directory
path up here as I'm clicking on each
file so if that helps CSS is where
Styles dot CSS is going to go as you can
see we've just included it in that
folder and we've got content where our
three content files are going to be
going so CSS is holding our Styles J s
is holding our JavaScript and content is
holding our three content pages so it
makes it a lot easier for us to find
everything that instead of lumping it
all in the root directory
okay so we've included our stylesheet
now inside of our body that's a slightly
different let's just go ahead and
include general JJ s and jQuery as well
in fact let's go ahead and build the
menu in the content area first so we're
going to create an unordered list file
menu this is quite good practice to get
into so we're going to create an
unordered list and then have list
elements
we're going to have list elements in the
middle so we'll create three of these
one is for home which is the index page
here our index content page once for
about and one is for contact so let's
just pop them in home about us and the
contact
okay so ul we're going to go an ID to
and this is going to be nav so we can
use styles to style this up let's just
go take a look at how that looks now
browser first of all now I'm refresh you
can see it looks like this I literally
just want them all in one row so that's
quickly very fast styles well not focus
on this too much and we'll say ul hash
now because we've called our nav just
nav and I'm going to say list-style:none
and thus a padding:0 I'm going to say
margin I'm going to create north east
south and west er this is north margin
east south and west south or just want
10 pixels because I don't too much space
between the content and the menu itself
and then for each well we'll just take a
look at what that's done you see that's
just got rid of our bullet points and
we've got a margin we just take a quick
look we've got a margin at the bottom
you can see that yellow area of 10
pixels which just gives us enough space
to sort of space out the content now
what we want them to do is all be
displayed inline so I'm going to say ul
hash nav airline so we're styling the
lis in between and we want to say
display inline refresh and you can see
that they're all in line now we can go
ahead and give them a margin now could
say margin right but I'm just going to
do like this I'd prefer to do like this
in case we need to add any margin in
later I'm going to say margin
in fact let's just use rights probably
more accepted to do margin right if
we're only styling one margin so margin
right we'll just say 10 pixels and you
can see that we'll just space them out
of it so that's all we're going to talk
about with regards to CSS so we can
close that now we don't need to do any
more styling now underneath that menu
item or our unordered list menu I'm
going to create a div with an ID of
content and this is where our content is
going to be displayed in here so
essentially we're going to end up with
something like just a header and then
content so we're going to end up with
something like this and when we click
each item here we're going to change
this content without obviously reloading
the page but for now we don't actually
need anything in here because what we
can do is we can use Ajax to load the
initial page and then load subsequent
pages on top of that by just clicking
each each menu item so obviously these
need to be links so let's just pop them
link some a tags around them
annoying repetitive process I guess I
could have duplicated the lines but
there we go
so I'm going to do something quite weird
now and you're going to find out why
I've done that in a moment I'm going to
type H ref equals the H I think was
indexed just there I'm going to type
eight zero equals about there an href
equals contact there now at the moment
that would just link to you know a file
called index with no extension so it
seems quite odd but you will see in a
moment why we've done that obviously
what we want here is we've got our links
but we don't have any content as soon as
we the page loads we want the first page
the initial page to load in there so
let's go ahead and do that we need to do
that from general is the first thing we
need to do is include jQuery because
that's going to allow us to use the
jQuery library the second of all then
we're going to include general J s let's
go ahead and just populate index about
on content with some content first so we
can sort of practice loading them in so
I'm going to create a header and it's
just going to say home and a paragraph
underneath welcome to our website ok we
can close that forget about that same
with a about or create a header and
we'll just say about us and then we'll
say just this is our official website
just pop any old rubbish in there and
we'll have another h1 for this contact
and then we will say call us on 0 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 9 so really nothing there
knew nothing to be learned there ok so
the first thing we want to do is load in
this index page so under here we'll go
in and include our scripts we don't need
a type in html5 so we'll say script
source equals something and remember to
end a script tag now what you what we
want to load first is jQuery we want to
load the jQuery library so let's go
ahead and click on download jQuery and
we're actually going to copy this URL
here we're going to go ahead and paste
it into the source so we're using
external include which is absolutely
fine
I wouldn't recommend this normally keep
the file on your server just in case of
jQuery site goes down you never know as
long as you've always got access to that
file that's what's important
the next thing let's say script source
equals and we're going to include our
J's file which is in our AF folder and
its general doc J s so we're going to go
ahead and just test that let's just put
an alert in there and say working and
let's go close jQuery website now
refresh and we get a page alert saying
working so everything is working we're
assuming jQuery is working we don't
actually know yet but let's go ahead and
get on with the rest of the tutorial so
we have this div here called content
it's got an ID of contents of a going to
be using a hash to reference it the
first thing we want to do is load out
index dot PHP far from our content
folder so let's go into general KS and
we'll use a jquery selector to select a
document and we want to wait for the
event handler ready so we want to wait
for the document to be available to
start manipulating then we're just going
to go ahead and we're going to say and
select the content area so content div
and we're going to be using the jquery
function load which is essentially an
extremely easy and lightweight way of
just including a file into a particular
area so we'll just load it in that's
literally all that's required so go over
to jQuery documentation if you
we want to read up more about this you
can use ajax ajax to load files in and
this a bit more advanced error handling
there but this should be this should
sort of sufficed for smaller sites that
don't need any you know advanced error
handling for that because obviously you
going to want to do something if the
files available and blah blah blah so
we're going to load in content forward
slash index dot PHP okay so quite
straightforward let's go ahead and
refresh you can see that that index file
that we created earlier has been loaded
in we've got our header and then we've
got our paragraph here so quite cool
we've already used Ajax now to load it
in using the jQuery load function but
now what we want to do
we'll just comment this we'll say
initial and then what we want to do is
we want to go ahead and handle clicks so
handle menu clicks so our menu we need
to use a jQuery selector to see when one
of these links is clicked now what we're
going to be doing is what when one of
these links is clicked we're going to be
taking this name here and we're going to
be appending dot PHP on and then
including it from the contents folder so
that means that when you want to go
ahead and add a new menu item you can
just duplicate this down oh not get rid
of the existing one you can just
duplicate this down and then when you
have a new section you can just go ahead
and change this and create a file so you
don't need to faff around with
individual selectors for each menu item
you can just pop it in the href and
we'll load that in and we'll prevent the
default action which would be to go to
this file called index about all content
contact sorry so into general jeaious we
need to use our selector our div is
called or sorry our UL is called nav so
we need to use that selector then we're
going to traverse or select down to Li
and then a and then we append a click
handler on so makes more sense when it's
written so let's go ahead and do that so
we want to say ul hash nav Li a so when
an a link inside an Li inside this ul
called now is clicked so dot click
we're going to perform a function or
carry out everything inside here and
that is going to be first to alert okay
okay just so we know that it works so
let's go ahead and refresh when I click
we get this alert okay and then it goes
to this about file here which doesn't
exist obviously when I click contact we
get the same thing here
blah blah blah so let's go ahead and
actually make it work now I'm going to
create a variable and I'm going to call
this page and that's going to be equal
to and we're going to use the this
selector meaning what we've currently
got selected which will be our a so this
and then we're going to select the
attribute href which will give us this
value so we're going to say attribute
href which will give us index about or
content depending on which one's clicked
and doing it this way means we don't
have to create a selector for each
individual link meaning that again like
I said when we add more a tags on we
don't need to do anything it will just
automatically work so this dot attribute
and inside ear we need to specify the
attribute which is href now I'm going to
go ahead and alert page just so you can
see it working in steps click about it
comes up about and I click let's go back
contact and it comes up contact
the same with home as well but I'm guess
I'm guessing you guessed that it's now
let's go ahead and actually make this
work we want to do the same as we did up
here but we want to load in the page
that's been clicked so again we say hash
content dot load and then inside here we
want to save content
forward slash and it will be X where the
page is going we'll add that in in a
moment
dot PHP so X we need to substitute now
for the page that's been clicked so
let's just append on using pluses so
obviously we're working in JavaScript
not PHP which would be a dot and in here
we'll just write page okay so quite
simple that's going refresh let's click
about us oh okay so we've got the
functionality there but what we need to
do is we need to prevent the default
action that you know would normally
happen so when you click on a link the
href would be located too so what we
need to do is we need to
they return false and what this will do
is I mean that it won't carry out the
default action it will carry out
everything that we have inside of this
function so let's go ahead and refresh
and click about us contact home and
there we go so now we've created a
linked list which can be easily added to
the loads content in dynamically or you
know easily using Ajax in jQuery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
