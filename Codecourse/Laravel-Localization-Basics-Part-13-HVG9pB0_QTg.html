localization with laravel now
localization is the ability to basically
translate page content based on the
user's locale and the locale will be
something like en or de depending on
whether you know what's been selected
English German Spanish whatever and in
this series we'll look at adding
translations to laravel so we can switch
between locales and basically see these
new languages take effect so let's first
of all go ahead and install laravel
using composer so we use PHP composer pH
AR and we say create project laravel
laravel and prefer the distribution okay
so now that's installed let's go ahead
and open this in our browser and just
take a look at what this looks like so
we've got this laravel directory here
and public you can see we've got the
default laravel page let's go ahead and
open this up now Brown in our text
editor the first thing we'll do is
remove the default hello dot PHP view
under the views folder so we've got this
hello dot PHP view here which you can
see in the browser we'll go ahead and
we'll get rid of this we don't need to
see this and we're going to create a new
view and we'll go ahead and call this
home upload PHP so we can take advantage
of the blade templating engine now also
going to need to modify the root file to
render this view instead of the one we
just deleted so let's head over to
rootstock PHP and we'll change this just
to home so if we go ahead and enter some
test content in here say hello and we
check this out in our browser you can
now see we've got the text hello here
now we're going to look inside the app
Lang folder and we'll see that we
already have some languages in here so
we've got this en directory we've got
pagination reminders and validation
these are just what laravel uses as
default for things like the validation
system and obviously for pagination and
reminders as part of the authentication
system now these are simple arrays with
key value pairs
and the key is the identifier for the
translation Tex and this is what we use
to identify it when we want to output
something to the user we also need to
use the names of these files when we're
calling translated text so you need to
choose the files wisely break them up
into sensible sections when you start to
use more and more translations it's
going to make it a lot easier to find
what you're looking for and obviously
laravel has already done that for us
because pagination reminders and
validation you know you can just guess
what they're for so let's create a
greetings PHP file inside of this en
folder so we'll call this
greetings dot PHP and we'll save that so
we obviously open up PHP tags and we
return this array and inside of here if
we pull this down for readability I'm
going to enter hello and this is just
going to be hello now let's create a
language folder for the German language
so we need to create a new folder in
here and we'll call that de and then
we'll create a new file with exactly the
same name inside of here so we'll call
this greetings
PHP will do exactly the same thing so we
could go ahead and copy and paste this
and instead of Hello write hello now we
need to learn how to access these
translations to output them to our user
so over in our home view that we created
earlier we're going to output something
using the double bracket syntax and
we're going to output trans and then
choose the name of first of all the file
and then the actual translation key in
this case we know it's in greeting stop
PHP so we choose greetings dot and then
the name of the key in this case it's
hello so over the browser and refresh
you see this works in exact work it's
showing the exact same thing now the
reason it's automatically preferring en
is because inside of config and app if
you scroll down over it so you can see
that the location
is set en by default if I was to change
this to de you can see these changes to
the German equivalent now it's good idea
to sort of point out that we have this
fallback locale as well and this works
really well if the locale that supply
doesn't actually exist or the actual
translation doesn't exist inside the
file so we will fall back to the English
version so that's really really useful
now we've used the trans helper function
to actually output this in here but it's
good to know that this is actually part
of the land model and we can use lang
and the static it method to get this as
well it just so happens that using trans
as the helper function makes it super
easy and quick especially when you're
outputting lots of text and it's all
translated now we're going to look at
using the set locale method to actually
set the locale inside of our application
so we're going to head over to the roots
PHP file and use the trans set locale
method and choose our actual the locale
now ordinarily you'd do this somewhere
else maybe in your filters folder
filters file inside before or something
like that depending on where this is
coming from it could be probably coming
from like a session or a cookie that's
been set or the users preference so here
we'll say Lang set locale just to test
we'll put it inside of our view and
we'll choose the locale obviously in
this case we've got two folders de and
en so I'm going to choose de so now
we'll see that this will change from
hello to hollow instead so that's how we
set the locale we've learnt how to
create translation files inside of the
LAN folder and we've learned how to out
put them in a view</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
