branching including merging branches now
branching is the process of creating a
new pointer that allows you to literally
branch off and work on the same code but
in a safe environment where you're
pretty much free to do what you want
mess it up if you like because you can
discard the changes of that branch and
if you're happy you can merge it into
another branch so sometimes this concept
can be a little hard to understand but
we'll demonstrate exactly how we can
branch switch branches discard branches
and merge branches this will make your
work flow a lot better since you can
switch what you're working on quickly
and easily and it also makes this
process really quick since you're not
duplicating your entire project code in
order to branch off and this is partly
why gear is so popular because it
handles one of the most important
aspects of development really really
quickly another version control software
all code this sometimes copied in order
to branch off and you can imagine this
would take a while so we've decided we
want to branch off to create a new
feature of our hello world application
you can use the git branch command to
create a new branch like like so so git
branch and I'm going to create a new
branch called hello England there we are
now we're not actually on this new
branch if you run git status you'll see
that we're still on the master branch
and as we've said previously master is
just the default branch that we have now
if you want when you're creating your
new branch you can provide the be flag
like so and that will automatically
switch you to the new branch that you
create but let's switch over to our
hello England branch manually we use the
git checkout command for this so we say
git checkout and then the name of the
branch like so and we get a confirmation
here saying that we've switched to the
branch we can also confirm this using
git status now we can do whatever we'd
normally do create modify remove files
make commits as normal and let's do that
and create a new file
so let's create England HTML and let's
go ahead and modify this to say hello
England so let's commit this change or
add this change in first so if we run
git status we get this so do a git add
we do a commit here so we've committed
this change let's just switch back over
to github just to look at our list of
branches in this case we still only see
the master branch despite the fact that
we've already created the hello England
branch and this is because we've not yet
pushed the changes we've made on that
particular branch to github so let's go
ahead and do this quickly
this time we use git push origin and
then the name of the new branch instead
of master so in this case it's hello
England and there we go so let's take a
look on github now and you'll notice we
have this new branch now in terms of
merging branches we can actually
automatically do this on github
we're going to stick to the command line
so we can learn how to do it there first
because it's likely that you'll be
creating branches locally and you want
to merge them into same master or
another branch and then go ahead and
push these up let's quickly though check
out how we switch back to our master
branch just because this can be a little
bit confusing particularly if you've
used the be flag and you've not known
any different so we just use git
checkout master so we can switch back to
the master branch although we've added
and committed files in the other branch
when we run git status you can see that
we are now on that branch so if we do a
hello England check out that takes us
back to our hello England branch now the
good thing about branching is what we
could actually do is switch back over to
the hello England branch and create a
branch off of that hello England branch
and we could create another bunch of
that you can create branches you know as
much as you want and this is what's
great about geeks it makes this so
flexible
but now let's learn how we merge hello
England into master so we've created am
well our master branch sits there we've
created our hello England branch now we
want to merge it into master on the
command line and then push the changes
up so let's go ahead and do this now and
just the side now you can see all
branches that you currently have open by
just running the it branch command so
let's now use git merge and then the
name of the branch that we want to merge
in this case it's hello England remember
we are on master right now sorry now
we're not we are on hello England so
let's switch over to master and then
let's merge hello England into that so
we've merged it in with merge the
changes in so because we are obviously
already in our master branch we can head
over to sublime text and see that we
have this hello England file in here now
we it can actually delete the hello
England branch because we don't actually
need it so we can say get branch d hello
England like so and that's deleted so
let's now push our changes to github
using git push origin master and that's
going to head and push them changes so
now you can see that on the master
branch we now have that new file
you'll also notice that the message we
have up here earlier about pulling up
doing a pull request has gone so we
don't need to merge this on get up
anymore because we've done it locally
now despite the fact that we've done
this you can still see that we've got
this hello England branch on github so
obviously that's the downside of doing
this on the command line because now the
branch did exist because we haven't push
the changes back up so to delete this we
just do git push origin the delete flag
and then the name of the branch and
there we go let's just check this out
and there we go
it's gone so we've now learned how to
create switch merge and delete branches
with git</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
