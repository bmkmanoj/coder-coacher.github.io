allowing a user to connect their dropbox
account with our application so we can
do things like upload files to their
Dropbox folder and also download files
as well as well as a host of other
things that you can do using the Dropbox
API now in the current state that you
can see within my browser my account is
actually connected if I head it over to
sequel pro and just refresh there you
can see that I'm storing my Dropbox
token which gives me access to the API
to this code Court app which I've
created which we'll look at in just a
moment now what's happening here is
every time we access a page that
requires Dropbox functionality in this
case it's just index.php that we're
going to be working on it's going to
check this token and if that isn't
available it's going to redirect us off
to Dropbox to authorize now the way I've
set up this test application is very
much how you wouldn't do it within your
project you'd obviously have some kind
of structure to your application
depending on the kind of framework
you're using or just really how you've
set up your application but you can take
what we learn and you can implement it
into your application have methods for
checking if a user is connected methods
for returning the client which we use to
access this functionality so let me just
invalidate my token we can either just
set it to some random text or set it to
a null value or empty value and
currently on the index file I'm I'm
returning the client or I'm actually
creating a variable which stores the
Dropbox client and if that can't be
accessed you can see that this time
because I've just invalidated my token
it's redirecting me off to Dropbox and
we're going through the oauth2 process
to obtain a token and then that's going
to be stored here for future use so I
can either cancel this which we're not
handling but that's pretty
straightforward
or I can allow it and what that's going
to do is it's going to return me back to
the authorized return
URL and that's obtained a token and
stored it within my account and now
rather than being redirected off we can
use any of the functionality to access
uploading files downloading files
whatever we need to do so in this video
then we're actually going to look at
setting up the PHP SDK for Dropbox very
very straightforward just a simple
composer download we're going to be
setting up our app on Dropbox providing
the keys
connecting the user and going through
this process to authenticate them as
well as storing it in the database so
let's get going and do that so we can do
some really cool things with Dropbox so
before we get started then you're going
to need a Dropbox account so go ahead
and sign up if you haven't already and
then what we're going to do is head over
to the developers area where we can
create an app so this app is going to
give us some keys which will allow us to
authorize the user your app basically
represents exactly what it says which is
your actual application so once we've
hit create app it asks us what type of
app we want to create now we're not
going to be using drop-ins and we're not
going to be talking about them what we
are going to use is the Dropbox API app
and this allows us to use the sink API
datastore or core API and this is the
one that we want so it asks us what type
of data we need to store we can either
use data stores which we're not going to
be going into but they're quite
interesting if you want to have a look
we're interested in files here so we can
actually take files from our application
and store them in a user's Dropbox and
it says can your app be limited to its
own folder this depends on if you need
to access files already on the user's
Dropbox by picking a specific folder
maybe a users already created a folder
but in our case what we're going to be
doing is within the app directory you
can see at the moment I've got this
opening my text editor apps that will
sit within your core Dropbox folder and
we'll have a folder created of our
application name that stores files and
usually this is okay
so we want to provide a app name in this
case I'm just going to choose code
course if the name of the app you are
trying to create already exists it will
alert you so you won't be able to create
an app that already exists in terms of
its name and there's not really much
here that we need to set up the only
thing we need to concentrate on is the
redirect URI we're not allowing implicit
grants you can read about that more if
you hover over this I so we're going to
disallow this it does mention if your
application doesn't use the implicit
grant flow it's safer to disallow it
entirely we can also generate an access
token if we want to we're not going to
be doing that because we're going to be
doing that on a user basis and you can
use web hooks as well so we need to
figure out where we're going to redirect
the user once they've clicked that allow
button on that OAuth process so we need
to create a few files within this
Dropbox API folder you can see at the
moment in here I'm just on index dot PHP
which happens to just be an empty file
and we also have to have here an empty
files folder which we're going to be
storing files later down the series
which we can copy to the user's Dropbox
account so what we want to do then is
create a new file here which is going to
be the point which I'll use a lands on
in order for us to authenticate them so
I'm just going to call this Dropbox
underscore finish PHP I'm doing this on
a file by file basis just to make it a
little bit easier for this tutorial but
you'd likely have some kind of routing
system maybe forward slash Dropbox
finish or something like that and that
passes you after maybe a controller and
then you can do this in a really nice
clean way so now we know the location of
the endpoint that we're going to end up
our this is Dropbox underscore finish
PHP we can copy this URL and just paste
it in so we can use HTTP for localhost
but if you look at the placeholder here
it says that it must be an HTTP if it's
live
so if you are doing this live you're
going to need to have HTTPS to be able
to do this so if we hit add there that's
been added so that now is an authorized
redirect to your I and we can carry on
with the rest of it so we're going to be
creating a new folder in this directory
and we're going to call this app and
we're going to have a fold it in a file
inside of here sorry called
start PHP and that's basically going to
set up the API parse all the information
that we need so we can actually connect
the API art we need to actually pull
down the PHP SDK for Dropbox to be able
to actually use this and this makes
things a lot easier so I'm going to
create a composer JSON file and we're
going to require in as a dependency drop
box slash drop box SDK and we'll pull in
1.1 got star here so you can find this
over on the Dropbox github page and you
can see a little bit more about it here
as well as look at some examples
and it's obviously available on packages
we're going to be downloading this with
composer so at the moment we're pulling
in one but one star set anything with
one but one but then incremental
versions up here and you will obviously
need composer installed if you don't
already head over to get composer to org
to download it so over an hour terminal
then we want to install that dependency
so we just run compose it install wait
for that to finish and that shouldn't
take too long so it's pretty quick now
we have the ability to include this in
you'll notice that we have our vendor
folder created with this in here and you
can go ahead and browse the code if it
helps it's quite useful to take a look
at it so inside of start then we want to
require the base directory here and we
want to go back one intervention or
toload composers autoloader
if you're familiar with composer this
will make complete sense too but
basically what we're doing here if
you're not familiar with composers we're
pulling in all the dependencies and
configuration that we set inside of
composer JSON in our case it's just
pulling in the Dropbox SDK so I also
want to do is I want to start sessions
and I want to fake a user being signed
in so user ID equals one so within your
authentication system you would
obviously be able to however you're
doing this access the current users ID
that signed in and this is important
because when it comes to creating our
users table inside of this database we
need to be able to store the token there
for future use otherwise every time a
user accesses our application we're
going to have to ask them to real thin
skate with Dropbox and that's pretty
annoying so now that we've done that
we're going to define some API details
now Dropbox is namespaced under Dropbox
so all we need to do is every time we
call our class under Dropbox we just use
the Dropbox root namespace so what we're
going to do here is just quickly create
some variables Dropbox key that's going
to be a string and we have a Dropbox
secret and we can find them within our
application area and we also want to
give this an app name as well this just
identifies your app and the version so
I'm going to call this code course 1.0
so over in our Dropbox area here our
developer console we can grab our app
key so let's copy that and just paste it
into here and let's copy this as well
and just paste that into there so now
what we can do is call the app info
class passing in the Dropbox key passing
in the Dropbox secret and then we can go
ahead and use the web or class to
authenticate so app info is going to be
a new Dropbox / app info
this takes two parameters or arguments
which is Dropbox key and Dropbox secret
so if we go over to index now and we
require in that file that we've just
edited at that's the apps forward slash
star table PHP we don't see anything but
L sorry let's go to index there we go so
we've now got our index page and that
should all be good so let's carry on now
another thing that we need to do is when
we're authenticating we have a
cross-site request forgery token that we
generate and that allows to prevent
against cross-site request forgery
attacks by validating it when you send
your user to Dropbox so much like you'd
find on a forum somewhere this just
helps prevent cross-site request forgery
so we want to store a cross-site request
forgery token so I'm going to call this
cross-site request forgery token store
and that's going to be a new under
Dropbox array entry store and this takes
again where you're storing this and then
the type of token you're accessing in
this case all asking for in this case
it's Dropbox or cross-site request
forgery token and we can use that to
validate a little bit later on so now
what we want to do is define the auth
details remember we've provided the app
info so we've got that stored now we
need to actually set up web
authentication so it's a new Dropbox web
or and in here we pass the app info
which we provided up here we pass in our
app name now we need to in here pass the
redirect URI for when the user finishes
and we know what that is because we
pasted it in here just a moment ago so
we can actually copy this again and just
paste it into there now all of this
information will probably be better
stored in some kind of
within your application just so it's
easier to change obviously at the moment
we're doing things very procedurally but
you'd want to go ahead and tidy this up
so we're going to store the cross-site
request forgery token store or past the
cross-site request forgery
token store variable in there so now
that we've done that what do we need to
do well the first thing I want to do
before anything is actually create our
users table and create a user on here
and then we'll go ahead and connect to
our database so I'm going to create a
user's table you probably already have
one and I'm going to store in this case
just a user name that will be a VAR
child say 20 and we want to store our
Dropbox token here as well and I'll just
set this to Avatar 2 5 5 but it is much
smaller and this might be better in
another table as well and you might want
to join this in order to check it that's
absolutely fine for simplicity we'll put
it in the same table so now that we have
that structure set up let's just create
our user name we've now got an ID of 1
remember we store that just up here and
we have an empty put a Dropbox token so
we've got nothing in there and that's
absolutely fine for now so let's set up
a connection to our database let's use
PDO for this and our driver is going to
be MySQL the host is localhost the
database name is site and we have root
and root so user name and password
so let's now grab the user details just
so we can check our Dropbox token if it
exists so we'll do a quick prepared
statement on our table so let's select
everything from the users table where
the ID of the user is user ID so this is
a placeholder here what we can then do
is execute that so user execute and we
can pass in the name of the placeholders
key in this array and then the value
which is obviously coming from our
session and then we can set user to user
fetch object and that will give us an
object back with the user details so if
we were to do a var dump of user you
will see that that will contain let's
just double check this that of course
sorry I used a comma here so that should
give us back the user details so we've
got an ID one username of Alex and
Dropbox token of null so we can use that
to check if the token exists and if not
send the user off to Dropbox so we'll do
that within another file in app again
you probably wouldn't do this in reality
it would be some kind of method or
function just to check the status and
what we're going to do here is set a
client variable which is going to be
accessing the Dropbox API in order for
us to upload and do all the cool stuff
like that so we'll call this Dropbox or
PHP and we won't put anything in there
just yet but on the index page we're
going to require that in so app Dropbox
or PHP and that will allow us to on any
page that we want to do some kind of
thing with the client so upload or
whatever we can just include this file
so this file is going to number one
check if the user has a Dropbox token if
they don't have a Dropbox token or if
the token is invalid and that's really
important we can send them off to the
author URL which we saw at the start of
the video now
why would use and not have a valid
access token surely if they've gone
through the process of authenticating
coming back we've stored the token and
everything should work right well what
if they go into their settings in their
Dropbox account and remove your
application that means that they no
longer are tied to your application they
would have to real thent okay and that
is when a token would be invalid so it's
good to think about these things if you
use a remove
your app from their settings and they
come back to app they should have the
real authentic eight so what we're going
to do in here then is we're going to
check if user Dropbox token is available
and if it is we want to get the client
and we'll do that a little bit later on
but for now if they don't we want to
generate an author URL and redirect them
to that URL now we're going to have a
little bit of duplication here again
this is what I said normally in an
application you'd extract the what we're
doing in else to a method just so it's
easier to call from anywhere else in
your application but for now because
we're just learning about this stuff
we'll just duplicate our code up and
you'll see what I mean in a minute if
that doesn't make sense
so web auth start
and remember web auth is what we
provided in the start file just here so
that's the new web off passing all our
details including the redirect URI so
star is going to return us with a URL to
access our or just to start the OAuth
process so we can just say header
location and append on or through our L
and we can just exit the page there so
when we visit index now we've set up our
app in start we are using Dropbox Earth
which is essentially acting as a method
to check if the user is authenticated
with this otherwise we're going to
redirect them off so we should now see
us redirected off to Dropbox perfect so
what we're going to do here is click
allow and see what data we get back so
you can see we've come back to Dropbox
finish PHP we know that should be the
case we've got a state here and the
state is actually the cross-site request
forgery token and these need to match in
order to be able to authenticate us just
so we're protecting against cross-site
request forgery and the code here is
what we're going to use to obtain our
token so what we need to do then is a
little bit more work over on Dropbox
finish because we're not actually doing
anything with the
data that's been sent back here so this
is no longer going to works B we have
we're going to have an invalid token now
because they're generated obviously as
we come back so let's go over to index
dot PHP and just leave this where it is
for a moment we can always refresh that
page so on the Dropbox finish then we
want to require in app start so we can
use the functionality we've already
built in there
and we're going to call the finish
method on web auth so over in Dropbox
off with we're using web auth to start
the process and here we want to finish
the process so for that we use web auth
finish and we pass in where this deep
where these details are coming from so
the token and the code and in this case
they're coming from yet and what we're
going to do is we're going to use lists
to actually list out what we want back
from this method so in this case it's
just the access token so we now have
access to an access token variable which
has been returned from this finish
method taking into account the details
that we've brought back so we can now
store that token into the database to
use for future requests to the API so
let's create a query or a prepared
statement here so we're going to say
insert into rather not insert we want to
update users set drop box underscore
token equals drop box token that's one
placeholder and we obviously want to do
that where the user ID is the currently
signed in user so now we want to execute
that passing in them variables so we'll
say drop box token is that access token
we've got back and the user ID is
obviously from our session our fake
logged in user
and then we'll just redirect the user
back to index.php so you can obviously
do anything you want here but the basics
of it are this and the storing so now
let's actually go back to say our index
page
we've been redirected hit allow and we
come back it might take a little while
so we're just doing a few authoring or
authorization stuff and it looks like
we're getting redirected straight back
and that's probably because something
that's gone wrong and it's not storing
our token so it's redirecting itself
back so we've probably made a mistake
somewhere let's just check this and
there we go for a comma just in there so
that query would have failed so let's
try this just again let's go back to our
app over to index.php hit allow and
there we go so we're now landed on
index.php we're not being redirected
back to Dropbox anymore because that
token exists but what happens if this
token is invalid well in this case
what's going to happen with what we've
currently got in Dropbox auth is we're
checking if the user has a Dropbox type
token but we're not getting the client
and therefore we can't validate that the
token is actually correct so we need to
do this now and by using by creating a
variable that holds the client we're
then able to use methods to upload and
stuff like that so we'll say client
equals new Dropbox client and in here we
need to pass in the Dropbox token
remember that's coming from the users
Dropbox token field so in this case we
can just say user Dropbox token we need
to pass in our app name remember that
was stored in here as a variable this
just goes to show that the configuration
route is a lot better because you don't
have to have all these variables
floating around everywhere and we also
want to define the character encoding in
this case I'm going to choose utf-8 so
this in itself won't error so if for
example I was
to either remove this token or just make
it invalid so I've just removed a big
chunk of that you'll notice that we
won't actually get an error because
we're not actually sending any requests
to the API we've created our client but
we're not sending any requests so how do
we send a request to the API well we
just use the client so we say client for
example yet account info if you need a
hand finding out which methods are
available they're documented really
really nicely on the Dropbox website but
otherwise you can just head over to
client dot PHP and you can see a list of
the methods in here so for example in
our case we have let's just however to
get account info and there it is so that
creates the request and returns JSON
with the response body so how do we know
if this is going to error well it will
error now we'll see we'll get a message
but we'll get an uncaught exception so
there we go we've got an uncaught
exception and this is the exception name
is exception invalid access token which
we know because I just removed a chunk
of it so now what we can do is we can
wrap this in a try-catch to actually
catch that exception and then do
something so let's copy and paste this
exception name and just paste that into
here and we'll call that e we don't
really need to do anything with this
because we know the nature of the
exception that's been thrown so what we
want to do is if it is an invalid access
token we want to do the same as we've
done here so again I'm duplicating code
here it's really important to note that
this is not a good idea you want to
extract this to some kind of method or
function to be able to just call this
whenever you need to start the
authentication process so we're doing
exactly the same thing here but the
client is now available to us if this
doesn't error so let's check this out
when I hit index.php that's
automatically going to throw that
exception redirect us back off to code
course the app to validate
so I hit allow that's going to redirect
me back the same thing that we've
already seen and we're now storing a
valid access token so let's just take a
little peek at this account info here
you could go ahead and store this
account info if you wanted to in the
database just to keep it on your end but
let's just play around with this so we
know we have access to this client
variable now because we've included it
in Dropbox auth so I can say now get
account info that will error if we
output it so we need to do a var dump on
this or a print R and you'll now see my
account information so we have got a
display name which is my full name my
user ID whether my email address has
been verified if I'm part of a team my
country my email useful things like that
if you were if you need them but in the
next video we're going to look at lis
uploading files to the users Dropbox
account at this point it's also good to
know that this code course folder has
automatically been created within my
Dropbox account so if you are following
along
check out the apps folder within your
Dropbox account and you should now see a
folder name relating to your application
name let's go ahead now in the next
video and look at uploading files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
