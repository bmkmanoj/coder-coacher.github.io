code you are going to need a couple of
things the first thing is a web server
and the second thing is you need PHP
downloaded and installed ready to go on
your web server now we can do this
manually but it takes a little bit more
time I would encourage you to eventually
try to set this up yourself but just so
we can make things a little bit easier
for ourselves we're going to be using a
predefined package that installs
everything for us and this is WAMP
server so what this will do is once
we've downloaded and install this it
will install Apache PHP and MySQL for us
so Apache is our web server this just
means that we can visit a page on our
computer and basically serve all the
files that we're going to be writing and
then of course PHP is attached to that
as well so we can write PHP now MySQL is
a piece of database software which we're
not going to be diving into but we do
have other courses on that so when you
get to that then you'll have my sq are
ready to go so there's a couple of
things that we need to do before we
start to install WAM server on windows
this is a little bit more tricky there's
a bit more setup than other operating
systems so let me talk you through that
now so you are ready to go and follow
the rest of the course ok so if we head
over to the download section this is
basically where you are going to
download WAMP
either choose the 64 bit or 32 bit
version depending on your computer but
before we do this I just want to point
to you the SourceForge page for Wham
this is just where WAMP is basically
stored ready for download so there's a
file here called readme.txt what I'll do
is I'll leave a link to this in the
course links so you can find this readme
far a little bit easier it's a little
bit difficult to find and I'm going to
go ahead and open this and I'm just
going to guide you through some of the
things that you're going to need to do
before you install WAMP so let's just
take a look at this once it's finished
okay so that's finished and it's just
open this text file here so this is a
little bit annoying but what you're
going to have to do is down here each of
these links you're going to need to
visit
and you're going to need to install all
of these files this is just the visual
see packages that you'll need for WAMP
to run so you'll need this one here and
these two and these two here from this
link and same with here and same with
here so this does take a little bit of
time but you're only going to need to do
this once so like I said I'll leave a
link to that file in the course link so
you can very easily find this and once
you've installed all of them we're ready
to go and install Wow so I already have
this downloaded so I'm just going to
open up here and I'm going to just guide
you through the installation if you're a
little bit new to this kind of stuff so
let's go ahead and allow this and we'll
wait for this to pop up we're going to
choose this go ahead and read that and
accept it and of course there are some
notices here as well let's go ahead and
hit next we want to install it in C
colon backslash WAMP which is important
because this is where we're going to
eventually be writing on orally saving
all of our PHP files so let's go ahead
and say next and next and then go ahead
and wait for this to install so once
this has installed we're going to take a
look around where this has been
installed and I'm going to talk to you
in the next video about how we create
our first PHP file so let's go ahead and
wait for this to finish and we'll be
back in just a moment okay so that has
finished and what it's now asking us is
do we want to use a different browser
than Internet Explorer now this doesn't
really matter because throughout the
series we are going to be accessing this
on our own from which ever browser we
want and also in the next part going to
talk about which text editor we're going
to be using so what I'm going to do is
just press no here and then when it asks
me about the default editor I'm going to
press no as well so let's wait for this
to just finish up and then like I said
before what this is going to do is start
Apache for us it's also going to start
MySQL so if you did want to dive into
databases in another series on code
course you can go ahead and do that as
well so again let's just wait for this
all to finish and then we'll be ready to
go okay so that has all finished let's
go next and finish the installation and
you now have a patch
and PHP installed and you're ready to go
so before we do anything let's just head
over to this PC depending on the version
of Windows you're using go ahead and
open this and you'll see a new WAMP
directory just in here so now that we
hopefully have that all installed
hopefully didn't have any problems we
can go on to the next part and look at
creating our first PHP file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
