more simple than strings since we
haven't arrived at the arithmetic
section yet what we'll do is take a look
at an example of using these data types
and explain pretty much what happens
when we echo them out so we already know
that how we store a simple integer is
something like the following so days in
week is 7 or you can store your age
anything that is a whole number now an
integer is a whole number even if it's
negative and this includes 0 so an
integer a valid integer is a 0 a valid
integer is a minus 5 a minus 100 a minus
1000 this is a valid integer so we call
this an integer now floats are similar
and these simply include any number with
a decimal point we already know that
these are known as floating point
integers doubles or real numbers so they
can call them anything but to be honest
most of the time you'll hear them called
floats so a good example of a float and
a kind of common example is pi so 3.14
one just as a very short float there we
go that is now a float so we can perform
calculations or more appropriately
arithmetic on integers and floats which
is why they're different to strings we
can't add strings up but we can
concatenate them but with floats and
integers we can add things up and do
anything we want divide multiply and of
course we'll be taking a look at this
later when we cover cover arithmetic now
just before we come away from floats and
talk about what we do when we echo these
out or you use them elsewhere you can
also use an e to donate very large
values so for example if we wanted to
define 1.2 million so let's create a
bank balance value we would say 1.2 and
then e 6 so we know that that's going to
create a value of 1.2 million because we
have 6 in there for this the amount of
zeros so let's go ahead and aircrack
bank balance just here go over to the
browser and you can see one two hundred
and then zero zero zero so we've got 1.2
million ok so what we're now going to do
is cover what happens when we come out
these numbers now we've already seen an
example of echoing this out we would
kind of think that a string would be
able to echo out but with a float this
wouldn't quite work but we know in this
case that we literally just see text
when we output a value now as I said
before there are certain data types that
we can't echo out but for numbers these
are essentially just changed to strings
when we try and echo them out so we
already know that we can just echo out a
string what we can also do is
concatenate on float values concatenate
on integer values so for example we know
that we have a string we can catenate on
a value and I'm gonna say your bank
balance is and then I came from just
include a pound or a dollar sign there
and you can see that we get that result
so it's very very flexible like I said
before PHP is a loosely typed language
which means you can use different
variable types within each others and
you'll generally find that things just
work so that is integers and floats
there's not really much more to cover if
you're getting into kind of advanced
scientific things there's probably more
to learn but really just for now know
that you can define out a value like
this you can define out a value like
this you could even do 1.2 million like
that and it would just work in exactly
the same way we can concatenate it onto
strings we can output it as we normally
would and of course later on we're going
to look at how we use arithmetic to
change numbers by using mathematical
operators on them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
