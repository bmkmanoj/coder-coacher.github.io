user model the relationships between the
users based on this friends tables this
user ID and friend ID and also whether
it has been accepted and then what we're
going to do is manually add some rows in
here just so we can get a list of Alex's
friends and then we can go ahead and get
a list of Billy's friends so we'll just
tie these up to the three users that we
currently have so to start with in what
we're going to do is over on our user
model we can actually create these
relationships so under models and user
let's go down and start to create these
so the first one is going to be a
relationship which is a belongs to many
relationship for users based on the
friends table that's going to be the
friends of that user then we're gonna
have another method which is going to be
users who have this user as a friend so
it's kind of like a two-way thing your
friends and then who has you as a friend
and this way we can kind of combine
everything and work out who who's
friends with who so let's start with the
first one we're gonna call this friends
of mine and in here we're gonna return
this belongs to many so we have a
relationship here and of course we have
chatty models user so this is the user
model but we are tying this relationship
to this to the user model so we're
relating it to itself basically the
pivot table is friends we've just
created that table and we're matching
these up by the user ID and then the
friend ID is our foreign key so we have
this relationship created this remember
is friends of that user now we want
users who have this user as a friend so
we're going to say public function
friend-off I'm gonna do pretty much the
same thing so this belongs to many we're
gonna have the same model in here
obviously the same pivot table this time
though it's gonna be a little bit
different it's gonna be the other way
around so friends ID or friend ID and
usual ID so we've got a two-way
relationship here which will give us the
flexibility we need to work out who's
friends with who who isn't friends with
who a list of our friends etc so now we
want a general method for the current
users friends or at least represented by
this user model so we're just gonna have
a method that name that makes sense
which is just friends so here this is a
little bit different remember inside of
our table we have accepted it's a user
ID could for example be one friend ID
could be two so alex has added dial as a
friend Dale might not have accepted so
accepted would be zero to start with
then when she does accept then we have a
condition in here to only pull back
accepted friends so we're gonna write
out this now and then we're gonna test
what kind of data we get through from
this so gonna say return this friends of
mine so remember this friends of mine
here is the friends of this user and
we're gonna say we're hither so that's
the pivot table which is the friends
table accepted it's true so it's pulling
back friends of this user where the user
has accepted now it works in the same it
kind of works in two ways because if for
example let's go back to users table if
Alex adds Dale that will be user ID one
and then user ID too so that would mean
that Alex's friends is Dale but
then not friends with Alex even though
they are technically both friends now so
we need to merge in the other side of
the relationship so we end up with you
know Dale being friends with Alex
even though Alex handed Dale otherwise
we're just going to end up with you know
Alex being friends with Dale and taoism
friends with Alex so hopefully that
makes sense what we do is from this way
accepted equals true we get these
results which is a collection now and
then we merge in the friend of
relationship so we just say this friend
of and again we say we're accepted it's
true and we get that result and this
should be where so we need to test this
out so we're going to find a location we
can output a list of the users friends
and when best to do that then the user
profile so only user profile we have
profile to index we can actually just go
ahead and do this straightaway so we
head over to our resources views profile
index you can actually output a list of
the friends here so if we have a 8 and
h4 here and we say user get first name
or user name friends so let's just
preview this I think we have that method
available
yes Alex's friends and then down here
we're gonna loop through that new
friends method that we've created so
what we do is a quick if statement to
check if we do actually have any friends
so we have an else and an end if here
the condition is if not user friends
count you can just a little bit
differently if you want then we're just
going to say
user get first name or user name has no
friends now otherwise what we can just
check this at the moment I shouldn't
have any friends and you can see here
that because we're accessing there's a
relationship it's giving me an error
because I've put friends ID rather than
friend ID so it's just quickly fix that
up now so to find out where that is here
so friends ID we need to change that and
then this should work so Alex has no
friends so now what we want to do is we
want to loop through the friends so we
can say for each and end that for each
user friends as user and then in here
remember we have our user block template
so we can include that so user partials
user block so let's check this out we
still should see no friends but what we
can now do is we can manually add a
friend in and we can keep an eye on the
results here and we can even go ahead
and keep an eye on the results for diet
as well so Dale's profile let's go ahead
and just duplicate this and go over to
two users so we'll keep an eye on both
of these and then we can even add a
third user to test them as well so over
in users we've got user ID one and two
so if we add in one and two there if we
hit enter still don't have any friends
and we still don't have any friends here
either because this hasn't been accepted
that was the condition so if I change
that to accepted one we now have a
friend from for dial and a friend for
Alex now remember I said earlier and
just just so this is perfectly clear
when we did friends we merged in the
other relationship now if we hadn't have
done that so if we just get rid of that
this means that if Alex added Dale which
is the case here so Alex added Dale then
Dale is now
along with friends with Alex because you
know that doesn't make sense if you
think of it that way the other way
around this is to create two records but
it becomes incredibly complicated so
it's much easier to just create two
relationships and then merge them in
using one method so now we have that set
up let's just have a look and work this
out for another user
so for Billy if we make Billy friends
with Dale as well so three friends with
two and we accept it and Billy now has
down as a friend and Dale now has Alex
and Billy as a friend
and obviously Alex just has Dale as a
friend so that is our friends
relationship and outputting the list of
the users friends to the profile next
we'll just be looking at creating our
friends page which is going to one show
us a list of our current friends and
then eventually allow us to see our
friend requests</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
