with Forge and we're gonna take a look
at a few other things as well like the
nginx config we're gonna remove the
default site and create a new site which
is gonna work without domain and just
get this ready to go basically so once
you're on this screen within forge we're
gonna choose digital ocean just here so
we're creating a digital ocean server
and we're now gonna choose some of the
options here so the credentials it's
just personal there's no other option
we're gonna choose a name for this and
I'm just going to call this in stick
Adam II that's the name of the site I'm
using I'm using that domain as well and
the server size is really up to you I'm
just gonna choose the lowest one since
this is just an example but obviously
you can ramp it up if you need to you
can always upgrade this later
via digital oceans control panel so it
doesn't matter too much so the region
again choose the region that's closest
to your audience or the majority of your
audience we're not going to be talking
here about using a CDN which is a
content delivery network so I'm just
going to go ahead and choose London for
now so the database name you can change
we're gonna leave it at forge it doesn't
really matter you can you can change
this around if you want so you could
give it the same name as your business
or project or whatever let's just leave
this at forge for now so it's a lot
easier so there are a couple of other
options we can provision this is a load
balancer which we're not going to be
covering that just allows you to set up
load balancer really easily you can
install PHP seven as well if you want
you can store HH vm and Haque but again
we're gonna just leave all of these
options and just set this up in a very
basic way and you can also enable
backups which will enable backups on
digitalocean so you might want to go
over to the digitalocean
and just read about what that involves
so let's hit create server this is gonna
take quite a while to do and we can see
this building down here under active
servers and also recent events it's just
listening for events so basically what's
happening here is it is building and
then it will provision the server and
once this is done you'll see this go
green and then we can start to actually
do all of the fun stuff with it so give
it a while wait for this to finish will
pick up in just a second so hopefully
now your server has
fully built and provisioned what we can
now do is go ahead and look more into
detail now you should have also got an
email through with some information
about the server the IP address the
username you're used to log in via SSH
and also the sudo password and the
database username and password as well
so keep this handy we'll be using it a
little bit later to go ahead and SSH
into the server so in terms of actually
managing this server then we can either
click this button here we can go up to a
list of the servers we have so into the
detail of them we're going to just take
a quick look around here as to what we
have so the site's here we're going to
be modifying this in just a moment these
are basically just each kind of yeah it
says here each domain on your server so
we're just gonna be dealing with one but
obviously you can have multiple sites
served on one server usually not
recommended but we're just going to be
removing this default site and adding
insta Khadem EECOM as our main site we
also have this SSH key section which
allows us to add a public key and that
will allow us to SSH over we'll be
looking at doing that in the next part
we also have things like the scheduler
we can obviously run a command in this
case it's the artisan scheduled run
command and this will allow us to
basically run a cron job one cron job
and this will run laravel scheduler if
we want to set up any commands now we'll
go straight over to the network tab this
is pretty useful at the moment you can
see that we've got firewall rules for
HTTP and HTTPS obviously on port 80 and
443 and they said that this is allowed
from any IP address now what you can do
is if you're saying stalling
elasticsearch and you need to test this
locally what you can do is go ahead and
type in elastic search here type in say
nine 200 and then from IP address that
would be your IP address but for now
this is all we need we've got HTTP and
HTTPS setup and we can't access anything
else but them so we also have monitoring
so we can actually install monitoring so
for example New Relic we can use paper
trail and you know a couple of other
services here but
basically this we're not going to go
into but if it's if you need to do it's
there for example for New Relic you can
paste in your license key this will set
everything up on the server for you you
won't even need to go into your server
and then you can start monitoring your
server with New Relic we also have
things like meta as well which is like
the server metadata but again this is
not always going to be used for example
the max file upload size you can go
ahead and change this but the most
important thing we want to do is delete
this default domain so we're going to go
ahead and remove this I'm gonna create a
new one so if you already have a domain
we're gonna actually attach this later
on to this or pointless to this server
so my domain is inst academy.com and
it's important here that we type in the
actual domain for what we want to access
this from the reason for that is it
locked our nginx config which we'll look
at in a moment and it'll allow us to
respond to requests that come from insta
Khadem EECOM or whatever your domain
name is so let's go and click add site
you can allow wild card as well
subdomains as well and you can see
that's going to go ahead and installing
so we'll just wait for that to finish ok
so that's now setup now interestingly if
we grab the IP address from just up here
and we go ahead and try and access this
site now you'll see that we get a 404
not found and the reason for this is if
we head over to our nginx config we can
go over to our site here and we can
modify the engine X config for this site
so if we go to edit files and then edit
nginx config and we'll look at this site
area in just a moment it's slightly
different you can see the nginx config
is listening on port 80 and the service
in stick Adam e-comm now if you did want
to access it via the IP address
initially just go ahead and paste that
IP address in there and that's basically
gonna serve this here so this will be
found so if we just go and save this out
and if you ever want to restart nginx or
any other service you can go ahead and
do it down here so for example I could
restart nginx that's very quick so that
would just go ahead and restart and when
I hit this you see there we get this far
here now this is just a file that's
created by Forge when we first create
our server so we're gonna delete this
later obviously we don't this anyone to
be able to access this but you can see
now that by changing our nginx configure
we can access this by our I appeared by
the IP address but we can also access it
by the domain so what we're actually
going to be doing is we're gonna go back
over to our site section we're going to
ream we're going to change this nginx
config back over to insert academy.com
because we basically only want requests
be responded to from in stuck atom EECOM
so we can go ahead and save that out
again and again we can go and change our
or restart our nginx server as well so
we'll just go ahead and do that now
there we go so now we're going to go
over to sites and you'll notice that we
have servers and sites of what's the
difference well obviously a server is
just one physical I guess server and in
sites you can have multiple sites on one
server so you can have two different
domains two different web sites on one
server so this is where you manage your
sites and in here we've got stuff like
the ability to install a repository
we're not going to be doing that because
we're going to be installing the
repository later on on voya which is
going to deploy the files to this server
so you can actually install the
repository directly here and deploy from
here but we're not gonna be doing that
you've also got things like environment
as well but we're not going to be doing
that here either we're going to be doing
that on on fire
and you've got things like queuing up
workers SSL Certificates which is pretty
straightforward to go ahead and set up
and we've also got the meta which is
basically the web directory where things
are served I'm going to be modifying
this a little bit later because envoy
creates some different directories for
us so that is pretty much setting up a
server and a site on forge we're pretty
much now ready to go to start adding our
domain name so we can actually access
this server via in stick Adam e-comm or
whatever your domain name is then we can
go and look at setting up on voya
linking out github account in and
actually deploying any new changes to
this server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
