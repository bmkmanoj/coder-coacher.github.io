actually getting this email activation
working now so let's sir we've we've
used our mail test or PHP we don't want
that anymore so let's go ahead and
actually delete that there we go okay so
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a new field in my
database now if I click on users you can
see this username Billy that I
registered a moment ago I'm going to
click on the structure tab and this is
going to allow me to add a new column so
I'm going to add it after email click go
and the column is going to be email code
now this is going to be an md5 hash so
as we're doing with passwords but it's
going to be 32 characters a varchar'
data type so let's go ahead and save
that so we've now got this email code
field here if I browse at the moment
this is empty which is what we'd expect
because we still need to generate this
and place it in I'm going to go ahead
and delete this user because obviously
we've already gone through the
registration process before we've added
this functionality so what do we need to
modify well let's go ahead and get rid
of login dot PHP we don't actually need
to do anything with that register dot
PHP down here remember we're sending
this array of data so the username
password the first name to be put into
the into the database now what we need
to do is we need to add another data a
piece of data here and that is going to
be this this email code that we passed
through to an email and allow the user
to activate and obviously the reason we
passed this code through is because
otherwise the user would just be able to
you know type in their email address
into a URL bar and it would essentially
register their account we need some
unique field something or unique piece
of data so let's go ahead and do this so
I'm just going to pass a new piece of
data called email code and what was this
going to be well I'm going to wrap
anything that I send here in the md5
function and it's going to be the
username
Plus micro time now what that will do is
it will take the user name it will
append it to micro time so the current
time in milliseconds or I can't exactly
remember going go ahead and look it up
in the in the PHP manual you could of
course use date which would return the
current timestamp but either way doesn't
matter as long as something is unique
enough and then it will encrypt it you
know hash it essentially to an md5
string or hash so let's go ahead and
actually register a user account with
this and see what happens so we've got
nothing in the users table at the moment
I've deleted all of the users so let's
go ahead and register I'll just go ahead
and say Billy password we'll just P
password password again will just be
password obviously so Billy Garrett oops
and we'll go ahead and put the video PHP
academy' Dorgan click register
registered successfully click on the
users table and you'll now see we've got
this email code here okay so that's the
result of what we've just done and
that's placed that in there using the
function that we created earlier I won't
go back too much into that waste anytime
so we've stored this unique email code
what do we want to do well obviously
upon registering this user under the
register user function that we created
let's just go over to that now that's
here so below here we need to send an
email to the user containing the code
appended to a URL that they can just
click on so obviously I'm working
locally so I can't click through an
email on to localhost while I can but
I'm gonna you'll see my mail client
formats odd so we'll have to copy and
paste it anyway
but the point is here we want to send
the email so depending on how many
emails we're going to be sending out I'm
going to go ahead and create a separate
email function that's essentially going
to use the mail function within it but
it's going to include the header every
time if that doesn't make sense you'll
see in a moment
so in general dot php' I need to create
a function that's going to essentially
send an email now we've already seen
that mail is very simple I'm going to
simplify this even more the reason being
is that if I ever wanted to add any more
functionality to sending email I could
just go ahead and pop it right into this
function so the email is going to take
three parameters to subject and body and
inside we're going to have a static
header so we're going to use the mail
function as its intended so we're going
to pass through to subject body I'm
going to keep the headers the same every
time so I'll say hello at PHP academy'
dorg oops so really we're just
shortening this but again like I said if
we wanted to add any more functionality
to this email function later on then and
we never be using it across the site
will be a lot easier since I register
sorry inside users dot PHP in the
register user function we want to use
this email function that we've just
created now who do we want to send the
email to now remember we're passing this
register data array so we can access the
email okay
so here we want to send it to register
data email the subject we want to be
activate your account now notice here
I'm going to place the body in double
quotation marks as opposed to singles
the reason being is that we're going to
be using the backslash N and escape
character which will essentially not
escape character but it will format a
new line and then that's it so this will
be the body so let's just pull this down
for now and then we'll put it within one
line in a moment because you'll see that
using this will automatically create
line breaks for however many line breaks
you do within your editor so what do we
want to do what we want to say hello xx
is just going to be the users first name
you need to activate your account so use
the link below obviously you would write
something a lot nicer than this we would
then go would go down a couple more
lines the link would be here and then
would just say at the end like PHP
academy' or something like that so from
your company okay so hello something
who's this going to be well let's go
ahead and just break out of these of
this these double quotes if you look at
it on one line it makes more sense so we
have this string here we can catenate on
register user first name so we can
catenate in that on and let's let say
what let's just do it on one line it
just is going to make a lot more sense
with breaking out of these some of this
string so hello
first-name blah blah blah the link goes
up here there we go so it's going to
look a little messy but you know that's
that's ER that's just to be dealt with
and okay so hello something we need two
line breaks here so essentially creating
your paragraph you need to activate your
account to use the link below two more
line break so two more returns the link
goes here now what's the link can be in
fact we'll just do two more line breaks
there so the link here is going to be
HTTP colon forward slash your website
comm forward slash and we're going to be
creating a new page in aroma called
activate dot PHP so in my case it's
localhost
oops localhost /lr because that's the
directory directory that we're working
in here lr and that's going to be
forward slash activate PHP and we need
to pass some values to this URL and we
can pick these up using the the get
array of data so we need to send the
email so the email equals x
and email underscore code equals x so
where these X's are we need to replace
in the users email address so n string
concatenate on register data email and
ignore code equals again concatenate on
register data and remember we've just
added this so let's go back and just
refer to it anyway email underscore code
so we can now go ahead and say email
underscore code and then a couple of
line breaks and then how signing off so
let's just go ahead
oops just go ahead and pull this back up
there perfect so now this will send an
email to the users email address who
they're registering with or the email of
the registering with with this subject
in this body which we've just done so
let's go ahead and delete this user
account and actually register once again
I'm logged in here hopefully still
logged in those session expired as Billy
at PHP academy' dog so I'm going to
register with this email address and
hopefully we'll send this over to me if
I've made any mistakes so I type in my
username password that I want my first
name my last name and my email address I
click register
you've been registered successfully I go
and check my email and there we go so
we'll read that in just a moment but
obviously we need some kind of message
here just quickly to alert the user that
they need to activate their account so
let's go down and where are we the
success part of this that is where is it
there we go
you be majestic successfully please
check your email to activate your
account ok so the success message now
looks like this so please check your
email blah blah blah we go over we click
on this and there we go so this looks a
bit funny just the way my my mail client
roundcube
formats this but hello and we're missing
the first name we've got some extra
spaces here that we don't want so we'll
tidy this up in just a moment but you
can see here that this has placed the
email address in here successfully and
it's also placed this email code now
it's important that obviously this
matches what we have in our database so
this starts with a d1 and ends with a DA
so let's just check that and there we go
we've got D 1 and D a so now we can pass
these through to a script and check the
email matches the email code and then
set active to one relatively
straightforward ok so let's just go and
clear this up with regards to the
addressing the user and these extra
spaces and then we'll go ahead and paste
this paste this in okay so we're sending
it's that email that works we're saying
hello register user there we go register
data that needs to be yeah
I'm sure a lot of you spotted that we've
got an extra space there we also had an
extra space just there so let's go ahead
and delete this let's go ahead and
register again just to make sure it's
works I know this is a bit tedious but C
we don't want to leave ourselves with
any problems so again we just register
with all the same data had a million
times before click register and blah
blah blah over to our email INBOX
there we go this time hello Billy that's
fine no extra spaces perfect so now we
can continue well we've got one on there
but I'm going to ignore that for now I'm
sure you'll be able to sort that out so
we've got our new email code remember we
are concatenated the username in the
current time and then you know that's
going to be different every time because
the current time changes so that's this
is how this you this code is unique so
let's go ahead and just copy this and
paste it into our browser window the
user would basically click on this or
copy and paste it the same let's
duplicate this window paste that in
there and press Enter
object not found we haven't created our
activator PHP
Paige yet but we're going to be doing
that so we'll go ahead and we will
create this in the next part of the
