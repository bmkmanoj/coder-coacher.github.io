different types of loops but sometimes
you'll find yourself needing to break
out of a loop or continue or skip a loop
as you are doing them so if we do need
to break out of a loop or skip one we
can easily do this using two keywords
now let's quickly take a look at how
this works and then we'll dive into some
more practical examples so again just to
keep things really simple I'm going to
go ahead and bring back this really
simple array of course we've already
looked at more complex arrays but this
will kind of help us work out what's
going on now let's work with a for each
loop since we're using an array and this
is the simplest way to do it I'm going
to go through and for every name we're
going to loop so we know that we can
echo out inside of here let's go ahead
and add a break on as well okay so let's
go over to the browser have a look and
there we go
we already know how to do this now if I
were to use the break keyword just here
just have a thing guess what would
happen we know that this loop three
times for every item but if we break
here what is gonna happen is we're gonna
break out of the loop and of course
because there's no condition surrounding
this it will break us out after the
first loop so let's go ahead give that a
refresh and you can see that we only see
the name Alex so breaking out of a loop
will immediately exit and it will not
loop anymore we'll just go on to
whatever code we have written down here
so using this then we can wrap the break
inside of an if statement because we can
create if statements inside of these
blocks and really depending on what
we're trying to do this will allow us to
control how this loop works in a little
more detail so let's take a example of
findings of particular value within an
array now there are other ways that we
can do this but we'll use this as an
example so let's get rid of everything
we've written and let's create a user's
array now instead and inside of here
we're gonna create a raised within it so
just imagine this is a list of users
they are contained within an array so we
have an array of arrays so the first
user name let's
Alex and let's create a few here just so
we can try and find a value within this
array so let's say Billy Dale and say
Ashley and Mabel and let's do another
one just so we have something else to
play around with okay so the goal then
is to say to find and we want to find a
particular user so let's say we were
looking for Dale now this is the third
one down so ideally what we want to do
is loop through this array and as soon
as we find Dale inside of here we want
to break out that loop so let's also
initiate a variable called result just
so we can extract this once we found it
and place it into this variable and now
we can start to do a for each loop on
these users so again for each users as
user and inside of here now what we want
to do because we have an array now
inside of this user value because each
of these are arrays we can check this so
we're going to say if we're going to say
user at the key username we're going to
check if that value which will be for
the first loop Alex next loop Billy and
so on and we're going to check that that
equals to find which we specified up
there now if that's the case we want to
set result equal to that users are
assigning that user array for each of
these loops than there and of course now
we want to break out and that is pretty
much it so hopefully that makes sense
let's var dump on the result so we can
see that we get something out of here
let's go over to the browser
give that a refresh and we see array
with the username of Dale so of course
if I were to change to find to Mabel we
get the following and if I were to
change it to something that doesn't
exist in here so for example William we
don't see anything we see that default
null value that we set there so
hopefully that makes sense this is a
little bit more complicated but let me
just explain once more exactly what's
happening here
now we know that we have an array of
users each of these users happens to be
an array so when we do a for each users
is an array but
also user is an array as well we know
how to use an if statement and we know
what the triple equals comparison is
this will type check as well and we know
that the user name key in each of these
users is a string so we know this is a
string so we're using a strict
comparison to check if it equals the
value that we defined now because this
if statement will run however many times
we have users we check if it's equal if
that use name equals what we're looking
for we set result which we previously
set to null to that user array so this
is now an array and then if we have
found that user there's no need to
continue so we break out the loop now if
we don't include the break have a look
at what happens so at the moment we're
looking for william which doesn't exist
let's look for Ashley you see it works
and if we look for say Josh it works as
well so really why are we even using
this break well let's imagine this list
was a lot longer if you were to find
dial at this point there's no need to
carry on looping you don't need to carry
on once you have found a particular
value so if anything this is more for
speed and not having to iterate through
items that you just don't need to okay
so hopefully that makes sense I'll leave
you to play around with this if you want
to but now let's look at a slightly
different example now this is the
continue statement and we're going to be
using this inside of a loop as well
now the continue statement is slightly
different and what this will do is it
will skip to the next iteration at the
point that we call continue so it won't
break completely out of the loop it will
just skip the iteration that's currently
happening so we'll take a look at a
similar example in just a moment so
maybe we want to list through these
users but skip someone with a particular
username so let's say we were just
looping through and echoing them out but
we didn't want a particular person to be
echoed out so let's again bring back our
for each loop we're going to say for
each users as user and now in here we're
gonna have instead of a to find we're
gonna have a to skip so let's say we
wanted to skip dáil okay so now in here
we know that we can echo our user and
then we can grab it by that username and
then again we can append on a break just
in there so let's go and refresh we know
that we get Alex Billy down Ashley Mabel
and Josh so all of the items now before
we output here to the page we want to
check if that username so it's a very
similar if statement so if user and then
that username key is equal to the to
skip value now we don't a break because
that's gonna break out the entire loop
and it's not gonna work we want to
continue and what this will do is at
this point it will jump to the next
iteration so it just won't output down
here when this is true so let's give
that a refresh and you see that Dale
disappears so again let's just play
around with this let's put break here
and see what happens and you can see
that it gets to the point where it's
died out and it just breaks out of the
loop obviously that's not what we won
so again hopefully that makes sense we
have break and we have continued both do
different things but they work pretty
much where you need them and this is
usually within some kind of condition so
if both of these at this point don't
make sense have a really good look
through the code start to play around
with things and maybe implement
something yourself if this does make
sense the last thing that we'll be
covering is breaking nicking and
continuing but within multiple levels so
by this I mean that if we're nesting a
loop inside of another loop and we
already saw an example of that before
when we were doing a for loop within a
for loop what we can actually do is
break out of the outer loop from within
the inner loop so because this can sound
quite confusing let's take a look at an
example now what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna pull over an array structure that
I've already created just so we don't
waste too much time but by now this
should look pretty familiar to you all
we have is an array with three arrays
inside of this and we have a user just
here the user here and a user here and
each of these has like so I think we
looked at an example of this earlier on
in the series so this kind of structure
should make sense okay so what we want
to do then is we want to find a
like or a user who likes a particular
thing and break out of this entire loop
so let's say we wanted to find code so
let's say to find is code now the first
user doesn't have code that they like
but the second user does so at this
point what we want to do is because
we're gonna be looking inside of a likes
just here we want to break out the
entire loop we don't want to continue
looking so let's go ahead and implement
this and see what we can do so I'm gonna
set found to null or a result to null
whatever you want to call it and again
let's do a for each loop on this and see
what we can do so we're gonna say for
each user's as user once again and now
inside of here because we're looking
inside of likes for this we want to do
another for each on this inner array for
each user so we're gonna say for each
user and we can say likes and we're
gonna call that like then in here we
want to do that check so again we can
have an if statement and we can say if
the like which is now for the first user
cats then food then for the second code
cat some food we want to check if this
is equal to to find then we want to say
found equals user because what we're
technically doing here is we're finding
a user who likes a particular thing
we're not returning this here we're
returning the entire user now down here
what we would normally do is say break
now this is there's not necessarily
anything wrong with doing this but
really what we want to do is once we
found a user with a particular like we
don't want to go on to the next user
like just imagine that's the kind of
brief that we want to do so let's just
see how this works and they'll all see
what we can do with breaking outside of
loops within loops so we're going to do
a var dump on found so let's go ahead
and refresh and you can see here we have
a user name of Deo so let's just take a
look at that and here it looks like it's
skipped past this one despite the fact
we found the first user with code in
there like so it's gone on to the next
one and the reason for this is what it's
done is inside of here we're looping
through the likes
when we use break it's only going to
break out of this for each here it's not
going to break out of this one now what
we can do is we can define multiple
levels that we want to break out of now
in this case doing break on its own is
equivalent to st. break one notice if we
refresh we get exactly the same result
now what we can do is we can say well if
that's the case I want to break out of
two so I want to say break two this will
not only break out of this loop but it
will break out of this loop as well so
in this case we're finding code
this doesn't have code this does we want
to break out of the outer loop and then
return Billy so again hopefully that
makes sense if not have a really good
look at this code sometimes these kind
of things can take a little bit of a
while to sink in so let's refresh and we
get the result that we were after
so for continuing and breaking then that
is pretty much it we're going to stop
here but remember we can also choose the
levels we want to continue on as well so
I'd recommend you play around with this
once again though you have the knowledge
now so when it comes down to it you know
that you can use break and continue and
if you want you can define the levels
that you want to break out of in this
case breaking out of two for each loops
we come right down and we do a far dump
down here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
