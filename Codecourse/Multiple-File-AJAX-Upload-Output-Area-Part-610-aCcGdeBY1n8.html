how we want things to look when we
actually output to the user what's been
uploaded and what hasn't so we'll going
ahead and filling in the mark-up down
here and we'll go ahead and add the
Stars in a minute let's go ahead and
give this an ID of uploads this is just
a container under our bar here we want
to also go ahead and give this a class
of uploads so we can target that in our
stylesheet and I'm gonna go ahead and
create some text here upload file or
uploaded file links will appear here
let's go ahead and actually start this
but what we want to do first of all is
see what we're going to be adding in
here so what I'm going to be adding in
some anchors so we'll just say far dot
txt and far - dot txt and I also want to
go ahead and add a paragraph and say
these files didn't upload obviously this
is going to look a bit nicer later or
make a bit more sense later but we can
go ahead and experiment with this now so
that's how we're gonna be adding in the
mark-up with JavaScript later these will
obviously just be links to the files
that we're going to be creating or
uploading but when i refresh here it
doesn't look quite right we've got these
two sort of sat alongside this text and
these two sat in the in a line there so
what we want to do is just head over to
global dot CSS and we want to add some
additional styling in here just to
control these so I'm gonna target
uploads which is the class we just gave
and I'm gonna target any anchor within
that and I'm also gonna target any span
element within that and I'm gonna say
display as block so that will just
display these as block level and we'll
eventually get something that looks like
that now this will obviously go once we
have uploaded files so we'll end up with
something looking like this so now that
we've done that we can go ahead and
start to concentrate on the actual
functionality
