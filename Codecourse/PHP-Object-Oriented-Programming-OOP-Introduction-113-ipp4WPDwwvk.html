learning up to now is what we call
procedural programming the next step
that you need to take in order to become
a good developer is to learn
object-oriented programming also known
as LP now there are two main benefits to
using LP of a procedural programming and
they are well one it provides a modular
structure for your application until it
makes it easy to maintain existing code
and right now they probably don't mean a
lot to you they probably don't make much
sense but as we progress through this
series you'll realize what they mean now
throughout the series I'm going to be
using a lot of terminology that may seem
intimidating it's important to not get
put off by this they're just words so
we're going to start of the series by
using an example a real-world example
that you may just have come across now I
have a list of data types here by now
you probably know what most of these
mean you know what boolean is true or
false an integer is a whole number we
know our float is it's basically an
integer but with a decimal point a
string is just really anything an array
is a map we're going to come back to
this a resource is maybe like a file
handle null is just how it sounds know
and a callback is just a callable
function now we don't need to look at
any of these in this series you'll need
one that we're going to be focusing on
is object so what I'm going to say is
I'm going to create a new object and
assign it to new standard class it's
called STD class for short you you may
or may not have already come across this
new keyword basically what this does is
it creates a new instance of this class
and remember I said about the
terminology so now what we can do is we
can assign properties to this class or
this this object even and basically a
property is just a variable so if we say
object name and
we set that to John we can then go down
here and say echo object name and if we
refresh the browser we get John and we
can set this to an array as well so if
we say array John Billy Susan maybe and
Max and then we can loop through these
so forage object name as name in fact
the stripping names now then we can just
echo name and append a line break and we
get John Billy Susan max so that's the
absolute basics of object oriented why
it's not even object-oriented
programming I'm just demonstrating how
to use a class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
