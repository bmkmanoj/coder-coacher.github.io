extremely small function set in fact
we're only going to be used using one
function in this entire system and
that's going to be an escape function so
extremely important when we're
outputting data and that's been stored
in a database whether or not you choose
to sanitize data that goes in or
sanitize it when it comes out that's
entirely up to you I probably recommend
to sanitize when going in and coming out
as well so what would well sanitize when
going in escape and coming out so we're
going to create this escape function
which is basically going to take a
string use the HTML entities function in
PHP explicitly define a couple of
options which is going to make this
using this a little bit more secure so
let's go ahead and define the function
it's basically just going to be escape
we obviously want to parse a string in
or it's going to be more or less useless
and we want to go ahead and return the
result of the HTML entities function
here so what what we're going to do is
obviously we're going to escape the
string that we pass in however this
isn't quite enough to make it as secure
as we want it to be the first thing I'm
going to do is define the the end quotes
option which is basically going to
escape single and double quotes and the
last and probably most important it's
defining the the character encoding for
this and this just makes it a lot more
secure in case we're dealing with
encoding of a different type so utf-8 is
going to be our choice here so this is
essentially what we've done and there's
a lot of information about HTML entities
and how you can make it as secure as
possible online so you know it's a good
idea to go ahead and research things
like this rather than just relying on
the basic functionality that the
function provides so this as it is it's
going to be you know more than enough
for us to go ahead and escape things and
and for us to be reasonably comfortable
with how secure this is going to be so
that is literally all we've done or
we're going to be doing we've already
seen it up
P that we're including this file here
and that's what we need to do if you
have any other functions that you
require they can either go in one
functions file or in in subsequent ones
but for the system that we're going to
be building in this series this is all
we need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
