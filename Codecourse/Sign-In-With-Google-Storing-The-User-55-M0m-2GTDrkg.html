our application do all the cool stuff
they need to do there's one problem
we're not actually storing their details
in a database this doesn't stop them
from signing into your application and
using it but it's nice to actually store
some information about them so we can
you know keep information about them
so inside of MySQL I have a database
called website so at the moment this is
empty we've got an empty set on all the
tables let's create a new table so the
there are a couple of it's about this
table that are unique to the way I'm
doing things here because I just want to
issue a simple inset into query I'm not
checking where the users exist before I
do this and the reason it is I'm going
to use the on to placate key update part
of the query to basically not create a
new record for the same Google ID so we
need a Google ID field which is
basically going to be a unique field so
let's create a new table and let's call
this Google users and this is going to
have three fields an ID a Google ID and
an email so basically the ID is going to
be an auto incrementing ideas you'd
normally find you can use this to
identify your users that's absolutely
fine however the Google ID is going to
be unique in the sense that when we do
use that on duplicate key update we're
effectively just doing nothing for this
so well we are we're doing an update on
the ID
matching the ID a little bit confusing
but it doesn't matter in a real-world
situation you might be looking in your
database and saying does this user
already exist if not don't run this
following query but I'm just running one
quick query for simplicity and you might
want to do this too so the idea is going
to be an integer it's going to be not
null it's going to be a primary key and
it's going to be also incrementing now
the Google ID is going to be a decimal
it's a 21 length so we provide 21 and 0
here it's going to be also not null and
it's going to be unique so that's where
it comes in why we're not replacing this
record with
when a user signs in again again again
we don't create a new record for every
time they sign in the email we can just
give this a voucher of two five five
maybe have it not null and that's it
cool so let's show tables make sure
that's been created brilliant and let's
describe Google users okay so everything
looks okay we've got an ID as an int not
null primary key and order increment
Google ID decimal 21 and not null unique
and email varchar' perfect
okay so now what we want to do is we
want to create a new class because we're
dealing with dependency injection we
want to inject this into the Google auth
class that we've created it's inside of
classes let's create a new file this is
going to be very very simple just
basically going to be a simple database
wrapper okay so inside of DB now we want
to create a MySQL I instance you can use
PDO use whatever you want but in this
case I'm going to have a private MySQL I
property we're obviously going to create
a constructor and this is going to set
this MySQL I to a new MySQL I object and
we're going to pass in at the details
for our server localhost root for the
username for me its root for the
password and the database name which is
website so we also then going to
introduce a query and this is going to
take an SQL string and it's basically
just going to return this MySQL I query
SQL that is it done
so just to recap when we instantiate the
class we're connecting time to our
server with the details provided here we
are then storing this up here so we can
use it down here for our query very very
simple abstraction of the MySQL I object
in PHP so now that we've done that we
can include this in here so require once
classes / DB dot PHP and we want to
inject that into here so we can now
create
a new instance of that and inject it in
so we need to accept this in here so
this is going to be a type DB so we can
type into it and that's going to be oops
null by default so we can now say this
DB equals DB and we need to obviously
store this up here protected be cool so
let's just check we haven't done
anything wrong it looks ok so now we
want to deal with actually storing this
so at what point in the application do
we want to actually store the user well
we want to store the user when they're
redirected back from Google obviously
because if we were doing it too soon we
wouldn't have all of their details but
there's a couple of things that we
actually need to do before we can get
any information about the user so we're
going to create a get payload method
which will get the attributes of the
user then we can retrieve the payload
from this so let's just check this now
we're going to say this can be protected
get payload ok so let's examine a few
things in here and we'll run that from
you let's go look let's run that from
here so payload equals Earth payload
sorry get payload ok and we'll do a
print our payload and we will wrap that
in a pre element just so we can see that
a little better ok so at the moment is
going to error because we don't have a
payload method ad sorry um that sort of
is a protected bloody method isn't it ok
so let's set this to a public method ok
so this will be nothing at the moment
now to get the payload we need to access
obviously our client so I'm going to say
payload is this client now we need to
call the verify ID token method
and we then need to get the attributes
from this so let's do a return on
payload and let's check this out so a
number of segments and token okay
so index dot PHP let's get rid of this
and let's sign in okay cool
so let's do this instead of doing this
here let's do this in here check
redirect code because when we sign in
we're doing this here anyway let's get
payload
that's basically because the reason we
get that back is because we have
provided a code that's already been
authenticated with so if we sign in
again and hit accept
okay so we're finally there this is the
payload that we need it gives us some
details about our account it gives us my
email address if my email has been
verified or not blah blah blah what
we're interested in is this ID here
which is our Google ID and we're
interested in this email here so inside
of our get payload method down here we
want to get the payload from here so we
can see if we look at this this is
currently an array so we can just call
on the end of this payload there so now
what we can do is instead of outputting
this we know the names of the properties
inside of this array so we don't need to
muck around with this too much inside of
here I'm going to call this store user
and then from there I'm going to pass in
this pay get payload you can do this in
any way you want it doesn't really have
to be here you can do a separate check
you can do whatever really but generally
I'm just going to call this store user
this get payload and the reason I'm
splitting this up is because it's not a
good idea to have methods do more than
one thing really or lots of things this
is actually sort of you know quite the
bias it's doing lots of things after
another but you know whatever so the
store user method
cool so this is going to be a protected
method as is get payload let's just
change that detected method okay so to
store the user what do we want to do
well we want to construct an SQL query
I'm in here by the way we want to accept
payload so this is going to look like
the following it's going to insert into
Google users we're going to choose the
fields we want to insert into because
we're not inserting with the ID so it's
the Google ID and the
now add the values that we want to
insert are the following so we've got a
decimal so we don't need to surround
this in single quotes its payload ID and
for the second one it's a string so we
surround that in single quotes it is
payload email so on duplicate key this
is where the fact that I set the Google
ID to unique comes in this now will be a
duplicate key so on a duplicate key
update ID equals ID which is basically
the equivalent of saying zero equals
zero we're basically just doing nothing
weird maintaining the IDS integrity here
so we're going to say this DB query SQL
remember we store the database up here
that we injected in this class so
actually before we do this let's just do
a echo on payload email something like
that just to make sure we've got
everything right so let's get rid of
this code let's sign out and we'll sign
back in again and we should just
basically see my email address there
cool nice one and the reason we've got
this modify cannot modify header
information is we're outputting before
we use the header function so let's put
that query back and hope that I've not
misspelled anything and will again get
rid of this code sign out and we'll sign
in so inside of here we have got nothing
in Google users at the moment when I
sign in that should then store that so
there we are
cool so we've got the Google ID being
stored and email let's just sign out and
sign in again and just make sure that
that doesn't store that twice so it
should now still have one record with
the same ID perfect
so we've now not only authenticated with
Google we've also stored that
authentication information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
