creating the H scrolled up jas far now
what we need here is we need a function
I'm going to call the function H scroll
scroll and we're going to apply it a few
parameters to this the first one is
going to be text so they're going to
enter a specific string that they want
to be displayed we're going to have the
speed so the speed that the box opens
while the div displays Scrolls down and
we're going to have a delay speed so
this is going to be how long the div is
open for and displayed to the user now
before we start writing anything inside
we need to include our jquery is far and
we need to include our H scroll JS file
inside our index PHP this is quite
simple the first one we're going to
include is the jquery is so we have the
javascript jquery like library available
i'm going to say script type equals text
/drive a script and the sauce so we're
going to say SRC and this is going to
equal jquery dot j s so now our jquery
library is included in our page don't
forget to end the script there now we're
going to say script type equals text
/drive a script the source of this is
going to be H scroll j/s so you can
include this in any way you want to use
this pop-out notification box and don't
forget again to end the script ok so
everything should be included now we've
got our jquery library and the function
i'm going to write inside H scroll so if
we come back to here we've got the
function H scroll and like I said the
text the speed and the delay now the way
we want to do this is we want to say
dollar sign
hash header now what we're doing now is
we've addressed the header div and we
want to say we want to put something
inside it and what we do is we say in
fact now what we'll do first is will do
just to make it clearer will say header
slide toggle and i'm going to say 300 I
almost make it 500 so what we're doing
is we're toggling the slide of this at
500 so half a second basically this is
in milliseconds now we want to delay it
so we're going to say doc delay and I'm
going to delay this for let's say 2500
so this is 2.5 seconds now what we're
going to do is we're going to do a slide
the total again and I'm going to do that
at 500 so we've toggled it out so it's
going to scroll out at 500 so half a
second it's going to delay for 2.5
seconds and then it's going to slide in
in half a second so what we can actually
do is we can come back to our index dot
PHP file and we can actually create a
button that's going to toggle this out
so all we need to do is say input type
equals submit and we're going to say
value equals say click and then we're
going to say unclick equals now we can
call our function that we've just
created which is H scroll
and we can pop some text and a delay in
there as well so all I'm going to do now
is going to I'm going to include let's
just say either I'm going to do it let's
say what speed will pick a speed and
we'll pick a delay at the moment the
delay and the speed our in depth in just
their they're you can't you're not gonna
be able to change them using these so
I'm going to put them in any way i'm
going to say exactly why I've done so
the speed is going to be 500 and the
delay is going to be 2500 so and if we
click this button it should open up our
header as we want it to let's refresh
okay so we've got our button there we
just give that a click we've seen the
message is popped down and then in the
minute well 2.5 seconds it will pop back
up so we've got this working and you can
see that what we've done is and we've
already got this is a message in here hi
there the speed and the length of time
that it's going to take for it to stay
out is not taken into account yet so we
need to way of taking these variables
and placing them into our script the
first thing we can do is get rid of all
of this we are going to use the div
texted bit later on but for now all we
need to do is keep that just like that
and we won't need to modify that again
in this tutorial so now what we're doing
is we need to set the text then we need
to set the speed and delay and the
speeding delay easy all we need to do is
replace this here so it takes this
variable here the delay again just say
delay and again the speed here as well
so now we can set the speed we want it
to
let's just go back to our page index dot
PHP and I'm going to set the speed
coming out to 100 and the delay speed to
200 so we can see a major difference
here we can see that our parameters are
been taken into effect so we click it it
comes out and back in again so we can
see that we've modified that so we can
customize or speed we want to app now we
want the text to display properly so I'm
just going to set this to 2000 and we
want the text to display that we've
given here so we can simply come into
here and we do is be again address the
header div i'm going to say dot HTML and
in brackets we're going to put we're
actually going to create our div that
we've just deleted from our index dot
PHP file inside here so we say div ID
equals and this is text and we say plus
text and then we end the div with the
plus and ending the div there so now
what we can do is we can come and test
that it's refresh we click we see that
we get high there come up and it'll go
down again and this is because we've
specified it here so we can type
anything here and that will change
according to what we've specified it
okay so the next thing we want to do is
we want to set if these parameters
aren't given we want to set a default
speed so you might not want to set the
speed every time so we want to just say
we just want to write anything here we
want a default speed for it so to do
this we're going to say if speed equals
undefined
and or delay equals undefined when it
come down and we want to say speed
equals 500 and delay equals 2500 just
like we had before so it's setting a
default speed that is going to be taken
into account here and the default delay
which is going to be taken into account
here so what we do now is we can test
this so I've take I've got rid of the
speed and the delay parameters will
refresh the page we click and it's come
back to the default settings and so we
didn't need we don't need to specify and
the speed or anything here okay so
another example of using this we've used
it i'm in a button and that's working
absolutely fine but let's say i want to
do it when the page starts so i'm going
to get rid of this i'm going to say text
don't know script type equals text
javascript and then i'm going to end the
script and inside here on to say just
very very simply h scroll
welcome to PHP academy' and all that's
going to do is when we refresh the page
the first thing we see it's going to be
the drop-down menu and or the drop-down
notification it's going to go back up
again so it could be a nice greeting to
your users when um when they enter your
site okay so that's about it for the
tutorial the source code for this is on
the forums that's PHP academy' dorg
forward slash forum it will be available
in the source code section and you can
download all of the files i've used and
also the image that we're going to be
that we've used for the background for
this notification area okay so i hope
you enjoy the tutorial and if you
haven't already make sure you subscribe
