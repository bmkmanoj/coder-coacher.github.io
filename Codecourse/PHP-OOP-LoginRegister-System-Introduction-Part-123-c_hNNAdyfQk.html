building an object-oriented login and
registration system from scratch we're
going to be building several helper
classes and also some of the main
classes that we're going to use to make
this work so a lot of this functionality
can be taken and used elsewhere as well
so as well as being a login and
registration system it's also an
object-oriented programming learning
curve we're going to be only touching on
really the basics of object-oriented
program but if you are new to working in
this way of writing code in PHP then it
should give you a bit of a drive to go
forward and learn a lot more and learn
intermediate and advanced topics so
let's take a look around the system that
we're going to be building it's very
basic in terms of design you can see
that there's absolutely no mark on the
page we're just going to completely take
away from all of that and just focus on
the the core PHP aspect of it this is
also going to make it super easy for you
to integrate into your own website as
well so let's go ahead and just take a
look at the database first and see what
we're actually dealing with now there's
three tables only we do have quite cool
functionality in this application but
there's not going to be too much going
on so it's going to be easy to manage
and then you can extend it later on if
you like from what you've learned so the
first one really is the the users table
which is the core of this this is where
our user data will be stored so you can
see that there's only one registered
user that's myself we've got a password
assault named when we joined and the
group that we're in so the groups are
basically different groups with
different permissions so we do have an
integrated permission system in this in
this code as well and in this case I'm
an administrator and the admin flag is
set to one so if a user is of ID two
that means they're an administrator and
they have admin permissions so we can
set specific permissions for specific
users if we want now we also have a user
session table which helps for the
remember me functionality so you can see
if we go ahead and login there's a
checkbox to allow us to be remembered so
let's go ahead and just log in and take
a look around here obviously a user can
register as well that's that's very
basic functionality
just supplying username and password etc
etc so once we're logged in we can look
at our profile so each user can have
their own profile based on their
username we can also change our password
very useful update the details of our
profile and we can also log out we also
have the ability to register as we've
already noted theirs might look quite
basic
we're actually including some quite cool
functionality in here and like I said
we're building well we're building
static helper classes which are going to
do things like make it super easy to
validate things as well so if you go
back and register you can see that we
get a sort of validation here now this
once we build the class is going to be
really easy to work with and you can
take this validation class and use it
anywhere just straight out of the box so
the way this has been built is very
module sort of module based so you can
take away things that you learn from
this and use it elsewhere as you see fit
so if we take a quick peek at the the
source code you can see that the classes
folder hits full of helpful classes so
for things like dealing with input we
have a massive PDO database wrapper as
well which makes working with your
database super easy and secure as well
we have everything automatically
automatically sanitized as we use it in
our queries also things like validation
as I've just mentioned we have a
validation class to look up say unique
values make sure things match Max and
min values and the way this is written
is it can be it can be extended super
easily so you can add additional
functionality as long as you understand
how this is built in the first place
so that's what we're going to be
building so hopefully this is going to
be extremely easy to take this
functionality as you require it and use
it elsewhere in in other PHP
applications but yeah for now this is
exactly what we're going to be building
and by the end of the series you'll have
learnt
hopefully more about object oriented
programming PHP and you'll have a secure
login and registration system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
