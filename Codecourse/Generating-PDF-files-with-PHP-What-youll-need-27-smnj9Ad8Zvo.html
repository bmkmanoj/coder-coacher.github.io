all of this functionality the first
thing we're going to need is phantom Jas
and this is a headless browser
essentially what we're going to be doing
is we're going to be rendering the
contents of that template I showed you a
moment ago so this one here and then
what we're going to be doing is taking a
snapshot of it using phantom Jas so
we're not using any complicated code to
generate PDFs we're just taking a
picture of a web page that's as simple
as it gets
so we're gonna need phantom Jas what
you're gonna need to do is you're going
to need to download it for your
operating system what we're not going to
be doing is detecting which operating
system we're working on but you can go
ahead and build that in later so you're
either gonna need it for Windows Mac or
Linux and once you have that downloaded
you'll be ready to go with that the next
thing is if you don't have Composer
already we're gonna be pulling down a
few dependencies for this more so than
me psr-4 autoloading you don't need to
do that but we'll cover this later on as
long as you have composed it installed
and you can run composer in your
terminal then you're good to go
or if you downloaded the pH AR file you
can run PHP composer dot PHR and then
any of the commands that we'll be
running so the next thing is TWIC we're
going to be pulling this down with
composer and twig is just a templating
language for PHP and this will allow us
to render that view much more easily
than requiring files in and then
replacing variables it's just going to
be a little bit neater of course you can
not use twig eventually once you've
built this but it's a good idea to use
something like this when you're doing
what we're doing so we're also going to
be using two Symphony components the
process component this is going to allow
us to execute commands and the command
that we're going to be executing is
phantom Jas that's gonna run a script
and that's gonna take a snapshot of the
website and then we're going to save
that farm and render it as a PDF the
next thing we're going to use is the
HTTP foundation component from symphony
and this will just allow us to respond
and allow the user to download the file
as a PDF you can do this in raw PHP but
it's a lot easier you
this component so that's everything we
need to get going we're gonna be writing
all the code ourself obviously these
dependencies we're not going to be
building ourselves because I'll be a
long process however once you have all
these we're ready to move on to the next
part where we're going to start building
out this class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
