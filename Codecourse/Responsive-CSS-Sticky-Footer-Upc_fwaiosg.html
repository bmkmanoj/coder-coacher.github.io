trick to achieve a responsive sticky
fitter which is usually quite difficult
so here you can see I've got some
content just in my body of my page on my
wrapper and I've got some content in the
footer as well so as I pull this in you
can see that not only does the footer
fall down with the content it also does
respond nicely so it's not obviously not
a fixed height footer so this is
extremely easy to do so let's go ahead
and look at how we do this so we'll go
ahead and write the mark-up first you
can see I've got a basic document laid
out here and I've got a main dot CSS
stylesheet linked in with nothing in at
the moment so the first thing we want to
focus on is the wrapper so this is just
where all of your content will go and if
you're incorporating this into your
website as it is you may need to change
things around here
but this is generally how things are
going to work so I'm going to say this
is the content and we'll also have a
footer down here this doesn't need to be
a html5 footer element it can be
whatever you want and inside of here as
well will create a wrapper the reason
we're going to do this is we need to add
some padding to this and we won't be
able to add padding to the footer we'll
see why in a moment so I'm just going to
say this is a footer okay so what we're
gonna do now is over main dot CSS we're
going to apply some stars to the HTML
and the body and the first thing I'm
going to do set the margins to zero just
so everything sort of sits back in its
place like this and we also want to do a
few hacky things and this is a very
hacky solution but it works so I'm going
to set the display type of HTML body as
just as a table I'm going to set the
height to 100% and I'm going to set the
width to 100% as well now let's fill in
our wrapper stars and let's also fill in
some footer styles in the photo
specifically I'm just going to change
the background color just slight gray
and for the wrapper I'm going to give
that the 20 pixels padding I spoke about
a moment ago so that now gives us this
so we can start to work
I'm pulling this footed down to actually
make it sticky so with the wrapper we
want the height to be Auto here and this
isn't going to do much art in a minute
what we're going to do is we're going to
change the actual footer to be a table
row and this is part of the hack really
we're working with tables here although
it does seem odd we are technically
using CSS properties we're not actually
marking up tables here so personally I
don't see a problem with this solution
so we're going to set the display type
of the footer to a table row and I'm
going to set the height here to one
pixel so now what we're going to see is
we're going to see this literally just
stick to the bottom and the benefit to
this is that obviously as we add more
markup here this is going to be
responsive so for example we were to add
a couple of lorem ipsum paragraphs just
here and we were to do the same in the
footer maybe just a few this time then
we can head over here and the first
thing that we notice is that all of our
content in our main wrapper or main
section whatever however you're going to
mark this out we'll push down the footer
which is what we expect we don't overlap
or anything like that and second of all
you'll see that the height of the footer
has increased and in actual fact when we
pull this in and the height increases
even more to take into account the
height pushing from the content so
that's pretty much it it's really easy
to do and quite clean no sort of extra
markup required like you see sometimes
we get a push clasp or push ID being
added in a markup somewhere this just
allows you to keep your markup to an
absolute minimum so that's how we create
a responsive sticky footer with CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
