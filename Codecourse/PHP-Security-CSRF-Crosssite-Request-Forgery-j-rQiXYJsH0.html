cross-site request forgery is how common
it is I'm also gonna look at a live
example of actually performing a
cross-site request forgery attack so
let's run over the kind of setup I have
initially here you can download these
files from the course downloads if you
want to follow along
let's open up my database first of all
and just take a look at the kind of data
I have in here I just have a user's
table with two users and whether this
account is active now the page I have
here has a form which will allow me to
delete my account which will essentially
just set active to zero but this could
really be any action that a user would
perform if they were an authenticated so
this is what the form looks like all
it's doing is it's going through to
delete PHP this is a very rough set up
but of course you may have routing you
know whatever so it's going through it
has a post method and if we go over to
the delete dot PHP file you can see that
we're just preparing a statement here
with PDO and we're executing it and when
we are passing in the user session so
that's stored just here as a kind of
mock signing a user in so we've got
everything set up to delete an account
this is how you may normally do it
let's go ahead and click the button and
see what happens so we've gone through
to delete PHP that would obviously
normally forward you back somewhere sign
the user out whatever but the point here
is that active has been set to zero for
that authenticated user then you might
be thinking well since this is behind a
layer of authentication no one else can
possibly prompt a user to delete their
own account but that's actually not true
now obviously what an attacker could do
is forward you to this URL because you
would be signed in to this website you
would see this button but that's not
gonna force you to actually click on it
now what we want to do is take a user to
this website here and that could be by
any means it could be by the means of a
link
it could be embedding in an image source
it could be really anything but the
point is that's very easy to do
so let's take a look at this
CSRF page that's over in a new folder
here called CSR after PHP and all this
is doing is it's pulling in jQuery and
then with jQuery we're using the Ajax
method to Ajax over to delete dot PHP
with the type of post now as soon as any
user who's authenticated on this website
and logged in visits this page this is
going to send a request to this delete
PHP file not this one but the one we go
through too and it will delete their
account so let's take a look at the
network tab and we'll just pull this up
so you send a user over to this page it
doesn't look like anything that's
happened but if we click on the delete
or PHP request it's actually sent a
request through and what's actually
happened now is that's one at the moment
when i refresh it's set to zero so this
is a cross-site request forgery attack
and this is how it works there's
obviously different methods of doing
this and different ways we can do this
we could also if we were to have
something like user dot PHP delete
equals true then that may you know
perform an action deleting a user's
account either way we need to protect
against this in some way so let's set
active back to one for this user and
what we're going to do is we are going
to implement cross-site request forgery
protection over on this form inside of
bootstrap we're actually going to be
checking a token or talked about more
about that in a minute and then on
delete what we're gonna be doing is kind
of mocking making sure this page only
accepts post requests now it's really
important to know that this is a very
rough example of doing things if you
really want good cross-site request
forgery protection either pull in some
package from somewhere or use a
framework that implements cross-site
request forgery protection or a
framework that uses something called
middleware which will allow you to do
this a lot more elegantly either way
we'll look at a basic example of how we
can fix this up within this very basic
application structure and then hopefully
you'll understand more about how we
actually protect against this so let's
start writing the
out for this now so the first thing that
I'm going to do is just put in a tiny
bit of code here which is very bad
practice just to only allow this page to
be accessed by a post request so you
wouldn't normally do this you'd have
routing setup which we don't which would
allow this for you but I'm just going to
check inside of the server superglobal
array request method that key and I'm
gonna check that that doesn't equal post
and then if it does equal if it doesn't
equal post I'm just going to kill the
page and all that means is we can't go
through to delete dot PHP or we can but
it's not actually done anything it just
kills the page so that's the first step
protecting your brute but you do that
with some kind of routing system either
way we have that there now which is one
kind of level best than we already have
the next thing we want to do is for each
request generate a random token and you
can do that in whichever way you want
I'm gonna be using the kind of most
secure way of doing this there are many
other ways to do this but we're gonna be
generating a random token putting it in
a session value and then we're going to
be appending that to our form if that
token then matches will allow the user
to perform the action and the point of
this is that an attacker will never know
that token because it's only available
to the current user so let's do this if
that doesn't make too much sense so over
in bootstrap PHP which is loaded into
both my delete and index file that's
really important to know I'm going to go
ahead and I'm going to set this all up
so we've already started sessions you
need to make sure sessions are started
because we're going to be using the
session superglobal all right and I'm
gonna do an if statement here again to
check if the request type is post
now this isn't foolproof if you're doing
things like put operation or delete
operations you may need to adjust this
but again this is just a very basic
example to demonstrate cross-site
request forgery attacks so we're
checking if the request method is post
you could do like an en array here and
have post get post put delete whatever
you wanted to now what we're going to do
is we are going to in fact before we do
this down here we're going to generate a
random
touken and we're going to store that
within the session superglobal and it's
gonna be underscore token you can call
this whatever you want so now what we're
going to do is use the open SSL random
pseudo bytes function I'm gonna pass in
the length and then we're gonna do a
binary to hex on that now this is just
one way of generating a random string if
you're working with PHP seven you can
also use the random bytes function it's
entirely up to you so now that we've
done that let's just I guess kill the
page here and look at that token that
we've generated so if we hit enter here
there's a token it will change each
request that's really important to know
it doesn't have to change each request
but in this case we can just do it every
request so if the request method is post
that means we now want to check the
token but where's this token actually
coming from well it comes in every form
that we want to submit that means that
that token has to be checked for every
form we submit therefore the attacker
thing we looked at earlier won't work
because along with this we'll have to
generate and send a random token it's
very good it gonna be very hard to guess
that so what we'll be doing here then is
saying if not is set dollar underscore
post token so if the token isn't set we
don't want to allow this request to go
through or if the token
doesn't equal the token stored in the
session so all we're really doing is
saying within a forum here's a token
when you submit this form I need it to
match that token that we generated here
and then we know it's the user that's
actually using the website physically
using the website they're the person
that's going to have submitted it now
otherwise we're going to kill the page
and just say invalid cross-site request
forgery token you could do anything here
for an exception redirect to user really
doesn't matter but now what's going to
happen is when we submit this form so
that's just refresh on here when we
submit this we see invalid cross-site
request forgery token why is that well
we haven't implemented the token into
our form and you want to do this for
every form that you build because
obviously every form you build is
susceptible to cross-site request
forgery attacks particularly if it's for
things like deleting accounts or you
know ordering items from a from a
shopping cart it could be anything but
really it's great to just protect
everything so we put this inside of a
hidden input field the name is going to
be token remember that's what we're
checking here so post underscore token
and we are setting the value to session
token so before we check this let's just
run through it once more the first thing
that a user will hit or will be executed
is all of this code and then this here
so obviously this won't apply for users
sending a get request to a page they're
just viewing a page that doesn't matter
but here we're generating the token
after this we then place the token into
the form when the user submits the form
we now have a post request and we check
that that token stored in here matches
the one output on the form and then we
notice that users submitting the form so
let's keep an eye on this active one and
we'll go ahead and assuming I'm a
legitimate use I'm authenticated I want
to delete my account and there we go
that looks like it will have deleted my
account there we go
however we're going to try the same
method we saw at the start of the video
hitting this page sending over a request
to delete dot PHP and we'll see that
when we do this it sends a request over
but we can see we get that invalid
cross-site request forgery token
response back and even if we were to try
and make up some random value here it's
going to be very unlikely that we
actually have a match now like I said
this is a very rough method of doing
things it doesn't cover all cases it
keeps you secure for post forms but for
any other operations it doesn't and also
it's very messy so like I said within a
framework you'll find that this imp is
implemented a lot better and even if it
isn't you'll have the resources to
implement it in a much more elegant way
so that's how we do cross-site request
forgery attacks and how we protect
against them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
