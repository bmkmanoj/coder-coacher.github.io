install PHP BB which is a bulletin board
system developed in PHP now the first
thing I'll need to mention is that I'm
installing this on a local server so I'm
going to be using localhost
now the probably the best thing to do if
you're trying to learn how to install
PHP BB and you want to just test run it
to setup the best thing to do would be
use a local server and I do have a
tutorial on how to setup xampp which
will allow you to run PHP and other sort
of files from your computer as your as
it act as a webserver so the first thing
we want to do is we want to come into
PHP BB calm we're going to come to
downloads and we're always going to
choose latest version so if we click on
this we're going to come down here so
the latest version is important because
we have security issues update issues
functionality issues that we want to
keep and they're very most updated so
what we can do is we can come across
here and we've got update to stable
release download language packs this is
for if you were want to update your PHP
VB version so what we want to do is
instead we want to download full package
so if we come down here this is the full
package and we're going to I'm going to
be downloading the zip file so if we
click on this we'll see that we get a
message to download it's pretty simple
and that's downloaded now already have
this the reason it was so quick because
I already have a copy of this and what
I've done is I've transferred this to my
htdocs folder inside xampp and this is
inside my c drive so this is basically
the folder that's initially publicly
accessible or rather locally accessible
through your localhost and this is in
here
localhost' /and whatever you need after
this and we're going to be installing it
in forward slash forum so in effect this
htdocs is our root directory okay now
here's our installation I've already
copied it over I did that before the
tutorial so it hasn't just appeared here
you will need to copy it over from your
downloads file wherever your downloads
are stored and then what I'm going to do
is I'm going to drag this and I'm going
to click extract here and what that's
doing is just extracting that to the
internal folder called PHP BB 3 ok what
we can do now is delete this package and
when we click on this we can see that
the files contained within let's just
make this a bit smaller and the files
contained within are the files that are
part of the PHP Beebe package so we've
got all the folders here with the
install directory which is important to
us now and the files so for example the
index dot PHP everything that's
contained within you've also got styles
here which are the styles that you can
copy over to install everything but
obviously in this tutorial I'm just
going to be focusing on the installation
so this is the most important folder
that we need now now only need is I'm
going to come back over here and well in
fact what I'm going to do is we're going
to come back here go back we've got this
default it's extracted as PHP BB 3 which
is the folder I'm going to rename this
to forum so because we're working inside
htdocs' this will be htdocs forward
slash forum or back slash in windows
case pressing enter and this is where
the user will be redirected so localhost
forward slash forum
ok so it's automatically directed us to
our install directory and we're greeted
with a little message we have some tabs
up here convert install what we're doing
is we're choosing the install tab
and it'll give us some information about
the install so read this before you
proceed and then we want to proceed to
the next step all this talking about is
a lot sort of database issues things
like that so proceed to the next step
okay so this what what this will do is
check the installation compatibility so
upon first glance of this list I am
passing everything with my current web
server that's been installed so my PHP
PHP version is acceptable that this is
my PHP version at the moment and it
requires 4.3.3
other options
this one is register Global's
and it's either way acceptable yes or no
but obviously it's recommended now these
are optional and this one's optional
this is required with a get image size
if any of these return an error so
either no and they are required what
you'll need to do is Google obviously
sounds silly but is a very good option
for seeing how to enable these functions
how to change things and why your PHP
installation could have got PHP Beebe
installation could have gone wrong so
check these though they are M required
and if you're having problems then you
can look around how to enable specific
functions if you have installed a fresh
copy of xampp then it should be fine
however if you are using say just a
Apache server and PHP installation you
may not have things enabled however for
now this is worked also when you're
uploading to a global service so hosted
hosted if you have web hosting then
these should all be
you should all pass anyway these are
pretty straightforward they're not
really worth talking about supported
databases now obviously the database is
very important because we are using a
database now to have MySQL enabled is
probably the best option you are looking
at a MySQL server which is what you need
one of the databases that you can use
and these are unavailable for me but I'm
not bothered because I'm going to be
using MySQL store data
I just find it the easiest you can use
PHP myadmin to manage your data if you
need to go into the database
internally so we have a number of
options available so this is not not a
worry
MySQL I'm using optional modules so like
it says these modules up or applications
are optional it will enable extra
features so we've got compression
support for compressing compressing
files into packages remote FTP support
Gd graphic support these all come with
xampp so if you are using a local server
and you're testing this and it's fine if
you're using it again on a hosted server
they should all be available if your
hosting is good so files and directories
we've got these files inside which is
cache files or cached files and store
these are all inside here so we've got
cached files and store now these are
writable directories that PHP BB needs
to write to throughout its process of
people using the form and you using the
forum so it's an important that these
are writable if it's if they're
unrightable you can right-click and you
choose properties inside windows and
change these if you're using c panels
say if you're using them at for your own
hosting then this can be change the
permissions can be changed
okay so optional files and directories
and convict up PHP and image avatars
upload so this would be obviously for
avatars that want to be uploaded okay so
everything is found and writable in this
respect and we have these features
available and we've got a database
available so everything important is
available and we have this option here
start install this is automatically
detected that everything is fine so I
can start the installation so I'm going
to click that now what we need to do is
set up our database again like I said
I'm using MySQL so I'm clicking and
choosing this from the drop-down menu
MySQL now because I'm running on a local
server this is going to be the localhost
you can see it's already there the port
isn't too much of a problem if you have
manually changed this yourself you'll
need to specify a port but by default we
can leave this blank because it'll
automatically detect the default port
for an SQL server now the database name
I'm going to be calling the database
name forum my database username I'm
going to be called out I'm going to be
called Alex I'm going to have Alex as
the database username and the password
I'm just going to set there okay so we
haven't actually created this database
called forum if we were to proceed to
the next step the prefix by the way is
just the prefix for the tables in the
database this isn't anything you need to
worry about I just leave it as some as
is so proceed to next step you'll see we
were returned with an error this is
could not connect to database and access
denied for Alex at localhost using
password yes ah sorry this is going to
be rude that's my root password and root
sorry my username is root and my
password is blank I'm using my local
server I don't have a password set and
my username is room so what you'll need
to do is you'll need to find out your
database username and password and to do
this what I'm going to do is I'm going
to open up PHP myadmin this should come
with xampp anyway so M is just
localhost' forward slash phpMyAdmin and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
come down to MySQL the table here and
come down to user this is a table user
and then you can see here that we've got
localhost for the hope app localize for
the host root for the username and no
password so this and this here is what
you're going to need to enter here and
here it's not advisable not to have a
password but for now I'm using my laptop
which doesn't have an internet
connection most of the time so this is
acceptable and obviously localhost here
is our server we're running on a local
host ok so now what I'm going to do it
again like I tried before I'm going to
proceed to next step and we will receive
an error and this is unknown database
forum now the reason for this is PHP
Beebe installation will not create this
for you you'll have to create it
manually so we come to PHP myadmin and
if you're creating a database on a
hosted web server CO you've paid for
hosting inside cPanel you have an option
to create databases and assign users to
them databases in which case this will
change to your your host so mine would
be PHP academy' to org or you can still
use localhost if it's in web hosting the
server port remote blanks it should
default database name is as you choose
and the database username and password
will be what you have set in your
control panel for your hosting so
whatever you have set then obviously you
can add your username and password here
okay so what we're going to be doing is
we're going to be going back to home and
what we're doing now is we're creating
this database name we've received the
error unknown database form i'm simply
under create a new database i'm going to
be typing
form now inside cpanel for hosted
installations you will not receive this
area here to create a new database all
you'll need to do is create a new
database in your control panel and
that's under the my MySQL databases
button so for now obviously I'm using
localhost so I'm going to click create
and that's created that database we
don't need to put anything in it because
PHP BB will do that for us
but this error message will no longer
appear when we click proceed to next
step we've created this database so
proceed successful connection we've can
successfully connected to the database
and proceeding to the next step we're
going to solve the administrator
configuration now the administrator
username I'm going to keep as Alex
obviously choose and the default board
language you can add languages but I'm
not going to speak about that today
administrator password set a strong
password I'm just typing password in his
mind for now but set a nice strong
password this will deter people that are
trying to log in as you in for the
administrator control panel so I'm going
to confirm this just password my email
address and this would typically be your
just used usable email address I'm just
using Alex at localhost Khan just simply
I'm installing on libraries this isn't a
really email address but and this is
where you would put your email address
and now we're proceeding to the next
step and administrate settings the tests
have passed so we can proceed again okay
the configuration file has now been
written so your configuration has been
written and we can then proceed to the
next step now these are typical settings
that you might want to change an able
board wide emails I strongly suggest you
enable this that way emails will be sent
by the board when people register so if
people register
they're going to receive a confirmation
email this is highly recommended you can
use SMTP server for an email but if you
click no and you have a mail function
that will send out mail particularly if
you are on web paid hosting the mail
function will work and you will be able
to send mail so I always keep this as no
for now and server URL settings cookie
secure this is for SSL installations if
you're using an SSL registered domain
forced server URL settings I would just
leave this as no for now server protocol
HTTP colon forward slash forward slash
so this is as you would expect if it is
a secure server you would add HTTPS
domain name is localhost so I am running
it on localhost if you're running on
paid hosting say PHP academy' org this
would mean that I would choose this
domain name but for now we're running
localized server port leave this to
blank this is the default HTTP server
port and script path is forward slash
forum which we have determined here so
we've got htdocs switches and affect the
route so it will be localhost forward
slash 4 and we can now proceed to the
next step
okay so the database tables used by PHP
3 have been created and populated with
initial data so now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to take you back to here
where we have forum with no tables found
in the database if I go back to home
you'll quickly see that PHP where is it
forum sorry has now 62 tables so PHP
Beebe has installed used SQL query data
to install all of these tables or create
all of these tables for us so this is
our data you don't really need to worry
too much about this but this is just
shown how the automated process has
installed or created your tables for you
so now we can proceed to the next step
okay so we're greeted by a crap
congratulations message and we've
installed it successfully now we can
click this login button here and what
this will do is it will take us straight
to our administrator control panel for
our administration control panel and
here what you can do is you can click on
forums the tip of the tab create
categories and things like that it's
something that you'll have to get used
to
you can change styles of your board you
can install styles of your board but
this is all if you want PHP Beebe
website you can gain some information on
how to sort of use this and how to
install things
so if we have proceeded to the board
index which will be what our forum looks
like to normal users you'll see that we
get this information dialog come up here
is please delete move or rename the
install directory before you use your
board now I strongly recommend I mean
you can't you can't use your forum until
you delete it or rename it or move it
what I suggest you do is actually delete
it now to do this we're going to come
into forum and let's just change the
size of these
and we're going to delete this install
directory so simply just delete and
we're going to delete that so now what
we do is we can refresh and you'll see
that our forum has properly appeared now
and we've got our first forum and as
opposed to your welcome to PHP p3 so
we've got an initial post is by myself
obviously this is automatically posted I
can then post a reply so view a
submitted message everything is working
I'm obviously the only user at the
moment and this is a successful PHP
Beebe installation now what we can do is
actually once we've logged in as myself
so I'm logged in as Alex we can use the
administrator control panel which will
pop up at the bottom only for yourself
to access this obviously just click on
that link and it will take you into the
administrator control panel so we've
successfully installed PHP Beebe it
would have taken me longer to run
through problems you may encounter while
you're installing but this is the
general idea of installing it obviously
like I said it's different on a paid
hosting server where you may be using
cPanel you're going to have to create
the databases by yourself inside the
cPanel
but as long as you know how to use your
hosting then you should be able to
install PHP be PHP be be and
successfully successfully do that now
I've just noticed there's the config
file PHP is currently world writable we
strongly change the permissions to 640
or at least to 64 for so to do this
inside I'm not going to explain now but
inside our cPanel and inside our file
manager we would have to change this
if you were to log into your cPanel
hosting and go to file manager you can
change these at these sides of each file
so you would locate config.php which is
here and next to this in cpanel you
would see being able to chmod the
particular file and just change this to
640 so that was how to install PHP BB if
you have any questions or you'd like me
to update this video as anything else on
this video then just simply give me give
what comment the video or message me on
youtube and I'll happily try and make a
modification of the video or tailor it
to a specific people specific person's
needs so yeah that's basically it so
good luck with your PHP PV installation
and I will see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
