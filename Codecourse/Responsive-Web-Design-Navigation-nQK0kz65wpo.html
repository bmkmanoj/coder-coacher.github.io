we're going to be continuing our
exploration of responsive web design so
we've already looked at some of the
techniques that we can use but in this
video we're going to start getting our
hands dirty bit with some of the design
patterns so obviously the design of your
website is completely up to you but
there are certain patterns certain
trends that may be worth considering for
implementation into your website is in
this video we're going to be looking at
a very popular navigation pattern and
let's have a look at this demo of it so
you can see that out here in the wide
viewport we have a horizontal navigation
and then when we go to the more narrow
viewport we have a vertically stack
navigation that's hidden in this drawer
here and we can toggle that with this
handle this is very simple simple to
implement and we can have a look at how
to do that today so I have a folder here
called now call it whatever you like
I'm going to create a new file called
index.html and then here is just going
to be basically what you'd expect it's
basically just your normal website I'm
going to call this navigation demo I'm
going to create a header in the header
I'm going to call it um best website
since google and under this we're gonna
have our nav element in there we have an
unordered list and some list items in
there let's go for some page names and
although okay gallery contact or fairly
reasonable page names I would say and
I'm going to wrap these in anchor tags
using a bit of sublime text voodoo and
I'm just going to add sort of the hash
link there so now we have this
navigation which is basically the
mark-up that you'd have on any other
sort of site so there's nothing new here
and I'm going to create a simple section
just stick some basic text in there and
let's link in a starchy so I'm going to
pull this style dot CSS create it and C
so I'm just going to start styling the
website for the desktop so I'm going to
have my body with a margin of 0 and a
padding while padding of 0 and I'm going
to put a font family there on there
sans-serif because we're all modern
people M for our header I'm going to put
a background on it of 0 0 7 9 5 f I have
some colors picked out written down here
but you can use basically whatever you
want give it a width a pad some padding
using the shorthand here for padding so
if you want to have this is giving it 40
pixels top and bottom and zero padding
left and right what else should we have
let's have a white color on there and
align the text Center and I'm also just
going to stick that in each one's
for my navigation I'm going to have an a
background color again going to stick
again I have written down some colors
286 use whatever you like you want to
put on here overflow:hidden now this is
going to be important later on because
we're going to be fiddling with the
height and if we have a height smaller
than the content within the element and
overflow of auto then we're going to get
the contents of spilling out of the
unordered list and that's not what we
want so I'm going to put a color of
white on here as well and a margin Nahr
they don't need a centering I'm also
going to put some padding on there and
because I'm going to have inline block
list items I can use text align Center
to Center my list items speaking of
let's create them so as I said display
of inline block can give them some
padding and yeah I think that's what we
need let's have a look quickly yeah
looking all right cut off and take a
margin off the navigation you notice and
that we have ugly anchor tags a good way
to normalize your anchor tags if you
want to get rid of the underline and the
color on them is to say
text-decoration:none that gets rid of
the underline and then I found color
inherit works right well so instead of
trying to manually fix the color back to
what it should be
it will just them I'll just take the
color from whatever's around it which is
really handy and then for my section I'm
going to get something up in finding
recently it's the line height putting a
line height of 1.5 m/s is really nice
actually it spaces out the
a lot lighter and I think it's just a
bit easier on the I've the user because
you know if you have a big dense block
of text it's not always the best thing
to be reading paddling oils with the 35%
and center that okay so that's nice just
a normal sort of style for the desktop
but also some hover States for this just
change the background color go change
that to three nine nine zero seven seven
let me code on so now we have a nice
hover State on there so now that's all
fine and good but we've all seen that
before we all know how to do this up
sort of stuff let's jump into the mobile
side of things so if you haven't already
watched my video about media queries it
might be worth doing that now because
we're going to be creating a media query
and we want to be targeting a max width
and let's see what we're going to set
this to so if you watch the media query
video you'll know that if you background
the dev tools and then resize the window
you can see the size of the window and
the top right which is really handy so
it looks like somewhere around 580 to
600 is going to be a good break point
for this
so get 580 open this up and in here
we're going to style our list items how
we want them to be I'm going to just do
that don't need to but adds a little bit
more specificity um so our list items I
want them to be width a hundred percent
and because their width is a hundred
percent and we have padding on them
we're going to need to put a border bot
that's my box sizing of border box on
there now this is because if you had the
normal box sizing it would be adding the
padding on the outside so obviously
width of 100 percent plus extra padding
would overflow
but I won't go too into too much detail
about that right now also going to take
a bit less about a bit of padding off so
I padding 15 pixels rather than 20 so
now if we go down to yeah that's looking
nice let's add I think I'm going to put
them on the left so text align them left
again it's all just little details you
can do this however you like
so there are list items are done how we
like now we need to add this handle that
we had okay so this is just going to be
a div wants to be inside on navigation
element but outside of the UL element so
I'm just going to call this handle can
give it a class of handle and inside
here just have the word menu
another thing we had inside here in the
demo was the sort of shutter icon I'm
not going to go over how to create that
in this video but this is created in
this demo with just using HTML and CSS
this is really quite easy to do if you
look around on how to do it but again
I'm not going to cover this in this
video but make sure that if you are
using this technique you do use some
sort of icon because it's just going to
make it so much more obvious for the
user whenever you're using some sort of
clever navigation design it's important
to make sure that the user knows what
they're doing with it so make sure that
if you are using this you have a little
icon in there okay so our handle we want
to style this is outside of the media
query first of all so well let's give it
a width first of 100% background of
but remember my hash let's text the line
at left and give this a box sizing of
border box as well because we're also
doing them width 100 and at and we're
going to be adding padding on this
so put border box on that as well maybe
10 pixels padding or 15 pixels top and
bottom 10 pixels left and right that
would be nice I'm also going to put a
cursor cursor where cursor of pointer on
here so you're not aware what that does
and make sure that we have this little
hand which would usually see on an
anchor tag but it allows us to put it on
things that aren't an anchor tag so
that's really handy when you want to
make it obvious to users that an element
is clickable also I'm just going to put
color white on there and they'll do it
for that okay so now we have our element
style but we need to think about hiding
certain things so we want to hide this
handle for when we're in the wider
viewports and want to hide the list
items initially anyway for the mobile
pupils the the narrower viewport so
hiding the handle is really simple
because we don't want to animate it tool
we can just say display:none and it
won't show up on the wider viewports and
then inside this media query we can say
handle display block and that will work
perfectly before we need it to do and it
will show up in the smaller viewports
the actual unordered list hiding that is
going to be a little bit more difficult
because we want to animate it
unfortunately can't animate between
display:none and display:block because
there is no in between there the browser
can't interpolate values between those
two things
so we need to use something that will be
able to be animated we could use height
but then would be setting an explicit
high and that you might end up sort of
setting it bigger than it needs to be so
what we're going to do instead is to set
a max height on our UL so we can do that
inside the media query actually I'm
going to going to put it above this just
because I feel like that's a bit neater
and okay so as I said we're putting a
max height on this of zero pixels so
that's going to hide it for the mobile
viewport I keep saying mobile if you
really just be saying now our viewports
because it's any viewport that's less
than 180 pixels so that's hidden it
nicely for those viewports and still
showing for the wider ones so the way
we're going to show this now is to add a
class of showing while I'm just gonna
call this showing to the UL element
whenever we want it to be shown and then
we're going to affect the max height
property again and I'm going to set this
to 20 e/m this is where this technique
has a bit of guesswork involved because
this needs to be something that's
definitely going to be big enough to
hold the navigation list but not too big
so that it messes with the animation
you'll see what I mean in a minute so
now because we have two numerical values
here two things that can be interpolated
we have 0 to 20 so the browser can go
from 0 to 20 and it can animate it what
we're going to do is add the transition
so in our UL we say transition and we
want to that to affect the max height
property
and I'm going to set this to 0.4 seconds
just because it's not too fast and it's
not too slow
and now we need to Christ me two
prefixes a few times so I'm going to say
WebKit LS Mozilla and / Oprah so now if
we look at this and we go into our
inspector here we open up the nav
element and start affecting the class
here if we set it to showing you can see
that it animates open so that's exactly
what we want to do and now all we need
to do is to toggle that class because as
you can see if I take that away it
closes again animates to closed
we just need to toggle that class by
clicking on this handle and I'm going to
do that with jQuery but you don't have
to if you want to just use pure
JavaScript just look up how you can
toggle a class with pure JavaScript it's
not too difficult it's just a few more
lines of code I'm just using jQuery here
to save time so I'm using the Google
hosted libraries and I recommend you do
as well so you just click on jQuery here
copy the link I'm going to stick that in
the head of our document and at the
bottom here I'm going to create the
script to toggle the class so the way we
do this it's really simple so we go
target the class of handle so we have
our handle here targeting that and it's
going to be on the click event comma
gonna execute function and that function
is going to be our nephew l want to
toggle the class of showing and that's
really all there is to it so if we look
at this now
now I write down we can see if we click
on this it toggles the class of showing
and so our CSS kicks in and we get this
nice transition to open up the drawer of
our navigation so that's all there is to
this really popular navigation design
pattern and I would really recommend
trying to implement it into your site
and seeing how it goes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
