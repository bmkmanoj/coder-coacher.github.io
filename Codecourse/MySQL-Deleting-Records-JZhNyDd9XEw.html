updating records it works in more or
less exactly the same way the only
difference is that we use the delete
from keywords instead of update so let's
take a look at deleting say the
introduction to PHP article or in fact
the working with mysql and things are to
quit doesn't really matter so let's go
ahead and use the delete from keywords
or command and again as you probably
already know we choose the table that we
want to delete from now running this
command is extremely dangerous well this
is going to do is it's going to delete
records so delete from articles on its
own with a semicolon hit enter that will
delete all records in your database
table so be really really careful when
you're issuing these kind of commands
what we now want to do is instead of
delete from articles we want to provide
a where clause define where we want to
update this or delete from so we want to
say where ID equals to now when we run
this command obviously what it's going
to do is it's going to delete from the
articles table but only where the ID of
a record so ID being the column is equal
to 2 so in a hit enter it says query ok
one where affected as we expect so when
I select star from articles select all
four columns we go ahead and we can only
see one record in here now be really
careful when you're deleting as you can
see it can be extremely dangerous if
you've got a lot of data in your
database what happens here is this is
actually you know where it doesn't give
any warning so if you were to go ahead
and choose delete from articles it won't
prompt you and say you sure you want to
delete everything it will just go ahead
and delete it so make sure that you you
know issue these commands really really
carefully when you're deleting data from
your database table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
