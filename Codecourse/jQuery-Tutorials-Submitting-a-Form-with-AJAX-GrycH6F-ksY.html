to be doing is we're going to be
submitting a HTML form with Ajax so
we're going to be using the jQuery AJAX
library to submit this obviously without
refreshing the page but what we're also
going to be doing is we're going to be
careful as to create this so it's
entirely flexible so that you can
quickly implement it elsewhere you want
to build the same functionality for each
form you use on a website we also need
to bear in mind accessibility what
happens if the user has javascript
disabled in that case we want to submit
the form anyway so we're going to be
able to form as we would normally submit
it but then we're gonna let Ajax or our
Ajax functionality handle the submission
for users that can and obviously we're
going to keep our form semantics and
everything like that so this is how the
form looks at the moment let's just go
ahead and fill some details in here so
let's go ahead and put our my name in my
email address and a quick message I'm
going to go ahead and hit Send now that
has sent this data to a PHP file without
us actually seeing anything
and you can see here I've logged to the
console what we've got back and that's
just a print art in PHP so you can see
at the moment I've gone array of data
which is the name email and message this
is actually printing out the post global
variable so this here so this is what
we're going to be doing in the video so
we'll start from scratch build up the
form and then build up our JavaScript
functionality okay so basically what
wouldn't be doing is we're going to be
building the form first that will submit
to a specific page and that's going to
be the page that we're going to process
the data in and we're going to be
building it as if we didn't have
JavaScript enabled and we're going to
ensure that it works first of all and
then when that's done we can handle the
rest with Ajax and then this
functionality as I said we can use over
as many forms as you like and it's super
quick to implement once you've done it
so the first thing that we want to do is
build the form now let me just explain
the elements that we've already got on
the page we've obviously got our basic
markup on the page we've got a title now
we've included jQuery the latest version
of jQuery from the Google CDN and we've
also including a file called mange
which is found here nothing in at the
moment but that's where we're going to
be writing our JavaScript nothing too
complicated as well so let's go ahead
and start to build out our form and give
it the usual attributes that we would so
the action is going to be the page that
we're submitting to now in this case
I've created a folder called Ajax and
I've created contact PHP which you can
see I've got open in my editor so that's
the father we're going to be Ajax into
so I'm just going to choose Ajax contact
or PHP and I'm also going to choose a
method which is going to be post now the
reason we do this is because we're going
to use JavaScript to pickup the value of
this attribute but also if we submit the
form it will go to this page to process
the data inside of the form so it falls
back to people that either don't have
JavaScript enabled or you know there
might something might go wrong so let's
go ahead and create some input fields
are going to have name email message and
then the submit button
oops so the type here is text and we'll
give this a name now the name is
important we're not going to give these
any classes or IDs unless we of course
use labels but in this case this is
going to be picked up by JavaScript as
well so it's extremely important I'm
also going to incorporate a placeholder
in here and just say your name so let's
duplicate this down and we'll change
this to email and change this to email
and let's again duplicate this down and
we'll create out submit button while
we're down here and we don't need a name
for the submit button and we also don't
need a placeholder you just need a value
for this so I'll just say send and
obviously in here we want to go ahead
and create a text area so we're
basically building a form as we area
basically building a form as we usually
would so there's nothing different about
what I'm doing and this is going to be
message so let's go ahead and check this
out refresh so we've got your name email
message and send so we'll go ahead and
just wrap some divs around this in fact
we'll give this a placeholder too so
obviously this is going to depend on
your design but I'm just going to wrap
empty divs around this you know not
recommended but just to space it out for
now
I'm gonna apply any styles or anything
like that and I'm certainly not going to
use paragraph tags so once that has done
that's just that should be alright then
lovely so let's go ahead and just
preview this cool so we've got all the
markup out of the way now we're going to
get into the exciting stuff which is the
PHP side of stuff which is going to be
very basic because you know this isn't a
tutorial about processing a contact form
but will then work on the java scripture
is just going to get a little bit more
interesting so when I submit this to
contact dot PHP let's just take a look
what happens so I'm going to fill out
some details send okay so this has gone
to Ajax contact our PHP so inside of
contact PHP we want to create a
conditional statement and we want to
check if the data that we are expecting
is set so post name post email groups
and post message now obviously I'm using
PHP but you could be using any
server-side language here does not
matter where you're submitting this to
as long as you can process this on the
backend so here I'm going to print our
post we're not actually going to do
anything with this data but you can do
everything with this data so when I go
ahead and hit refresh you'll see that
we've got an array of the data that I've
submitted so that is the point of this
now what we want to do now is actually
take over this functionality so click
send nothing's available we want to take
over this functionality and when we hit
stem we want to send this
behind-the-scenes and then get that data
back so we can either put it onto this
form redirect with JavaScript something
like that so let's go ahead and write
the JavaScript for this now it's not as
complicated as you might think it is
actually extremely easy and hopefully
the way I explain it's going to clarify
each step that we take so the first
thing to do is to set a selector for our
form now we don't want to just target
every form we want to talk its forms
that we specifically want to enable Ajax
for so I'm going to give this a class of
Ajax and that will mean that any form of
the class of Ajax will be prior
test by this functionality I'm going to
say formed Ajax
I'm going to use the on method and I'm
going to say on submit so when this form
has been submitted I a submit button has
been clicked the last thing I want to do
is return false and the reason for this
is that otherwise the form will submit
in its normal fashion so when I click
send now nothing happens okay so the
event handler has been triggered so we
can do a consult up log here to check
but there we go but we're not actually
submitting the form in the traditional
fashion so now what we want to do is we
want to create some variables we want to
create reference to the current object
which is the form or the element and we
want to get the URL the method and we
want to set some preliminary variables
to hold the data that's going to be in
this form now the beauty of this method
is that if we want to go back to here
and add another field we don't need to
write any more code in the JavaScript
area this will all handle we're going to
loop through all of the elements in here
that we want to submit so you don't need
to go and change everything so this will
remain that light you could implement
what I'm about to write and never have
to change it so that's the beauty of
this so I'm going to create a variable
called that and this is going to
reference the current project that we're
working with I'm also then going to say
URL equals that dot attribute action and
we also need to get the method some of
the same method equals that dot
attribute method and we also want a data
variable which is going to be a
JavaScript object to hold our data now
if you're not on if you don't really
understand this that reference is up
sorry this reference is the current the
current object that we're in so that
would be this form so now we can use
that to say that dot is just a shorthand
way instead of using this and this over
and over again attribute is basically
just one of the form attributes that's
action and method so we grab them let's
go over to the index dot HTML file so we
grab the method and the action and we
save them
so now what we want to do is we want to
loop through all of the elements in the
form now which elements are we
interested in well we're only interested
in elements that have a name because
they're the ones that we want to pick up
on the other side the name is required
for the traditional submission but we
want to pick up the value from these
based on the name so name name and name
this doesn't have a name because it's
not of interest to us we could give it a
name and it wouldn't matter but anything
with a name within the form is of
interest to us so we want to loop
through in fact we say that dot find and
in here we choose another selector and
the selector is literally just name this
means find anything with a value with an
attribute of name regardless of whether
it's empty and regardless of whether
what content is within it and now we use
the each method and we have a callback
function so this will run for every
single element with name and we'll
expect that there would be three in this
case so let's consult log and let's put
some value index value and in here let's
say console.log value so when I click
send you see that it basically outputs
the the three input fields that we're
interested in so the name the email and
the message so now that we've got that
clear we need to create some more
variables and again I'm going to create
that variable to reference this now
remember this now references each of the
inputs that we've just seen output so
we're going to have a name for it which
is that dot attribute name and that
reference is this all this and we're
going to have a value which is going to
be that dot bow okay so now we've got
the values of each of the elements that
we're interested in we can append them
to this data object here the reason that
we're appending to a data object is
because we're going to be sending this
through the Ajax jQuery method and we
need to pass this as a JSON object or
just an object so we say data value
equal ab sorry data name of course
equals value
so this basically just says data name so
the name of the name of the input field
and then we apply the value so under
here I'm going to say consult log data
consult log data and let's go ahead and
refresh so I'm going to type in Alex my
email address and hello click send and
you see now we've got an object named
Alex email Alex a PHP academy' dorg
message hello so this is in perfect form
to send through to our PHP file using
the jQuery AJAX method so we've built
this up perfect now we can send it along
so now what we're going to do here is
we're going to use the Ajax method some
curly braces inserts some curly braces
inside and here we want to specify the
URL the type of request which can either
be get or post which we picked up here
so the URL here the method here and then
we want to send the data through which
we already have seen in action so the
URL is just going to be the variable u
RL the type is going to be method in
fact let's change this to type and let's
change this to type then so we're sort
of keeping consistency and the data you
probably guessed already is data so this
is sending the URL that we specified
here with this data type or the type of
request and then the data is going is
all of this all the values here that
we've already seen output passing
through as well we also have a success
callback function and in here we get a
response and then we can console dot log
the response so what happens is is the
ajax method sends the data to this URL
with this type so this data here and
then we get a response back and week and
it's basically anything that's output on
this page which the moment is print our
post
so we'll just console dot log the
response and with this data you can do
absolutely anything you can clear the
form you can output error messages and
you know get creative with that so now
let's go ahead and say Alex Alex appear
to be Academy
hello click send and the response is the
print art of this so this isn't
JavaScript this is the print our value
of of what we've seen in our in our
contact our PHP so we could even say
your name is name so let's say Alex I'm
not gonna bother filling these out we
don't actually have any checks to say
these should be it should be submitted
but there we go your name is Alex so we
can do anything we want inside of our
PHP file now we can pass error codes
back and things like that and then we
can pick that up within this callback
here so basically what we've done is
we've created a form that can be
traditionally submitted but we then
overtake it with the JavaScript
functionality but then we have that nice
fallback you it's not available and then
we can process it in the backend with
any server-side language of our choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
