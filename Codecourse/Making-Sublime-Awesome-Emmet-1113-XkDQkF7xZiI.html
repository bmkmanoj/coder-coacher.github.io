than likely you're probably going to
want to know about Emmet
so Emmet is basically like we saw with a
twig example a really nice way to
autocomplete things but it goes a lot
further than this and we're not gonna
dive too much into this we're just
talking about this in the context of
sublime but we can actually do a lot
with Emmet
so Emmet is available for lots of other
text editors but we're gonna go ahead
and install it for sublime and see what
we can do with this okay so let's go and
just restart sublime and now that we've
done that let's just go and create some
kind of index.html file so now that
we've got Emmet installed we can do
things like generate a document layout
by just including an exclamation mark
and hitting the tab key so that will
generate us a document layout you've
probably seen me do this in other videos
so we can also do some really clever
stuff so we can do something like row
and then if we're working with a
framework like foundation on the front
end we can do something like large five
columns and then we can multiply that by
two and you can see how easy this is to
work with so if you head over to their
website you'll find a lot more about
this but trust me this will speed up
your development on the front end a
massive amount is really helpful plugin
to have and it's probably one of the
most used plugins that I actually
actively use because for example when I
am you know creating a submit button or
a text field or something a little bit
more complicated like a form with
perhaps a text area in it I don't want
to have to write all this out myself so
I can just go and generate this with
Emmet really really straightforward but
really helpful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
