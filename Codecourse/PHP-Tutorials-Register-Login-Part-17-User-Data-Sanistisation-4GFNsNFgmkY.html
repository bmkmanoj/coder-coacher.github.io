and address something that we haven't
looked at already and this is in terms
of security with the website now we've
just created our profile page so if I
click on that here you can see that this
is my first name which is the value that
I store first of all when I register and
something I can update later on here if
I like as well as things like my last
name and the email address and any other
fields that you're adding here now these
are stored in the database like so we're
going to look at an issue that an
extremely common problem with websites
that allow you as the user to enter any
data that's stored and then output a
later stage so for example any social
networking website where you can enter
bio your details your interests anything
that's stored and then output to Ed for
anyone to see basically about this
public publicly accessible so I'm going
to sort of expose a security issue that
we currently have here and then we're
going to go ahead and fix this and see
how we change this so I'm going to go
over to settings and I'm going to modify
my first name
now obviously you'd expect your your
your users to say well you know my first
name is Alex I'm going to type Alex
however the key here is never to trust
input and the reason being is we could
do something like now you can see I've
got it up here for my I've been testing
and this is an old HTML attribute
bgcolor and that allows you to set that
ground color on a page or for example I
could say strong and then Alex like this
now obviously these are our HTML
elements and strong is just a way to
emphasize text and you know most
browsers will render this bold however
this isn't really a valid first name we
don't want to allow users to do things
like this when I click update here you
can see that my name here
year and if I go to my profile this is
now bold again I could do something like
underlined for example which is
obviously not semantically correct but
however you know this is now underlined
now this is a problem because we don't
want users to be able to do this now
this isn't really a security issue it's
more of a display problem however you
also have what your users also have the
ability to use scripting so for example
I could say alert here and I could say
hello now when I click update this
hasn't done anything well it hasn't done
anything yet there but when i refresh
now you can see that we have this script
execution and you know this is a
security problem for a variety of
reasons redirects things like that
now we need to protect against this so
after this long explanation we have a
very very short solution to this now
I've got registered up here to be open
here simply for the fact that I know I
need to go ahead and open the function
that registers our user and scroll down
and find this a register user now we've
got this array walk that's calling this
array sanitize function in general PHP
so for every item ie first name last
name email blah blah blah we perform
this function here or call this function
MySQL real escape string now that helps
to protect against SQL injection but
what we're not doing is sanitizing any
HTML input we find or any HTML elements
we find now what we can actually do is
we can use a function to convert these
this this data or these this text into
HTML entities now HTML entities are
representation of things like a less
than or greater than sign but that are
rendered to the browser and aren't shown
as you know actual symbols for example
well you'll see in a moment so if I say
use HTML entities around here
and also around this single sanitize
function which we we use for things like
user input looking in anything really
that we need to singly just sanitize a
piece of data it's important we do this
here as well if we use this in the
future for anything that requires input
let's go ahead and just refresh here we
get the same problem up here but I'm
going to go ahead and just modify this
back to Alex and there we go we're back
at the start so we can now look at the
new effect that this HTML entities
function has had my first name here is
Alex that's fine
now let's go ahead and actually in fact
let's go ahead and get rid of this
quickly and we'll just show how it was
stored in the database previously
because this will this will basically
just you know give you the clue so I use
my script tags here to produce this
output here click on here and you see
we've got this here that's what you'd
expect you've got a less than sign here
greater than signs to n forward slashes
etc etc now let's go ahead and just just
redo what we've just done or undone so
that's to use the HTML entities function
and sanitize our data this way as well
let me go ahead and change my name back
to Alex update the database is updated
to reflect that now let me go ahead and
do the same thing again let's just do
the yeah let's do the script tags that's
sir more of a danger now you'll notice
first of all this is now actually being
displayed on the page rather than being
executed when I click back on settings
you can see that we've got this instead
now when I click on users now you can
see that we have the HTML entity which
starts with an ampersand and then LT
stands for less than colon
that's an HTML entity that's then
rendered on the page so for example if
we view the source of this web page we
can see that this now does not actually
execute this alert here because this is
just seen as output it's not seen as the
start of a script tag so that's you know
really important
thing to bear in mind when you're
actually accepting user data the same if
we were to use strong and I clicked
update we just get our strong tag start
end so you may not want to allow your
users to enter any tags whatsoever and
there are additional ways that we can
you know protect against this as well we
have functions like strip tags and
that's just strip underscore tags so
we'll do the same for this one as well
strip underscore tags and let's go ahead
and check this out so let's go and edit
my settings again I'll just click update
bottom
okay so let's change this back to Alex
let's go ahead now and use strong like
that okay so let's go ahead and check
this out in the database and you can see
now that we have escaped the with
Runnings up we've done exactly the same
thing have an i/o no of course sorry
sorry have the reason that this hasn't
worked is we've converted to an HTML
entity of course and then that's then
not seen as a tag so by stripping tags
of things that aren't tags we obviously
don't get the desired output so thinking
about this logically we would go ahead
and we would use strict tags here which
would strip the tags and then perform
and then we'd have any HTML entities
converted again so let's go ahead and
check this out so let's change this back
to Alex quickly and let's go ahead and
then change this to or do strong Alex
update there we go
we've updated but nothing's happened we
remain at Alex and that's because the
strip tags function has changed these
title removed these tags essentially so
even when I type strong and then update
in the database this just remains as
Alex because the tags from either side
have been stripped as well so this this
so HTML and PHP tags so you know PHP
tags aren't as much as an of an issue in
this case but it certainly strips HTML
tags so that's some visibility security
where we are sanitizing user data that's
actually output onto the page we've
modified the two functions erase and the
sighs and sanitize erase sanitizers
obviously sanitizing things like how
update field as we're going up date
information as we're looping through and
updating this data and sanitize is just
a single but these functions go ahead
you know have a look at them in the PHP
manual and so read up about them
there'll be some examples there as well
but it's extremely important that we do
consider any data that is allowed to be
entered by a user and then output again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
