migration and create a test table inside
of our database the first thing I want
to do is install composer so I can
create a laravel project once this is
done I can run PHP composer wher create
project laravel laravel and prefer
distribution now that's installed let's
take a quick look inside of our MySQL
database I'm going to use the empty
website database that I have if I issue
the show tables command you can see that
I don't have any tables at all let's now
open up this newly installed laravel
project in our text editor so we can
start to connect to our database and
create some migrations let's head over
to our app config and database file and
we'll change our login credentials for
our MySQL server in this case my
password is root and the database as
we've already seen is called website now
that we've done that we can actually
create some migration so I'm still
inside of here I'm going to go ahead and
list directory and I'm going to CD over
to laravel this is where we go ahead and
use artisan eh bees command-line
interface so let's use PHP artisan and
we'll do migrate make now this might
seem a little strange but what actually
doing here is we're creating a migration
file and we'll see this inside of our
text editor in a moment we're going to
name this how we would expect it to read
as the action in this case it's going to
be create underscore articles table now
we notice that once I create that and
head over to database migrations you can
see that we've got the migration file
here but it's also created a class named
similar you'll also notice that we've
got two methods up and down now up is
what happens when you actually run your
migrations so for example creating a
date table or modifying a table and down
is what's going to
than when we roll back our migration so
we're going to be using levels schema
builder to create our articles table so
we use the create method we pass in the
name of the table that we want to create
and we also have this callback which we
can then access the argument T or table
or whatever you want to call this so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create an incrementing field here this
will be the primary incrementing field
I'm going to call this ID so we use the
increments method for that I also want
to go ahead and create a title a
description and a body so in this case
I'm going to use the string method the
title I'm going to give that a length of
200 this is essentially the same as
creating a varchar I'm now going to say
t string description this is going to be
500 and I'm going to say t text which is
a text type so that doesn't require a
number I'm just going to call this body
now laravel also has useful created at
and updated at columns which when you're
using models and new using perhaps
eloquent you go ahead and create a
record for this it will automatically
add a creator that date and when you
update this in any way it will
automatically modify the update to that
date for you so to do this we use time
stamps and don't confuse this with time
stamp so the opposite of creating a
table is obviously dropping a table so
we say schema drop articles let's go
ahead and run these migrations so we use
PHP artisan migrate now because I've
created this migration
anyone else now using this project can
go ahead and run the same command and
not actually have to worry about setting
up the database themselves at all this
will all be done for you when I hit this
you can see that we get a migrated
create articles table if there are any
problems here you'll see an error so you
can go ahead and fix your code up let's
now show tables within this migrate when
it is what
site database that we have you can see
that we've got two tables ones migration
some want articles so migrations is
basically a table that will keep track
of all the migrations that haven't
haven't been run so you don't go ahead
and delete this or modify this just
leave it it is if we now describe the
articles table that we created and I
just go ahead and enlarge this you can
see that it contains all of the data we
would expect to see to laravel generated
all of this for us and the good thing
about the schema builder is it doesn't
matter what database solution you're
using as long as it's supported by
laravel this will just all be created
normally so you know it doesn't matter
if you're switching between databases
now remember you can also create
multiple migrations in one go so if you
know the structure of like five or six
tables you can use the migrate mate
command over and over again and fill in
as many migrations as you need and then
when you run PHP artisan migrate that
will just migrate everything and the
same for yourself on another machine or
another developer as well so that's how
we create a table using laravel
migrations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
