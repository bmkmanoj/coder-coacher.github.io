like a profile image or really it could
be any image and we're gonna create a
circle effect around this so essentially
we're gonna turn this image into a
circular shape and this is quite a
popular web design trend now so the
first thing we want to do really is just
pull an image in just so we can play
around with something I've got an image
directory here with a profile an example
profile picture inside I've also got a
main CSS stylesheet linked in here let's
go ahead and do this if you haven't
already if you want to follow along so
let's go ahead and put this image on the
page so let's grab this profile dot PNG
and let's head over to the browser and
check this cool so we've got the image
up here so there's a property in CSS
called border radius which is quite
widely supported now and we don't really
need to use vendor prefixes I'm going to
be demonstrating this without vendor
prefixes so what we need to do is look
at the reusability of this effect so
rather than applying it to a specific
image we want to create a circle class
that basically allows us to apply this
to any image and in fact really any
element that we want so let's give this
a class first and then we'll look at the
style in the class in a minute
so I'm going to say class of circle so
what we can do is as long as we've got a
stylesheet linked in we can head over
here and we can say circle and we can
start adding properties to this and
we're gonna add the border radius
property let's just give this a radius
of say 10 pixels and see what happens
here you can see that the edges have
been curved around quite a nice effect
in itself but we are after a circular
effect and to get a circle what we need
to do is we need to adjust the border
radius to the point where it's half of
the width or higher than half of the
width so at the moment we've got a width
of 220 a natural width of 220 on this
image so let's go ahead and add 110
pixels and there we go we get our circle
effect done now
this isn't actually a great solution
because what happens is if the image in
question is larger than say 220 pixels
we then won't have a circular effect now
what we can do instead is provide a 50%
option and then that will always give us
a full circular effect we don't need to
mess around with values however large
this image gets or however small it gets
the border radius will always be at 50%
and you might also want to include
classes like radius we just say a border
radius of 30 pixels anyway and this
would just be for images that you want
to display just with a slightly curved
corner but anyway that's how we create a
circular effect with CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
