console in Chrome developer tools and
this is mainly going to be where you
either debug or examine data within
JavaScript or really any other messages
that are thrown by scripts or your
browser so we're going to return back to
the example where we are using an ajax
request here to hit the user's PHP file
which basically just contains some JSON
data this doesn't have to come from your
server it can come from another server
as well but we can use the console to go
ahead and actually output what we need
basically so we're hitting this users
dot PHP file we are sending through this
blob 1 but we're going to ignore that
for now
and over on the preview we saw earlier
that we can open and close this data
here that's coming back from it
but when you are writing JavaScript the
console is going to become really really
useful and there's a few ways that we
can use the console so the first way is
to just click on the console tab just
here and the second way because the
consoles probably the most accessed area
when you are front-end developing
particularly with JavaScript what you
can actually do is you can have another
tab open so for example you could have
the elements tab open and you can hit
this little button here that's going to
bring up the console as well so you can
work simultaneously with the data here
CSS for example and you can also use the
console down here so it's good to know
that you have this down here if you need
it along with any of the other tabs that
you need to work with what we're going
to be doing those we're going to be
exclusively working with the console
from this tab for now so how do we work
with the console well let's take a look
at a very basic example inside of this
app jas file let's go ahead and get rid
of this data we're sending through and
in the success callback within the ajax
method on within jquery let's go ahead
and just pull this data in so we now
have this data which is essentially just
the data that's being returned from this
far which is just JSON object as we've
already seen so how will we actually
work with this you know we might go
ahead and say
something like if data dot success
equals true maybe if you're posting
something you know there's there's
variety of ways to work with your data
but what if we want to just examine this
data well we can use console.log
which is basically going to log an item
to the console and we can pass in data
there which is a an object and when we
go ahead and refresh we see this object
well we see an array with three objects
within it if we expand this we see 0 1 &amp;amp;
2 so it's a zero index array we see some
JavaScript stuff in here for example we
have a length property which tells us
the length so we can do console.log data
dot length if we wanted to and when we
refresh we get three just output here
but for now what we're gonna do is just
look through this so we can just examine
really everything within here depending
on the complexity of the data this
really does help because you can just
see what you're working with so for
example if you want to access the name
on the first object here you could just
go ahead and say data zero dot name and
that's going to give you out Dale so
it's really useful to be able to work
with this just so you know what kind of
data you're working with even if you
have written the data yourself
so there's another way that we can work
with the console so let's just get rid
of this and go ahead and refresh so
within JavaScript you obviously rights
you know whatever code you want to write
so for example we could say something
like far link equals document dot get
element by ID this is just raw
JavaScript we could say link over on
index dot HTML we could have an anchor
just in here with an ID of link and we
could just say click me let's just put
that HOF to a hash when we refresh we
now have a variable called link which is
basically that element so if we do a
console log on link
when we refresh we see that element just
there but more interestingly what we can
actually do is access any variables that
are stored using the console so if I
just type Lincoln hit enter that gives
me what I already saw when I did a
console output what we could also do is
we could you know modify this so we
could say something that linked dot
click hit enter you can see that just
appended a hash in the URL because
that's essentially just forcing that
link to be clicked this is using the
jQuery click method we can also do we
can write full code in here if you
wanted to so we could do something like
alert one that's going to go ahead and
give us an alert box out so anything
really you can do in here to play around
so if you wanted to start playing around
with this link variable and adding an
event listener maybe you can do it all
from the console here sometimes it's not
entirely desirable to do that but
essentially as long as you know it's
there it's really really useful so this
is great for debugging if you were say
just looping through a load of items or
something and you want to just go ahead
and console.log these out you could
console.log them out see the values when
you are developing JavaScript this
really just does help you just see what
kind of data that you're working with
otherwise you'd have no real way to see
it so for the console that is pretty
much it and again when you are
developing this is such a highly used
part of chrome developer tools and once
you start using it you'll probably find
you'll be lost without it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
