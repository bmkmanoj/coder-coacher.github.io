look at do-while loops and while loops
in PHP and will explain the fundamental
difference between these so the first
one we'll look at is wire loops so if we
go ahead and just look at outputting
numbers from 1 to 10 we'll use that as
an example here and we'll see how we can
do that with a while loop
now while loops are also used to loop
over result sets so for example if
you're working with MySQL I and
retrieving data from a MySQL database
Orion video and you're returning results
from a database and you might see syntax
that looks similar to this as while row
equals and then the ability to fetch a
result so a result row but we're just
going to be basically looking at the
very basic syntax and looping from 1 to
10 so I'm going to create a variable
start and this is going to be 1 so with
while we're going to say while and we
also need a counter here and because we
need to determine what number we're
starting at and also the increment so
I'm going to say while X is less than or
equal to 10 which is currently then I
want to go ahead and echo in natural
fact we can get rid of this start
variable on ones go ahead and echo X and
I also want to increment X as well so
what I'm really doing here is saying
well let's start at 1 and when we hit
this line here we're going to check
immediately if X is less than or equal
to 10 which it currently is so we're
going to echo that out we guess we could
append a space onto that and then we'll
increment that value now what's going to
happen is this will loop again and X
still will still be less than equal to
10 so we'll basically just achieve
something like this where we're looping
from 1 to 10 and that's fair enough and
we know that we can use this for things
like database results so we don't really
need to go too much else into this but
we also have this loop called do-while
now let's just say you wanted to do
something before you before you even
checked a condition let's just change
this around a little bit so we
can I say do something while something
else so in this case that's just echo
hello and where we say where we say
while I'm just gonna say well zero now
if we were to change this to wild zero
none of this would run because this
evaluates to false so let's just get rid
of that what's going to happen here is
the difference but the fundamental
difference between the do-while loop and
a while loop is that the do-while loop
will always run the block of code before
it checks the condition so the condition
here will be checked after the block has
been run so now what we get is hello
whereas if we were to use a while loop
doing this while zero echo hello then we
would not get any output because the
condition is checked beforehand and
therefore the block isn't even run so
the do-while loop is useful if you want
to actually run a block of code and then
look at an expression as well so if for
some reason we wanted hello to echo out
at least once but then we wanted to
check if X was less than or equal to ten
in here we might want to then increment
X what's going to happen now is is that
we will see we just load up the browser
we'll see a Hello echoed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9 10 times as expected because what's
happened here is we're running this
block of code and we are basically
echoing this out and then we're
incrementing X checking if it's less
than equal to 10 and then running based
on that so if for example we had X up
here set to 100 if we now refresh
hello's output once because what come
what happens is we execute this we
increment X which is 101 but then by the
time we reach that point the expression
con evaluates true because that value is
in fact greater than 10 so that's a
fundamental difference between do-while
loops and while loops in PHP and the
while
is particularly useful as we've already
mentioned for looping over result sets
such as database results</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
