these alert boxes these are styled
obviously with CSS but then I'm gonna
build a very small jQuery plug-in to
handle being able to close them which is
obviously optional you can just have
them as styled elements on your page if
you need to so you can see that at the
top of the page we've got one large
alert here and these use exactly the
same Styles they fit to the container
that they're placed into we've got this
X here which we can click and just get
rid of and then that disappears the same
with ease as well so they work in
exactly the same way so we're gonna
start off by building this very basic
page layout we're going to have a left
side of a page and a right side of a
page if you're using some kind of grid
system these will fit nicely into that
so let's go ahead and start to do this
build up the styles and then we'll start
writing the code that we need these to
be able to close as well so we're going
to start off with not much code at all
here all I have is a basic document I've
linked in a style sheet which we're
gonna be writing all of our CSS in and
I've got an empty JavaScript to folder
here which we're going to be placing our
very small jQuery plugin into so let's
start first of all by building a very
basic container for this left and right
hand side for the page and then we'll
get going so let's build a container
here and we're gonna have a class of
left in here and we're gonna have a
class of right this really doesn't
matter we're just using this as a test
so this is going to be the left hand
side this is gonna be the right hand
side obviously at the moment not much
going on here so inside of app dot CSS
then we're going to just start I guess
by prepping our page so let's set the
margin to zero
on our body and that's just gonna mean
that our alerts will sit nicely at the
top let's choose a font family here
we'll go for Helvetica and that's a
sans-serif so we'll provide a sans-serif
fullback let's set the font size to 1m
and let's give a line high of 1.2
so that's not changed much just the
visual elements mainly of the typography
so let's stop this container that we
have then we're going to give this a
margin of 20 pixels so everything that
sits inside just pops out a little bit
like that and for the container left
element and also the container right
element really this could just be one
class because we're doing the same thing
to both of them
we're gonna float this left and we're
gonna give a width on this of 50% I'm
gonna give 10 pixel padding now this
isn't gonna look right it's not gonna
sit next to each other and the reason
for that that we've got 50% width and
because we've got the temple padding on
this it's not quite gonna work out so
what we do is we can make use of the CSS
calc function to take away 20 pixels
from 50% that's because we've got 10
pixel padding on the left temple padding
on the right and that gives us the
following so let's just inspect these
while we're here just so we can go along
with what we're working with you can see
here that these are just sit sitting
nicely next to each other within this
container so let's add some content very
quickly to this page I guess we could
add a header in here left side of the
page amazing and we'll add the same for
the right as well let me just copy these
over just sorry a little bit quicker
here and we'll have a paragraph here
with some lorem ipsum in and we have a
paragraph here as well with some lorem
ipsum we'll do 10 maybe and then we'll
do another paragraph here with a little
bit more so we now have the following
that's it so we're going to be creating
our alert box one is going to be at the
top here one's going to be just under
this header and one's going to be just
under this head and we can see how this
interacts on the page the reason that
creating all this content is important
to see how the end result actually works
with the content on your page just so we
know that it's going
work properly when we come to use it so
let's start styling up the first alert
box then so inside of our CSS file we
want to define a class called alert but
let's start with the markup actually and
we'll start with the alert that's gonna
be on the top of the page and this will
naturally fit into the container it's
put with him so let's create a div with
a class of alert just here and we'll go
ahead and we'll just enter some text in
here
so we're working on the site this
weekend some random message so that's
going to look like the following not
much at the moment and we'll be adding
our close button in here as well in a
moment so then let's start with styling
up the basic alert styles this is going
to apply to any alert whether it's an
error success alert or a default dirt so
we're gonna give this a padding of 20
pixels we're gonna give this a
background color this is going to be a
default color which is just going to be
a gray color we're going to set the
color of the text to white and we're
gonna set the font size here to 0.9 m/s
so let's go ahead and check this out
and it looks like this so that wasn't
too difficult at all we've got our basic
alert box working and that's the basic
star for this so let's go ahead now and
target the close button within this so
what we want to do is we want to
actually create an anchor here the href
can just be a hash because we're gonna
be handling this with javascript in a
bit and we can go ahead and give this a
class of close and for the content
inside of this we're going to use x
which gives us a nice X and we get the
following so we've got that X there we
can click it but obviously it's not
doing anything
so we need to style this up get rid of
the default color get rid of the
underline here and that's pretty
straightforward
the probably the most difficult part is
positioning this so within the alert
class we're going to target the closed
class
and we can go ahead and set the stars
for this so what we're gonna do is gonna
float this right we're gonna set the
color of this to the same as the text
color within our alerts we're gonna take
away the text decoration which is that
underline you see on links by default
and let's take a look at what this looks
like at the moment so it it's kind of in
position the only problem I have with
this is that the area to click is very
small you can see my cursor change here
that's what I want to do is give this a
little bit of padding and then position
it correctly so we have a little bit of
a bigger area to click so I'm going to
set the padding to 10 pixels that's
gonna solve our problem but it's gonna
give us a little bit of a positioning
issue you can see here now that the area
to click is a lot bigger and that's
particularly useful for mobile devices
or any kind of smaller device where user
has maybe a touch screen and they need
to press it with their finger so to
combat this I'm just gonna set the top
to minus 10 pixels and I'm gonna set the
right to minus 10 pixels let's go ahead
and refresh nothing seems to be
happening and the reason for this is the
default positioning of this so what we
want to do is set the position to
relative and what that's going to do is
allow us to give it give it their -
values so we've now got our alert close
button with a bigger click area and you
can go ahead and adjust this if you want
it a little bit bigger as well or if you
want to move this out a little bit
whatever you want to do but we've got
the basic styling here so what we're
gonna do now then is we're gonna copy
this and we're gonna paste it underneath
this header let's just reinvent this and
we'll do the same for this one as well
and let's change the text to reflect
which kind of alert we want to output
here so the first one is going to be a
success so I'm going to say success your
settings were saved and then down here
we're gonna say whoops something went
horribly
wrong so you can automatically see that
these are fitting within this container
really nicely so we already know that
these can be used at the top of the page
if we want or we can just use these
within containers it works exactly the
same way due to the way that we've
styled it but now what we want to do is
apply an additional class for example
success or for this error error and
that's going to allow us to change the
background color of this to suit the
type of error and that's really
straightforward all we need to do is say
error alert error and then we just
change the background color so let's
change this to ff7 777 that's going to
give us a sort of ready pink color and
then we can target alert lot success and
we'll change the background color here
to 5/5 a a 4/4 which is going to give us
a nice green color so we've tackled the
actual positioning of the close button
the actual container the background
colors for different types of alerts but
now what we need to do is go on and look
at actually how we close this element
we're going to be using CSS transitions
to handle this rather than relying on
jQuery to actually transition this away
and we'll get these fully functional so
a user can actually close them so in the
next part we'll be handling the
JavaScript side of this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
