data for your application whether that's
just static content on a page or you
want to add fake data to your database
for testing you know how time consuming
it can be and in fact it is just a waste
of time in this video we're gonna look
at a library called faker which
basically generates fake data and this
is random really easy to get going with
and we'll look at an example of seeding
a database table called articles with
some fake article data now this makes it
really really easy because when you're
in a development environment you're
going to be generating things like
pagination for records and to create
enough records to work with things
effectively it's just going to waste too
much of your time so we'll look more
about faker in just a moment let's first
create the articles table that we want
to seed and then we'll look at how we do
this we'll download faker as a
dependency for our project and we'll get
going with it so let's create this table
quickly it's gonna be called articles
and sequel Pro has generated an ID for
me it's unsigned primary key and auto
increment obviously an integer we're
gonna add small fields like title or D
created and we're gonna be generating a
hundred records here basically with a
refresh of a page and this is gonna be
random enough that you can work with the
data and faker also allows you to
generate tons of other information URLs
email addresses thirst names
company names there's so much that you
can do okay so let's just modify these
we're going to set the title as a
varchar 200 the body is going to be text
and the created out or probably at 8:00
time so we've got our fields ready we're
not gonna enter any records into our
database manually we're gonna let faker
handle this for us so there's a couple
of ways that you can install faker you
can either download the zip from the
github page and include it in your
project and you
use fakers autoloader I wouldn't
recommend this necessarily because using
composure as a dependency manager is so
much easier so let's do this using
composure if you want to do it using the
downloaded zip that's absolutely fine
the concept of using faker is exactly
the same so I happen to have a terminal
window open
I'm currently inside the faker directory
which I have up here and I'm gonna use
composer to search for this package so
make sure you have composer installed
and then we're going to run the composer
search command and we're gonna search
for a faker it's gonna go ahead and look
this up in packages and here is the
library that we want so what we can now
do is go ahead and show more information
about this to determine which version
that we want to download so this shows
the versions here we don't put in the
master we don't pull in perhaps this one
we do want to pull in something like
wonderful star so inside of my text
editor then I'm gonna create a new file
I've already got index dot PHP created
just a blank file create a new file in
here this is going to be my composer
JSON file and we're gonna be pulling
this in as a development requirement not
just a requirement the reason for this
is it's unlikely that in a production
environment we'd want to use this to see
the database you might need to in which
case you can happily include it as a
normal requirement in this case it's
just gonna be on my local computer so
let's then paste this in and remember we
said we wanted one that 4.0 or you could
do wonderful to starve it in this case
we use wonderful at zero and we need to
go ahead and install these dependencies
and there we go so faker has now
downloaded we have a vendor folder
created for us with the library in it
and we also have the composer Auto load
file
so we can easily just include all of our
dependencies in our project so let's get
going then and start using fake currency
what it's capable of I'll obviously need
to require in the composer autoloader if
you've downloaded it from the zip just
go ahead and include it as per the
instructions so we need to instantiate
the factory class which is part of the
fakir namespace so I'm just going to
create a variable called fakir and we
instantiate factory under fakir and we
actually have a static create method
here but that's all we need to do we
don't need to configure anything we
don't need to set anything up we can now
just start looping and using all of the
properties and methods that are
available within this Factory here to go
ahead and or within the fakir library to
actually just generate what we need so
inside of the github page the
documentation is pretty extensive you
can see here that we've got stuff like
lorem ipsum text so we can generate
words sentences just a single sentence
and you'll notice that the type of these
outputs vary so for example if we wanted
to generate a sentence we can choose the
amount of words if we want to generate
sentences we can also choose the amount
of words in this case sorry in this case
we generate an amount of power amount of
sentences if we received something like
paragraph so this is a method that
allows us to define how many paragraphs
we want to generate so say per article
we want to generate 20 paragraphs would
use the paragraphs method provide 20 as
an argument overriding the default 3
this would turn return us an array which
we can then manipulate and in turn to
the database that's exactly what we're
going to be doing we can also generate
things like first names for male and
female address information phone numbers
company information we can generate date
times date times quite interesting
because then you can use that further
manipulator internet thing
so like URLs email addresses usernames
passwords the list goes on and on take a
look at this and see and to be honest
probably most of it will be relevant to
to your data needs so let's start with a
really simple example and generate some
words here so what we need is a loop so
within this loop faker is going to keep
up to date with how many times we've
looped we won't go into that but it will
then generate fake data based on the
amount of time so that property or
method T method is accessed so for
example let's do a for each loop and
let's just stick the range function in
here and say we want to generate one to
100 so this will generate an array with
100 elements and we can just loop that
as X so this will basically loop a
hundred times you can generate say or or
use a for loop if you prefer it's
entirely up to you so let's just take a
look at an example so I'm gonna echo out
faker as we instantiate it up the top
there and I'm gonna say word and then
I'm going to just generate or append on
rather a break so we now get the
following a list of a hundred random
words there we go simple as that but we
want to do a little bit better than that
and we actually want to seed our
database with data and the concept
applies to any data you're working with
so after you finish watching the video
you can go ahead and apply the same
concept to any table any data so the
first thing I want to generate then is a
body for my articles this is the more
complex item that we're going to be
doing because we need a little bit of
manipulation and for this we're going to
be using faker paragraphs and we're
going to generate how many paragraphs or
tell this method how many paragraphs
we've won so in this case then if we
just do a print our on the body this is
going to give us the following so we've
got an array of 20 items full of
paragraphs so we want to do something a
little bit different here because we
don't just plunk loads of an array
arrays into my database table what we
want to do is we want to surround
each of these paragraphs with a
paragraph tag so how do we do that well
we can use the implode function which
will take an array and it will convert
it to a string and join it by the string
that you give it with in this method in
this case I'm going to join it by an
ending paragraph and the starting
paragraph and you might be thinking well
why is that well in this case if I go
ahead and append on a paragraph here and
then end on an ending paragraph here
what this is going to do is it's going
to join it by a starting paragraph and
an ending paragraph then the starting
paragraph then another ending paragraph
so it will basically wrap whatever's
output from this for each key in a
paragraph tag and we can check that by
just echoing Oddie and you'll notice
that because we're doing this within the
browser it will be rendered as HTML we
view the page source you can see here
that we've got a starting paragraph if
we follow this all the way down we've
got an ending paragraph and so on and so
forth so this is now data that's ready
to go into our database
okay so let's before we go on just
create a connection to our database I'm
just going to be using PDO here and
obviously within here we're going to
choose the driver we're gonna choose the
host so localhost or 127.0.0.1 to make
sure that we remove all data from that
database table before we seed it the
reason for this is if you run a cedar
which is essentially what we're creating
in a very simple form we want to remove
everything we've already created and
then recreate it or we're just going to
keep appending more and more to our
database so we'll say DB query and in
here let's say delete from articles
simple so that's going to remove all the
articles then populate the database
so in here then we can create a simple
query we don't need to worry about SQL
injection it's all very rough
we are querying within a loop but we're
not concerned with the performance on a
on a development environment it doesn't
matter if you have to wait a couple of
seconds we're gonna do a simple query
just to insert so insert into articles
we choose a title a body created much
like we created here so title body
created and we then specify the values
in this case then we have a string here
for the title and all I want to do here
for the title is say faker sentence and
we'll say we want 20 words in that
sentence so you can adjust the word
count the next is the body we already
know that we have generated that
surrounded by paragraphs now we want to
go ahead and insert the date/time and if
we go ahead over to the faker library
search for date/time we have a couple of
options here we can use UNIX timestamp
what I'm going to be using is using an
ISO 8601 format which is going to
generate something like this and that's
going to insert a random date into that
record so this is really useful for
things like sorting records by date if
you have that kind of functionality and
you can also set a maximum value as well
in this case the maximum values up till
now up to the present moment so let's go
ahead then and say faker ISO 8601 and
let's just surround like so and there we
go we should be good to go now so we've
generated the body
we've output the sentence here and then
a date as well so running this then is
going to clear the table of any records
that are currently there and then it's
going to go ahead and loop through and
populate that with data so as mentioned
we have a title here of 20
words we have obviously our incrementing
IDs we have a body here which you can
see is just lots of text surrounded by
paragraphs we've already seen this
working and then we have the created
update which within our application mean
what we might want to go and sort so
that's pretty much it we've used faker
in a very basic example to see how we
can populate a database on product
development environment just to test and
play around with data if we don't have
any real data to hand and like I said
there's so much you can do this so check
out the documentation see what you can
generate and this is going to save you a
lot of time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
