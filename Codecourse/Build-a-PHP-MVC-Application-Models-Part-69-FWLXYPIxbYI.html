models and we're going to do this within
our base controller we'll create a
method in here that allows us to load in
a model and then actually in our
controller we can do something with it
update something output something
whatever let's create an example model
first though we've got none at the
moment let's create a one called user
and this is basically just for
demonstration purposes going to contain
a name a public name so this can be set
to once we've been stand - tada er user
model so let's save this as user dot PHP
mmm with a capital u as its class name
user and we'll even all that now so
within our home controller we want to
create a new instance of this user we
want to set a name and then we want to
output that name so it's not very useful
but we are technically updating our
model so what we need to do in here is
we need to have some way of loading in a
model efficiently so we don't have to
require this in ourselves so within our
controller we create a new method to do
this so we have a public function called
model and this is basically in a load
modeling by name so I'll just write
model in here
so let's echo out model for now just to
basically explain how this works
so within our home controller remember
extending our controller here and that's
because we want to make use of the
functionality that's in here this could
be protected to be honest we'll leave it
as public for now but this basically
will echo out model so in here I'm going
to say this model user now what this is
going to do is because we're referring
to this referring to the parent class as
well so that then echoes out user not
useful at the moment but all we really
need to do here is require in this model
so we say app models X dot PHP and X is
obviously going to be the name of the
mod
that we want to require in in this case
its model so once that's required in and
bear in mind we're not doing a file
check here to check if it exists it
doesn't really matter too much at the
moment you can include a file check if
you want so we're going to return a new
model so this is the model name that we
passed in and we'll government returned
that as an object so now this is the
user model so we can do things like user
name equals Alex echo user name there we
are so there we are we've got Alex
despite the fact that we're not we're
not making use of the parameters at the
moment what we could obviously do is say
named echo name and we could then
include a parameter here so that's
interacting with our model so we've now
successfully called the model required
it in returned it to our controller and
we can make use of it inside of here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
