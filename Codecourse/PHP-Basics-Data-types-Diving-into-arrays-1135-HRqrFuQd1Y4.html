array is how to create one access Irate
items and add items onto an array but
let's dive deeper into arrays so we're a
little bit more comfortable working with
them now you'll see arrays everywhere
when you're working with PHP so
understanding how to use manipulate them
is absolutely crucial so first let's
just refresh our memory on the basics we
know that we can create an array by
creating a variable and then assigning
an array to that now we can assign I
didn't mention before but we can assign
an empty array if we want to so let's do
a var dump on names and just see what we
get out in the browser let's take a look
we see that we get an empty array so we
can in fact do this if we wanted to
initialize an array and then add values
to it later on now of course we know
that what we can do is go ahead and
actually assign values when we create an
array and then we see the following when
we go ahead and do a var dump on that
you may also see and I already mentioned
this the array keyword used now this
uses rounded parentheses so it will look
a bit like that so if you do see this
it's exactly the same as what we've
already done you can see that when I go
ahead and refresh here in the browser we
get no difference at all now there's
nothing wrong with using either syntax
but I'm sure you can guess which one's
better the two square brackets are a lot
easier to type and a lot easier to read
and for this reason I always use square
brackets and I'll be doing so throughout
the course so again we know how to
access an array value let's just return
these two square brackets and we'll go
ahead and output the first name here so
let's go ahead and echo out names 0 we
know that that will give us the value
Alex and we've also gone ahead and var
dumped which is why we see both of these
just in here so we also know that along
the way if we wanted to we could go
ahead and add a value to this so for
example if I wanted to add in dial to
this array we know that that will now
give us an array with 3 items and then
we'll be able to access that later on if
we need it ok so let's start to dive
deep in our into
we'll cover different index types we'll
also cover something called
multi-dimensional arrays and we'll also
look at a couple of array functions that
are built into PHP that will help us
along the way
so we know that by doing a var dump we
have something called numerical indexes
so these are just starting from zero and
incrementing upwards so sometimes this
can get a little bit tricky when you're
trying to pick out values but as long as
you know that it starts from zero you
shouldn't have too much trouble now the
reason that we do have numerical indexes
in this case is because we only have
values in our array we haven't specified
that we wanted a particular key because
PHP doesn't know if we want to name
these different values they're
automatically assigned numbers now if we
wanted to create an array that had
specific keys and this is called an
associative array we would do something
like the following so let's get rid of
this now let's say we had a people array
and in here we wanted to store different
people with different values assigned to
them people now what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to bring this down onto a new line
just by hitting return a couple of times
just because it's a little bit easier to
go ahead and type this way and see
what's in the array
okay so previously we did something like
Alex then we had a comma and then we had
say Billy what we're gonna do here is
we're gonna say well Alex I won as the
actual index name and what I've done
here is I've created an equal sign and a
greater than sign and all this does is
it says well I want to assign the value
26 to Alex now let's do the same thing
on a new line with Billy and go ahead
and say 21 so just imagine that these
are ages of these different people let's
do a var dump on this and see how this
looks in terms of what we have now so
now you can see we have an array with
two items in still but this time rather
than numerical index is we have strings
as the index name just here so we have
Alex and Billy and then we have a value
assigned to each of those so the values
of this array are now 26 and 21
and we have keys to finder strings so
why would you want to do this well in
reality if you're working with more
complex data it's nice to be able to
assign keys to this data so we know what
to access now before we were doing
things like echo people 0 which is a
little bit weird because maybe you will
want to access this by a specific key
now let's take a look at what happens
when we do this undefined offset 0
that's because we don't have a numerical
index at 0 now if I was to echo people
Alex we get the value 26 and if I was to
do the same for Billy we get the value
21 if I was to access something that
didn't exist we get an undefined index
rather than an undefined offset that we
saw before so we have an offset and an
index there the technical names for
either a numerical index or a string
like this okay so now that we roughly
know how to do this let's look at a more
complicated but real life example let's
say we have a list of users that could
come from our application that could
come from anywhere maybe the database
and these users had different properties
so again I'm going to create an array
just here and down here what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna create an array as the
first element of this array so this
might seem a little bit confusing but
just bear with me so I'm gonna say the
the username for this first user is Alex
and then on the next line I'm gonna
create the same thing like this but
assign it a new username so what we're
saying now is if I just pull this up so
we can kind of see what's going on like
so rather than saying Alex here and
Billy here we're creating an array
within another array like so so now
what's happening is if I just pull this
down onto a line so it's a little bit
more readable if we do a var dump on
users we should see the following so we
have an array of two items but the first
item now a numerical index is an array
and the second item again a numeral
index is another array now what we've
done here is essentially created a much
more powerful structure we can iterate
over this and then go ahead and access
username if we wanted to and we could do
that for each of these users so when for
example you see a website that lists
through a list of users or a list of
forum topics or anything like that this
is pretty much what's going on behind
the scenes so as a basic example then
let's access the first user and then
grab their user name now if we just try
this out we know that we now have a
numerical index because we've not
assigned a value to an index we could
have done that but we've just created
two arrays within an array if we were to
echo out say users zero we know that
that first value is an array so the
question is then how do we access the
user name key because remember now user
zero is an array and again we can do a
VAR dump on that and we've seen we now
have an array not with a numerical index
but with a string as its index name so
we can echo out users 0 because we now
have an array inside of here we just
again use square brackets and we can
access the user name property that would
give us Alex
so we're saying the first element at key
0 then within this new array the key
that has the value user name so we can
do the same thing for the next user by
just changing this over to 1 because it
still has the same property inside of
here we get Billy there we go now what
you're actually doing here is you are
creating a multi-dimensional array all
that means is you're placing an array
within an array it has multiple
dimensions if that terms sounded scary
before you should now be able to see
that it's not really that complicated at
all so we can actually build onto this
and create more levels of this and at
the moment each of these users just have
a single property but what if they also
had an email address
now again what I'm gonna do is just get
rid of this one here I'm gonna get rid
of this and I'm gonna go ahead and I'm
gonna pull this down and indent it this
just makes it look a little bit more
readable now I can define out another
property to this particular user so for
example Alex at Code course comm like so
and now I can copy this because remember
this is still the first element of this
users array and I can duplicate this
down here and then I can change this
over so Billy Billy at Koko's comm so
now if we take a look at this here users
go ahead and give that refresh this
looks a little bit more complicated now
before I go any further with this what
I'm gonna do is if you are seeing output
pretty much like this there's a nicer
way to go ahead and output this there
are a couple of other ways you can do
this but the easiest way if you don't
have a particular PHP extension
installed to format this nicely is to go
ahead and echo out Kri so these are
format tags with an HTML so it will
preserve the formatting and then we can
say pre like that now notice I'm also
using commas here we can actually use
commas to kind of caseinate when we echo
out but you can of course do the
following with dots what we're basically
saying here is whatever we've are done
we want to wrap this in an HTML pre tag
and preserve the formatting of the var
dump output but just to keep this nice
and simple let's go ahead and use commas
here because I think otherwise it
probably won't work so if we head over
to the browser
give this a refresh you can now see that
this looks a little bit easier so it's
easier to see what's going on here so
again we still have an array with two
elements the first element is an array
so this is a key or index 0 this is an
array now with two items in a username
and an email the next element is an
array with two items in username and
email so now what we can do is start to
access these different things from
within here so if you want to challenge
yourself try and access the second users
email address if you want to pause the
video and go ahead and try that if you
follow
along try that now and we'll go come
back to this in just a second okay so
hopefully you went ahead and tried that
out but what I'm gonna do is test this
out now and we'll see how we did so I'm
gonna echo out users we know that we
have 0 &amp;amp; 1 so we want to access 1 and
then because we have that email in there
now we just do the following let me just
comment this one out you give that a
refresh and there we go so really it's
just about looking at the structure of
your array and drilling down into it how
you need to now what I'm gonna do is go
one level deeper just so we can drill
this in let's say we had each of these
users has a set of likes so things that
they like now in this case this is
perfect for an array because we might
have strings that we want to store in
here so what I'm gonna do is in here
create another array and I'm gonna have
to find out a couple of likes so let's
say cats and food let's do the same
thing for Billy as well so let's say
likes and just keep this structure the
same so we're gonna save the he likes
books and likes cats brilliant so now we
have the following so we have two items
still but now we have an array with
three items for the first person and
this has a username and email and likes
but the likes in here now is another
array with two items in so you can nest
these as much as you want it really
depends on how complex the data
structure you're working with is but in
this case we now have two arrays within
an array we have one inside another
inside another okay so to access the
first like here for Alex how would we do
this but again we just drill down into
it so again let me comment this one out
I'm gonna go ahead and I come out users
the first user is 0 now before we did
something like accessing the email but
now we want to access the likes this is
now an array so if we were to echo this
we get an irate a string conversion but
to get the first like we just chained
this on again 0 is the
like and we end up with cats okay so
hopefully that makes sense if it doesn't
take a really good look at this build up
your own data structures and try and
access certain things now most of the
time you're not going to be building
that these up yourself so you have to
kind of get used to doing a VAR dump on
data that you get back from somewhere
and then working out how you're gonna
loop over it now what we're gonna do now
is take a quick quick peek at a loop
obviously an array like this is useless
without being able to do something with
it and in this case we'd probably want
to list through the users and then show
them in the browser so what I'm gonna do
is get rid of that VAR dump just down
there and I'm going to use something
called a for each loop now we're gonna
be looking at these much more detail
later on so don't worry if it doesn't
quite make sense at the moment but
basically we'll want to see for each
thing we want to call that something and
then within this block here we can do
something with it
so in this case we say for each user's
which is a plural as user which is a
singular and then in here from that user
for each time this loops
it will now be this for the first loop
and it will be this for the second loop
so let's just do a var dump on user
within this block and see what happens
so let's go over to the browser give
that a refresh and we now have this on
the first loop and then we have this on
the second loop for it Alex and Billy
and if we added more we would get three
loops or four loops or however many
users we have so now that we know that
we've got user in here what we can do is
access user name email or likes and then
drill down into that further so for
example we know that each user has a
user name let's go ahead and echo out
user user name and what I'm actually
gonna do is I'm gonna concatenate on an
HTML break you don't have to do this
but this will just put it onto a new
line for us so let's go over refresh now
we have Alex and Billy
so rather than individually accessing
these items we're now
looping over these so let's leave things
for here now we're gonna be covering
looping on a race later when we look at
loops but just finally I want to talk
about modifying a slightly more complex
array like this
we already saw earlier that we can do
something like users and then use the
assignment operator to add a new user
but what happens if the data structure
is a little bit more complicated like
this is well we can pretty much do the
same thing so let's just copy this just
here let's copy this structure and let's
say we'll users I want to add on this
array just here so again this might look
a little bit complicated but take a
minute just have a look at what this
looks like let's just change this over
so let's give this a new name and let's
go ahead and add in some more interests
let's say reading and cooking okay so
now if we just do a var dump but using
our pre tags to preserve the formatting
of our dump on users and again we want
to end that tag just there then we will
see and you use it in there now you
don't have to keep the same structure
but in this case because we'd
potentially be looping over this users
array we would want all of the same
properties and if this data was coming
from a database you'd likely find that
you would have all of these values in
here
so now let's say we want to just take
this and place it into the original
array so it doesn't matter whether we've
placed it into the original array or
we've added it on later as we've just
seen of course we know this is going to
work in exactly the same way however
what I want to do now is I want to
modify the value in one of these items
how do we do that
well we know that very simply we can do
something like users let's say - so that
would be Josh just here equals and we
could set this to anything so let's just
set it to Josh and see what happens so
now notice that we just have a string in
there so that's the basics of modifying
even a more complex array just works in
exactly the same way but what I want to
do is kind of drill down and modify say
books here
or cats here so let's modify this value
here for Billy from cats to dogs so in
this case what would we do well we would
say users we would pick that user so
this is 0-1 like so then we would go
into this into likes so again we use
that by its key and then the likes we
have 0 &amp;amp; 1 so here we would say 1 and
then we would assign that the value dogs
so now if we look at this we have Billy
here likes books and cats give that a
refresh he now likes dogs and of course
you could do the same here with the
username email address any other
properties that you've stored for a user
you can even add more properties onto
this if you wanted to so for example
I'll give you a very very brief example
let's say we wanted to add a bio or an
About section to Billy we would say well
uses 1 because we know that that's Billy
and then we would just say about and
then in here we would assign a new value
so I am learning to code now we have the
following a string in here as well I am
learning to code and we could just as
easily go and echo that out as well
using the same structure so go ahead and
try this yourself play around with this
and get really comfortable with working
with arrays I've shown you pretty much
everything you need to be able to
actually manipulate create/update arrays
and really now it's just about
practicing now naturally there are a lot
more we can do with arrays they're very
very powerful but we will be covering
that when we look at looping through
arrays and when we look at array
functions a little bit later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
