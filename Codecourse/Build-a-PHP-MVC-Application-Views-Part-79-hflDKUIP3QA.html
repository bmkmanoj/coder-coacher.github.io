what we've been doing so far is actually
outputting data within our controller
which is a massive no no we don't want
to do this what we do want to do is send
variables to our view which we can then
output without too much logic within our
view obviously you will get some kind of
logic in your view like looping well not
logic but you know doing things like
that but generally we do all of the
logic inside of our controller or our
model the controller handles that and
then we go ahead and render the view so
we've interacted with our model we've
updated the name of it based on the
parameter we sent through from the URL
now we want to load in a model and we're
going to create a method in here at load
interview sorry we're going to create a
method in here that will do that so we
want to create a new public function
this time called view and again we have
a view name here and we also have data
that we want to pass through to the view
we'll deal with this in just a moment so
it's really as easy as requiring in a
view basically that we've created so
let's create a view very very quickly we
know that we've got a views folder
inside of our app directory we've got a
home folder as well let's create a new
file with this home and call it
index.php and let's just echo out hello
here eventually we'll replace this with
the name so when we call a view we want
to say this view home index now bear in
mind that this has no correlation with
this at all it's not related what we're
doing here is essentially providing a
directory path so it's home index we
could call this bananas for we care and
here we just call index bananas but
let's say home index so this is calling
the view method on the controller that
we've extended so all we want to do here
is require in app views X PHP now X can
be a directory path so home slash index
this case we're just going to say view
so this will include in-app views slash
home slash index dot PHP to slash home
slash index dot PHP and data will then
automatically be available within this
view because we've passed it through to
this method so now what we can actually
do is well we'll check if it works first
because that's important now you can see
here that we're actually getting an
error we're seeing a missing argument
two for controller view now the reason
for that is the inside of our controller
we've got our data here which we
actually need to automatically define as
an empty array because sometimes we
might not want to pass data through to
our view we might just want to show a
page in this case that will then fix
that problem what we now want to do is
take this first parameter here pass this
through to our view and output it so
inside of here we want to create an
array and I'm going to say name is user
name so this is coming from our model
that we interacted with earlier we set
the name here and we're outputting it
here so obviously it's use the
functionality but we're just
demonstrating how this might work
so now inside of index dot PHP we can
actually output this so we say data name
and that's it so when we refresh it says
hello Billy we can do the same we can
change this if we want it so that is how
we pass in data to our view we don't
have to pass data to 12 you we've used
our view method on our base controller
to require in the view that we request
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
