actually selecting data specifically
from this table that we've created and
what we're gonna do is first of all
select everything and then we can look
at bringing back only the things that we
actually need so the first command that
we're going to do is select start and
asterisks from and then we're going to
define the table name and this case
obviously its articles okay so let's
take a look at this so select basically
just selects data and Astrix means
select all columns so star means
basically all columns not all records
there's different ways to limit data
which will look a bit later and from
obviously you know it's obvious it
defines which table that we want to get
the data from so in this case what it's
going to do is it's going to give us
this nice little ASCII table and we can
now see the data we inserted into our
table earlier in this case it shows us
that we've got one row we've got a name
and description of created at and an ID
now let's just talk a little bit through
this because we know that we created
these columns specifically defined the
data types and the ID particularly we
can go back and check this auto
increment in a moment so name is
obviously a strain in description string
they're pretty straightforward but
remember in the last video we use the
now function to define the Creator that
date and time and you can now see that
the Creator that shows the year the
month a day the hour the minutes and the
seconds that this field was actually
herb this record was actually inserted
now ID although we didn't specifically
define it when we inserted the data is
now also incremented to one obvious have
started 0 increments to 1 so we've now
started at one this record is now
identified always by the value 1 so
let's go ahead and just insert some more
data and just check this chick support
what we're doing here so I'm just going
to go and say I don't know introduction
to PHP or something like that and let's
go ahead and create another description
so if you need to get started with phb
this article should help you okay so now
let's go back to our select star from
articles command or select a Strix from
articles command and you can now see
that we've got two records here let's
just go ahead and increase the width of
this say 140 and it's run that command
again so that just gives us a bit more
room but we can see now that we've got
two records and the bottom we say it
says two rows in set and we now see that
we've got the Creator that time and date
is different obviously and the ID is now
2 for this second record so that's
another unique identify added for this
record so we've got two records two
unique identifiers the data that we
inserted and we can see this visually
within the MySQL monitoring this nice
little ASCII table and so we can use
select staff of that now what if we need
to go ahead and select specific fields
only so let's say I wanted to get all
records but I was only interesting
getting the name in the description or
some or you know any combination of
these from this database table so
instead of saying select asterisks I
need to go ahead and say select and I
need to come and separate the fields
that I want to return so in this case i
can say name comma description from
articles so Asterix basically means in
all columns this will now only select me
the name in the description so you can
see that now compared to the table above
we're missing the created at an ID
column and we can see the name and the
description so that's how we select data
from our MySQL table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
