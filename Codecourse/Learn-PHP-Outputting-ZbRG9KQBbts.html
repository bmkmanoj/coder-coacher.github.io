content to a page now and we're gonna
look at three main ways that we might be
able to do this we're gonna look at the
most basic form of just outputting a
string or a an integer float a variable
to a page but we could just gonna look
out putting strings in this case and
then going to include the ability to
concatenate both using comma separated
values for echo and also the dot
notation to concatenate strings and then
finally we'll look at the complex syntax
which basically allows you to output
things like array values within a string
inside of curly brackets so you know
this sounds very difficult but in
practice is actually very easy which
method you use depends on first of all
which standards of code code standard
you're following and also depends on how
you're actually outputting and what
you're actually outputting
if things start to get a little bit more
complicated then you might choose a
different method as long as you're
consistent in the way you're outputting
generally then you're fine but let's
take a look at a very basic example of
outputting so let's just go ahead and
just echo out a string an echo will
basically just outputs whatever you
specify after it to a page so in this
case if I use single quotes or I use
double quotes this basically is a
notation for a string so in this case
I'll just put output my name and let's
head over to our browser and just
refresh this and see what we see what we
get out so if we refresh the page now
you can see that we just see Alex here
and if we view the source of this page
we just see Alex on line one and that is
it so the same thing works with single
quotes but obviously using single quotes
and double quotes is is you know it's
not as easy as just saying I want to
include single quotes so I want to
include double quotes so for example if
i was using double quotes that's just
two double quotes and i was to say i'm
now this is perfectly valid because we
have a double quote here we have a
double quote here and a single quote
just in here between these two
characters so this works as expected now
what happens if I want to output
something in single quotes and I also
want to use a single quote inside of
this string and what's going to happen
here is we're gonna basically this will
error if we just go back to this page so
this will error so we get a parse error
a syntax error unexpected M T underscore
string expecting a comma or a semicolon
so what on earth does this mean well
what's happening here is it's seeing
this part here as a string and it's
expecting us to either end the line with
a semicolon which we do in PHP or it's
expecting us to concatenate this or or
provide an additional string to output
with a comma so this would work but
we're still faced with the problem that
we don't have our single quote between
the I and the M so how can we combat
this if we want to use single quotes on
the outside but want to use a single
quote on the inside well we can use
character escaping for this so if we use
a backslash just before the character
that we want to escape this doesn't take
into account the fact that we have the
single quotes on the outside and
therefore this isn't isn't affecting the
fact the reason single quotes when we
refresh now we see this single quote now
you'll probably think oh well it's
easier to just use double quotes and in
actual fact it is but then what happens
if we want to use a double quote within
this string so for example if I wanted
to enclose Alex in double quotes what's
going to happen here well we're gonna
receive a very similar error unexpected
Alex T string and again the same reason
as before so how do we combat this well
we can of course is
these characters as we saw with a single
quote and then this works as normal so
generally if you're just working with
strings like this escaping characters is
perfectly acceptable but remember that
if you are doing it this way then you
need to keep to doing this there is a
the here dock syntax which we'll look at
later and basically that allows us to
use single or double quotes in
conjunction with each other and not have
to use escaping so that's the basics of
outputting within a string either with
single or double quotes and we've also
looked at escaping now let's take a look
actually concatenate in or out putting
multiple values within echo now just as
a side note we can also use print and
you might see this used different places
there's no real difference between doing
this but there are some subtle
differences we're not going to go into
them too much but we're just going to
stick with echo it might be worthwhile
looking in the PHP documentation about
print and echo and an understanding the
differences between them okay so now
what we're going to do is we're going to
remove what we've done so far but we're
going to output I am now what happens if
I want to perhaps include a variable and
concatenate it onto this string so let's
just go ahead and create a variable will
explain variables again at another point
but in this case I'm just gonna set this
variable to the string Alex
so in this case what I want to do is I
want to say I am space and I want to
concatenate on or append if you like
onto this echo language construct so
there's two ways that we can do this
with echo we can use comma separated
values so we could actually say Alex and
we've already seen this what moment ago
when we looked at the single and double
quote differences but this would work as
normal you'll just see if we open up our
browser it says I am Alex however what
we can also do is we can include things
like variables here which will then take
into account what value we have stored
in the variable and we'll output
whatever we have stored there so we can
change this around
and refresh and we get we get the
expected output now what we can also do
is we can use the dot notation like this
and essentially what this is doing is
its concatenate in the string whereas
before we were effectively passing
multiple values to echo so this would be
the first value this would be the second
value we're passing them in there just
being concatenated if you like an output
but we can use concatenation like this
where it makes sense so again there's no
real difference between well there is
but there's no real difference in the
results that we get from this it would
work perfectly in this exactly the same
way if we were to use the single or the
the sorry the comma or the dot notation
but really it's preference and how it
looks and everything like that generally
it's better to comma separate simply
because when you're concatenated it's
probably a little bit slower it's
entirely unnoticeable probably but it
also looks a little nicer if we come and
separate but again it's personal
preference and it depends on which
coding standards you're following or
which coding standard your team as a
whole is decided to work with or you in
fact as an individual so now that we've
done that we'll go ahead and we'll look
at the curly braces or the complex
syntax now this isn't actually complex
but basically what it allows us to do is
provide complex expressions and include
these inside of a string so for example
i'm gonna say i am alex this is what
we've seen before we're just using
double quotes however what happens if i
again have this name variable up here
and i want to go ahead and include this
name variable within here without either
comma separating or concatenation on
with the dot notation well in this case
what i can actually do is provide curly
braces within here and then use a
complex inside of this so this is just
outputting a variable inside of here but
we can you also work with arrays objects
no anything like that within inside of
this complex syntax so in this case it
just
I am Alex and again this looks a lot
neater so for example I'm gonna say town
equals London and I'm gonna say I am
named and I live in town so it looks a
lot nicer than having two comma separate
or concatenate strings on here when i
refresh this works as expected so as we
said this also works with arrays so what
we can actually do is we can create a
variable full of arrays so for example
age and this isn't a useful use case but
if we had say 20 25 30 in here what we
can actually do is say something like I
am and then in here we can set age and
access say the first element of age so
we can do things like this within these
within these complex this complex syntax
so we won't worry too much about that
for now but basically we've looked at
the ways that we can actually output to
a page in PHP and how we do that
basically using the echo language
construct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
