mailing now you probably learn about the
mail function and this is I'd practice
for a variety of different reasons one
of which being emails sent with a mail
function are often sent to the directly
to the spam folder so we're gonna get
rid of that and we're going to use an
external library now we have a few
choices the two main ones the people
like to use a PHP mailer and swift
mailer
I prefer PHP mailer so we're going to be
using that in this example now I already
have my PHP mailer installed all you
have to do is either use composer or go
to the github repo and download it
directly but as long as you have your
files there and you include the dip
we're going to go ahead and start this
up so we're gonna say mail equals new
PHP mailer I'm going to instantiate the
class we're going to set is NTP and
we're going to say mail host which for
Gmail by the way I'm going to be using
Gmail for this tutorial you can use any
mail provider including your own web
host as long as it supports SMTP so I
think gmail is smtp.gmail.com we're
going to set mail SMTP auth equals true
these are pretty much self-explanatory I
don't really need to explain what they
mean we're going to say mail username
and this is the email address that
you've used so mine is t harvey 136
gmail.com are you going to say mail
password and I just set mine to my
password 1 2 3 which I'll be changing by
the way but obviously that's just the
password that you use for your email
account next thing that we need to do is
set mail to SMTP secure this is going to
be TLS and we'll move this up here just
to be loved and more organized next
thing that we want to do is set mail
from and this is just going to be the
same as my email address but this can be
pretty much and
thing don't say mail from name we're
gonna say Terry again this could be
anything and then we're going to
actually send an email so we're going to
send the mail so we're going to add an
address add address and I have another
account open in an incognito window and
this is called mr. Terry havi gmail.com
we're going to say male subject and this
is self-explanatory again just the
subject of the email so my subject here
we're going to say male body this is my
body and then we're going to say mail
send and we're going to set this to a
variable and this variable will read and
this function here will return a boolean
true or false
whether the email was sent successfully
so we're just going to say if is sent
ago mail successfully sent we move on
say else and the error the card please
try again later so let's test this out
let's go back to our browser hit refresh
mail successfully sent so if we go to
our emails click this there we go
you
so if we go back to our browser refresh
again check our emails
there's our bold text</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
