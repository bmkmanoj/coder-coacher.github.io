a progress bar with CSS that looks like
this and we're going to use transitions
as well to make sure that when we do
come to animate this perhaps with
JavaScript or something we can actually
make it you know look relatively smooth
so you can see at the moment that I've
got width here just set of a 74% this is
basically what the bar looks like I'll
zoom in just a little bit we've got sort
of like an outline here with a little
bit of shadow in line just to give it a
sort of 3d effect and then we've just
got this solid nice blue color bar here
so that's what it looks like and when we
go ahead and animate if you just see now
the transition will take place as I
change the width so I just removing the
width down like this and back up again
and we get this lovely smooth transition
that looks really really nice across
most browsers now if you don't have
transitions you know within a browser
for example an older version of ie this
doesn't matter because it'll still look
exactly the same in older browsers you
just won't see the smooth effect that
you get when you transition so this will
look the same it will function the same
that you know it'll look absolutely fine
you just want to go the transition but
the transition is just an added
enhancement here so let's jump straight
over to our code and start writing the
code out for this okay so over to our
text editor we're going to start
completely from scratch here so I'm
going to go ahead and define the doctype
here an html5 doctype and then use our
HTML tags to wrap the entire page we'll
go ahead and give this a head as well
and we'll create a title inside of here
so we'll just give that up like title of
CSS progress bar or something ok so the
next thing to do is go ahead and create
the body this is where our content will
sit this is where our container will sit
we're gonna create a container with a
width of 400 pixels just to contain this
because naturally what this progress bar
will do is fill a hundred percent the
width the element is contained within so
let's go ahead and just define this
contain you know we'll just use a div
here and give this a class of container
go ahead and end that and then within
here this is
where our bar is going to sit so if we
just type in bar there preview the page
and that's what we that's what we get at
the moment nothing special so we'll now
go ahead and link in a stylesheet and
then we'll go ahead and create that in a
moment so we say link rel equals style
sheet that's what this is and then the
location of the style sheet now we have
created a style sheet yet so let's go
ahead and create a new document and
we'll go ahead and save this in a new
folder within this directory within CSS
and we'll call this main dot CSS okay so
now what we'll do is go ahead and define
the container Styles and all we need to
do here is give this a width of 400
pixels so this container will now be 400
pixels wide we can then go ahead and
refresh and you can see now that we
should if we refresh now of course we
need to link a style sheet in so if we
do CSS /we main dot CSS that will link
house styles in and then we have a 400
pixel container so now what we're gonna
do is go ahead and start writing the
stands for the bar what we need to do
first to sort of work out what kind of
markup we need to add here for this to
actually work we're gonna have two
elements a bar and a bar fill so bar
will be the outer element that we saw
the Grays or background with the shadow
and the bar fill will be the colored bar
in them in the middle so blue for
example or red or green or whatever
color you want to give it that will also
fill that element so the first thing I'm
going to do is to find the bar itself
and then we're gonna go ahead and I'm
gonna give this a span this isn't gonna
be a div element it's just gonna be a
span there's no real particular reason
but one of the reasons I guess is this
the bar is just really I sort of you
know that the point of it being there is
just that it's a fill bar so it makes a
lot more sense to have a span within
here you can give this a div it doesn't
really matter or this can be a div if
you want doesn't really matter but it
sort of helps to visually separate this
as well so we'll go ahead and give it
give this a span and this is going to be
a class of bar fill and you can of
course target bar with a spanner
but it's probably not a good idea to
just say you know bar span when we come
to our CSS selectors and we'll call this
bar fill in case this needs to be
another element so we give the soft
flexibility there okay so the first
thing to our guess now is then just
style up the actual bar itself so like I
said we're gonna give this a width of a
hundred percent and what that's gonna do
is just fill the container and we'll go
ahead and give this a background and
I've chosen the light gray color
EEE and if we go ahead and just give
this some padding quickly that will give
us this element on the page that we can
sort of take a look at so we now know
that we've got this container we've got
the bar in the middle which is the green
highlighted area there and that's taking
up a hundred percent width of the
container that is in and obviously we've
got that background on there as well and
now the height of the bar will be
determined by the fill so we'll we'll
create the fill in moment and that will
go ahead and and do this so before we do
anything else here let's go ahead and
just start to play around with the fill
element so we want to give this a height
that will determine you know how high
this is and what it will look like so we
can say something like height twenty
pixels and what we then need to do is
say display:block because we've given
this a span element which by default is
an inline so if we just get rid of this
you'll see we can check this out here
we've got a display of inline here under
the computed styles so we need to go
ahead and give that a a display of block
so that'll allow us to define the height
in the padding if we need any or
anything like that so now that we've
done that let's go ahead and give this a
background and see what it looks like
so I've chosen corn flour blue which is
quite a nice color like this so you
can't actually see anything at the
moment so let's take a look
ah there we go that's because I've spelt
that wrong so if we go ahead and take a
look now so now we've got the if we just
zoom in here we've now got this bar and
then the bar fill in the middle this
nice blue color but it's still not
looking right it doesn't it sort of just
looks like a long blue rectangle at the
mode
so we need to go ahead and give this a
couple of adjustments so I want to do is
I want to go ahead I'll just give this a
width of you know say 60% or something
like that just so we can see how it
looks when it's shorter so we're not
filling the entire length of this we'll
also go ahead and give this a border
radius of 3 pixels that will just soften
the edges of that a little bit so that's
what it looks like now if we zoom in you
can see it starting to look a little bit
nicer with the softer edges here and we
can start adding the shadow to this area
as well in a moment so if we go ahead
and under the bar maybe give this a
border radius as well because we want
the whole thing to sort of you know
match up if you like so if i refresh now
you can see that the whole thing's got a
border radius and it just generally
looks a little bit nicer a bit sort of
easier on the eye if it's got that
radius in there the last thing we want
to do though is give this before we do
the transitions is give this a little
bit of a shadow and this is just going
to define this a lot nicely and it's
going to be a lot easier to sort of you
know look at so with the bar let's go
ahead and give this a box shadow now
we're gonna give this an inset shadow
because obviously by default if we were
to give this a shadow it would be on the
outside we want to give this an inset
shadow what we want to do is define the
X and the y-axis which are going to be
naught on 1 and then we wanted to find
the blur the spread and that's gonna be
3 pixels if we take a look at that we
can very clearly see how this has how
this looks so you know it's it's filled
out you know this top area the reason I
chose 0 pixels for the x-axis is because
if it's 1 it sort of fills this part
here I want that sort of be in there a
little bit and give more of a shadow on
this side so that's how it looks without
you know with a harsh line obviously not
very nice at the moment but if we go
ahead and we define an RGBA value so
we've got red green blue and alpha we're
gonna see 0 0 0 0 that's black and then
I'm gonna say Point 2 which is the Alpha
value and that's just going to give it a
nice soft you know a light color here so
Simon pasty in there and that's sort of
defined that really nicely without
King too much like we've given that a
box shadow which is nice so that's the
visual side of things done but what we
now want to do is apply the transition
and because if if you know when we look
to the first part the tutorial I changed
the width here this is very sort of
rigid and very solid as I moved the
width up and down inside my element
inspector what we want to do is go ahead
and give this a transition so we apply
the transition to the bar fill and we
use the transition property like this
and we go ahead and define what property
we want to transition we then define the
speed and I'm gonna say 0.8 seconds and
then we're gonna give these sort of ease
here so this is just ease so we've got a
transition here this does at the time of
recording require the WebKit prefix
vendor prefix for some browsers or some
older slightly older versions of
browsers I think Safari at the time for
recording so we just do that but with
the WebKit vendor prefix and now what's
gonna happen is when we refresh and
alter this value you'll see that we get
this nice smooth action as we go up and
down with the values so they you know
depending on how fast your progress bar
is moving you'll get that lovely smooth
motion so that's basically it for the
progress bar we've built a nice visually
looking at progress bar with a nice
little shadow here we've given some
border radius this works perfectly in
all other browsers back to ie 7 it works
really really nicely you just won't get
the border radius the box shadow in the
transition which is fine because it
still looks fine it's still easy to see
now if we want to play around with this
a little bit we can do so let's go ahead
and just set the progress bar now this
isn't necessarily it's just a bit of fun
in the console I'm gonna set the width
to 0% and I'm gonna go ahead and I'm
just gonna muck around in the console
and play around with this so I'm gonna
save our bar so sort of setting a
variable here this is going to be
document dot query selector and I'm
gonna select the elements a bar fill so
now that we've got bar that's that's
basically this span within it and what
we can actually do here is we can go
ahead
maybe set some kind of interval or
something like that so first I'm gonna
set a width to 0 these are all Global's
we're just playing around here so I've
set a width to 0 and I'm gonna go ahead
and create an interval here and we'll go
ahead and give it a callback in here and
this is gonna be every 50 milliseconds
now within this interval what's what's
gonna happen here is the width is gonna
increment so I'm gonna say width equals
width plus 1 and then gonna come down
here and I'm gonna go ahead and set the
width of the bar so I'm gonna say Bar
dot style dot width equals and then it's
something percent so this is with
percent that's basically all we need to
do and then down here I'm gonna go ahead
and create a little if statement and
this is going to be if width is greater
than or equal to 100
I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to
clear interval on the interval which is
the one we just created there and I'm
also going to go ahead if I just bring
this down just to make it look a little
bit easier to read I'm going to set the
width to zero again so well that's going
to do is it's gonna basically make our
progress bar go all the way up as it may
do you know if you were controlling this
JavaScript when it hits 100% width is
set back to zero and the interval is
cleared so we can go ahead and run that
again if we want you know providing
reset width back to zero again but
that's basically that so yeah I mean
that's a little bit of fun but that's
basically how the element looks let's go
ahead and set that back to 60% we can
just see that now anyone its glory so
that's a CSS progress bar and how we
might animate it using javascript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
