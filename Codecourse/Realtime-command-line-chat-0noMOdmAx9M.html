just having a look at how this works and
then we are going to set up a pub nub
account create an app go ahead and
install their SDK and we're ready to
start building this thing so I'm just
going to bring up a terminal on either
side I just have this split so I can
very easily work with it and I'm just
gonna run this file using PHP like so so
I'm gonna do this on both sides
assuming that two people are using this
even across the other side of the world
so I'm gonna join a particular room so
there's the ability to have multiple
rooms in here and I'm gonna go ahead and
connect with a username and that will go
ahead and connect me to that room with
that particular username so I can do the
same thing on this side I'm going to
join the same room but I'm gonna use a
different username and this also has the
ability to check if a user already has a
username taken so it will just ask you
to enter a new one so now I can do is
just start typing away and it works and
I can do this on the other side as well
and it's very very quick this is
actually in real time so just to exit we
just do a command + C and we're out and
we can go ahead and connect again if we
want let's just take a look at the
username checking that I just spoke
about so if I just very quickly
reconnect to someone this is actually
going to be taken it just takes a while
to get rid of that user but if I go
ahead and connect to as Billy which we
can see over here then it says username
taken and we can go ahead and choose a
different name so that is pretty much it
but to be able to do all of this we need
a very good service that allows for
real-time communication and for this
we're going to be using PubNub so what I
recommend you do is go ahead and sign up
for an account what I really love about
this is that you don't have to enter a
card you don't have to pay for anything
to get started testing this out so go
ahead and sign in and we'll go over and
start to create an app now the first
thing that you'll notice when you sign
in is a demo project that's already been
created for you so what we can do is go
ahead and click on this and you can see
here we have a demo key set essentially
all these are just the public or the
publish key and the subscribe key that
we can use when we download the piece
HP SDK now we're gonna be taking a
little bit of a look around this later
when we start to test out some messages
we can actually come over to this debug
console and actually check this out so
once we have these set up so what we
need to do then is download the PHP SDK
and we are of course doing this with
composer so if you go over to github
I'll leave a link to all of these in the
course downloads you'll find the PubNub
PHP SDK so the package name here is just
PubNub forward slash PubNub so if you
come over to your terminal inside of the
directory that you're working in I've
currently cleared this out so we're
starting completely from scratch you
want to run composer require and then
paste this in and we'll wait for this to
download okay so now that this is done
we need to create our chat file you can
see here that we've got a composer JSON
file with the PubNub package in there
and the version we have a composer lock
file and we have our autoload that we
can go ahead and put in so i'm gonna
create a new file we only need one file
for this entire thing and we're just
gonna call this chat dot PHP so we need
to pull in the pub nub library because
we actually need to work with this so
I'm going to use PubNub slash PubNub
that's just the namespace to the class
and then we're gonna create a new
instance of this so we can use it so
we're gonna say PubNub and we are going
to create a new pub nub instance and
into this we need to pass in our keys so
let's go over to PubNub and have a look
here so if we click on this you can see
we've got our publish key just here this
is the first argument this I'm just
going to pull this down so it's a little
bit easier and then we have our
subscribe key just here so let's copy
this and paste it into here and then
finally we have our secret key which of
course you don't want to reveal to
anyone so if you need any more
information on the public library of
course there are lots and lots of
helpful things in here for you to look
at we're gonna be covering what we need
to get this working but of course if you
want to go use this going forward
then go ahead and read this and of
course read the official document
so now we are pretty much set up so we
can subscribe to a channel and start
listening to things and in the next part
we're actually going to pull all of this
together there isn't a lot of code at
all so let's go over and build this chat
so just before we start to pull this
together in the last part what we didn't
do is require in the vendor autoload
folder which means everything set up
here properly but it just won't be able
to find this particular class so before
we get started I'm just gonna do a
require on vendor auto load dot PHP and
we're good to go now what I want to
start out with is how we actually run
this file now we saw in the demo that I
did something like chat PHP now at the
moment we get a permission denied on
this because it's not an executable file
so how do we change this well at least
on a UNIX based system we say chmod plus
X and then we choose the name of the
file this will just change the
permissions so now what's going to
happen is when I run this again you can
see that it works but we get a new error
and of course this is because we're not
running this with PHP now it's entirely
up to you how you structure this but you
can do that and it works but I'd prefer
to do that it's a little bit easier so
the way that we get around this is
inside of our PHP file just at the top
we say to this well what do we want to
run this file with if it's just run on
its own and to do this we use a hash
bang and then the location to PHP and in
my case it's user local bin PHP it may
be different for you but this should
work so now I can run chat on its own
and it works as normal great okay so I'm
just going to pull this up a line just
so we don't get that space output and
we're ready to start building the rest
of the chap so before we even do
anything I want to talk about pub nubs
subscribe method and then we're going to
take a look at a problem that this is
going to cause us so to subscribe to a
particular room we just say it's very
very simple PubNub subscribe and then we
go ahead and give the name of the room
so
just to test this out we're going to use
chat and then we have a callback just in
here and from this we get a payload
which is the payload whenever a message
is pushed to this channel so now inside
of here we can return either true or
false now returning true will basically
just allow us to constantly poll for
messages whereas if we return false it's
going to break out of this now it's
really important to note at this point
that this is a blocking line of code it
will block the execution of whatever
we're running and we can prove this by
echoing something just down under here
just say hello and if we go and run this
in the command like so you can see that
just nothing's happening it's just
hanging so this is blocking the
execution of our script now there's a
way to get around this in PHP and that's
by creating a sub process and that's
exactly what we're going to be doing if
you think about the way a chat
application works you need to allow the
user to type at any given point but you
need to be constantly listening for any
messages that are sent to that channel
and then you need to output them so I
mean here we're going to be outputting
messages and then somewhere up here we
are going to be allowing the user to
enter but we need to do something really
odd in PHP to be able to do this so now
that we know that that's the case let's
just test this subscribe here so all I'm
gonna do is I'm going to do a var dump
on the payloads that we get back this
will just allow us to see what kind of
payload we're working with now we can
test this from pub nobs website under
their debugger console so we're gonna do
exactly that now so if we just head over
to here and we go under the debug
console what this will allow us to do is
go ahead and enter a channel name in our
case it's chat and then we can go ahead
and add this client we don't need to
worry about the UUID so here you can see
a JSON string so in here I can say well
the body of the message is going to be
something like Hello and this is what
we're going to be pushing to PubNub
whenever we write something on the
command line and this will be sent to
everyone in that channel so if I press
send this is sent and if we go over to
the command line and make sure we're
running this so like so and I
send you can see in there we have that
payload and we can see a message which
is part of pop nubs payload structure
and then body which is ours and then we
have hi so that's how we're going to be
doing it the user type something into
their console this guy's pushed up to
PubNub and then it's sent to all clients
and then we can output the message
within there so pretty standard in the
way of chat so now that we know how we
can test it if you do run into any
problems make sure you use this debug
console it is very very useful so we
need to start to ask the user for their
name and all that kind of stuff Bart we
want to run this as a sub process that
kind of runs in the background and then
acts whenever something comes through
because it's blocking so we do this
using the PC NT l fork function in PHP
this will fork the currently running
process now I'm not going to go through
exactly how this works and talk about it
in length it's very complicated but you
can go ahead and read the manual we're
also going to be using this command as
well which you can see in the example
just over here so we're going to be
using pretty much this code here so
let's go and start to do this and run
this as a sub process so we can be
constantly listening for messages
without blocking anything so we say
something like PID the process ID and we
say P cntl underscore Fork and then down
here we just basically take that code
from the PHP manual so the first thing
we do is check if the PID is minus 1 and
if that's the case we just want to exit
with the one status code that's just a
general console error and otherwise we
can say else if PID like so this is our
normal process and then otherwise this
is our child process so what we can do
is take this put it into here so we're
running this now as a sub process and in
here this is where we're asking for the
user's input like their name or another
user name but their message so now that
we have this done let's start to work on
some of the prompts and we need to ask
the
user which room they want to connect to
and who they want to connect as so just
above all of this we're going to define
out a function called connect as the
reason that we're doing this is if the
username is already taken we need to
recall this to be able to prompt the
user again for their name and when we
were working in the console generally we
would use something like f right we
would give the stream which is SD T out
and then we give the string that we want
to output so we're gonna say connect as
and now we need to actually take input
from the user and to do this we use F
gets and then we use the stream again
but this time you say STD in now what we
need to do is trim this because it's
going to contain line breaks in it since
the user presses enter within their
keyboard and we're just returning that
so this function or purely server's
prompting the user for their name and
then taking some input returning that so
we can use the return value of the
function to set their username so here
what we do then is we say username and
then we just say connect as and we
invoke that so we can kill the page here
just to test this out so let's echo out
username and we'll see how this works so
over to the terminal let's come out of
this go back into it and I'm gonna say
Alex and there we go
you can see it's output just there great
so we've prompted the user for their
username and now we want to prompt them
to join a particular room so we're gonna
say F right and again STD out and then
we're gonna say join room a colon and
then we're gonna do pretty much the same
thing as we did here so we're gonna say
room equals F gets STD in and then we're
just going to trim it because again we
don't want any of them line breaks in
there so the reason we're doing this
outside of here is so that we can use
them in both this and this block because
we need to remember give the name of the
room here so we can actually replace
that now
so we're subscribing to the room that
the user chooses now it really doesn't
matter what room you subs
- you can either subscribe to a room
with people in or if you enter a new
name it will just create a new channel
so it's entirely up to you
ok so I'm just gonna move this up here a
little bit just it's a little bit tidier
so we've got the room that they want to
join then we prompt for the username and
now what we want to do is go ahead and
just tell the user that they're
connected so we're just going to say
fwrite STD out and here we are going to
say connected to X as Y and we'll
replace these in a minute so to do this
we're just going to say username that's
what the user typed and here the room
name that they gave and what I also want
to do is just do some new lines before
and after this just so we have a little
bit of spacing so we are technically
connected because we're subscribing to
this room but of course we're not
prompting for any input and of course
we're not outputting anything so let's
just review this in the terminal just to
see how we're doing so join room I'm
just gonna say chat and I'm gonna
connect as Alex and there we go connect
it to Alex as chat wrong we're here
around let's go ahead and just switch
these over like so great so now that we
have this done we can start to listen
for messages and output them to the page
so under subscribe then we are going to
first of all generate a timestamp that
this was sent so we're gonna say
timestamp like so and this is just going
to be using the PHP date function I'm
gonna say DM Y and then we're gonna say
hours in 24-hour format
minutes and seconds and now what we can
do is go ahead and write anything that's
sent out so again we use f right STD out
and then the string here is going to be
the timestamp in brackets then it's
going to be the user just in here
between greater than and less than sign
and then we're going to have the message
just here so we know that when we send
up the payload we get pretty much all of
this information through now we don't
know what the users user
name necessarily is because we don't
actually output that yet we don't
actually send this along so we're gonna
mock this inside of the PubNub debug
console so we're gonna say body hi and
then in here we're going to have a user
name that sent this for now we'll just
say Alex so when I send this through
then we have body now and user name and
if you need to remind yourself of the
payload simply do a var dump on the
payload just in here and we'll see this
so we can actually do this now just to
test out so I'm gonna join the room chat
as me so you'll notice that this is
exited out so this is I guess something
that we're going to need to address
before this and to do this we use the P
cntl weight function and this weights on
or returns the status of a fourth child
so this is how we're going to be able to
do this so just in here we want to say
PC and TL weight and this gives us back
a status just in here if we if we need
to use it so now when we try and run
this again and I joined the room chat as
me you can see that this just hangs and
this is currently now running this that
we can then see this payload dump from
so if we open up our terminal and we
come over to pub nub we can go ahead and
send this across and there we go so we
have an array with message which like I
said before is part of their payload
structure then we have body and we have
user name so we have the timestamp in
here we can simply put that into there
and now we need to grab the user name
and the body so we can go into message
and into user name so in here we just
say payload message username and then we
do the same thing here for the body so
we can just copy this and go ahead and
paste it in there with that body in
there great so now let's just break out
of this and go ahead and run it up again
will join chat as me and we'll go and
send this through like so come over here
and you can see as well as the payload
which we have got
we have the timestamp we have the name
and we have the message great so that is
pretty much it for outputting messages
there's a couple of things that we're
going to need to do in here in a moment
and that's just because we need to deal
with things like new lines and all that
kind of thing for now that I'm just
gonna put a new line on the end of there
okay so what we need to do then is start
to ask the user for prompt and what we
can then do is publish that message and
publish the user name to the channel
which will then be output and this is
where we can start to use our other
terminal side over here so if you have a
terminal like I term like I'm using that
you can split this is going to be a lot
easier otherwise just put two
side-by-side so to start to ask for an
input then we're just gonna say fwrite
again STD out and then in here we are
going to put just a greater than sign
just to kind of signify that we're gonna
enter something and now in here we want
to continuously be asking for input now
if we would just say message and again
use trim on F gets STD in then we are
going to just run this once we don't
want to do that we want to constantly
ask for input so a quick trick to do
this is just to say while true and then
wrap this like that now this will hang
this line here will hang so this won't
hurt go ahead and cause some kind of
infinite loop it will wait for the
message as the user types it so to test
this we can just say echo message let's
go over to the terminal run this up go
ahead and join chat and here you can see
I can just constantly type things now at
the moment we don't see another greater
than sign so what I can do is go ahead
and put this into here let's close this
off again run it up just say hi hi hi
and it works so now that we have this
done we need to actually publish the
message and then we can test so we don't
echo it out we want to use PubNub but
this time to publish and not subscribe
and we choose the room we already know
we have that in a variable and then we
have a payload so in here
have a body which is just going to be
the message that the user typed let's
just pull this down a little bit
and then of course the username which we
already know because the user selected
it as part of that session and that is
pretty much it so before we actually
test this out again in the command line
what we really need to think about is
what's actually happening here and is a
subprocess
still running now you might run into
trouble if you're doing any var dumps or
anything in here you might actually find
that this sub process is still running
and it's not being killed so I'm using
RS X so I can come over to my activity
monitor and I can go ahead and look this
up by its PID and I can go ahead and
kill any processes so if you look for a
process called PHP you will find that
you can just kill that if you start to
get weird output within your terminal so
just a little tip there that I run into
trouble with so we can now test this out
so I'm going to go ahead and run chapter
PHP I'm gonna connect to any room it
really doesn't matter and give my
username over on this side I'm gonna do
the same thing I'm gonna join the same
room but with a different username and
now I can start talking so I'm gonna say
hi there we go
and over here hello and there we go so
there's a couple of things that we need
to tidy up you've probably noticed that
the greater than sign that we created
here is kind of not output again just
here and it seems to be a little bit in
the way now then loads of ways that you
can do this but the way that I managed
to do this was just fiddling around with
the order of outputting of course
building something like this in the
command line isn't a great idea it's
really just for fun but this is how we
would do it so I've pulled this outside
of the while loop and now what I'm gonna
do is after I've actually sent my
message I'm going to put this in here
again bar I'm gonna prepend this with R
which will mean it will overwrite the
previous line and all this will mean is
that when we come over here and start
this back up again so let's join chat as
Alex I'm going to go say hi and if we
just go and do this in double quotes
because that won't take effect otherwise
so let's cancel reopen this
hi-hi-hi and you can see that we've kept
this just in here so a little bit of
fiddling around and you can get this
working properly okay so let's start to
chat in here and we'll see any problems
that we get so I'm going to cancel this
one off I'm gonna join chat again it's
Billy and I'm gonna go ahead and say hi
and you'll notice here that we have this
being output but with this just here so
what we want to say is if the message
isn't from that user that's currently in
this session we want to overwrite the
previous line and I will get rid of this
now there is one caveat to this and it's
really nothing you can easily get around
within the command line because the
command line isn't really built for
things like this unless you're building
an application in another language so
let's just tidy this up now in here we
want to go and use the current username
that we're working with so it's in scope
and in here I want a little if statement
to check when a message comes through if
the username doesn't equal the username
that we've set so we just go ahead and
grab this from our payload again so use
the name you can even put this in a
different variable then we want to do an
F write again STD out this time and we
just want to do exactly the same thing
as we did here so we want to just say
overwrite so this means that if the
message that's come through isn't from
the user that's currently connected it
will simply overwrite the line before
outputting the message so now what we'll
get is something a little bit better so
let's join chat as Alex let's go over
here and join chat as Billy and let's
start talking so hi and I'll say hi
again how are you and you can see that
what's happening is it's overwriting the
previous line and it's moving this down
so we can continue typing now the one
problem I want to address before we go
any further and this is very difficult
to figure out and I don't think you can
actually do this is if I'm currently
typing so hi there and I'm about to
write how are you and someone else
writes a message you can see that that
looks
as though it's overwritten it to get
around this you can press ctrl + R and
what that will do is it will bring the
line down so you can continue to write
like so and that would just work as
normal when it will just carry on the
flow so this can be a little bit
annoying but again like I said the
command line in this sense isn't built
for these kind of applications but what
we're doing in the anyway is pretty cool
so it doesn't really matter okay so the
last thing we want to figure out is if a
user connects with the same username we
don't want to let them in because this
is gonna cause a little bit of trouble
so to guess around this what we can do
is we can grab the users that are
currently connected to this application
so what we want to do is come over to
pub nub because we need to enable
something to be able to do this so if we
come over to our demo project just here
come over to our demo key set we want to
enable presents so if we turn this on
and then go ahead and save this will
allow us to detect the people that are
currently connected now by default this
will be a UUID so every client that
connects to this room or channel will
have a UUID but we want to push
additional information about that user
eg their username because that's what we
want to identify users by so what we do
then is just up here we're gonna say
PubNub we are going to set the state in
that particular room and then in here we
just give the current user that's
connected like so and this means that we
now identify each user along with their
UUID
with a username so what we can now do is
somewhere up here loop through anyone
that's currently connected and go ahead
and grab that information so just to
test this out we can say something like
here now PubNub here now that will give
us who's in this room at the moment like
so and this will just basically give us
all of that information so if we do a
var dump on here now like so come back
over to our terminal
connect to the chatroom maybe say Alex
and go ahead and do the same here
with billy you can see here now I've
connected as Billy we have someone in
here already called Alex and if I
disconnect from this and connect again
in chat you can see that I get two users
just here so there's no pretty way to do
this and that's using a framework or
anything obviously we're just messing
around here so we're doing it in one
file but we want to loop through and
just check the news name isn't taken now
the username will just have the
particular user we'll hang around for a
while so it won't be if you disconnect
you won't be able to connect that I'll
use them again but really this doesn't
matter that much so we're going to do a
for each loop here on here now and we
can look at the payload we can see that
we've got you you IDs so we want to go
through each UUID and we'll identify
them as user and in here then we want to
check user so that's each one of these
state username so State username and we
want to check if this equals the
username that's been given and in this
case we would just want to do it quick F
right and just say username taken may be
doing new line so we can do this in
double quotes or actually take that into
account and then we want to say username
and you probably guessed we again invoke
the connect as function that will just
block the script because we wait for
input and then it will return that
username and then we will go on this
won't quite work at the moment and we'll
see why let us go over to here and let's
connect we just fix up that syntax error
connect as say chat to connect as Alex
use name taken try it again try it again
and we're in so the reason that this
doesn't work is that what we're not
doing is checking this every time we are
prompting for a username so the way to
get around this then is simply to grab
this for each loop we want to go ahead
and use this inside of here because
whenever we call this we want to re
invoke that
action and up here what we want to do is
say something like username equals and
then the value of this finally we want
to return the username so like this so
let me just tidy this up a little bit
further we need to take here now up here
so we can grab this before in here what
we want to do is use here now and let's
test this out so let's go and run this
and of course we need to ask for the
room beforehand so let's do this just up
here and we'll go and run it so I'm
gonna join the room chat I'm gonna
connect as Alex and I've assigned this
as a variable but it would probably be
better in this case to go ahead and just
define this as a function then we can
invoke it just in here like so so third
time lucky let's go and run this join
the room chat make sure we update this
here so connect as and we will run this
again and I'll go over exactly what
we've done here just in case it doesn't
make sense so I'm gonna connect use name
taken use name taken username taken I
can do this as many times as I want
I've now just missed typed down and I've
been connected so we can do exactly the
same thing over here so let's try and
connect into chat as al X doesn't work
if I try to Alex it doesn't work because
we had that one before
tries Billy that doesn't work either so
let's go and choose another one and
we're in so it just works as normal okay
so just to go over this in case it
doesn't make sense we'll run through the
whole thing and just to clarify
everything so the first thing we're
doing is prompting for the room name
then we're looking up the users that are
currently connected to that room and we
are then invoking connect as what this
is doing is its allowing us to enter a
username just here we store that
username we then go through the list of
people that are already in the room and
if we have a taken username we go ahead
and run this again so it will just keep
calling this function over and over
again until this isn't true
and then we return that username what we
then do is we go and set the state so we
set the use of this in that room that's
currently connected we go ahead and just
tell the user then we fork a process
here off to another processor we fork a
process to a child process here we're
constantly asking the user for input
because we always want to allow them to
enter a message and then when they do
enter a message we go ahead and publish
that message and then again we loop
again and ask them for another message
in the meantime in the child process
what we're doing is we're subscribing to
PubNub which is a blocking method so
this will just block the execution
that's why we're forking off to a child
process we are obviously generating a
timestamp and then we're just outputting
any messages that we're getting back
from that channel and then of course we
are going ahead and overwriting the
previous line if the username is the
same so we don't get the issue that we
saw earlier and that is pretty much it
we've built a chat in PHP on the command
line very simply using PubNub remember
that this is a real-time chat so I'd
recommend going ahead and testing it out
with anyone in the world just to see how
quick this actually is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
