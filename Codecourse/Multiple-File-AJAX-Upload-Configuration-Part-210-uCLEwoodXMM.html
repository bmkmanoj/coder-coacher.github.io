in PHP we need to go ahead and dress the
fact that there's I'm usually a maximum
amount of data we can actually send via
a post request and also the specific
file upload settings as well so if you
go ahead and use the PHP info function
in a file you go ahead and get something
that looks like this and this allows us
to see where our PHP do i and i
configuration and sits now I happen to
have open this in my text editor so we
can go ahead and search for upload max
file size and mine set to 500 M which is
500 megabytes you also probably be
something like 32 megabytes or even less
we also need to go ahead and change the
value post max size as well I've also
changed this to 500 M again this will
usually be a lot lower for default
installations so go ahead and change
these values to something sensible
remember on a production environment
it's very rare that you'd want to allow
500 megabytes to be uploaded unless of
course there's a special reason that
you're allowing users to upload large
files like videos and then once you've
done this go ahead and restart Apache
that will keep the new configuration
into place and you'll be able to go
ahead and continue with the rest of the
series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
