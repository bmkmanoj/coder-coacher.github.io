is create the PHP code that's going to
allow us to connect to txt local and use
the API to send the text message or the
SMS message now the first thing we're
going to do is we're going to supply a
couple of variables with our username
and password now you obviously--you
username and password is unique to you
I'm just going to start out by with my
username which is PHP academy' now you
can see that just there and the password
which for the purposes of this tutorial
is PHP academy' password okay so we come
down a couple of lines now what we need
to do is get the data that's been posted
from this form here and we need to
create variables inside PHP from this
post data so that's the first step so
we'll just annotate this get form data
and the first thing we need to get is
the number now this is is for built-up
of the extension so the for for and then
the rest of the number so we've got two
variables here we've got the first one
which is number extension and then we've
got the just a plain number itself so
number equals dollar underscore post
obviously we know how to pass post
variables so that's number XT and then
I'm going to put a dot to concatenate
and I'm going to concatenate the actual
number onto that so number itself now
I'll go through these and then we'll
test the page to see if these are being
passed properly we'll just echo them out
to test that so the next one is from
sorry that should be a variable from
equals Post and from so we're taking
this here so the text that's going to be
displayed as the sender and last but not
least is the actual message itself and
that's pretty simple as well it's just
okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to echo each of these out and
this is going to allow me to test it so
save that come back into our SMS dot PHP
page okay so I'm going to type four four
one two three four five six seven the
sender will just say as PHP academy' and
the text we're going to say watch listen
and learn so if I click send you can see
that we've got four four up here which
we've echoed out which is the extension
we've got one two three four up to seven
which is the number we've got PHP
academy' in capitals which is the sender
and we've got watch listen and learn
which is the message here so
everything's being passed from our page
and then back to our page again so we
know that this is working that's the
first step is just to get rid of the
echo part of that okay so the next step
is to come down here and we need to
check whether the form has actually been
submitted in fact now first of all we're
going to put together the the variables
that we're going to pass to our web page
like I said in the last part of this
tutorial we need to pass all the
variables to that particular page on
text local com
so I'm going to call this bars now this
is going to be constructed exactly like
it would be a URL so if for example I
have HTTP txt local local.com forward
slash send or post SMS sent PSP I think
it is I think I'm wrong send up send SMS
post so
I'm going to round the wrong way send
SMS post.php then we'd have say you name
which is one of the variables here let's
have a look down the page okay so we've
got you name and P word which obviously
our username and our password now these
are really important because this logs
our sin now I'm sure you can now
understand the reason we're using curl
and maybe if you don't now you will
later on because it's sent much more
securely so username is going to equal
obviously our username and that's stored
up here now I could put this straight
into here but obviously if it changes
it's going to be a lot easier if we've
already got it in inside a variable up
here so username equals we need to
concatenate on user name and then we
concatenate more string on top of this
so I'm going to say P word equals and
then again concatenate on the password
okay so let me just echo this out and
Save Changes and just double check that
this is a form incorrectly okay so yeah
at the moment we've got a text local.com
forward slash send SMS post op PHP you
name it quiz PHP academy' P word equals
PHP academy' password now we need an
armor sound in the middle of there
obviously like we do with my sending
variables so if I just come in here and
I put and there okay so now obviously
we're not going to stop there we need
more variables let's concatenate some
more text onto there we also need the
message itself so message just save that
refresh that page
that's what I'll do is I'll come down
here just to save this file editor and
messing up like it has been okay so we
need to concatenate message and that's
equals remember that's following down
from this full stop here's concatenate
in this string on so message and that's
going to equal and then again we're
going to kick out an eight on message
that is here okay and then again we're
going to concatenate on
so from equals dot from so you get the
hang of how we're forming this and then
in a minute I'll refresh the page again
and I'll show you how this is sent and
form the link form the post variables so
from and let's just make sure we put out
and sign here around the sound and make
sure we put around the sound here as
well and then from and we also need
number
now it it doesn't actually the variable
name itself isn't actually number it's
selected numbs and the reason is it the
reason for this is that you can use
several numbers separated by a comma but
for now don't worry about that we're
just using a single number some some
gateways some SMS sending gateways might
not allow you to use multiple numbers so
I wouldn't worry about that too much
so selected nuns equals and then
obviously number that's the number with
the extension on and then we need a
couple of other variables and the first
one is info equals shallot Amazon info
equals one and we also need test Oh test
equals zero now the reason we're doing
this info is returning info let's just
go back to here and read about it should
be that yeah a flag to switch on and off
debug information so we want debug
information if something goes wrong we
want to know about it and so we need
info equals one and test equals zero
test equals zero basically means we're
not in testing mode we're going to use
our power credits to send the text
message so as far as I'm aware that
should be formed let's save changes and
we'll come back into our page here and
we'll submit some information to see if
it works now at the moment we've got
message equals nothing from equals
nothing selected numbers equals nothing
so if we do type our number in as we did
before our message here and we click
send you can see here how we've got
message equals watch this and learn from
equals PHP academy' selected nums equals
our number and then our static
information here the info on the test so
the Euro itself has formed properly the
only thing we don't need now is this
here because we're going to be doing it
through curl we submit the URL with curl
rather than doing it inside here so I'm
just going to get rid of all of this
just get rid of this here and that
should do it
so we've got our we've got our variable
here that we're going to submit through
curl let's just save that out and we'll
come back into our page and refresh just
to clear that up continue okay so
everything is working okay we know that
our URL or our variables have been
submitted now the next stage is to be
able to use curl to submit them on to
text local using the API so this is a
pretty simple process and that will be
in the next part of this tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
