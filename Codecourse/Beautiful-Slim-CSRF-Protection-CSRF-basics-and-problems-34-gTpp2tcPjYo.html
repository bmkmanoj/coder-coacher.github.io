installing the cross-site request
forgery protection package with slim and
we're gonna take a look at how this
traditionally works and hopefully this
will convince you otherwise that you
want to move on to the next part and
make this a little bit easier so the
first thing we need to do is just head
over to the github page for this I'll
leave a link in the course links as
always for this and we're just going to
go ahead and pull in the package of
course using composer so let's do this
first and that should download pretty
quickly there we go and this is pretty
much how we use it so like I said in the
introduction we can either bind this
onto all routes so this will basically
add middleware or I would actually
suggest you do is take a look through
this guard class just to kind of
familiarize yourself with it and we can
do that now actually if we just come
over to this this is essentially just
middleware that's bound to either all
routes or the routes that you provide
and you can see here that we've got our
basic constructor passing in storage so
you can change around your storage and
all your prefix if you want and all that
kind of stuff and we have these methods
like get token key name or name key and
get token value key and basically we
need to manually extract these out and
then insert them now the reason it works
like this and I completely understand
this is that you may wish to change
around your name key and your value key
and then the actual name of value so
this makes things a lot more flexible
and honestly this is absolutely fine but
doing this and passing this down to
every view gets very annoying so let's
first of all just go ahead and grab this
code here we're gonna attach this to our
container so we can do this anywhere and
all this is doing is just binding on
cross-site request forgery using a new
instance of that guard class that we've
just looked at it's as simple as that
same as what we did without views so you
would take this and you would bind it
somewhere before your routes and after
you've to find this out and your
container so something like app add and
then using your container you would just
grab that out of the container and this
would add to all routes so if you were
to post something through to another
route then this would have protection
enabled immediately
so really what we want to do is very
quickly create a form over here and post
it through to a new route so we'll do
that we'll take a look at that it fails
because we have this on here but we're
not including that hidden input and then
we'll go ahead and move over to the next
part so over in home let's just create a
really basic form kind of like something
that we would want to protect with
cross-site request forgery of course
it's a good practice to protect
everything with cross-site request
forgery so it's always a good idea to do
this so what I'm gonna do is actually
just create a layout if you are new to
tweak this will kind of help you out
with how this works we're going to
extend a base layout so I'm going to
call this app dot twig and into here I'm
just going to create a rough document
layout like so so we're just going to
call this cross-site request forgery and
inside of here we want to basically
define out a block where anything will
be inserted so we're going to call this
block content and then we immediately
end the block just here so we're gonna
say and block and now what we can do is
over on our home we can extend this and
place whatever we want in here so not
necessary really but it's good to go
through these things so we're going to
extend that layout so layout slash app
twig and then down here we define out
that block that we want to insert and
that's called content so down here we
end the block and we just place anything
inside of here that we need so let's go
ahead and do that now
so the form then is going to have an
action of a path so we're going to
actually define this out as a path in a
moment so we need to give our post route
a name and the method is obviously can
we post now in here I'm just gonna have
a button with a type of submit and this
is going to be some kind of subscription
upgrade or cancellation or something
like that so over in index let's just
create a new route this is going to
upgrade a subscription and we're just
gonna say slash upgrade and in here
we'll just create a closure and we'll go
ahead and return subscription upgraded
just to make things a little bit easier
and this should be just enough to see
that this works so we need to set a name
for this so if we just set a name
on this particular route to upgrade what
we can now do and this kind of leads us
into what we're gonna be doing is use a
kind of helper function so we can say
path for and then just give the name and
this is exactly the kind of thing that
we're going to be creating to make the
cross-site request forgery field
insertion a lot easier so now that we
have this then what we should have is a
button that goes through if we actually
enable sessions so by default cross-site
request forgery middleware for slim
released this package will use sessions
so that's the default storage and again
we can check that by coming over to the
guard just here and if we come down we
can see that the storage here by default
if it's not being defined out will use
sessions so all we need to do in this
case then is over an index dot PHP or
somewhere in a bootstrap file start
sessions within PHP that's all we need
to do so now we have this button I click
it we get a failed cross-site request
forgery check because we're not
including them inputs so let's do that
really now and completely bore ourselves
with how annoying this is by default and
then we'll go ahead and fix this up in
the next part so over in home then we
need these two hidden inputs so let's
create these now and we're going to have
a name and a value for each of these but
we need to pass these through to our
view because we actually have the name
and the value contained as we've already
seen within that guard class we have
their methods so what we would have to
do then and I'm just going to copy this
over from here is do all of this so we
just basically take all of this paste it
in there and then we have to send this
through to our view so we can do this
now and see how it looks so name key
we're gonna set to name key we're gonna
have a value key and again change all
this over and a name and a value so name
is name and value is value now there's a
couple of problems with this the first
one is that do we really want to be
doing this every single time we are
creating a route that potentially needs
cross-site request forgery protection of
course we don't the other problem is we
these are kind of generic names so we're
going to have to kind of pre fit
them anyway which kind of avoids the
point of having to pull out our name key
because then we have to again create a
convention to actually pass these
through to our view it's more to think
about and we may want to again change
the name from cross-site request forgery
named key to something else in the
future really this is just a headache
now let's go ahead and implement this
and we'll take a look so in here we have
our name key so let's go ahead and say
name key and then this is the name value
I think we just called that value
I don't know sorry this is the name of
course and then we have even this is
confusing to be honest and then we have
value key and then we have the value
like so so now if we just go over here
we need to very quickly fix this up
because what happens is when we add this
middleware in it will modify our request
because obviously this is middleware and
then we'll have access to this attribute
in here so it's actually you know a
little bit of a challenge to get this
working any best than it does here but
we of course going to look at in the
next video
so we have our update button we click it
and it works brilliant but we're left
with the problem that this is a complete
and utter mess we really need to make
this a lot easier and ideally we don't
have to do any of this at all and we
want to be able to not have to define
these inputs out manually for every
single form we create so let's jump over
to the last part and implement this and
finish up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
