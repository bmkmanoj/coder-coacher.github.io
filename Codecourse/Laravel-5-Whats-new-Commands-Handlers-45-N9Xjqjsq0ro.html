in laravel 5 now in laravel for the term
command was used to describe an artisan
command another 45 it's slightly
different and that's what we're going to
be looking at today so what I've done is
I've created a very basic application
which actually doesn't function at all
nothing happens it's basically a product
creation phone so here I've got my HTML
view I've created my roots here and I've
also got my product controller inside
show create were just simply returning
this view and in post create we're
creating the product although that's
actually coming to doubt since we don't
while we're not connected to a database
but that's not the point of this lesson
now before we go ahead with this I want
to first refresh our memory on the last
video by creating a request for this
fall so to do that let's go to our
terminal we're going to say page we
accent make requests create product
request so if we open that up now it
doesn't want to open create product
request we haven't got any sort of
authorization system so we're just going
to return true here down here will enter
our rules the name of the product will
be required will be a minimum of three
characters in the max of 100 a
description is also required minimum of
let's just leave that out we'll set a
max of 500 now okay so if we go back and
hit submit without entering anything it
isn't going to work yet and that's
because we haven't injected that request
into our method so up here we're going
to add a use statement for the request
so use acne HTTP requests create product
request
and we're just going to inject that down
here great product request request so
let's hit submit and we get these errors
if we enter something that's below three
characters in our name we're going to
get an error as well so all of that is
working fine and just as a side note
what we can actually do is replace this
with request all it makes it look a bit
cleaner but anyway we're not going to do
that because by creating the product
inside that controller that is actually
violating the single responsibility
principle so instead we're going to use
a command so we're going to get rid of
that and we're going to create a new
command using artisan so PHP axon make
command create product command and if we
go to our commands directory will see
our command in here so we won't get rid
of this self handling commenting now we
don't want that for now we're also going
to get rid of this handle method and
we'll get rid of this comment and expect
messy now all this command is is
basically a late to transfer object so
in other words instead of passing lots
of different arguments to a function for
example create product name description
you'd have an image of a price instead
of doing that what you actually do
instead is pass a single object so
create product product and product would
actually be an object which we injected
with those attributes and that is what a
data transfer objectives so that's all
that this command is so all we have to
do is inject those arguments so we had a
name in the description so this name
equals name and this description it
costs description we're going to have a
public name and a public description
perfect so now what we're going to do is
import that command with the you
statement so you Zach me commands create
product command and we're just going to
instantiate that class so this is fairly
straightforward we're just going to say
product equals new create product
command and we'll actually really
reading that to command for readability
and typically what we do here is say
something like input get name and input
get description which looks extremely
messy so instead we're going to utilize
this request object that we injected
we're just going to reference properties
so request name and request description
and then we're going to say this
dispatch come on and we'll actually just
pop that into there to make it a little
bit more compact okay so if we go back
to our browser and create a product will
say product title and description we're
going to get this exception and that's
because we haven't actually created a
command handler so to do this if we look
at our help list we're going to use the
handler command command so PHP artisan
handler command I'm gonna need to pass
an option command and this is going to
be equal to the name of the command
which in this case is create product
command so paste that in and hit enter
oh we didn't actually enter the name of
the command the name of the handler
sorry so PHP Adson handle a command
create product command and love ok so
the handler was created successfully if
we go to handlers commands great product
client handler clean this up with it we
can get rid of this constructor we don't
really need that
so you can see that this great product
command actually gets injected
automatically so just for testing
purposes let's just die and dump that
command hit refresh all right okay we
didn't update this namespace we need to
change this to acme commands and refresh
one more time and there's our object
perfect so we're not going to actually
add the functionality with the database
or anything like that this is just to
demonstrate commands what you would do
is do something like product create name
equals command name description equals
command the scriptum and then you'd
probably fire some sort of event which
we'll look at in the next video and then
you just return the product then inside
of this control here you'd return
redirect back with some sort of success
message but that's pretty much the gist
of commands now you can see how much of
an improvement this has made on this
controller we're no longer violating the
SRP and what it also does is allows for
code reusability for example this could
be an admin panel controller with this
post create method then we could also
have a moderation panel controller but
instead of rewriting all of this
functionality you could just use the
same command they did earlier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
