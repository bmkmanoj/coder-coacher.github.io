bourbon if this guy this little Steve
Rogers here is CSS when he gets injected
and becomes buff he becomes sass right
now if you add bourbon you're adding his
whole Avengers team on it you got
bitters and refills and neat and they
together that create an awesome world
saving team of bitter applause
extensions I'm starting off with a
simple file called example and a really
simple index.html here let me show it to
you it's just a you know it's bare-bones
HTML outline and we have one link to a
style sheet called
apt CSS so we don't have anything else
in this directory so where I have to
make my app dot CSS right now we're
gonna do that by creating a folder
called CSS and in that folder and create
a new file called app sass I'm not now
I'm gonna use app dot sass to be the
endpoint for all of my sass it's all
going to be compiled right to here in an
output to app dot CSS which is linked to
in my document if it so if I write body
and say back ground is gonna be CCC like
a light-gray you need to find a way for
this back background to be compiled into
a app dot app dot CSS now the way we're
going to do that is we're going to
install sass on our machine and then
from there we're gonna go and install
the things we've been talking about
bourbon bitters knee and also we're
gonna use refills so starting with sass
I'm gonna say sudo install Oh gem
install
sass and my password is just kidding I'm
not telling you great we have sass
install now I'm going to do the same
thing for for Bourbon pseudo Jim install
bourbon you know wait while that
installs and looks like it's all good
so let's gets a scrubbing open a new tab
and I'm going to need a CD into my
working directory so that's going to be
my desktop and examples when I called
this thing and then CSS now that I'm in
there I'm gonna write sass - - watch I'm
going to identify my sass file app dot
sass and I'm gonna stay : to identify
the output file I wanted to be apt on
CSS and go okay it looks like it it's
all good that's it wrote the new app dot
CSS right here
background CCC and when i refresh my
browser wind right here i can see in the
background it's it's night nice light
gray and i can also notice that sass is
watching this directory for changes and
i can stop it in time by pressing ctrl c
so if I change this to pink and my
browser window will be a background of
pink pretty easy okay oops that was long
thing so let me show you how a saps will
overwrite my style so I changed the see
the CSS to pink to give you this browser
but I so yeah so I did a big no-no you
don't ever want to change the body you
want to change the sass because I did
want to rant ass again or rather when I
saved my sass and the SAS application in
my command line
rewrote my output CSS so now our body is
green so all right I'm gonna change this
background actually I don't even care
what the background is the first thing I
wanted to show you guys is bourbon and
how that works to understand
bourbon and to work with bourbon we have
to install it the first thing I have to
do is CD into my projects folder which
is on the desktop and it's called
example and CSS and I have to say
Bourbon install cool now when I go over
here to my my project folder I can see
that bourbon is a new folder instead of
it inside of my CSS now this would be ok
if I wanted to kind of keep it small but
I want to also show you guys how I
architect my sass to allow for bigger
projects to happen later on what I want
to do is is since this bourbon is not my
code it's a plugin that I don't want to
be altering too much
I want to shove that into a folder
called zero plugins plug-in and there's
the plugins
I also want to create a new a few of
these of these folders here a new folder
called one base that shouldn't be in my
plugins folder it should be myself my
CSS and I want to make another folder
called two modules and the final one of
this type is three layouts now this is
great inside of these I can put it a
file called I'm gonna call this one
plugins der da SAS I'm gonna do the same
thing for each one of these major
folders this one's going to be called
base - der
that sense modules dot / - sir dots ass
and finally layouts - sir dots s now I
use these directory files as a way to
import everything in the directory and
that way when I'm writing my app dot
sass I can do something as simple as MV
port what do I want to import 0 -
plugins / plugins - sir and let me do
this four times this is got a base this
is gonna be modules maybe Lance same
here
yeah 3 3 2 1 base and modules
cool so these are sucking in
or rather importing these files here and
then what I went when I want to add to
any of these types of directories I
could just add it to the smaller
directory I don't have to worry about
going into my bigger one and kind of
finding where it wants to go because
honestly these can get quite big but
we're going to start small and now the
first thing we do is at an import
bourbon slash bourbon okay so let's take
a look at our sass compiling it looks
like everything compiled just fine and
look at our output CSS great we have a
blank page that is fantastic
the reason I'm happy about that is
because bourbon is a library of plugins
no I'm sorry
mix-ins and functions and helpers
add-ons so it's not actually gonna
render down to any CSS without
initializing it yourself like it's not
gonna do anything on its own it needs to
be these are just tools in your tool
built to use at any one time and they're
gonna not and they're not gonna add any
bulk to your project and I really like
that about it I really like that about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
