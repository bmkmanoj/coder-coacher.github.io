requiring files in PHP so we're going to
look at four different methods of
including and requiring files or a
mixture of these two statements if you
like the first thing we're going to look
at is including then we're going to look
at requiring and what the difference is
and then we're gonna look at include
once and require once as well so what do
we actually mean by including a file
well let's say that we have a function
stop PHP file which holds a few useful
functions that we might want to use
throughout our application well you're
hardly going to want to go ahead and
read eclair them on each page that you
build so what we do is we have a
separate file called functions which can
be included on any page that we require
them and then we don't have to just keep
read eclair in them so to use an include
you specify include and then inside of a
string you point to the location of the
include so this can either be a relative
or an absolute path but I'm gonna say
functions PHP so what I can now do is I
can actually call this function here so
I could say something like echo at five
and six so you'll see here that we have
eleven so we now have included the
functions file and we can actually make
use of the functions now you also have a
way of including files called require
now if I for example mistyped this or
the file wasn't available and I include
it let's take a look at what happened so
let's refresh you see we've got a
warning here and a warning here as well
now let's just remove the fact that
we're actually you making use of the
function because that's generated a
fatal error since that add function
can't be found so we have two warnings
here so what's happening is anything
after this is being run so I'm just
gonna say index dot PHP so anything
after this has been run despite the fact
that we can actually include this
functions file now what happens if we
absolutely need to kill
our applicational kill out page if we
can't include that file well we go ahead
and we use for choir now take a look at
what the the difference between the
warning and the warning here is when we
hit refresh this warning will actually
become a fatal error and you see that
the index stop here should be string
that we echoed out a moment ago is now
gone because we failed to open this file
so that's the difference between include
and require but what about include once
and require once well there's a
difference between these as well or that
they're the same thing but there's a
difference between include once and and
just include for example so let's go
ahead and just require once
functions.php and we'll see what happens
well we echo out the string index dot
PHP we know that that's there so let's
just go ahead and get rid of that and
we'll go ahead and use add here okay so
we've got the expected result by using
require once so what's the difference
well the difference is that if I were to
copy and paste this line either by
accident or something happened and I
refresh nothing changes it works in the
same way now what has actually happened
is upon running this I require once PHP
already knows that this functions file
has been included or required and
therefore it doesn't include it again
now if we were just using require rather
than require once you'll see that that
changes slightly and we see a fatal
error and that's simply because of the
contents of our functions file where we
have Reda clared the add function but
we're still messing up our page by doing
this so by key using require once we
know that will only ever require one
copy of this file into whatever page
that we decide to include in so that's
include to requires and include once and
require once in PHP and how and why we
use them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
