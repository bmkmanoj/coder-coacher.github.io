video number nine in this new series
where I'm creating a login
administration system using codeigniter
which is a popular PHP framework in this
video I'm going to be I think just
creating the view the main view of the
signup page I'm going to create a link
on the login page and then that'll take
you to another view so the first thing I
want to do for that is is going to my
main controller and create a new a new
public function here called signup and
this is just gonna load a a view called
I guess signup okay now I want to go to
the login view and create that link so
we're going to log in here and then just
after everything will go a href equals
close this because I always forget to
actually close it and sign up and then
in here we want to echo out the base URL
code base runners for URL and then we'll
append the actual location we want to go
to it so in this case that's main slash
signup and then semicolon save it now
if we just go back to the main page
without any form data or anything
unexpected in 14 line 14 okay so oh yeah
derp view you're probably looking at
that be like Steven what is following
anyway refresh this fixed we have a
sign-up link it takes us to a an error
because we haven't actually created the
signup view yet so let's go ahead and do
that go into our views create new file
and up dot PHP and then we'll just copy
the HTML syntax from the login form and
just start over sign up and then sign up
page cool so now when i refresh this we
should be getting right we can now see
we now are loading the view so let's
build it I'll open my PHP tags I will
open and close the form so I'll echo
form
I'm just open and I'll specify this
right away I'll submit it to main slash
sign-up underscore validation which is a
method that I'll create later and then
I'll echo the phone close now I'll let
go some P tags and as well echo the form
underscore input that we'll be using for
the first email field so this one will
be email and the value actually I'll set
this I didn't set it on the last on the
last one so I was going to show you how
I'll show you that after cool so the
form input email I'll just copy this and
then password and then this is instead
of input it's a password and the same
thing because we want to enter a confirm
password it's a form password and this
will just be specie password and then
lastly we will create a submit button
this would be signup underscore submit
Oh perfect one last thing is we want to
title these or label them so people know
what fields they're actually typing for
it
it's a password and then confirm
password that should be good so we
refresh this and there it is
looks good to me and when we submit it
it goes to the main slash signup
validation method so that's where we'll
do our validation so yeah why don't we
actually just create it we have some
time left on the video so we'll put it
right after the login validation for
function so the public function signup
underscore validation and then what I'll
do is first thing I'll load the library
or the form validation library so this
load library form validation suite next
is what I want to set the rules so over
this form validation set underscore
rules and then our three parameters the
first is the name in this case will be
email the second is the readable name so
we'll just capitalize to e email man
that's a great idea
I want to need you and then I will show
you a couple more of these of these
different rules that you can set so we
want to require and trim it
first off another thing we want to do is
what we can do is there's a function or
a rule already preset in code igniter
and all you have to do is type of valid
underscore email and I'm sure you if
you've ever done for malla Dacian with
native PHP you know you can get some
pretty nasty functions that are that
trying
decipher whether a email is valid or not
so this is a function you just pass it
in and if it's not a valid email it'll
throw an error for the email field
that'll say your email is not valid and
it's very useful very functional
another thing is there's an is unique
and is unique rule that receives a
parameter now this is the database name
and then the database or the database
table and then the field that was going
to check for so basically what it does
is this is actually because codeigniter
already knows where the database is it's
gonna check in this table and it's gonna
check all the email fields to see if
email is the same is that is the email
field for each and every one and
basically what it does is it just checks
to see if it's unique right so it'll
thrown it'll throw an error if it's not
which means like in this instance it
would throw an error if somebody had
already signed up with the same email
address which is extremely useful which
means we don't have to do that and most
of the time we do so CodeIgniter a +
create a couple more rules I'll just
copy this because I'm lazy we'll go this
form validation and then for password
fields and then this is not a valid
email it's we don't need to check to see
if it's unique
we just need to require it trim it and
that's it
we could also md5 it here but I'm gonna
md5 it later just because we need to
compare it to the C password so we'll
just ctrl D vet no C passwords firm
password and then there's another really
cool function called matches and this
will actually this will validate whether
or not it matches the field that we
specify so if the C password field
doesn't doesn't match the password field
it'll throw an error for the C password
field
we're so extremely useful I'm sure I
don't it doesn't take a lot of
explanation to understand why that's
useful we don't have to write that
function and
we could we could make our own call back
but code matters done it for us we don't
need to lastly we just need to check if
the validation has been run so I'll go
if this form validation validation run
so if it's been run
we'll just echo pass for now else will
echo no pass no you beautiful okay so
let's try this out I'll refresh this
just make sure that it's running the
latest version and we'll go email will
be
hello welcome comm password and I'm
gonna leave this one blank to you if
anything happens you shall not pass it's
not very angry what I could do is let's
go obviously if it doesn't pass I'll
echo that but I'll also load the sign up
view this load you sign up excellent and
which also reminds me I need to echo out
the form validation or the validation
errors and now click enter says the
password field is required the confirm
password field is required new Sherlock
pass he's very angry so we'll go hello
welcome
I'm going to leave that invalid on
purpose we'll go password just be
password the email field must contain a
valid email address that's cool Oh
so this is this is cool um if I write
the second parameter in the form input
function is the value so like I showed
you before we can actually set this to
this input post and then whichever field
so especially for the email we want this
to route to reset to actually what they
type so they don't have to type it every
time like I would have to right now so
what we'll do is also for login we
should do that for the login as well so
we can go this input post email and then
we also need another bracket cool okay
now if i refresh this say hello and now
you can actually see like Hello is Right
re registering and it's there every time
now cool so I'm gonna leave this video
at 12 minutes which is a little bit over
time but uh yeah in the next video we'll
talk about uh I guess we'll finish this
well we'll handle the what happens when
the form is validated
we'll also test like the field where the
is unique field and I'll show you what
that's like cool thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
