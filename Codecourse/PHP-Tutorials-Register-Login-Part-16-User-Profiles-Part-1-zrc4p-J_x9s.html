going to be doing something a bit more
interesting and we're going to be
creating a profile page and what this
profile page is going to do is it's
going to allow you to output any
information about a particular user and
that includes your own information as
well so we're going to be adding a link
just here called profile or something
like that or we could make this a link
either way doesn't really matter and
that'll allow us to view our own user
profile now at the moment we don't
actually have much information about the
user that we can change we don't have
you know we would have an uploaded image
or like an avatar or you know things
like that we can still build this page
and then if you want to go in and add
more fields to the database and you want
the user to specify you know things like
their Facebook profile or something like
that you can do that and then you can
display that on the profile page so this
will give you the jolt to go ahead and
actually you know output this
information so let's go ahead and start
return to the home page the first thing
we need to do is build up the profile
page I'll explain a bit about how it's
going to work and then we're going to
create the ability to access different
users profiles like this so you can see
that you know my username is Alex that's
how I log in to the website so if I want
to access a profile I just do forward
slash whatever page we're on so it will
be W W your website comm or whatever the
domain extension is forward slash and
then the users name and this is called a
vanity URL so I'll be referring to it
throughout the tutorial as a vanity URL
so we'll be able to access users
profiles like this which is extremely
useful because if you run a site and you
say well yeah you know go access my
profile it's it's something com forward
slash Alex you know it's a lot easier
anyway let's go ahead and start start to
build this up so the first thing I want
to do is I want to go ahead and create a
page that's going to output this profile
information so funnily enough I'm going
to call this profile PHP I'm going to
open up
Paige like contact and just copy this
just so I can you know get the the
template there and I'm going to go ahead
and I'm going to save this as profile
dot PHP okay
so close contact of PHP get rid of this
information here we don't need this now
back to our page and we'll try and
access profile PHP and there we go we've
got a blank page with our our design on
okay so now let's go ahead and start to
write write the data out here oh sorry
right this page out now we need to be
able to pass in a user name via get and
the way this is going to work is let me
just pull this down so we can write some
code in here we're going to first of all
check if this variable is set now I did
mention that we were going to do a
vanity URL so a /and username this is
the way we do it on the server side and
then we use an HT access file to be give
the ability to pass through a username
at the end of the URL so this page is
going to be the page that's going to
output the information about the user so
me and other users as well so if is set
dollar underscore get user name if this
is equal to true and empty dollar
underscore get user name is equal to
false do something here that's
essentially saying is this variable set
so we're not just accessing profile dot
PHP on its own and the username mustn't
be empty so we must be specifying a
username then we do something in here
otherwise I'm going to redirect actually
no I don't have ID I have a function
redirect so let's go ahead and check out
general functions now we don't have a
redirect function so we'll just use a
header
so header location index.php and then
exit so if i try and access profile PHP
without supplying any data then it will
just redirect me otherwise well what do
I want to do but I'm going to go ahead
and I'm going to set this this this post
that
so this supplied username into a
variable within this page so user name
and I'll just go ahead and echo this out
for now just so we can demonstrate how
this works because we're going to be
building out htaccess file which is
going to allow us to create our vanity
URL so we're checking that this has been
posted checking that something's
actually been passed through and then we
are putting the username that's applied
into this into this username variable
and just outputting it for now so here
let's go ahead and access profile dot
PHP and then we need a question mark
we're going to pass through this gift
variable so it's username remember that
corresponds to this value in here and
that's equal to Alex and there we go
that's outputting whatever I type in up
here okay so um that's all well and good
but now I need to be able to say well I
actually want to access this page but I
want to specify the name like that now
at the moment it says object not found
because there's no folder called Alex
what we want to do is rewrite this rule
here so I'm going to create a new file
and this is where our HT access comes in
I'm not going to go through the HT
access code or the HT access rules and
conditions too much because it's going
to confuse and or a lot of people but a
roughly go over it in how this works so
I'm just going to paste this in feel
free to just pause the video and copy it
down because I'm not going to be typing
this out it just takes too long but
essentially I'll try and explain what's
going on here so I'm going to save this
inside my LR directory as dot HT access
it's important we don't put anything
before this because we want it to save
as an HT access file and this is how we
save HT access files so if I press save
this is now in
htaccess new consits htaccess file to
make sure you're saving it as dr.
htaccess and nothing else
okay so what's happening here is we're
turning on the ability to rewrite this
URL and pass through different
parameters and things like that
here we're saying anything anything
after you know the forward slash in our
in our URL bar we're going to take this
value and we're going to append it here
so we've got dollars dollar sign 1 which
corresponds to this variable in LR 2 4
sorry lr 4 slash profile PHP which is
the profile page that we've just created
here and we're placing this forward
slash value into this username get
variable so take a minute to try and
understand that I'm going to go ahead
now and I'm going to try and access this
like this so let's go ahead and get rid
of this type in Alex here this value
here will now be picked up by this rule
it will be passed here the same way that
I've just demonstrated so that's
essentially it that's that's probably
the best explanation I can give I'm
going to hit enter and there we go the
same things happened so now I can type
in Alex 1 and it puts it there so
obviously if you're using this in a root
directory so something com forward slash
Alex you would just have it like that
and you would have profile dot PHP in
your root directory so fiddle around
with this and it's relatively
straightforward to get the hang of ok so
now that we've done that it's a it's all
good
so we can we can do a forward slash
username and then display the
information required I'm going to get
rid of HT access we don't need that get
rid of general we don't need that ok so
what we're going to do well we have a
lot of functions that we've already
built throughout the series that can
deal with processing information
gathering information about user and
then out we can easily output this
information and the way that we've
structured this is going to make this
page extremely easy to create so there's
not going to be much more code on here
than you already see so I'm going to go
ahead and I'm going to open first of all
my
in it file within core because we're
going to need that to demonstrate and
also my functions my users functions
file because we've got some functions in
here that are going to be useful to us
so what do we need to do here well we
have a function inside of users dot PHP
called let's just find it user data and
user data allows us to pass in a user ID
and retrieve information about their
user and we can pass in which fields
that we want to gather from the user as
well and remember we do this in our init
dot PHP to allow us to access our
information anywhere whatever page that
we're on and we've we've already looked
to that so you should be familiar with
that now we can use this same function
but pass in a user that you know isn't
us that we specify on this profile PHP
page so at the moment we're specifying a
username just because it looks nicer to
the user otherwise we'd have to do
something like forward slash 14 and you
know that doesn't look great we want to
do it by username so we need to get the
users ID to be able to pass through to
this user data function so I'm going to
say user underscore ID is equal to now
we need to somehow find the user ID from
the user name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
