at deploying code from a hosted
repository like github or bitbucket and
pushing that to a server like in Amazon
ec2 instance or a digital ocean droplet
now I'm going to be using github in this
case and I'm going to be using digital
ocean to create a droplet and we're
going to be using deployed io to
actually deploy this and this makes it
really easy to actually deploy your
application and keeps it all in one
place and keeps it really nice I've used
a couple of different websites that work
like deploy but I found that deploy has
the most options and it's also really
easy to set up as well so as you can see
I have a github repo here it's called
hello world and I basically just have
one file in here one commit and this
just says hello world in real life your
application will obviously be a lot
larger but in this case I'm just going
to use this as an example and you can
see the result of this here so by the
end of the video we'll have deployed
this all of the code in this repository
to a digital ocean server so regardless
of what serve you're using I'm going to
go ahead and set this up now so I'm
going to create a new droplet in digital
ocean if you've not already signed up
with digital ocean go ahead and feel
free if you want to so I'm going to not
really choose too many different options
here and just going to hit create
droplet and that's going to create my
droplet for me and I'll get a username
and a password just email to me you can
add an SSH key here I really depends on
your you know how you want to work with
this okay so once your droplets created
we're going to open up a terminal and
SSH over to our server if you're using
something like Windows you can use party
to do this so once we're connected the
first thing we want to do is install
Apache just so we can test that this
works via an HTTP server you can
obviously set up your droplet however
you want to with the services you need
etc etc so I'm going to fir
of all update apt and now that that's
done i'm going to install apache so what
we're now interested in is where our
public files are located in this case it
happens to be involved at HTML this will
differ depending on the server that
you're using you can see that we've got
index.html in here by default so if we
actually go over to a browser window of
our IP address we'll we should see the
default bin to a battery page and here's
the default page that we would see so as
long as you've got this working and you
know the directory where your public
files are stored we can use deploy to
i/o to copy the fast from our github
repository over to our public directory
so we'll leave this open so we'll need
this later on now what we're going to do
is inside of deploy IO we're going to
connect a repository so you're going to
need to provide your github it bucket or
self hosted details here in this case
I'm going to choose the HelloWorld
repository so I'm going to give it a
title here and a color label if you want
and I'm going to hit connect so once
that's done you'll see that your
repository has been added to the list
here bear in mind that before you
actually do any of this you will need to
connect your github or other account so
I'm going to hit hello world here and we
have the option to create an environment
and server so what we need to do is
create an environment here and I'm just
going to call this hello world
production and you can give it a color
label if you want and we also need to
choose the branch as well so this could
be a development branch a specific
branch or in this case it's just going
to be the master branch and there's not
really much else you need to do here but
you can do things like HipChat
or campfire deployment notifications so
I'm going to hit add environment and
once that's done we can choose a server
so you can see the options here and
depending on when you're watching this
video there may be additional options
when you come to use this but in this
case I'm going to hit digitalocean
and click next step so I'm going to call
this
hello world server the repository path
we can just leave as a forward slash for
the droplet though what we need to do
here is we need to actually change this
to the hello world droplet so now what
we can do is we can provide the remote
path remember this remote path is far
above Double H tml so we can enter that
in here so now we can go and click check
connection but this is going to fail so
you'll see what we need to do here to
actually make this work and this is
because we don't have the SSH key for
deployed i/o added to our authorized
keys on our server and there's cool
instructions here that will actually
tell you how to do this so if you hit
learn about public key authentication
you do get a guide here what we're going
to do is we're going to hit this and
we're going to take this key we're going
to copy this and we're going to paste
this into our authorized keys on our
server so we're going to use vim to hit
our home directory
in SSH and it's authorized keys so we'll
hit insert mode or paste this in will
come out and we'll save that and quit so
now when we go and hit check connection
there we go it works so there's a couple
of optional things you can do here like
post-deployment commands and web hooks
I'm going to skip this for now
so we're now ready to deploy so on our
server here what's now going to happen
is when we deploy from our github repo
this is then going to be copied over to
our public HTTP directory so let's click
deploy we have the option to choose a
revision and we can enter some
deployment notes here I'm not going to
do this so I'm going to hit review and
then I'm going to hit start deployment
so that's now deploying if we just
refresh the page there's not a lot of
files here so that should be done now
and when we go over to our server you
can see that's been deployed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
