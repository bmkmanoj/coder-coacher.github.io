looking at model observers so if I just
go into my database and look at the
users table you'll see that I've
truncated this just to clear all the
records now if we go to our editor and I
look at my routes file I've also created
two routes here this was tidy that up we
have a create route which just creates a
user using the eloquent RM and then we
have update which does the same thing
except it updates instead of creates now
we already learn about events and how we
can trigger events like this event
trigger user saved and then we could
pass in the user may be but what laravel
does is it creates these events
automatically so we don't have to
trigger them every time we update or
create something so if we just get rid
of this I'm going to go to my Acme
directory and create a new folder called
observer inside of here I'm going to
create a file called user dot PHP we're
going to have the namespace Acme
observer and then we're going to have
class user observer and now what we can
do is we can say for example public
function saved and here we take the
model and in this case we'll just echo
saved so now what we have to do is we
have to register this observer so back
in our routes file I'm just going to say
up here typically this will be done in a
service provider or in some other file
but to save time we're just going to do
it in the routes file so user observe
Acme observer user so when we go to our
browser go to create oh okay so here we
need to pass an object not not a class
name so hit refresh and we named this
wrong
okay so just call this user hit refresh
one more time and there we go if we look
in that database the user is there and
we also get this message here now we
also have saving so we'll just echo
saving and if we hit refresh again
you'll see we get the same result and we
also have things like update sorry
updating are updated and you can view a
full list of them in the laravel Doc's
here we're not going to we're not going
to go through them all because we'll be
here forever but you can see here we
have creating updating saving we have
saved and they can be really useful if
used correctly so do take the time to
take a look at them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
