few examples so down here I have a
string or a username I then have an
email I also have two URLs I also have a
HTML anchor tag and we're going to write
expressions to match all of these so in
our expression bar or our expression
field the first thing that I'm going to
match is this one so I'm going to insert
a character class I'm going to say 0 to
9 and we also want a to z and A to Z add
a plus sign and let's just get rid of
these to make things clearer and there
you go we have a match so let's get rid
of that and paste the rest in get rid of
these ones we're looking at an email now
and we've already done this one but
let's go over again just for recap so we
won a to z 8 to Z and we also want 0 to
9 and we also want to allow underscores
and that's going to be set to multiple
we then want an @ sign and then we want
to match a domain name so it's going to
be a to z a to z and 0 to 9 and that's
going to be plus 2 we then want a dot
which we need to escape and then we want
a domain which can be calm or net echo
dot uk' or anything like that but we
want to make this group non capturing so
we do that with a question mark
: I also want to capture the whole email
and I also want to capture the domain
name so I'm going to encase that in
parentheses as well so down here if we
say $1 1 we get a full email dollar too
and then we just get the third domain
next is the URL the first thing that we
want to match is HTTP or HTTPS so we're
going to say HTTP colon slash slash and
let's get rid of this but we also want
to match this one so IDs great now it's
not matching this one but all we have to
do is make that :
and by the way we should escape these
just so regex knows that they ant the
limiters and let's just add another name
down here so example.com and you'll see
why I did that soon so we want we have
our HTTP next we want to match this part
of the domain so we're going to add a
non capturing group and this is going to
be a to Z a to Z 0 to 9 and this is
going to be plus oh this should be a
character class and then we want to add
a period but it has to be escaped and
then finally we want a non capturing
group we want to allow calm or OGG or
net and the rest of them now now you see
why I created this here we're matching
these ones successfully but for some
reason this isn't working and that's
because we're looking for HTTP but it
doesn't exist in this one so I'm going
to add parenthesis around here and I'm
going to make it optional and we also
want to make that non capturing so
there's our URL expression next we want
to match a anchor tag now this one is
going to be a little a little different
so let's get the skeleton so if you will
and start it out so we have a hate ref
and then we have the closing tag we need
to escape this so regex doesn't think
that this is a delimiter and now we can
continue with a regular expression now
before we do I just want to add one more
example and I'm going to change these to
single quotes so now what we have to do
is allow this to be either double quotes
or single quotes so we do that with a
character class we could do something
like that that would work but instead
we're going to keep it simple and do a
character class so there we have our
opening quote but we also need to
include this we're going to add another
character class A to Z a to Z and 0 to 9
and then we're going to close
with our closing quote and we need to
add another character set for that so
let's get rid of this closing tag and
check it matches and something went
wrong somewhere so let's just break this
down until we can find out what's wrong
so that's working so it must be
something to do oh okay we need to add a
plus sign here telling me and we're
still not getting it
let's try we need to allow for these so
we're also going to add those in our
character set and we don't need to
escape these since they are in their
character set and we also need to add a
dot and we do need to escape that one
okay so that matches now next thing that
we need to match is this so we're going
to add a character set and this is going
to be actually we don't need a character
set of that because the label of an
anchor tag can be pretty much anything
it could contain more tags if we needed
it to so we're just going to match dot
plus and then we just need to match the
closing tag so let's add that and escape
that slash now if we go in substitution
type dollar one we're not getting
anything and what I want to do is I want
to capture the URL and I also want to
capture the label or the name so I'm
going to add a parenthesis around the
URL like so and now we get the URL I
also want to capture this label so we're
just going to add a parenthesis around
there and now we have our two groups
now we haven't covered every single
aspect of regular expressions but do go
to register comm and look through this
reference you don't really need to know
every single symbol but it would be
helpful to just play around and learn as
much as you can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
