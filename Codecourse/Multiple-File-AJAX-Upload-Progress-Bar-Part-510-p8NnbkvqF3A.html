nice-looking progress bar so we'll go
ahead and write the mark up or head back
over to our style sheet and we'll start
to actually create this and then we'll
look at animating the our fill just to
with CSS widths just so we can see how
this starts to look when we eventually
control this with JavaScript so we're
gonna need a container for our bar let's
go ahead and give this a class of bar
and inside of here we need something
that's going to hold the bar fill now
this is going to be styled to have like
a gray background and then we're gonna
go ahead and include a span in here and
that's going to actually hold the fill
so I'm gonna call that bar fill so I'm
gonna go ahead and inside of here
if bar feel text in another span let's
create that span and then go ahead and
add that class attribute so I'm gonna
call this bar fill text and that's
because we need to separate this further
we're gonna give this a little bit of a
margin so it doesn't stick to the edges
of the fill so let's go ahead and start
to style this at the moment you can
imagine you won't see anything because
we've just created a div with a couple
of spans in let's go over to global dot
CSS and start to style this out so we're
gonna go ahead and target the bar class
and we're gonna give this a width of
100% we just want this to be a hundred
percent of the container that is
currently in and we're gonna go ahead
and also go ahead and give this
background like I said of something like
a dark gray or I'll sort of like gray so
let's go ahead and give this a padding
of three pixels let's go ahead and take
a look at what this looks like you can't
really see much at the moment it's very
very very faintly there so now we will
go ahead and add a margin bottom on this
just so the rest of the content
underneath stays out the way and let's
create a box shadow here just so we can
start to see how this is looking so I'm
going to go ahead and have this in set
zero and one pixel with the offset and
three pixel with a spread and I'm gonna
go and use the RGB a function and do a
black with a point two opacity
now let's go ahead and preview what this
looks like and we can start to see it's
like an indented if I just go ahead and
zoom in you can see it's like an
indented bar which is exactly the look
we're going for so now I've got a couple
of things I want to do I want to give
this a border radius just to smooth out
the edges so I'll do that at 3 pixels
and they also want the box sizing to be
border box now we can also go ahead and
include the vendor prefixes like WebKit
and Mars but I'm gonna leave them out
for now I'll leave that up do to make
this compatible with whichever browsers
you're going to be targeting so now
we're going to create the fill inside of
the bar so let's create that class there
and we're gonna go ahead and give this a
height of 20 pixels let's go ahead and
check out how that looks
okay so nothing's happened at the moment
because we need to go ahead and say
display:block and the reason we need to
do this is because at the moment span is
an inline displayed by default let's
give this a background of
cornflower-blue so a nice blue color and
let's also give this a width of zero and
we'll give this a border radius as well
and we'll say three pixels just to be
consistent with its container so you
can't see anything at the moment because
we need to change the width of this to
be able to actually see anything look
starts up nice so let's go ahead and
change the width of this so I'm gonna
set the width to 50% so you can now see
we've got this nice blue progress bar
effect inside it's indented container
now let's go ahead and make this look a
little bit more interesting when the
progress goes up because remember we're
gonna be controlling this with
JavaScript so we're gonna go ahead and
give this a transition so I'm going to
say transition width and I'm gonna give
this a naught point eight second delay
and I want that to ease in again you may
want to go ahead and use WebKit Mars or
Oh
bend the prefixes but I'm just gonna
leave this as transition for now so
let's give this a width of 50%
and increase this you can see that as I
increase that and decrease it we have
this lovely smooth motion as we do so so
now that we've got that sorted let's
create the text inside of it remember we
give this a class of our fill text so
how is this going to look well very very
simple we're gonna say color we want
this to be white and we're gonna give
this a padding of three pixels let's go
ahead and just add some text in there so
let's say 40% go ahead and refresh so
there's the text let's go ahead and
change the actual bar fill to 40% and
there we are so that's how it looks with
the progress bar in place we can go
ahead and control the width of this with
JavaScript later on but for now that's
the design of the progress bar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
