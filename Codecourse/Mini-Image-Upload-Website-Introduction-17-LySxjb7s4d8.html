building a basic image upload site and
we're gonna take this video just to have
a look at how this works and we're also
gonna look at some of the technologies
that we're gonna be using to make this
as easy as possible so first of all
you'll see that when we land on this
homepage we have a button here now when
we click on this we get this lovely
widget up that we can choose from a
variety of sources where we want to pull
an image in from and as you can see down
here this is powered by upload care
which is essentially just a way to
upload a file have it served via a
wonderful content delivery network which
allows us to manipulate our images
however we want and we're gonna
obviously talk about that throughout the
series so the other thing is that we're
going to be using a micro framework
called Silex we'll talk about that in
just a moment but let's go ahead and
upload an image see what we can do so we
can either choose from these sources or
what we can do is actually drag an image
on which works beautifully we can crop
this and our cropping will be nice and
saved but I'm gonna go ahead and upload
this full sized image here now when I
click the upload button you can see that
this now appears on here
now we have this lovely hover effect we
have a nice shadow of course this is all
going to be done with CSS as well and
let's just upload a couple more of the
same image just so we can see how this
kind of grid system that we're going to
be working with works so you'll notice
that we now have a kind of grid effect
just here and we're actually going to be
using CSS flexbox for this so we're not
going to be working with a grid system
it's too complicated for such a simple
project we're essentially just going to
be using flexbox and we'll obviously
talk more about that in a minute
so you can see here that this goes ahead
and nicely responds down to a smaller
viewport so we can also click on an
individual image and see this obviously
this is a very small image but if we
were to upload a larger image of course
we can crop this as well but you can see
that once we do upload this we can go
and view this pretty big and we have a
hash here that we're gonna generate that
will allow us to share this URL
you wanted to go ahead and share then
we're good to go so we're going to be
using Silex which is a micro framework
if you've what was slim before it's a
very similar deal this is from the
symphony larger symphony framework so if
you're interested in starting to get
into another framework then this is
going to be the perfect starting point
but these are the two main things that
we're going to use to get this built as
simply as possible there's still a
little bit of work to do there's a lot
to learn here but these two things just
make our job a lot easier so that's how
it works let's go ahead and build this
basic image upload site</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
