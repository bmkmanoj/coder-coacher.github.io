off with the basic document markup that
we have here and all we've got is just a
form here and if you're familiar with
basic HTML this will make complete sense
we're basically posting all of the data
that we've contained within this form
element to index dot PHP and that's
under the post method so that means that
we can pick this up in PHP using the
post superglobal that we saw in the
introduction video and we've got the
username email and password fields here
that we can access within that and then
obviously the submit button down here
just post that all through to index dot
PHP so it sends an HTTP request with
this information we can just basically
go ahead and pick this up in PHP now
what we will be doing is we're going to
be requiring everything in and
instantiating everything at the top of
this page ideally you would have some
kind of MVC structure you would include
this in a separate file but bear in mind
you do need to instantiate a new
validator object every time you want to
perform validation so it's best to do
that you know for it within each
controller method or what however you're
working with this on every page if
you're just you know doing all your
logic at the top of the page so really
what we need to do is start creating our
classes in here so I'm going to create a
classes folder within my root directory
at the moment we've just got this index
dot PHP it's literally just submit
submitting through to the same page and
not doing anything so inside of classes
let's create a couple of files the first
is the dependency that we spoke about
this is the error handler so I'm going
to create a file called error handler
dot PHP and let's create another file
this is going to be our main validator
so we're going to call this validator
dot PHP so obviously matching the class
name the file name so inside a validator
let's start to define this class out so
this is a class of validator we're going
to have various properties and methods
in here but we'll go over them shortly
the first thing we want to do is inject
the error handler into this class and
this is called dependency injection it
means that we can use the error handler
separately
and this class doesn't depend on
instantiating a new error handler
instance sounds confusing but it
basically just means we're putting this
error handler into the validator to be
able to use its functionality so let's
define this out as well and we'll call
this error handler and that's about it
so inside a validator let's create our
constructor method now the constructor
method runs when this is instantiated
and it's going to take an error handler
in here we can type hint this just to
make sure that we do get an instance of
error handler passed in and then what
we're going to do is we're going to
create a protected method function up
here and we're going to call this error
handler so this is just going to be
called error handler and what we're
going to do here is we're going to say
this error handler and we're going to
assign that the value that's passed in
so now what we can do is we can
instantiate this and we can instantiate
this as well so let's just require these
files in and do that now so we're going
to do a require once on classes error
handler dot PHP and we're going to do a
require once on classes validator PHP so
now what we can do is we can create a
new instance of our error handler so
let's create a variable called error
handler and we'll assign this new error
handler that's it now we're going to say
validator equals new validator and we
want to pass in the error handler and
that's it so what we'll do is we will
only instantiate this if we are seeing
elements within our post superglobal so
let's move this just up here and in that
so after this happens we can then start
to use our methods available in
validator and the first one is checking
if the data is available and
in the rules so we want to look
something like this we want to say valid
validation so creating a new variable
called validation and that's going to be
validator check so we're checking we're
using the check method on validator we
don't actually have that available so
let's create that now this is a public
function so it can be publicly accessed
called check and this takes two
parameters the first is the items that
we want to check so ie the post
superglobal or an array that you want to
pass in yourself so you could
technically say something like username
Alex for example and that's obviously an
associative array but I'm just going to
basically pass in post then comes an
array if you're using an earlier version
of PHP you might have to use array like
this but I'm going to be using the the
shorthand notation which is two square
brackets and in here comes an
associative array of multiple check
checks basically for each item and these
are going to be called the rules so
we're going to call these rules they're
referring to each item as items and each
rule as rules so what we want to do
within here is loop through all of the
items that we're given so that includes
those in the post superglobal so let's
say for each so we do for each loop on
this and we're going to say for each of
the items passed in and we're going to
grab the key which we're going to call
item and then we're going to grab the
value within that so just for now let's
echo out item and value and let's see
what this does so we will just get rid
of rules for now in fact when I will
keep rules and we'll just pass in this
empty array so let's check what this
does if we just refresh here and hit
submit
you can see we get user name email and
password that they are basically the
names of each of the items so what we're
doing now is we are seeing basically the
reason we didn't see any values here is
because we don't have any
so if we were to provide some details in
here you can see that that will give us
the username which then the other field
the value the next name of the field the
value and so on so we know that we've
got access to these now and these are
both useful because obviously we need to
know the keys of each of the items that
passed in check we can sort of
correspond them with what we specify in
here so for example username and then we
give an array of values so I think the
best thing to do here is probably
actually define out the rules as well
because then we can pass them over to
another method within our validator for
them to be checked so let's just make up
the rules for each of these items here
let's say that we want the username to
be required so we're going to say true
let's also say we want this to have a
max length of 20 let's say that's stored
in our database with a max length of 20
so that makes sense obviously this makes
sense to have a minimum length because
we don't people entering one character
usernames we're going to have an email
as well so this is just going to be
required again and we also want to say
that this is an email so going to
validate this as an email passing true
they're my none of this functionality
exists at all at the moment let's also
give this I guess a max length let's say
we were storing it at 255 in our
database we wouldn't want it to exceed
that and the password as well this is
good for validation we can say that we
want this to be required so pretty much
all of our fields are required and we
also can specify minimum length just to
make people guessing for some kind of
password security so regardless of why
we're doing this we've created what we
want to happen this is the functionality
that we want so inside of validator
after we've looped through
each of the items what we want to do is
we want to check basically whether the
values that are passed in in our post
data or whatever is passed in here are
actually available here because if for
example we post in you know username
email and password and we forget the
password here that's perfectly
reasonable we might not want to validate
that we might just want to say well it's
not required there's no specific length
or validation we want to apply to it
let's leave out therefore we don't want
to include it in the check so we're
going to have an if statement in here to
check whether this is in the rules array
so we take the item which remember is
the key name we want to check whether
it's in one of these and we do that by
using the array keys function which will
basically return the keys from an array
make sense so in this case the rules
which all of these would basically give
back an array with username email and
password and then that checks against
that so now what we want to do is pass
it to a validator within our validator
or validate method within our validator
so we're going to say this validate now
we're going to basically put a few
things into an array here and the reason
we're passing this off to another method
is because it makes sense to break
things up here we're doing a couple of
checks we're looping through each item
and we're calling another method this
method would get way too long if we
didn't break it up so that's why we're
doing it here so we're going to say that
we want the field to be the item this
remember this is a field name we echoed
that out earlier we're going to provide
a value to the validate method as well
and that's just going to be the value
which is obviously here that could be
you know my password my email address
and we also then want to provide the
rules and we say rules and then item and
that's the reason we did this check in
the first place because otherwise this
wouldn't be set so this item corresponds
to user name email and password and
there
we're just passing the rules here so
these arrays when passing these arrays
along with the data and the field name
to the validate method so let's create
this method here it's going to be a
protective method because we don't need
to access it from outside of this class
obviously unless we have an inheritance
art this is going to be called validate
and this is going to take in some data
so we're just going to call this item
okay so in here we're not going to do
too much either we don't overload the
amount of checking we do in here or
anything like that the first thing I
want to do is I want to extract the
field name because I'm going to use it a
couple of times later so I'm just going
to say item field remember that this
that we just sort of pushed into this
method earlier so now what we want to do
is we want to loop through each role
we've already looped through each item
and then we're calling this validate
method for each item but now what we
want to do for say username you want to
loop through all of these rules for
email we want to loop through all of
these rules so what we want to do is
again do a for each but this time we
want to loop through item rules and this
is going to be as rule and this is the
wrong name so this is required max
length min length email or whatever else
you want to extend this with and this is
going to bring in a satisfier now the
satisfier is what satisfies that this
rule has been met so for example the max
length satisfy it is 20 the value passed
in here - this must be a maximum of 20
characters long so what we now want to
do is think about this we need a set of
a allowed rules the reason being is
because we're going to be dynamically
calling methods so I'm going to not do
all the validation in here I'm going to
create separate methods for each piece
of validation so whether it's a require
required or not whether it's a Max or
min length email
exists in the database or whatever so we
need to create a little if statement
here and we need to use the in array
function to check if the rule is within
a set of rules allowed and if this isn't
quite clear just now don't worry too
much it will become clearer later when
you see how we're going to be
dynamically calling these so we're going
to say if in array rule this rules now
this rules is an array which doesn't
quite exist yet so let's go ahead and
create this up here so protected rules
this is just going to be array of method
names that exist within this this class
now we could see if if say the rule name
is callable but that doesn't stop you
know us passing in fields that will call
this check method and again if this is a
little bit confusing don't worry it will
become clear later when we build this
out so we're going to have required min
length max length and email so let's
populate this here so required min
length max length and email simple as
that so only if this rule exists will it
work
so I'm just for a purpose of testing I'm
going to echo out rule perhaps a pender
break onto there and you can see that
now what's going to happen is when I
submit we get for each one so this is
for username this is for email and this
is the password we get each of them
output however if we neglect to include
required in this array you will see that
we omit the required then so that's now
not checking required so once we know
that this is going to be called we could
also check if it's callable that's up to
you whether you put that in but what
we're now going to do is we're going to
call them or use a function in PHP
called call user func array and this
could be confusing if you've never come
across it before but what we're going to
do is we're going to check for return
value on a method within our class to
actually let's leave this out for now
because it can easily become confusing
let's now define all of the methods that
we need to check required min length Max
and an email so these are going to be
protected because we don't need to
access these outside so we're going to
say required now each of these methods
that we create are going to take in the
agile field in case we need the field
name the value and of course the
satisfier
so in this case what we're going to do
is we're going to fill required it's
fairly straightforward we need to
provide field value and satisfy anyway
but we don't actually need all of these
we just need the value now here what
we're doing is we're checking if a value
is not empty so I'm going to return if
not empty value and we may also want to
trim this as well just to remove any
white space so that's checking if that
value is required you may want to do
additional checks in here it's entirely
up to you but that's now done so when we
call this method inside of here and
we're going to be calling that based on
the rule name so if the rule name is
required that will call the method call
required if the wrong name similarly is
let's do min length then if the rule
name is min length that will call inside
of here min length so this is basically
how it works
so let's now just start to call what we
need in here so we are going to use the
call user func array now what's going to
happen is for each of these methods
they're always going to return true or
false they're going to return a boolean
so we're going to say if not and this
means the return value from these
functions so we're going to call user
func array this takes we're going to get
rid of this actually because that's a
little misleading we're going to pass in
an array for the class or the object
that we want to call in this case it's
this object and this rule so now what
this mess
that is doing is it schooling this
meaning this validator class and it's
calling this role as a method name so
for example the first one is required
this line here will call this method the
second time round we get max length that
will then call a method called max
length it just means that we don't have
to do a switch statement or an if
statement to check each one and and
create basically more code than we need
to so let's define now the rest of the
rules and then we'll test if these
actually work and make sure we've not
done anything wrong here
so for the value and the satisfier for
the min length again fairly
straightforward we return the string
length and I'm using MB STR Len value so
if the string length of this is greater
than or equal to the satisfier that
means that we have fulfilled the minimum
length and we can literally just copy
and paste the min length and switch this
in for max length and that is exactly
the same thing except that it is less
than or equal to so if this is less than
or equal to the satisfy that means that
is fulfill the fact that it's not
exceeding the max length finally we have
a method called email which does the
same thing here has the same arguments
and we are returning we're using the
filter var function in PHP we're passing
the value and the constant here which
defines a valid email address so there
are our methods now these are calling
each of the method so let's just echo
out okay it just for the sake of it just
see what's happening here so I'm going
to refresh and click continue
okay so we've missed out something in
our call user func array method and that
is a second parameter of the argument so
we need to pass these arguments through
to these methods so in this case is just
another array
and we need to pass through the field
the value in the satisfier so in this
case is the field for the value it's
literally just item value remember
that's what we passed in without value
with our array interact into here and
last but not least we have the satisfier
and that is defined here as part of the
rules so let's again just refresh here
and click continue ok so this all says
ok ok ok
I should have that's a little bit
misleading I should have right failed
like this and depending on how many we
have here if we just append a break
you'll see we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 so if
we look back in our index we've got a
max length here to 5 5 so that wouldn't
have failed
we've got max length here of 20 which
wouldn't have failed that leaves 1 2 3 4
5 and 6 so that leaves us with the 6
failed that means that the failed has
returned 6 times and it looks like we're
on good track so this actually you know
returning the results we need but it's
no use just you know doing something
here what we need to do is we need to
store the error messages associated with
the current rule being checked and for
this we're going to pull in the error
handler which we haven't even touched
yet this is fairly straightforward the
error handler just basically allows us
to store errors add errors return all
errors check if the errors actually
exist and also grab the first error from
a specific rule or specific field rather
so let's create this error handler and
see this in action so we're going to
have a errors array here and we're
leaving this or automatically assigning
this with an empty array because it
could there could be no errors added so
we want to use the empty method on this
to check if it contains any values
now what we're interested in doing here
is allowing errors to be added so this
should be add error so adding an error
means we pass in an error message but we
also want to optionally allow a key to
be specified to group these and by
grouping them I mean if we want to add
an error specifically for the user name
that means that we can provide the key
of user name and the reason that we're
doing this but also not allowing or not
requiring this is because you can use
this error handler elsewhere in your
application we don't want to
specifically tie this down to what we're
doing within our validator that's bad
practice so to add an error the first
thing we want to do is check if the key
actually exists so we're going to say if
key neverkey does exist we want to say
this errors remember this is that array
up here and we want to add an error
within this specific key an error is
basically just going to be a string so
we could say something like let's just
give an example down here let's say
error handler in fact we can actually
demonstrate this because it's completely
separate we can actually do this so
let's just comment this out so the error
handler here we're going to say error
handler add error and we're going to add
hoops that is not valid just as an
example and then we can add it under the
key of user name and that means that if
we add say another error here another
one down here and another one down here
we can say something like too short and
under say email and password we can say
invalid email and we're going to be
doing all of this within our validator
class remember so this isn't completely
wasted functionality and you can use it
elsewhere as well as I could say say
passwords not strong enough it could be
anything so
now what we can actually do is inside of
our validator bear in mind this is what
we're going to be doing inside a
validator sorry inside of our error
handler if the key hasn't been provided
we just want to add that into the errors
like that as a normal string we're not
going to be doing that in this case we
always want to provide a key okay so
what we're going to do now is we're
going to create a method which checks if
errors do exist so we're going to return
if there is a positive count on this all
which we haven't created we want to
return true otherwise we want to return
false this is just a ternary operator if
this set is positive we're returning a
true otherwise we're returning a false
that support that does so this all
method that we are using within out has
errors method if we do a public all
function here which we are allowing to
be used outside remember earlier we
looked at using our validator fails
method and returning all errors what
this is going to do is it's going to
also allow an optional key to be passed
in we might want to get all errors as in
all errors for username email and
password but we may also want to get all
the all errors just for the user name or
just for the password so what we're
going to do now is we're going to return
and we're going to do another ternary
operator
we're checking if this errors key is set
if it is set then we want to return all
errors under that key so this errors key
now otherwise we just want to return all
the errors we're just going to assume
that that is not available so now has
errors should return true or false so
what do we think is going to happen if I
do a var dump on error handler has
errors let's take a look and refresh and
we get a true now if we were to just
temporarily get rid of these we get
false so we know that that's now working
so this is allowing us to add errors and
then check if errors are available what
about the other functionality that makes
this a little bit more rich in this case
its first this allows us to get the
first error within a particular key so
we're going to create a method here call
first and that's always going to have a
key we always want to provide a key in
there so we don't need to default sign
it to null so we're going to return
again we're going to do a ternary
operator here and return something so
what we're going to do is we're going to
check if this all at the specified key
and the first error on that key exists
so for example if there were two user
name errors and we said we want to get
the first a result from user name we're
then saying is the first error available
i does it have anything now if it does
we want to return this all at key at
position zero otherwise we're going to
return false a returning mixed from here
we're either returning a string or the
value false and this just lets us I mean
what we could do really is we just
return an empty string and that would
keep things a bit more consistent
we're either returning a string here or
an empty string so we can use this in an
if statement if we really want to you
can give it as false it's entirely up to
you so now let's check this out and see
if this actually works so let's start to
put this into an if statement we're
going to say if error handler has errors
then I'm going to say oh I want to get
the first user name error in that case
it's oops this is not valid
so I'm going to say echo error handler
first user name so that should give me
oops that is not valid cool if this was
switched around the other way
it will tell me to short there we are
so that works now let's try on the wall
method and it might help that we wrap
this in pre tags that just gives us this
output with line breaks which makes
things a lot easier to see oh we need to
do a print R on that and there we go so
we've got all of the errors in our
without keys along with our keys and
there we are now bear in mind if we're
not using keys let's just get rid of
these again temporarily we would
literally just see a list of errors
which is perfectly fine you may want to
use that for this reason so we've now
got this we may again want to get all
from username we've already built this
functionality and that will just give us
them - they'll relate to the username so
we've got this all working we can get
rid of all of this except out error
handler instantiation and we can start
to bring this back now so what I'm now
going to do is start to use the error
handler inside of the validator
remember earlier when we constructed we
pass this in as a dependency and we
stored it up here so inside of back to
our call user func array if a false
value is returned from any of these that
means there's an error so we want to
then go ahead and store an error so I'm
going to say this error handler we're
calling this exactly like we did just a
moment ago on index but we're calling it
from within validator so going to add an
error now remember again this takes an
error so an error string and it takes a
namespace or a key if you like so for
example user name we can't obviously
hard-code that because we're looping
through each of the values in this case
though we want to store it in the field
remember we pass the field through for
each of the fields and we obtained it
here that's then passed into there so
this will be user name for the first
loop this will be email for second and
password for the third now for adding
the actual error this is a little bit
more tricky so I'm going to pull this
down just so we can concentrate a little
bit more on this I'm pulling that down
what we're going to do here is something
slightly tricky we are going to because
bear in mind we need to provide an error
for each one each field but we want to
say the user name field is empty we
can't hard-code anything in here because
we're doing this dynamically so we need
to store a list of errors up here so we
can do that within a public we can call
this errors I suppose or messages would
be better now this is going to be an
array of strings it's going to be an
associative array so for required I'm
going to choose the message that I want
to output and because I've set this as a
public this means that this can be
changed it can come from a config it can
be overridden you can expand this if you
need that functionality but the
likelihood is you'll probably just come
in here and edit it so for required I'm
going to say the field this is a
placeholder this will change this could
be the user name field is required the
password field is required the email the
bio whatever you're choosing is your
field name this needs to be flexible so
we're going to say the field field is
required and we're going to be using STR
replace to replace this in a moment
so for min length this is a similar deal
but this time we want to also replace in
the satisfier so we're going to say the
field field must be a minimum of
satisfier length
and we'll do a similar thing for max
length here as well so let's just grab
this and paste this down here so it must
be a maximum of the fever must be a
maximum of yeah that makes sense okay so
the last one is the email and again if
you're creating your own options you can
extend this that is not a valid email
address that's a pretty straightforward
one okay so we've got these messages
here but how we're going to grab these
values and replace in these placeholders
oh that's fairly straightforward we're
going to use STR replace new STR replace
takes a needle which is what you're
looking for
it takes a haystack which is what you
are looking for in and it takes out
sorry it takes a needle or a placement
and a where you're replacing basically
so for this what we're doing is we're
passing in arrays rather than single
values and we're looking within this
messages rule so for example in this
first loop let's say the rule is
required that we'll grab this value here
so this string now is under replacement
and we want to replace the values in
here field satisfier and we want to
replace them with the field which we get
from here and the satisfier which we get
from here so let's say for example this
is a username we are saying required
true max length min length so this whole
thing as we know let's pull this over
this whole thing we know is going to
loop or be called this method is we're
going to be called three times for the
first time around this field will be
username which you know obviously will
remain the same for each each time it
loops but this
we'll change this rule will change so
we'll get this string for required max
length the min length will replace in
the field and the satisfier and then
that will be added to the errors if this
as we've already discussed is invalid so
what we now want to do is obviously
within our validator we want to
introduce some more methods that will
check whether or not errors have
occurred so we store these errors now so
now we need to check them so let's
create a public function called errors
now what this is going to do is it's
going to do something slightly different
we're not actually going to return the
errors we're going to return this error
handler oops
handler so let's test this out so we
don't have a fails method yet so we
can't do anything here but what we're
going to do is I'm going to do a var
dump on validation errors this will give
me a error handler object okay so let's
have a look here okay so what's happened
here is I'm basically trying to chain on
a method because we've already called
this check method here but the check
method doesn't actually return anything
and it should return this
so by returning this it returns the
entire object and therefore I can chain
on methods like errors so when i refresh
now you can see that we get this error
handler object back and it's got all the
errors in here so we know that errors
are being stored you can actually see
now the fruit of our labor the username
field is required that is not a valid
email address the password field is
required the password field must be a
minimum of 6 lengths so we can see here
we've lit such little work by doing this
and this check down here we've actually
created quite a powerful system so
instead the sort of instead of errors
what we want to do is we also want to
have a fails method so we can do
something more correctly down here and
we can say something like if validation
fails so this will return a boolean then
I'm going to do a print our on
validation errors all remember by
calling all on errors what were actually
doing is we're recalling calling all on
error handler so we're referring to this
method inside of here all so let's just
tidy this up a little bit and do a wrap
in pre tags and inside of validator now
we want to implement this fails method
so this is going to return this error
handler and has errors and this is
obviously implemented in here which
returns a boolean to this therefore it's
going to return a boolean so now if the
validator fails we're outputting the
errors from the error handler so let's
check this out hit submit and we get
this array here and we can change this
up like we saw before with username
inside of all and that will only return
us with the e username errors and we can
also call the first method on particular
field like so so with actually very
little code we've managed to create a
validator which you can extend your
validation requirements we've
implemented a separate error handler
which is used inside a validator as a
dependency now extending you
or validation rules are as simple as
adding it to our protected rules which
by the way earlier we discussed you know
may not make sense
the reason being here is for example if
I was I've know from a security point of
view I was you know creating some
validation rules etc etc and I wanted to
say I know
check in here now because we've got
check written in here what that's
actually going to do then is called I
mean it's not really from a security
point of view it's more from a sort of
correctness point of view or a
consistency point of view that would
then call this method because we're
calling methods on the fly so we do that
just to make sure that they're available
and like I said earlier you can use is
call a ball as well checking if the
method is called a ball anyway adding
your own validation is as simple as just
taking one of these messages and
creating it for yourself and whatever
the validation ball is what we can also
then do what you should also then do is
add a new item in here and then
obviously you would create a new method
and that would basically just do your
check and return true false or whatever
and it would then replace the field and
the satisfier fields that are input here
so with that we've created the base it's
the base for a very simple validation
class that can be easily extended</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
