time but the chances are the after a
while things start to get messy really
difficult to change and rendering the
page actually becomes slower perhaps
without you even noticing
well let's cover Ben and how this might
help you so Ben is a naming convention
for CSS and despite it looking quite
messy sometimes it's actually extremely
easy to learn and the benefits go a long
way so first we're gonna cover what Ben
looks like and then we'll dive into the
benefits so first of all what does Ben
stand for well the B embem87 and then
the M is the modifier now you'll mostly
use the block and element when defining
classes but modifiers although they used
less are actually equally as useful so
let's just step back and take a look how
you might be writing CSS at the moment
and honestly I have to say there's
nothing wrong with this I've done it
everyone's done it and I'm not saying
it's the end of the world
however as we're writing out the code
that we're going to do in a moment we'll
look at some of the problems that we'll
face as our project possibly grows
larger and we've all been there where
we've written CSS and eventually we get
into just a big mess so let's get rid of
this we know what them stands for now
and let's head over to app dot CSS and
take a look an example of how we might
write CSS out so let's say we have a
user avatar we obviously define an
avatar class and then we go ahead and
give it some properties so for example
we might have a border radius of 20
pixels and we might have a width of 50
pixels and a height of 50 pixels let's
just change this to a hundred percent
actually okay so let's say we wanted to
place this avatar on our top navigation
this might be used for say a blog post
or a forum post or something like that
well we may say navitor and
might say avatar so we're saying an
avatar within our top navigation perhaps
has a different width and a different
height to it so we define these stars
out like so so now we decide Oh actually
we need an avatar in the bottom
navigation when a users signed in so we
say nav dot bottom and then we say
avatar and then again we define out a
different width and a height to say it's
40 pixels this time instead but now we
decide well on the bottom navigation we
want the Avatar to possibly have a
grayscale so this could be some kind of
modifier depending on something so we
could then say nav bottom avatar dot
grayscale so this would be an avatar on
the bottom navigation with an additional
grayscale course and then perhaps we
could use a CSS filter on this to filter
80% grayscale so you might be thinking
well there's nothing wrong with this at
all but what's actually happening here
is one you're tying this down to certain
element so you're being very specific
about where these elements are styled
let's say that then we want to move this
avatar and we want to place it somewhere
else
well we've tied this down to NAV bottom
now and we can't really do that of
course what we can do is we can say
avatar dot small or large or something
like that but again this kind of gets a
little bit messy and at the moment we're
just talking about a very simple
component we're not talking about
layouts we're not talking about reusable
modules we're just talking about a
single component that we want to look
different in different places and
actually glancing at this code does it
look obvious exactly what's going on to
me it looks a little bit messy now the
other problem here and one way BEM can
help us is these kinds of selectors are
actually very slow they're very
expensive
within CSS to actually render this so
we're going to take a look at them and
how we can actually make this look a lot
more readable do
you or anyone else that looks at your
code and we're gonna see how this will
improve speed how it will improve the
way we work at general workflow more
importantly how we can reuse components
and using BEM will actually make our
HTML look a lot more readable as well
we'll have very very specific modules
that at a glance will just look very
very simple to understand right so we
know the downfalls of working with CSS
like this so how is BEM going to jump in
and save the day
well let's head over to the next video
and we'll start using the BEM
methodology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
