self-destructing message app now this
might seem like a pretty silly thing to
build and it probably doesn't have too
much real-world use it can be useful but
the reason that we're doing this is it
touches lots of areas of developing a
project and what we're going to be doing
is using slim three which is a very
lightweight very easy to use PHP
framework so if you are put off by
frameworks don't worry too much it's
gonna be really simple to set up and it
will make our application structure a
lot nicer we're not gonna have any messy
files floating around now the next thing
it does is deals with sending email
through a third-party provider which
when you have any project is really
important so we'll look at doing this
through mailgun which is a third-party
email provider rather than doing this
with something like PHP mailer or the
PHP mail function which you should
probably never use it also looks at
things like configuration and because we
have container within SIM 3 it keeps
everything tidy we're not gonna have any
messy long 300 line files here so there
are a few other useful things along the
way but generally building this will
give you a really good idea about
pulling all of these things together to
build a really nice little application
so let's look at how this works I'm
gonna type an email in here and I'm
gonna choose a message some just can say
like that so when I send this off we
actually see a notification up here
which we're going to be looking at -
that's just a flash notification so it
won't persist in a session and you'll
see that this has sent me an email so we
have a new message from destruct II you
have a new self-destructing message now
obviously when we click on this we can
actually see the contents of it you can
see that this is identified by a hash
here but actually what's happened here
is it's been deleted as soon as we
viewed it so when this link is given to
anyone else or the receiver tries to see
it again they won't be able to see it
this has actually been deleted from the
database as well so a really fun app to
build that type
is pretty much all kind of good area so
you need to know we're gonna be looking
at obviously submitting that form
showing them flash messages storing
things now database sending emails and
looking at doing this all within a very
nice easy to use framework to keep
everything tidy so let's jump over and
start building this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
