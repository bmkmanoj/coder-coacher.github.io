is counting the amount of records that
we have within this table and this is
going to provide us some input that
looks a little bit different to what
we've already seen and it might be a
little bit confusing at first but you
know hopefully this should make sense so
at the moment we know that we've got two
records you know we can see that it says
at the bottom here two rows in set
however this data won't be available if
we were say using an interface in PHP
and we wanted to pull through data it
won't necessarily give us the count of
the records unless we specifically
select this or you might just want to
query the database once just to get a
count of records and in this case this
command that were about to use is
probably going to be the best option so
what we're going to do is we're first of
all gonna just get the count back and
then we're gonna specifically define the
column name a dunt a dynamic column name
that we want to give this count value so
let's just take a look at how we do this
we still use the Select command but this
time we use the count function what we
do is we pass in a field that we want to
count on now we can use Asterix but I
just prefer to write ID or something
like that and we go from articles as
usual so we're just using a function
here in place of any fields and what
this will do is it will give us a again
a little table here with a count of ID
and it will say the actual count value
so this is the value that you would pick
up in you know whatever programming
language you're using to access this
database this is where you'd pick it up
but what we're gonna do now is slightly
modify this query and I'm gonna use the
as keyword to specifically name this
field with with a count value in so I'm
just going to call this count so now
what's going to happen is it's gonna
select the count as count and the count
will be the field name so you can now
see that instead of having count ID it's
now changed to count two
now you might be thinking well what if
we actually want to bring back all of
our data and the amount of results well
that's absolutely fine what we can do is
we can say select count ID as count name
description create it ID for example so
we want to bring back all of our fields
and the count as well so what this will
do is is you know this doesn't quite
look right at the moment so we'll see
what we can do about this in just a
moment we need to modify this query
significantly so what we'll go ahead and
do is just get rid of all of this
because we don't really want to go ahead
and just modify it be better to type it
out again and what we need to do is
create an inner query and what this is
going to do is it's going to provide us
with all the results we need plus the
count on each result so we can go ahead
and we can select the count where we
need it so let's go ahead and do this so
we need to go ahead and select I'm just
gonna select all data just for the sake
of seeing everything and what I also
want to do is go ahead and select
something else and this something else
is going to be instead of count ID
because if we do it this way I could say
count ID from articles like this we get
exactly the same results we get the one
we get one result back in the count now
ordinarily what we do is with group by
and we would group by a specific fields
that were group by ID now what this
would do is it would provide us the two
fields because we're grouping by the
unique identifier and but the count now
shows one so that looks a little bit
strange so what we can actually do here
is instead of saying count ID we want to
go ahead and create an in in sort of an
inline or inside query so I'm going to
go ahead and say select count and this
is all within brackets select count ID
from articles as count just capitals
just so make sense okay so it's
selecting all fields from articles but
we're also doing an inner query and
we're selecting the count from articles
as count and we're grouping still by ID
so
this is now done is it's given us the
two results that we need and it's given
us the count on the end of here which is
two obviously because we have two
records</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
