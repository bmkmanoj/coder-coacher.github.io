creating a basic poll with PHP so I'm
just going to show you around what this
looks like and then I'm going to explain
a little bit about the code and the next
we'll go on to actually you know
creating the poll itself so here you can
see I've got two polls already set up
now these are set up in my database you
can see here that we've got an ID a
question and a start and an end date
which mean you can actually control the
start in the end date for the poll the
questions obvious it's just displayed
here on the page so now I'm currently
logged in as user one now we're not
going to be talking about user
authentication in this series because
it's kind of a waste of time just to
explain the functionality of a poll so
for now what we're doing is we're
starting sessions in PHP if you don't
understand what these are will be
looking into it and then we are creating
or assigning the value 1 to this user ID
key in our session superglobal all that
means is that we're pretending the Wyss
signed in as user with the ID of 1 you
may already have some kind of
authentication system and I'm just going
to assume I'm signed in as user 1 which
would obviously be the unique ID
assigned to each user so if we would
create another user it would look like
that so we would we could also sign in
as Billy so the questions are displayed
here and we've got two whole options you
can see that if we actually go back to
Pauls and we change one of these so for
example if this one ended on the 22nd of
the 8th month then that one wouldn't be
displayed so we have control over what
we can actually display here let's just
change that back and head over here so
I'm going to click on the first one and
you can see here that we've got a main
question which we already know it exists
and we've got now a few options these
are stored in a separate database table
just to make things a little bit easier
and a user can click on either one of
these options and they can hit submit
answer so as soon as I do this it's
going to present me with a different
view and that's going to be a total
percentage of all of the users answers
so for example if I chose the first
option here you can obviously see that
it gives us a little confirmation you've
completed the poll thank you and then
we've got the first
option as a hundred percent which is
obviously I'm the only user that is
voted on this poll and the other two are
at zero percent obviously so let's
actually take a look inside poll answers
here you can see that's been logged as
well as well as the choices here will
obviously be going over this later let's
go ahead and sign in as user two so once
we do that you'll then see this returns
back to me not being able to or me not
have completing it so now technically
signed in as a different user so if I
now choose the second option that's
obviously going to split the first in
the second option at 5050 and so on and
so forth so however many people vote
you'll see the percentages so this is a
really short easy simple but effective
way to allow you to create a poll so
that's what we're going to be looking at
the code is fairly straightforward and
we'll get started in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
