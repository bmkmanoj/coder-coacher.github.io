we've been seeing the standard slim for
a for not found error page so for
example if we were to just head over to
a rubbish URL we see this just normal
404 page now obviously we are going to
want to implement a custom 404 page
within our application so we can render
this along with the rest of our template
now luckily doing this is really easy so
all we need to do is under routes we
want to create a section called errors
so we're going to create a folder errors
and under this we're going to create a
new file called 404 dot PHP now it's
really straightforward to define and not
found route all we do is we say app not
found and then we give our function in
there it's quite straightforward and we
can use app as well so what happens if
the page cannot be found we want to
render a view because we want this to be
part of our template so let's say app
render errors 404 dot PHP and let's go
ahead and add this to our routes far
down here so so this route doesn't this
view does not exist sorry so let's
create this now errors 404 dot PHP again
let's steal the base from the home view
and we will add this to 404 in the title
we can just say 404 and then that page
can't be found easy as that so we have a
route to deal with a 404 which we define
using the not found method parsing our
callback as usual our closure we render
a 404 view and now when we view a page
that can't be found we see that as part
of our application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
