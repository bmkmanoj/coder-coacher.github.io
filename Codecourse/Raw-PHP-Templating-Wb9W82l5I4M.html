with PHP we're not going to be using any
particular templating engine we're just
gonna use raw PHP templating and just
look at how templating just within PHP
works so you probably come across a
point where inside of a file you're
wanting to output HTML and there are a
couple of ways to do this
obviously the preferred solution would
be to use some kind of framework or some
kind of better structure where you
separate your views from your logic but
in this case we're just gonna do all of
our logic at the top of this page and
then we're gonna output right at the
bottom so this is sort of the next best
thing so we would close off a PHP tag
here and we would create some kind of
HTML structure down here where we can
actually output something so typically
what you might do is if we just get rid
of this for now you might say well I'm
going to I don't know create an array of
items so you can create an array like
this and we could say I'd know item 1
item 2 an item 3 these might be items
coming from a database or an XML file or
a JSON file whatever it is but you would
typically you know do a for each loop
she would go over each of these items
call that an item and then you would
echo out say item and then you might do
like a comma if you were using echo and
you might do a br on there or something
like that so we get the following result
we just get item 1 item 2 item 3 and if
we look at the page source they're just
separated by be ours obviously this is
acceptable depending on what you're
doing but generally it does tend to get
a little bit messy particularly when
you're doing something like the
following so for example say I wanted to
create an unordered list which looks
like this and it has list items within
it that looks bit funny because of the
highlighting but there we go you get the
idea we can have multiple list items and
this is just the correct way to list
unordered items with markup so what we
would typically do is or what you might
do which is extremely bad practice you
might echo a UL here
you might echo an ending ul down here
and then you might just for readability
indent this for each loop and then you
might echo out list item here and then
within this you might come and separate
this or you could even concatenate it
there's not really much of a difference
and then you might just output item like
that and that would give you the
following so we're still generating
markup here but as you can see this does
look a little bit messy there are other
ways we can do this we could break out
of PHP here and break into PHP here and
get rid of our PHP code so we could do
that down here as well
oops just end that and then we could do
the unordered list there and ending that
like so so there's a few ways that we
can do this we could even do that there
as well so we could break out here we
could do Li Li and then do break into
PHP and out again an aerco item so
that's another way to do it and it works
exactly the same way it's still looking
a little bit messy so in this video
we're going to look at a couple of
things that we can do within PHP and
we'll look at a couple of examples so
just echoing and then we'll look at
things like looping as well and if
statements but apart from that you'll
generally get the gist of the syntax so
what we're gonna do is going to end our
PHP tag there normally on a page with
just PHP we wouldn't what we're gonna do
that I'm gonna create a html5 markup
basically a basic document layout here
so the idea here is to cleanly or as
cleanly as possible using raw PHP
templating is to output the unordered
list and the list items within here well
let's do this now now what we're gonna
do is we're gonna first of all use an if
statement to check if there are any
items in here so we could do the
following PHP and end PHP tag and this
allows us to use shorthand syntax like
the following so this is a little bit
different because we don't have a curly
brace here usually what we do is we
would have I'm sure you know this is
something like that
in this case what we're doing is we're
just saying if and then our expression
can go inside of our parentheses we then
got a colon on the end so we're gonna
say if not empty items empty is just
going to check if this has any items in
and then we're gonna come down I'm gonna
open and close another PHP tag and we're
gonna say else again with a colon on the
end so pretty much like you would chain
onto the end of your curly braces you
would have an else there and then you
would also then have an end if with a
final terminator so a semicolon so
otherwise what would we want to do well
we want output a paragraph and we're
just gonna say sorry there are no items
now otherwise we want to loop so instead
of pulling this down and causing an
extra line which can get a little bit
confusing we're just gonna come down
here and we're gonna open and close tags
again I'm gonna use the for each again
and you probably already guess we just
bug a colon on there and then we come
down here and this time this is a little
bit different because usually with the
for for each loop you would end like
this but we've done the same here with
end if you just say end for each like so
so inside of the for each here we're
gonna say for each items as item and
then here what we can do in fact up here
this is what makes it really really
simple because we've not brought this
down we've basically just got single
lines here so I've actually forgotten to
insert the UL so I just come down here
and I put the UL in I come down here and
I in that you out there and then what I
can do is with in here I mean you could
even indent this to be honest it it's
entirely up to you you would add your
list item here though we've got two
levels of indentation so you may want to
just stick with doing something like the
following or something like that so it's
entirely up to you either way we've now
got our list item so what we can now do
is we can use the short echo which as of
I think PHP 5.5 or 5.6 maybe this will
be on by default in the config you might
usually see
this turned off in the config or it
really depends between different servers
for maximum compatibility I'd say use
the normal tag like this and then you
would just echo item otherwise what you
can is you can use the shorthand and
this involves removing echo and it's an
implied echo so we have a opening a
short opening tag and equals and then
the item you don't even have to have the
semicolon I like to add it if I do do
this but you don't necessarily have to
it probably looks a little bit cleaner
that way and that gives us exactly the
same result so we've got the same markup
here we've got our document we've got an
unordered list opening three list items
and an unordered list and obviously if
we were to remove the items from here
and just have an empty array there we go
we get out sorry there are no items
message so this is how you can very
basically template your your output if
you are not using a templating engine if
you do want to use a templating engine
that's a really really good way to go
because it does provide much cleaner
syntax basically so there's a little bit
about PHP templating or raw PHP
templating you can use other control
structures here so for example while
loops just an if statement and if-else
we've seen an example of an if and a for
each here you can go ahead and use what
you need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
