decided to simply call it blog it's just
the most simple name I could think of
but of course you're free to name it
whatever you like
so first categories this has two fields
namely an ID and a name so let's start
with the ID now we do not need many
categories I have seen sites which have
over a hundred categories but I think
it's very unlikely that you will ever
need so many but just in case we'll make
this three characters long but you
really don't need any more than this of
course primary key and auto increment I
explained this AMD my sequel series so
if you don't understand what this means
please by enemies refer back to those
videos next we have the name which is
going to be a VAR char field of at most
24 characters long and we'll want this
to be unique we do not need duplicate
category names and that's all there is
to it as I mentioned in the previous
video we make this 24 because category
names generally should not be very long
they should be short and they should be
descriptive that can be done in one word
and there simply aren't many 24
character long words so that's all there
is to the categories table let's now
create the Post's table remember this
has five fields the ID the category ID
the title post
contents of the boats boats post sorry
and the date at which it was posted so
once again let's start with the ID this
is going to be an integer and once again
I doubt you'll create thousands and
thousands of posts but in case you want
to expand on this and allow multiple
users or whatever features you want
we'll just make it six but I think
that's really really stretching it
anyway primary key also increment done
category ID is exactly the same thing as
the ID in the categories table so we'll
give it a length of three remember that
here we are using the relational model
we could enforce this with nodb but you
might not have this set up and work well
it just makes things unnecessarily
complicated for the sake of this
tutorial so we're just going to stick
with this with E my SM don't really know
how to pronounce this either way don't
worry too much about what I just said
next post title for char now some people
forget to specify a length here and just
assume that the max is used but you need
to specify a value here and we're just
going to stick with 255 titles can get
pretty long so it's fine then we have
contents which is going to be text field
and we don't need to specify a length
here so we're just going to leave this
default and then we have date posted
which is where is it
day time and here we're going to specify
a default value and we're going to make
it zero zero - double zero - quadruple
zero how do you say that and then
basically the same with colons so
basically we have day month year then
hours minutes and seconds the reason we
use this as the default date is because
we are going to use a function within my
sequel called
now which stores dates and this format
so this is a good practice now let's
save this and there we have it now I'm
just five minutes or so through this
video but I think I'll just keep things
a bit organized and start coding in the
next part so see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
