continuing our series of unit testing
you can check out the full episode
playlist by clicking there and today we
are continuing with exploring mocking I
am mpj and you are watching fun fun
function
all right so let's have a look at where
we were last time let me close this
window this is the order total function
that we were working on and we see here
that we have we started a bit with
calling fetch here and well it's not
doing much we also needed to start doing
some response parsing here so I think
that that's what we were going to
continue it I'm also going to open up
the sandbox so that we remember what
we're doing here so this is the way you
do a fetch call you you call fetch with
an L and then you parse the response in
this case we're parse it that's Jason
and then we're going to extract the the
vit rate here okay so we have our fake
fetch here and what we want this to do
is return a the promise that resolves to
two response
so you see here fetch returns a promise
and that promise resolves to this
response object which in turn has a
jason jason method on it that in turn
will that will actually also return a
promise that will resolve to this data
here so you know let's just do that
actually so fake fetch will return I
promised the deter that resolves to a
response object this is a response
object and that has adjacent but
that in turn resolves to order it it's a
promise
returns a promise that resolves to oh
sorry I've switched little woman sandbox
and I resolve to this thing's it's data
rate standard value it let me copy that
so that just help me here resolves to an
object that has rates which in turn has
a standard rate which in turn has a
value which is going to be a 19 perhaps
I made a mistake here promise - promise
I'm drunk let me fix that promise or
resolve is of course what am I I meant
anyway given this then Blaire we should
actually expect this to multiply the
value of this order by 19% let's update
the test to do that so expect result to
be 20 times 2 times 1 19 let's run that
create integrated terminal and run npm
tests see what we get
get a I expected to get a failure but we
didn't hmm that's peculiar new actually
it is not because they I'm hmm let me
close that I'm gonna show you that
mistake I made going to slightly zoom
out as well so that we can see more so
the way just works is that when it comes
to a synchronous test
it needs to know when the test has ended
so you know you can do that by having
these dumb functions and then call them
when at when the test is done we could
see if that worked actually and p.m.
test yeah that that works but that's not
the way we want to do it because it can
also instead of using this callback
pattern we can just return this this
promise here it's a bit more no promises
are nice it's a nice FBI it's better
than the dun dun thing so just we'll
cool so these will throw a throwing
error and that will propagate up the
promise chain which jest will then
handle it's really sleek but either way
we have a problem here we expected the
value to be something like this but we
actually received 40 because we have no
code for this so let's see here
the fetch simplement this will return a
promise that resolves to a response and
responds has a method for JSON that we
can call which in turn research returns
a promise that resolves to add some data
and that data will have some rates and
one rate that is the standard rate than
that without value of 19 so let's go
back can implement that data dot rates
and this is standard rate and it has a
lot C there and then
we will use that that rate and will
actually copy this copy this for now and
multiply that with one and on so do take
that times let's just do that for a
minute we'll fix that won't work but
we'll fix it later let's just make some
progress see what that turned out to be
cannot read property then or undefined
where was that
where the tojo line three oh we didn't
get oh this is the happy path we have a
bunch of tests failing now let's
actually disable all other tests and
focus on one at the moment because it's
very nice in programming to solve one
problem at a time so adding it only to
the asset means that it will only run
this test which is often very helpful so
let's see right now this fails hmm all
right it's still just returning 40 yeah
it's because we we're not actually
returning this this promise here it just
makes this request and then it proceeds
to this line here which is not very
useful so we press read write return
okay cool let's run it again and see
that helps oh yeah
expected forty seven point 59 but we
received our 760 hmm that's a bit much
it's because we are multiplying by 19
when we should actually be cursing this
to be 0.19 so I think that if we divide
this by a hundred
I think that's correct is that correct
yeah maybe let's see
run NPM test again no that becomes 7.6
now that's because we are not
multiplying by zero point 19 so it's
actually the 1 plus zero point 19 see if
that helps hang on
ah yes cool now we were to green get the
correct value
I keep typing NPM tests here but I just
remember that we actually have defined
an NPM watch as well so sorry MVM run
watch that will alter run every time we
um every time we save all right so
there's some duplication here don't
worry we will deal with that eventually
but for now you mM put a pin in it we
will be removing duplication but not
until all tests are green
so let's actually let me remove it only
to see the other failed tests that are
not failing because then is undefined
mimimi mimimi mimimi mimimi
you know and this is because in the
cases we only really do this we only
really want to do this if we have a
country and the order might not
necessarily have a country at perhaps
the user haven't selected it yet so we
want to just have an if statement here
and do order a dot country and just wrap
this thing in that you know Wow there we
go and now all those tests or or
succeeding we have one skipped test here
because I actually may
a kind of dummy test here
this is coal like I'm I think of these
as to do to do tests so to speak because
I wanted to remember this case but it
seems like we have actually accidentally
solved this because we had tests
breaking for other reasons so I'm
actually gonna delete that we don't need
to write that test that is over and sell
us now that we have other tests that
just cover that naturally also I think
that this empty function here we don't
actually need need that anymore because
it's just not making use of it so I can
just change the empty function to know
to be honest let's do that so let's see
null or the total no the active function
no and no there as well we don't need
that this bit cleaner I feel a little
bit disoriented here with all this
mocking it feels like I don't quite know
what is real I'm skeptical are we just
whatever we are we actually testing
anything here or are we just creating
this fake fake implementation and then
just testing the fake implementation are
we actually testing any real logic yes
we are like I understand how it might
feel like we're doing quite a bit of
faking here doing this elaborate mock or
fetch but what we are concerned about is
to check to test if order total is
causing the side effect that we want the
fetch and that it does the right things
with what that would that side effect
the yields which is which is the data so
what the test is doing is we're
concerned with testing or the total
right and what or the total does is they
cause as a side effect fetch
so this side effect comes out of order
total so to speak and we were inspecting
that this looks correct that's what
we're doing and then we are passing a
response back into order total and then
we are inspect what comes out of order
total after that to see that that is
correct
so like request comes out we inspected
that request mmm looks good looks like
we expect it to be then we pass in a
response and then given that response we
inspect that hey we get to correct that
out of that or like the correct order
total where that multiplied in so order
total is what we're testing we're not
actually we're not testing fetch at all
here I'm skeptical does this actually
work is is this we've written a lot of
tests now we didn't want a code but we
have not actually tried it against the
real API we built it checked it out in
the sandbox kind of but we've not
actually check that or the total runs
correctly against the real API I'm
interested in the fact that when you're
doing TDD with mocks it can only become
kind of sordid TDD before we were coding
like Tilly with pure functions we were
writing a bit and then we implemented it
in the code and we would actually see
the real results because there were no
side effect it was just the pure
function and our tests but when we are
doing TDD against mocks it's just us
creating a fake reality and then we
check using TDD that our our tests does
the right things in this fake reality
and depending on what happens in the
fake reality that
the test does response to that sorry the
code responds to that in the right way
but it all depends on us having the
having correctly designed the fake
reality which means that when we are
doing any kind of mocking we actually do
have to actually test that we have made
right assumptions in our test by
checking the stuff in the sandbox so
let's see if we can do that actually I'm
going to do import the order total no or
very total $42 and we require and I'm
gonna close this for a bit I'm gonna
start quokka on this file there we go
and we're gonna call order const result
we've got a call order total and the
first argument and is pass in a fetch
because it needs fetch and we are going
to give it some kind of order yes let's
steal one from this this test here go
back to sandbox pass in this here see
what happens oh cannot read properly
standard or undefined interesting what
is happening so rates is undefined
that's actually just been x
console.log x see what happens 401
authentication required please pass a
valid API key had it in your request ah
yeah that's because we need to actually
give needs credentials here
so we still have some work to do in our
test let me close this for a while and
have a look so not paste this in god I
just grabbed this here to help us have
it side by side go back to the test
you're gonna paste this in here while we
work if you you if you have a big screen
unlike me who I was doing a youtube
channel you can just split your editor
side-by-side that's very handy when
doing unit testing to keep the tests
here at your reference code here but
either way this is going to be passed
here as an option options object when I
call it ops at least and we expect
headers dot no sorry respect ops headers
and we expect that you have an API key
property we expect that to be expect
that to be key one two three so what is
key one two three well here's the thing
we also because this uses process here
we now have another dependency and we
need to create a fake process as well
and pass that in so functions tend to
have a multiple dependencies and that
has an N which in turn has a bat API key
which in turn has should be key one two
three
so let's actually pull up the terminal
in toggle terminal and I know run all
tests cannot read property headers or
undefined yeah because
hoped first of all it's not getting an
oops let's remove this let's actually
fix that first
so or the total will now pass in some
options you see what happens
category copy the API key of undefined
yeah sure because it wants a headers
bunk we get a new problem here yeah key
1 2 3 received undefined let's actually
just API key and then I'm gonna write
the hard code the key here so it's key 1
2 3 start faking it but we want with we
can't hard code values like this so
we're going to proceed well hmm actually
ups passing process here this is the
process object we inject that now this
will break all other tests
so let's actually disable everything but
this no I'm back and dudududu cannot
read
property country of Oh
undefined hang on what is confusing me
here yeah we actually have to pass in
the fake process otherwise the arguments
order is correct click process cool
cause wait a but appear correctly it's
green but it that's because we have a
fake value here I'm gonna use the actual
value from process process and
what was it again I won't go back to the
test
it's that API key oops and it is green
cool let's just change this just make
sure that it breaks correctly yep
awesome we're gonna remove the only and
then we're gonna see that all the other
tests fail so that's because they don't
have a process object these because
these don't use the don't use the fetch
we can just pass null in here as well
they don't matter
don't make use of this these test cases
so just gonna do not look and we have
five passed so now it now it actually
uses the the correct way about API key
so what's sure try this again try this
again cannot read property country of on
define now okay of course we need to
pass in the process in the sandbox as
well all right cool yeah we cannot read
property standard or undefined
let's see what is happening here let's
check this again X happening console the
log X see oh my god bad requests what's
bad about it so it was because I had run
out of credits I I refreshed them again
ha note to self don't use a throttle API
for tutorials cool so let me remove this
console log
and go back to the sandbox finally it
works awesome all right cool so we wrote
some tasks that completed the whole
response chain and the parsing of the
response and then we also verified that
the our mocks our assumptions about the
fake reality that we created actually
correspond to reality by running our
code in the sandbox and true it seems
like it's working that calls for
celebration
and by celebration I mean a commit all
this changes in the package of jasa yeah
oh I just indented some code let's keep
that separate the sandbox also got some
changes let's actually let's say git
commit that as well
and script MD we don't want that that's
my script notes and I want to remove the
the package of JSON there because it was
just that was just an invitation and we
want to keep those in a separate
committee I don't like putting you know
spelling fixes and stuff like that
baking them into a committee I want I
kind of want to do them separately we
fixed risk bombs test yes commit
messages are important but not that
important well they are I think they're
really important but this is not a
tutorial about good commit messages
hello
let's let's still do this fixed
indentation issue I know I'm being
inconsistent but let's see let's see
let's see so this is what we added here
some nice new response parsing we have
some duplication here that we will
eventually eventually fix we looked at
the we created Wisc standard or fake
fetch here by checking that it used the
API key that is also passed through fake
process and it's also we also check that
it use the rate here from the from the
fake VAT IPI to calculate the output
result this thing here this is actually
now redundant because you know since
we're checking the output which is
completely dependent on fake fetch
actually being called otherwise it
wouldn't work this thing is just
completely superfluous so we're gonna
remove that
no longer needed now and we can also
remove these curly brackets we don't
need them anymore let's actually just
make sure that the tests are still
running don't bypassed so let's let me
commit that removed
superfluous checks
I feel like this injection here results
in extra code if you were not unit
testing this and requiring this thing
here it would like that would mean that
order total could just have required
this on its own inside of itself it
feels like an injection mechanism adds a
little bit of extra code and extra code
but it makes me feel yes it's a little
bit extra code but it's it's not a lot
it's it's pretty nice it's pretty clear
what is happening here we just requiring
in fact we're passing it in it's very
easy to follow how the injection happens
process is here a I mean there are other
ways we could achieve it we could use
some kind of messing around with
Global's and stuff like that but it
wouldn't really be easier to follow it
might save us a little bit of code but
it would still it feels like it would be
more brittle I like this because it's
extremely straightforward what is
happening just does have an ability to
override requires so if we used fetch
inside like it with the require inside
of order total we could use that but we
would still have the problem with with
process which is a global variable so we
would have to like mess around with that
global I one advantage with this is that
it makes all dependencies all dependency
mocking behave in same
way which i think is pretty nice and I
think that's a good point
