development directions do you like
besides web development hmm okay
I think that by far the one that is
entry interests me the most right now
from like the perspective of where I
think the industry will grow a lot is
machine learning I don't know a lot of
machine learning it's something that I'm
completely procrastinating or learning
but I would really really like to and
the reason why I'm so interested in it
is that I think that a lot of the things
that have rather complex user interfaces
today will be replaced by machine
learning algorithms for example Spotify
is orly when it was launched it was
essentially kind of conceptually a big
database of songs you have to search for
the songs that you already knew you'd
like do you have to assemble playlists
to create cohesive experiences of like
what songs fit together and the service
that they have now is pretty different
and especially you discover weekly if
you don't know what Spotify like if you
haven't used Spotify you discover weekly
is this playlist that the
recommendations of a mix of new and
familiar songs that Spotify generates
for you every Monday I think and it's
based on your listening history so if
you listen to like a lot of songs from
you know some artists then discover
weekly will figure out that okay there's
a lot of people that listen to this
artists also likes this artist and this
artist has just released something new
and this person hasn't listened to that
so it should probably listen to that and
they've spent a lot of time tweaking
that and making it good and it works
really really well for some people like
me
although a lot of people are very happy
with but that's machine learning for you
and I think that a lot of interfaces in
the future will be more like that just
like these magical lists of things that
a computer just figures out for you
instead of you having to wade through a
lot of stuff you have just watched an
episode of fun fun function I release
these every Monday morning Oh 800 GMT if
you are forgetful you can subscribe by
clicking here or check out another
episode right now by clicking here
I am mpj until next Monday morning stay
curious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
