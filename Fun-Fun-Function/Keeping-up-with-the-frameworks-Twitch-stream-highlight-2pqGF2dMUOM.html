really won't like I know that I know
that it's fun to say like oh the web
development and JavaScript community is
so like there's a new framework every
week but they're really really isn't
angular and angular has had such a long
lifetime angular launch angular
Wikipedia when was that good launch
does anybody remember when it was like
the first version of angular 2009 seems
seems correct 2010 2010 so it's like
it's seven years ago and it's still
being used like things are not moving
that fast react was react is still the
up-and-coming thing compared to react
and it was what is that five years ago
for wikipedia says October 20th 2010 but
when was react I'm just guessing fine
and it's if you just if you look at the
big movements and focus on like things
that are gaining traction the ones that
are actually actually matters then you
won't really have to learn all that many
frameworks you need to learn a new one
perhaps every third year at best at
worst that people are excited about view
but it's good god yeah you don't need to
jump on every little framework that does
an iteration on top on our framework you
can wait for a while to see if it works
out and see if it gains traction
then you start like okay maybe there's
something that you should check out like
web development is not fashion it's not
like the stock market it's not where you
have to be absolutely at the edge of
things that is not how development works
Oh react was to march 2013 four years
ago image Niki I for one and super
grateful for all the people working so
hard to improve the jsf ecosystem yes
that is so true I am really grateful to
we should be so happy that we have so
many tools and so many people working on
them like a lot of it is crap but a lot
of it is just fantastic quality as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
