time with YouTube but was it an easy
decision
I'd imagine working at Spotify was
awesome do you miss your co-workers
and/or the work in general Spotify is
absolutely an amazing place to work I've
never been at a place as long as I've
been at Spotify it's the compensation is
great the people there are great the
culture there is great the problems that
you are solving are generally super
interesting its enormous
at scale Spotify it's especially in
Sweden it's a very high-status job
people like you can go to a party and
people are impressed that you work at
Spotify and they start talking about
their favorite spot if I hate you to fix
it like people people care about the
product which is just amazing but I was
at Spotify for four years and I am a
person that gets bored very easily the
fact that I was there for four years
being me is so much to credit that place
that it managed to keep my interest but
in the end I just felt like compared to
what I felt when I started I felt like
very insecure and I felt like oh my god
I'm surrounded by so many smart people
and these these problems are so hard now
at the end of the of my my period there
I felt like I have this down this is not
challenging me anymore I know how the
Spotify desktop crime works and I know
how to be comfortable with it and it's I
it was fine and I was just being
challenged anymore I could have moved to
another part of the company and they
offered me to do so but it would have
required relocating to Stockholm
which I was not particularly interested
in doing and I just frankly felt like I
needed to challenge myself and do
something completely different like do
cool stuff and be afraid again be my own
again it's just time for a change and
yeah it was a scary decision it took a
long time to make that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
