to use a little bit about switching jobs
when is it time to leave your current
job and what criteria should we look for
in the next one that is what we're going
to explore today I am MP J and you are
watching fun fun function Leo Mendonca
sent in this question mpj help I have a
conflict of interest right now I just
received two different work offers on
one hand it is an offer to work for a US
company that build apps without coding
or just a little code they work with
some standard technologies like Jas
jQuery and CSS they take 20% less but I
was doing some background checks and
they have this really nice company
culture which seems to be really warming
and appealing on the other hand there is
this company that uses react Redux es
2015 sass and so on they pay more
provide more vacation and even pay out
bonuses but I believe that company
culture is not that good I need to
decide until the end of next week what
would you recommend hey Leo as a
developer you are extremely lucky
because you are attractive on the job
market and that situation is only going
to escalate for us as developers because
there the the expected need for
developers is so high that the amount of
developers that we are training
currently cannot possibly fill that void
however as fantastic as that situation
is to be in it does create the genuine
problem of picking the right employer if
you have a lot of options what do you
optimize for should the company have
great benefit should it have a great
culture perhaps it should have a strong
brand is it not the workplace uses
cutting-edge technology should you look
for remote work opportunities coming
what is a good workplace on this channel
I often talk about something called
self-determination theory that is a
psychological theory which which has a
lot of research behind it
that deals with the topic
of intrinsic motivation in human beings
intrinsic motivation it's it's different
from extrinsic motivation which is
extrinsic motivation is basically oh I
need to work so that I can get money so
that I can buy shelter and food and the
latest smartphone extrinsic basically
motivation that comes from the outside
intrinsic motivation on the other hand
it's the kind of motivation that comes
from within you that you when you do
things because you feel that they are
important because they are tasks that
you chose to do it's a motivation behind
tasks that have nothing to do with these
external factors exist it comes within
you and research have shown that when
you are intrinsically motivated you
perform much better at tasks especially
when those tasks or are highly creative
or tricky problem solving issues which
programming is a very very good example
of so self-determination theory tries to
answer the question of how do you
achieve intrinsic motivation what what
what does it what are the founding
blocks that we can put in our lives and
our workplaces to facilitate a intrinsic
motivation occurring so
self-determination Theory postulates
that there are three basic needs for
this to happen
they are autonomy competence and
relatedness autonomy is basically having
control over our work day when you are
autonomous in your work life you're
basically the opposite of being
micromanage autonomy is having a sense
of agency around what you're doing an
example in a software team might be that
you as a team member you're involved
with you're allowed to you pick what
tasks you feel are most important in
me in the backlog and you are also
involved in creating items on that
backlog and you are also involved in the
prioritization you have a great deal of
control over your situation and your
work basically you decide how to go
about things how to do you work that
that's up to you not to somebody else
nobody tells you how to do your job and
you are also probably involved in what
you are doing as well you have control
over that as well that is autonomy
relatedness is understanding and feeling
how your work connects to larger whole
the way I see it it's about being able
to stop your work at any given time and
ask yourself why am i doing this task
instead of something else one reason why
I think that Tesla is so effective is
that they are very clear on their Y if
you google Tesla's mission statement
this is the header of it Tesla's mission
is to accelerate the world's transition
to sustainable energy if you're a Tesla
employee and you can connect your your
current tasks in a chain to that mission
you are you're going to feel very good
about your work if you are a Tesla
employee and you can connect your
current tasks in a chain to that mission
statement that is going to be very
motivating it should be said that some
literature here calls this purpose not
relatedness but I think that that is not
giving it the whole story because the
reason that we we want a purpose is
because there is an underlying need for
us to interact with and be connected to
and care for people that underlying need
is white feels so good to be in an
organization and contribute to an
organization that has a very clear why
that is related to caring for people
that's relatedness the third factor is
competence competence means and I'm
going to read here the desire to control
and master the environment and outcome
we want to know how things will turn out
and what the results are of our actions
the way I see it we need to be we need
to know that we are up to the task at
hand because that makes us valuable to
other people which in turn will make us
more secure because we are however I
would like to talk about how you work
with competence actively especially in
the context of switching jobs and a few
weeks back a former boss of mine talked
so kevin goldsmith talked about this so
excellently in in an interview I've
linked that interview in the episode
description a Kevin he has a very
interesting approach when switching jobs
when taking a new role he asks himself
what is the next job after this one
where will this new job take me
afterwards in this new role what
experiences do I expect to have what new
skills do I expect to learn and when I
have those skills what is the next role
that I will then be able to do what will
I use those new skills for and I think
that this is such a great way about
thinking about reasoning about career
change because thinking about your next
job after your next job gives you this
benchmark that you can complete a job
your current work again
personally I have had a lot of problems
with answering the question or it's my
current job making me grow in the right
way and is it making me grow enough and
Kevin's solution to that problem is very
elegant he spends time to formulate what
his
next role is its next job and also a
rough time frame on when he wants to
reach that job and that gives him a tool
to check if his current job is providing
him with the correct growth and this
means that he can know when to leave and
for what for example he can use it to
the discovery of his current job is just
not giving him the growth that he needs
it to do or perhaps it just doing it way
too slowly for it to be within a
reasonable timeframe or it might be that
it checked that oh wow it has already
given me that I I have already grown to
where I want to be then it is time to
look for the for the next challenge
where we can use the growth weapon this
job has given him I think that is such a
nice way of thinking about growth and
competence alright so summarize all its
bla what I think that you really should
spend some time thinking about when
picking picking between possible jobs is
well this job are give me a sense of
autonomy will I be able to control my my
work to a large degree also do I think
that this this role will give me a sense
of relatedness to a larger whole and
finally spend some time defining your
next job the one after this one the one
that you can't get the one in the future
and really ask yourself if taking this
job will move you towards that job and
that's it you have just watched an
episode of fun fun function I release
