a little video talking about how value
conflict can lead to burnout I think
it's safe to say that our most software
teams today realize that burnout is a
very real threat to your software team
but I think that the general view is
that burnout is caused by working too
much
when in reality that is just one of the
reasons why burnout happens and one of
the other big ones is value conflict
that is what we're going to explore
today I and npj and you are watching fun
fun function and value conflict in the
workplace is when you value something
highly but your team doesn't for example
it might be that you think that unit
tests are very important but your team
they're just not convinced of their
value it might be that you are you're a
person that prefers software that is
focused on being bug free and fast and
instead of having a lot of features but
you find yourself in a team that is
basically a feature Factory or might be
that you perhaps you're the lone
designer on a team and you have to
constantly fight for getting time to do
user research basically you believe in
something but the team doesn't now not
all value conflicts are destructive
value conflicts happen all the time
because we are humans we value different
things and it's actually through
discussion and these these conflicts
that we have that great insights happen
and we create new and innovative
solutions at these value conflicts and
and you know pull between people that's
how we create great things and it's part
of the fabric of being human however
there is a limit to how much you can
take some of the values that you have
they are extra strong they are
your core values so you hold a lot of
values but these values they are they're
closer to
your identity as a software developer
for example one light one of my core
values is I have to build stuff with
care so for me
yes building something that works for
the end-user that that is great that
it's important but it's not quite enough
for me I also have the need to build
something that is maintainable in the
long run and not to tell you that some
teams have for example imagine that
you're a product company and you only
have one product in that software team
it's likely that they value
maintainability very high but that is
not the reality of all teams some teams
might be it might be an ad agency for
example that mostly built contain sites
the campaign sites they are launched one
and they have a very high probability of
never being changed again I think like
that they don't value maintainability
and nor should they but working in such
a team would for me be very draining and
that is because I would have to
constantly suppress something inside of
me that is very important to me I would
basically be spending my days in a place
where I could not believe so to speak in
order to function in such a team I would
I would have to play the role of someone
else and I would have to do that all day
all year long and it would be even worse
if I was in a situation where I would
not even think that it was appropriate
to suppress that value for example let's
say that I'm working in this ad agency
that puts out campaign site let's say
that they they the agency has been hired
to create create an application like the
actual application on our campaign site
but something that will actually live on
for a couple of years so this new
application that we're hired to do it
would definitely
benefit from being built in a
maintainable way so I start pushing for
that but the team they are just not
there value-wise
they are they're used to building
campaign sites and they just don't hold
my values so I find myself in a
situation where I argue and I argue but
I I don't get hurt the people around me
they just don't buy it
and that wears me down now wears me down
so bad so I think that it is very
important that you sit down in your team
and discuss what what are our values
what do we agree about and what do we
disagree about and here's the most
important part are we okay with those
disagreement again some disagreement is
perfectly okay even good but there's
also some values that we just can't
afford to disagree on some values are
your more important to get people in
Silicon or people will you start burning
out and that's it that is what I had on
my mind today you have just watched an
episode on fun fun function I release
these every Monday morning always
hundred GMT you can subscribe there if
you want to be reminded but if you don't
want to wait until next Monday morning
you can check out this episode that the
machine learning Google thingamabob has
selected for your viewing pleasure
I am mpj until next Monday morning
stay curious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
