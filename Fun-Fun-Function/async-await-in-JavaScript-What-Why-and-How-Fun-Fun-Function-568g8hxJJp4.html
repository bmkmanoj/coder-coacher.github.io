at the asynch
await keywords which allows us to pause
the execution of functions and this in
turn allows us to write asynchronous
code that reads like synchronous code
I am npj and you are watching some fun
function
I am wearing a blazer today because
sometimes you just feel special
let's begin I am going to show you some
code written with plain promises we are
going to do some fetch this is built
into browsers but it doesn't exist
in a node so we are going to install a
node module require little node fetch I
think it's called I cannot find module
no - now that's correct because doesn't
exist yet
however using quokka we are which is the
in line evaluation thing I'm using I'm
going to install the missing package for
only this quark file hang on and on
screen so now we can start to define a
function so what we're doing here is a
function in a fictitious a cat API app
system so this is going to get the Earl
of the profile image of a user let's
call it so that we see what is happening
as we go along so as you see the call is
evaluating to undefined nothing no
surprises there but let's start coding
it alright so as you see here we get
some garble here and it that is because
search is returning a promise which will
eventually evaluate resolve I mean to a
response so we'll call them on the
promise and we will pass it a function
that will take the resolved response and
we will call dot jason on it not
unsurprisingly this parses the response
at Jason so now we see that result is a
promise that resolves into this this
Jason thingy here but we don't want all
this we are just interested in the image
URI here so we are going to call this
on the promise and then we are going to
call data and we are interested in the
image Earl fantastic the result of such
avatar Earl is now a promise that
resolves to the image your eye of the
user warning if you are unfamiliar with
promises this video is going to confuse
the hell out of you so if that's the
case you should watch my promise video
first you can find it here or in the
epital description I am now going to
attempt a rewrite of this function using
a things away well I'm going to comment
out the initial implementation yes so
that we can keep it in mind while we're
doing this the first thing that we're
going to do is to make this function a
synchronous you can notice down here by
the way that this now returns a promise
that resolves to undefined we're going
to talk about this a little bit later
okay
let's begin by creating an intermediate
variable here called data and I'm going
to grab this from the previous
implementation and paste here and let's
just see what data is at the moment okay
so as we see here it valuates
to a response so this is a bit bit
misleading we are looking for the
response at the moment I would can't see
it here because it crops it but this is
actually not a response this is a
promise that resolves into a response so
I'm going to write a keyword here called
a wait and this means that there is this
is now the actual response object this
is not a promise that that resolves to a
response this is the actual response
because the function has has paused here
and then resumed once fetch has arrived
and then resolved to the actual response
object so let me continue here to
actually demonstrate this to you I'm
going to write data here and I'm going
to do response dot Jason
and I'm going to also evaluate data here
so as you see here data is now a promise
that resolves to the parsed JSON data so
we would not be able to do this here
unless this was the actual response
otherwise if it had been a promise we
would have to do then response yadda
yadda and then response dot dot dot JSON
but we don't need to do that because
this is the actual response object
however data let me write that out so
that it come on yeah that data still
evaluate it's still a promise that
resolves to the to the parse JSON data
so I need to write a wait in front of
this as well and boom now you see that
it's no longer promise it's the actual
actual actual data so see there I remove
their wait and it's a promise but if I
add the wait
it's now the actual data let me delete
the response line here we don't care
about that in moment because now we know
what the data and I'm now going to do
data dot a image Earle and we're going
to return that oh and now we see that
the result of fetch avatar Earle is now
a promise that resolves to fetch avatar
arrow and thus it behaves exactly like
our previous implementation here so now
we have rewritten it using a sync wait
start I'm going to read you a
description of what a sinker weight is I
will repeat it at the end of this
episode and by then you will hopefully
understand it inside a function marked
as a sync
you are allowed to place the await
keyword in front of an expression that
returns a promise when you do the
execution of
a sync function is paused until the
promise is resolved you got that if you
did well then why are you watching this
video go out and look at nature instead
on the other hand if you're confused
excellent keep on washing the idea
behind the asynch await keywords is to
be able to write asynchronous code that
flows like synchronous code okay so
nothing really
let's go back and look at our previous
code looking at these two and it's not
completely obvious that this flows in
any different way from the promised
example let's examine an example where
we have a little bit more nesting so
remember this is a cat api and all of
the users are cat owners and imagine
that we want to fetch the profile images
of all the cats that a user robes so
this function will begin just like the
previous ones we will fetch a user and
we will pass their JSON data
okay so we see here that the user has
this array of cats but the cats are not
actual cat data it is Cat Cat IDs so we
need to fetch these cats we iterate over
the cats or rather we map over them
let's say we want for every cat mm-hmm
how does the cat all right the cat our
IDs so there are not really cats
so let's write cat ID because other
otherwise we'll be confused let's fetch
that cat what oh hang on I'm doing this
wrong ah we need the cat and we need the
cat ID all right now we're getting
somewhere they are at Hertz in one cat
sniffles and it has some image URI
let's return this image URI image cool
and we need to remove the curly brackets
okay we still have an undefined over
here ah it's okay we're not returning
the result of our fetch here let's
return that still nothing why not okay
we're not returning the results of our
map let's return that okay that's better
now we have something it's an array of
promises that is not particularly useful
because we want the actual resolved
values here not the healthy promises so
what what has happened here is that map
has went over the cats and for every cat
it has transformed that cat into a
promise of a cat URI so um let's put
this into an immediate intermediate
variable first I will remove this line
here and I'm going to remove these curly
brackets because we don't need them and
we don't need
the return statement let me just see
what promises are cool still this array
of unresolved promises return so instead
we want to return a promise that
resolves to an array where all these
promises have been resolved and to do
that there is a handy function in
JavaScript code promise all look you can
pass an array promises boom come on
there you go let me delete that line
because it's just confusing us and now
we see that it's indeed an array of
images that contains cat avatars also by
the way if you are not familiar with map
this probably confused you of it luckily
I do have a video on map over here and
you can also find it in the episode
description what we are going to do next
is to rewrite the code that we just saw
using a sink and weight but before I do
I would like to take a break and make an
announcement that is way overdue some of
you know this but most don't I have quit
my job at Spotify and unfun function is
now very officially my part-time job Oh
this week on Friday on Friday morning
I'm going to release a video where I
talk about the launch of a patreon for
fun fun function and more importantly
I'm also going to talk about the launch
of Fun Fun forum I'm really really
excited about this and in that video I
will be talking more about what fun fun
forum is but the important thing the
important thing that you need to have in
mind is that if you become a patron this
month August lastly is the 31st you will
get next to your name a special forum
badge a permanent special badge that for
eternity shows you that you were one of
the first patrons of fun fun function
after August 30
first nobody will get these badges ever
it will be a very very ugly badge that I
will probably have hand drawn with a pen
it will absolutely positively not be
worth your money so for the love of God
only do it if you want to support funds
on functions and if you want a special
forever for a maternity batch of
infinite value back to the ordinary
scheduled programming where were we okay
let's rewrite this function using I
think away
all right so let's walk through this one
first it uses a wait here to wait until
we have the data and then it parses JSON
waits for that and then when we have the
use of data it construct a an empty
array of cat image your eyes to hold
them and then starts looping the cats
array of the user and for every cat ID
it's going to do a fetch and then let's
go to wait for that fetch to complete
and which results into Eris bowls which
is then calls JSON on it waits for that
to resolve into the actual cat data and
then it takes the image your eye on the
cat data and pushes that to the cat
image your eyes and it does that for
every cat and then it returns the cat
image your eyes and that is what we see
here in the result again you don't see
it here because it's it's uh it's
cropped here but this is not the actual
result this is the promise of a over
result that eventually resolves into the
result the first thing that strikes me
when I look at this code is there's a be
in here what strikes me when I compare
the asynch await example with the
promised example is that the SN Kuwait
example is a lot less straightforward
which ironically wrote not straight the
code here it flows in a very human
readable manner at least to me the
second thing that you should notice is
that they are not logically equivalent
if you notice that it means you have
eyes good job eyes the sink await
example it will load the cats in
sequence while the promised example will
load them in parallel so the promised
example here is a lot lot faster I wrote
it like this because I want to
demonstrate that I wait only were
for single promises it cannot wait for
multiple promises initially when I was
exposed to a sinker weight I felt that
it was a little bit useless how do I put
this okay I could totally see how I
think a weight was useful for simple
scenarios and how it could make the code
flow in a more approachable manner but
at the same time it wasn't as flexible
as raw promises so it just felt like a
bad deal to me but I came around
eventually because I realized that you
can just fall back to raw promises when
a sinker weight limits you and I'm going
to do that here I'm going to delete this
comparison comment and I'm going to
actually comment out this bit here okay
let's write
tre wrote the code have good at the code
by the way I wrote that from a script I
don't actually I didn't make that up on
the spot yes sir you know alright so
what do you see here is promises are raw
promises and a sink weight mixed a
little bit together this code is going
to be a little bit confusing if you are
new to a single weight so I I recommend
that you at this point post video a
little bit and look at this code and try
to get familiar with what is happening
before continuing okay freeze frame okay
so what probably was the most
challenging part of this thing to graph
is that we are passing and a sync
function to Matt we can do this because
as I briefly mentioned before ah
I think functions return a promise when
you called it let's look at a much
simpler case to examine that and go to a
point Thank You killing and coding sorry
 joking it's below people can
again be later will be no chronicler of
the booth and our sync function will
always return a promise which makes
sense because it's a synchronous but
let's go back to where we were before
let me delete this because it's mostly
just distracting in this example we have
mixed a raw promises into our await
example because we want to fetch things
in parallel but for a minute I want us
to like think in the other direction
what if we didn't want things to happen
in parallel what if we had a case where
we wanted things to happen in sequence
let's imagine that we have a batch
script that processes a few hundred
thousand users and our imaginary
that script looks like this has a sequel
query it does this database query it
gets a promise
get some users and then it loops through
the users and then for every user it
processes the user and it awaits for
every process to to complete a real
resolve before it continues so process
user you have to imagine that that
returns the promise so in this case we
have a lot of users so we don't want to
create a hundred thousand requests at
the same time so in this case it makes
for this simple case we just want to do
this are sequentially here a weight
makes a lot of sense we can absolutely
do this with promises but I imagine that
it will be a bit awkward I shall attempt
to rewrite this using promises in the
last example we actually had a fake real
service with real data real fake data
but in this case this is just imaginary
so you're not going to see any correct
in line evaluation going on here it's
your scan DUI refactoring
boom functional programming reduced what
do you think this compared to this to be
honest I don't think it's this is less
bad than I anticipated it to be to be
honest I think it's really a testament
to the flexibility of reduce but it is
still very clear that the I think a
weight example is just a lot nicer let's
summarize
first we looked at what a think a weight
is inside the function marks as a
slinked your life to place me a waste
keyword in front of an expression that
returns a promise when you do the
execution of the sinc function is post
until the promise is resolved
we then talked about why a sinker weight
excess and the idea with the singer
weight is to be able to write a
synchronous code that flows sort of like
synchronous code and then we spend some
time looking at how to actually use it
so did I explain this well enough did
you understand it is unclear that's cool
you're supposed to comment down below if
it is clear to you then please help
someone else out teaching is the best
way to learn remember there's a patreon
video launches on Friday morning so if
you want please do become a patron you
have just watched an episode of fun fun
function I really sees every Monday
morning Oh 800 GMT if you don't want to
wait for the next episode you can watch
this episode right now that the AI
overlords have selected totally with
your best interest in mind
I am mpj until Friday morning thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
