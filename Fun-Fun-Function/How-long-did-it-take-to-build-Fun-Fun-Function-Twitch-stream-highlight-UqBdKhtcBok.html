developing fun fun function I spent many
time on developing fun fun function
I started fun fun function in God when
was that it's actually check YouTube I
think it's three years ago fifteen
fifteen of May 2015
so I mean in May it's gonna be three
years and I got quite a bit of
subscribers from start and a lot of
people ask me how did you get so many
subscribers for me that's so fast and
the answer is I didn't I had I had a
quite a bit of strong presence on Quora
at the time which I started about five
years ago so I've been doing I think
I've been doing Quora for about two
years so I've gotten quite a bit of
followers there and Quora was not big on
programming and I was the main person
writing programming there so we didn't
have much of an audience in the
beginning because programmers didn't
hang around there but as Cora grew I
grew with it so had around 10,000 people
there that I kind of siphoned off to
Twitter and then started siphoning off
to YouTube once I started the channel so
it's kind of like five years of work to
build it I would say which i think is
any a general good measure when you
start doing a project and you like
getting serious about it and you can ask
yourself do I want do I really want to
make this a priority in my life for five
years is it if that's how long it takes
it is it still worth it might be a good
sanity check and a good way of keeping
yourself focused
it's so easy to just start like I used
before from production I used to start
so many get-rich-quick apps and stuff
like oh this would be a great idea to do
and stuff like that and the thing is
that no matter how good an idea is it
just it's just gonna require a lot of
work and a lot of focus from you in
order to make it work it's it's just
scary how much time this this channel
took to build I'm glad I did it but yeah
and I think I actually knew that it was
gonna take around this time to to get it
off the ground didn't start thinking
about doing YouTube channel when I
started writing on Korra that was just
for fun but about two years into it I
started a YouTube channel and I thought
that yeah I'm gonna make this work I
think I could make this into a big thing
and it's probably gonna take around
three years and it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
