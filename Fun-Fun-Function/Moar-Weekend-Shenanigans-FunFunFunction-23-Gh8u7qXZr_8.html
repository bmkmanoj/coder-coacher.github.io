fun fun function today we are going to
continue the weekend project hack that I
started a couple of weeks ago you can
find the first episode there it was
actually not my intent to make that kind
of episode and I to be perfectly honest
I completely hated that episode when I
uploaded it I generally aim for 12
minutes and the episode turned out to be
30 minutes I didn't succeed in
completing a hack it didn't tell a
cohesive story it didn't have a neat
script like theirs was basically a lot
of things about it that was wrong but if
God it got such a great response and
yeah
that's the thing about YouTube videos
there almost seems to be an inverse
relationship between what videos I think
will be successful and what videos are
successful in in reality well what's
good about that last video so went back
and looked at the comments and DA and
the video and try to figure out what
what did I accidentally create here when
you look at that episode it captures
what programming really is what it
really feels like and what's nice about
it really
yet you're creating something and you
run into problems and you hammer your
head against him until you solve them
slowly but surely something's starting
to take form it almost has the same feel
to it like the let's play format that
gamer youtubers use the problem is that
the episodes get very long it took ages
to edit the last video and I don't
really know how I'm supposed to make
this work so that is the objective of
this episode is to try to figure that
out we need to experiment with this a
little bit to find the format and I also
I'm not scripted this I'm just going to
try to let it flow I will edit this
heavily but I will try to give you I
will not try to hide the errors
I make as much so let's just jump into
it uh so this project is this is a very
common problem for me now I'm jumping
into some code here it was several weeks
since I did this project I was looking
at this code I did I did I did go back
and watch the last episode but then I
really helped because I seem to have
written some code some code here that
was not there in the last episode so I
have coded some stuff here since the
last episode yeah and this is this is
quite a normal problem in programming
that you're jumping into code and you
don't know what who the hell wrote this
shit and then you look at the gate name
and say oh it was me I just don't
remember it this is why I often try to
keep a log of what I'm doing and git
commits are great or I often feel like I
need something more granular than that
so I try to keep a work log let's do
that okay okay work log and I often tend
to I like to write down a current goal
to keep myself focused on what I'm doing
so sometimes I get the impulse to do
error factoring or try to oh we should
pull in this library but if it doesn't
help you on your way to your goal that
is actually just a diversion or busy
work so I tend to when I feel like oh I
want to refactor this I say to myself
yes you are allowed to do that but only
after you have completed your current
goal and you can use that cleanup or
refactoring as a kind of reward for
completing a goal so what the hell is
our current goal I don't we're making
something with this button we're
creating a Pomodoro timer eventually but
that seems like a very big ol I want
something that we can reasonably
complete today maybe so what about
I don't know okay let's think I'm tired
a a make a make a make a there sometimes
when you're writing it's just a good
idea to write stuff out we want to press
the button and have the server log out
the number of the phone that was pressed
BAM right that is a goal so our current
goal is to press the button here one of
these four and have the server log out
the number of the button that was
pressed that was that is our goal that
is realistic it's achievable it's
unambiguous so last time I put our
server up on Google cloud and since the
Google cloud will cost you a little bit
of money I actually just deleted that
cluster after I made the video so today
we are going to spin that up again
that's our first objective so that we
are back where we were last time so I'm
writing that in the work log okay let's
get going let's get the server back up
again okay how do I create a cluster I
think that I have this in this curl dot
txt file I'm gonna just change this to
something more descriptive like notes no
cuddling what I'm gonna name it if this
was a Twitter stream I would probably
ask the chat but I don't have any goals
squiggles that's fine
all right so I think g-cloud content
this one I think that I will paste this
one and see okay
see yes creating cluster Oh this took
some time before uh I will probably go
do something oh it's done okay so we
need to deploy the server on Google
cloud do some googling deploy coober
these JSON Oh No didn't find anything G
cloud oh here's something
cube CTL create F and then it's where is
it cuber new t stop json does this work
yes I think it did let's close this so
what we did here was that this
kubernetes top JSON is the file that
describes how the cluster should look on
kubernetes or this part of the cluster
so this is kind of a server description
sort of don't know if this work though
let's say cube CTL get RC so this gives
us a list of replication controllers and
replication controls in kubernetes is
that is the stuff that control servers
and like and the service and cells are
called pods so we can do cube CTL get
po4 pods and that seems to be like you
see here that it has status running
there all right so this is good but we
need to expose it to the Internet as
well I think I had that in my squiggles
no of course I don't I'm just gonna go
through my videos and look at where what
now
okay look at how red my nose is there
I've been outside walking cube CTL
expose and I explosive replication
controller that and type load balancer
there this work you must provide oh I
need to expel it that it's an
eradication controller cool it's exposed
just copy this so that I have it in my
squiggles here so this is to me this is
very typical of how I do development
there is some detail about something
that you forgot kind of how you did and
your brain helps you figure out sort of
too old I think I made a note of that
there I think I made a video of that
there or perhaps that colleague of mine
mentioned something about that kind of I
probably should have her things are
immense it's all over the place and you
need to figure stuff out even when there
is proper documentation it's often hard
to navigate that documentation or to
find exactly what you need so you need
to get this process and this feel about
figuring things out I think that we now
can just do cube CTL get service seven
still and now this should have an
external IP which so we should be able
to curl to this whoops
all right because we don't know if this
works because it doesn't output anything
but it might do it in the logs what I
mean by not outputting anything is that
the we're posting here to event right
and it's received here and we are yes
console logging the body out but we're
not actually sending anything to the
response so to see if this work we need
to check out the logs of this this pod
here this one so to do that I'm gonna
copy paste that and we've cube CTL logs
yes exactly here body world and that is
what we sent here like a hello world and
we're reading it over here so now we are
back at where we started in the last
video yay all right so where were we
let's go back to the the work log and
remind ourselves so the current goal and
said we want to press the button
and have the server log out the number
of the button that was pressed right
we have server I think that the next
step is to let to just make the button
call server just anything just just have
a button do something sub goal get the
button calling the server somehow I
think I added this shit here
this service hook dot JSON I don't know
what this is against that this is
probably okay there's an IP here I guess
that this is the IP of the old cluster
and it calls
slurp and it posts some things here I
think that this is the kind of a web
hook thing that is uploaded to the SPARC
cloud which will then call the our
cluster they unlike kubernetes cluster
yeah so let's see we need to log into
the SPARC cloud where it's not even
Sparrer
no it's 400 they're not called spark
anymore they're called particle IO
dashboard perhaps yes this is our
dashboard okay we have the photon the q2
waffle right this looks good
gonna try to plug this in I need to get
a USB extension cable because my
computer is down there in order for the
fan not to make too much noise to the
mine wait I realize I don't need a USB
extension cord because this is Wi-Fi
connected this one is just for power so
I can just connect it to my monitor nope
that doesn't work I don't think that the
Dell monitor actually if you don't have
things are so hard you know what I do
own I own this USB battery yeah that
ain't is cool so what this thing does
now is that it downloads the from the
software from the from the cloud and
downloaded it and run it it's pretty
cool so you deploy things as long as
these things have Wi-Fi you can deploy
things new firmware to them over the
cloud this was great before so I guess
that the blue box means that they are
online maybe okay cool so our pewter
waffle is now online that seems like
what we have named this so how do I edit
the code and is run
on this thing Oh a click here maybe
build yes this is it ok so I have made
some stuff here there's a lot of are
this lot of stuff here this is not nice
code
okay I'll partially implement this
actually thank you former MP J I ok tell
me I think that if we look at this loop
here yeah we see that I have
so if button on at one half sorry
Swedish it's pressed the then the LED is
supposed to come on and then it's going
to delay for 500 milliseconds and then
it's going to publish the button press
event here button press with one and 60
something and private ok and then we
have the exact same thing here button to
and also 60 here 6 here 60 here I don't
know what six years but it seems like we
have a partial implementation of this
and the button has died just doesn't I
think that the battery doesn't realize
that this is actually pulling any power
because I suppose of this just also
milpa or it just doesn't tell this thing
that it's charging
I don't know but either way after a
while it will just shut itself off so I
need to actually do the thing with the
extension cable
I swear to God that I'm not sponsored by
IKEA but these things really good stuff
I fixed it I am outside waiting on the
train because I need to go into the city
because my monitor died during the
recording and it won't come back up so I
need to buy a new monitor I kid you not
this is not staged this makes me very
grumpy of course and part of me wants to
just say don't buy Adele because you
need quality tools that you can rely on
but when it comes down to it this is
really just what the universe is like
things break down it's a mess and being
a developer or any creative professional
or any any person making things for
other people means that we we deal with
these things so that others won't have
to do that is our job so my job is to go
to town get new monitor and continue
shooting
I have approximately 45 minutes before
the last electronic store behind now
poses no need to hurry I literally just
walked in and took the first monitor
with that looks easy to carry took a lot
less time than I anticipated
and we are back with a functioning
monitor this service hook here I think
that we can do
Oh particle IO let's find out what this
how the service hooks works particle web
let's see what we have
I need to find out again what my public
IP s of kubernetes keeps ETL I get
service s let's paste that in here the
web hook of the particle IO see if we
can why not how to create these oh I
just do particle web hook create service
okay cool
interesting I'll press the button here
and cube CTL get you see what logs looks
like city I'll get logs Oh
cube CTL yet oh oh we're there okay
interesting so what did what we did was
that we defined a service hook here and
this service hook is kind of like most
web hooks if you familiar with them that
specifies an IP that it calls to and a
port Inanna endpoint what type of
request is gonna post and what and what
value so this is a spark event name a
spark event value and then the spark
core i d-- so okay so what is this this
is okay so i guess that this this here
corresponds to this here and the value
were here yes going to be the it's a
button pressing button three they come
from our code in the spark particle i/o
so if I switch to the particle build
here that is sent from this particle
publish here so particle publish will go
to the particle cloud and then it will
send that on defined into whatever is
defined in the service web hook here and
it will send on this jss JSON blob so
it's takes the spark event name from the
from the publish the publish call here
and spark event value and also welds on
the source the spark core ID and the
spark core ID I think that a
we go to the dashboard the particle
dashboard will see that it's this right
this and this is the same and that will
later allow us to send send stuff back
to the to the photon so I guess that
this is mission accomplished our current
goal was to press the button and have
the server log out the number of the
button that was Preston we that's
exactly what we did
so when I press something you know what
we can tail the logs if I do like know
if I plan an f2 the logs comin and
kubernetes it will follow the log so if
I press the button now am am nice so
this is a really good step on the way I
think that I'm just gonna admit it so we
have get status whoops oh nothing is
basically committed I am going to add
dr. file get and package drop Jason
Jason I'm not gonna add the squiggles
we're gonna the code itself and we're
not gonna work log either and I'm just
gonna do it kind of dirty commit here we
IP WIP that's 4 stands for work in
progress and I'm gonna get push em PJ
master just so that it's saved this is
not a way that I like to work on more
serious projects but this is a week in
hack and we're not too concerned with
get message history alright so that's it
for today so we made a little bit more
progress today we actually we actually
accomplished what we set out to do this
time which was to press the button have
the server log out the number of the
button that was press much thanks to my
former self that obviously did this a
couple of weeks ago there's a lot of
mess here
that I would like to clean up maybe we
uh we will we will do that next time but
I think I want to make a bit more
progress before we go into the cleaning
anything well let's hope that my screen
doesn't break next time we might get
some more coding in next time oh I'm
still struggling with getting his let's
code session to work I really want them
to work he will just have to bear with
me well like I experiment with this I
promise they will eventually become
awesome I don't promise that really
anyway I am mpj this is fun fun function
until next Monday morning stay curious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
