that your test all right do you write
the test for your test
well that depends
let's say that you have if you if you're
doing TDD and you're writing like an or
calculator or something and you say to
the like you write a test that checks
that if you put in 2 plus 4 does that
return for that you don't need to verify
that that test is right I mean that that
is just an example so to speak that is
what the the report was what the test
does it's it's very clear you can must
like ocularly see that the test is
correct however let's say that you
instead have a piece of code that calls
another API let's say that you have a
function I did this in one of the other
in the unit testing series you have a is
a code that fetches the tax rate from an
external service given a country so
given that you pass in a country to this
function yet it passes it does a fetch
request to certain API with some certain
parameters and given some jason it
parses that jason and then it extracts
some piece of information that could
back from that thing then in that case
then your unit test is going to you just
have a mock for that it's not gonna
actually go away and fetch a network
request every time you run the test
because that would be insane like those
tests would be really slow so you're
you're mocking that and that is tricky
because you might make a
stake in how you set up the mock so even
if you test this green and oh this does
the correct correct fake request fake
side effect the side effect might
actually not be the one you want so in
that case you will actually have to
manually verify that the the effect that
your once you have test green you have
to actually take the unit test and run
that and inspect the results manually
and like okay yes it's test is correct
and only then do you actually save and
commit the test so whenever you have
side effects with unknown forms then you
will have to manually verify every unit
test you write once</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
