like what is it an interesting
discussion of of why no maybe is it just
does do people think that oh yeah it's a
who you care about any code metrics for
a project is the question
I like lines of code number of files
number of offers we can talk a little
bit about it see if it's a picture it's
interesting because are you for me like
the question is no and I don't know any
eye developer that does that cares but
yeah I mean so I think when you are
beginning developers sometimes you
fetishize the number of lines of code
something is right yeah and you could
either say I am so productive today I
wrote two thousand lines of code it was
great
it just sprung into existence I'm such a
badass or you can say ah I you know I
expressed this super sort of you know
complex thing in only two lines of
reactive area or some shit like that
and no one can read it but do you think
you're so clever but this something
that's maybe not but I wanted to explore
a little bit why write it because why do
you feel I think it is because it is so
tangible it's very tangible quality
right it's it's a convicted wrong
quality it doesn't matter but it is a
number that can go up or down yes it
makes a great alarm code today or I've
removed a lot of code today or I've
written this in sixty seven characters
and it used to be four hundred right it
makes you feel good oh yeah absolutely
I love just sitting down you know in the
morning and by lunch time I have you
know fifteen new classes and it's all
dances together and it worked on the
first try yeah feels great but I don't
know like I I think maybe in the way the
question is is based it's like oh these
are metrics yeah so
I think it my I took some courses in you
know computer science and I don't
remember some where they were like oh
hey you know for these serious projects
we're tracking all the metrics to
somehow say something about code quality
or productivity or something like that
yeah but you know they also pointed out
the number of black lines of code is a
terrible metric yeah I don't know what a
better one is but it's like I mean lines
of code just like when you get like down
a little bit an abstraction level it's
like it can be a smell if you have a
class is 7,000 15,000 lines long that
smells right that's like oh this is not
as like for instance like it's saying
that you there's also in in programming
like when you're working on a product
that has been for a long time like you
like it's very common that you change
code oh yeah and what you must you do
and then like if you count like remove
when I change code is basically change
code is business to remove lines and out
of lines and if you like if you change
something and you do a big refactoring
and you'd apply this a lot of code
change that it's also like a code like a
code smell then if you have to make it
might be that you in order to make
change you have to like change all over
the place like that means that you have
a non orthogonal system if you listen to
the guy is a gang of four that talked
about the normal terminal system or is
it clean code I haven't read a book in
years an orthogonal system is where yeah
adding it changing and writing means
that you can change this area but it
right and there's a good principle it
kind of boils down to if you have one oh
yeah oh yeah this is what it is I think
it's like a class or a method you'd have
exactly one reason to change yeah it's
one of these one reason to change all
right and I don't think that's always
true no but it is a good sort of you
know a good statement of intense
a sort of go-to heuristic yeah I am I
mean yeah because I mean it's like if
you take something as simple as
duplication of code or a concept oh I
could talk about that a lot yeah yeah
yeah but if you don't have to because
it's so I universally agree that that's
bad right are you duplicate anything
reasonably what are you doing yeah
anyway no but I mean just like for the
basis of this discussion yeah if you
duplicate things and then you apply this
principle oh I think should have exactly
one reason to change if it's duplicated
now you have to change it in more than
one place yes if you want to change
whatever the overall thing is it's like
I love the genre but Google does like
capturing a concept yes like I've
captured this concept here and this
concept now like I can speak like in a
class I mean I know you JavaScript guys
don't use classes anymore a lot of
people use classes I don't know if that
segue but no but it's like oh you've
captured it in like either a method or a
class or something and it's like oh now
I can ask the disk guy intelligent
questions about what it is and what it
should be doing right and it's like you
can extend the concept because it's in
one place and that's really good I want
to make like a news come because I think
that removing duplication can also lead
to an honor for all system interesting
let's say that like I have a very good
way of decoupling things is copy and
paste like and let's say that yeah let's
say that you have two pieces of code
right and you like they do different
things and they say that it's a ordering
system and the payment system right
right and you let's say you may need to
make a change in the payment system and
that there are some code duplication
between those two right there's not
enough about value added tax or
something to your orders yeah exactly
relevant to both fair and
you just change that in the but if if
the change is just related to the
payment system then you can just change
that there right because the the code
that is duplicated wasn't really they
were they're very big couple right but
they just happen to be the same at a
point in time
exactly changing exactly that is the
happy case for duplication because the
first one then it's important to
recognize the bad case is an if the
change that you want to make is
applicable to both of those systems yeah
then it is very good to have that right
in in a in a non duplicated place like a
function or or another class or a back
oh there's a you know calculated total
price of the order needs to be done both
to pay the order and to display what it
should be and the case that I want to
talk about is the case where you pull
this thing up in a shirt function right
but you're kind of pulling a little bit
too much yes you over generalize you
misrepresent what is actually common
yes exactly you miss the the actual that
you don't a good way of seeing the
general case is to allow duplication to
arise yes like in order for you to like
wait the general problem to evolve
wrecks but sometimes you don't do that
you just feel like I don't know I see
the general right you can pull this up
and and I can foresee in the future
because I've done this together yeah but
you like that that is it's extremely
common than that fails yeah so you end
up with this thing that you know sweet
like when you find yourself in the
situation where you want to change the
payment system but due to the fact that
so much stuff lives in the the general
thing because you don't pull too much
things into the general thing right you
now have to oh shit now I have to change
the the general thing instead and yeah I
have
change the API of that thing right now I
have to change both the payment system
the general thing and the ordering
system and maybe even ten others it has
a knock-on effect because you have said
that this thing is you know generally
applicable yep and then it starts not
being generally applicable orders like
oh there's like one difference between
them yeah and you have failed to
elegantly capture what other premises in
some way yeah so you think that like
everybody agrees that duplication is is
generally a dangerous thing but I think
that we also have to recognize that
there is a certain risk with
generalization like people think that
removing duplication is free and risk
free no like yeah and that is that
that's a big one for me yeah I agree
I mean you often end up with very if
it's not a slam dunk sort of concept you
end up with these I mean I think the the
the the sibling of this of this problem
or concept is naming right yes oh yes if
you don't name this thing that you've
broken out and it's very very earlier
where if it doesn't say exactly what it
is it's like oh yeah process order
process order payment data like some
shit like that what is that yes that
dude exactly gonna do stuff sum up total
for German dat like whatever like yeah
but that's at least we're vague name
oh yeah worst one is where it's like
gift order but the fucker does some
mutation under because owner I need to
add this mutation and oh it's in this
function and you add it and now the
commune's is sort of placed order but
not really yeah query command
separations is really good you should
use that so what is that Oh query
command separation it just means that
you can have queries yeah like you ask
things like get order yep it returns the
order and you have commands which is
changes it oh we perform a mutation on
the system and a good principle is that
you should separate queries and commands
so
I mean yeah that's very that way you may
have a command that's something like I
don't know
please order for example this young man
but in that method you might have
queries like Oh gets the cost of the
order or you know stuff like that
yep but yeah the overarching kind of
reasoning for this is that if the case
you describe where you have a query ya
get order and it does something else
yeah
it changes the mutated states yep
that is an onion and unintended
consequence a side effect
yeah right and that's how bugs arise
because you father just like returned
something but it also did something that
you didn't anticipate and now you have a
back but we like to be playing devil's
advocate here like nobody is arguing for
those things like no that's an argument
would say like oh you but you should
just not have made that mistake in the
first oh yeah yeah it's true but the
problem is that like I just like the
architecture zealot of Christmas past
came down and I just had to shout about
separating queries yeah like I
the thing with naming Frederick's is
that naming is very hard yes so once you
start okay I you think that ah this is
I'm just gonna break this out into a
variable or amiright a break this out
into a function just yeah like make
things and then you have to name it then
you have yeah give it a cohesive name
and that is surprisingly hard and
time-consuming to get right yeah and
sometimes it's not even possible because
it that you might not know what it is
you know it's a place in the system but
you haven't written enough of the rest
of the code to know how this thing will
be yes later on
exactly yeah I think my favorite
principle for naming things said she is
that you must always tell the truth
everything must always tell the truth
like a name should not say something
that it is not or you know it has to
work both when you
is it on like a global level yeah ask it
a question and it has to work locally
yeah if you like without the surrounding
context like without the assumptions
basically whatever you name something or
do anything you have a lot of
assumptions about what does this yeah
like if you say order there's like a
bunch of assumptions about what is that
yeah well what are we doing this is an
ordering system and there's I don't know
yes
so anyway but I want it like the thing
with that I think that most people can
you should not have your functions lie I
think that most people can oh yeah I say
oh I like lying but I would like in
order for that to work I would add a
second commandment like no we giving
Commandments as overwrites right if I am
I I wouldn't that you're you cannot
methods can also be very vague yes I
must say exactly what it is because
phrases like yeah I'll have this
terminology that I'd like to refer to I
learned it from Wikipedia Oh recent
works Oh talked about this before
haha and it's just terms that kindness
order censored like it's like appeal to
this undefined Authority it sounds good
and yeah yeah it sounds like it means
something but really doesn't and
developer by weasel words are manager
utils like you just kind of obvious that
it is it's kind of honest like yes this
is my pile of shine but a manager like
it's it deals with other objects or some
like it's very I think if you're gonna
use manager you have to on a project
level agree what a manager is yeah in
game programming you do use the word
manager yeah sometimes yeah if you
actually have a definition in other
words basically means it's a singleton
and it deals with stuff you know that is
valid you know I would in a context as
the game progresses it doesn't get any
better this ought to go away you have
like you have an actual definitional
manager sure I mean
in my project yes like the global okay
but basically like an example let's see
I remember I remember I use her data
manager boom would be like Oh what does
that do it probably keeps track of the
users data and saves it in those that
enemies spawning manager except
ambiguous what you think it does enemies
spawning manager enemies spawning
manager like it spawns and it's like
okay it's I guess all right it's I
imagine it being a thing that sits in
place and is responsible for spawning
the enemies it feels like it's something
that is is there but it's not like could
you just say enemy enemy smaller or yeah
I could but now we're getting now we
could unless manager has a specific
meaning yeah so I mean your project so
if I came across my own project or you
know a product I didn't know and I saw
enemies spawner versus enemies spawning
manager yeah I would think that enemy
spawning manager has the you know the
the logic for how do you spawn an enemy
you know it would be like it would know
what what needs to happen with the enemy
for it to to be in a good state and so
on yeah or delegate that or be
responsible for that enemies spawner
might be you might have more than one
enemy spawner you could have like an
enemy that's like makes other enemies
and that could have an enemy spawner but
yet to me the meaning when you say
manager I think singleton yeah but
that's like very specific to gaming us
no always true no but a single bonus is
on the other hand a term that but I very
specifically mean something right
exactly yeah so it's basically something
that has more of an overall
responsibility or managers like the life
cycle that is independent of any any one
thing it's a little bit a little bit
sure but it's like basically the
important thing is that all the words
leading up to the word manager is this
part descriptive yeah
so you could say you look for the
enemies spawning example you could
imagine that the enemies spawner
actually is the guy who knows when an
enemy should be spawned yes but that
might not be true it might be more like
an enemy's factory or something like
that
sure but yeah anyway I don't always use
manager for these banks but I I'm just
saying that it can be a good word if you
agree on what it mean if it is really is
reminder with some very specific stuff
you avoid confusion other words and the
name as well but if you're just an enemy
manager what the fuck does that do I
don't know Jesus Christ
what was the orange I think we we were
out of time
oh really oh yeah well that was it you
have us watched an episode of fun and
fun and function this was a given
episode it's not usually like this but
sometimes it is it was fun yeah fun
function yeah well I put talk about
programming concepts every week you
should subscribe if you haven't yes ah I
like the video as well oh do you know
give it the thumbs up do all you to do
all these social media thing and I
really sees every Monday morning Oh 800
GMT time oh ah it's great are super hard
ah because when when they do these like
the normal episodes I have like this
list of things that the Savior and I can
say the intro like a hundred times until
I get it right but when we do these
episodes it's kind of like this week
Chloe thing it is very jarring to go
from from the free flow walking mode to
the very exact alpha mode yeah like Nina
I guess you have a spiel but if you just
give your speed - it's here it's super
weird like if I just sit here and look
into the camera and say you know yeah
it's super with either way until next
Monday morning stay curious
yes but I did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
