fun fun punch in this series we are
learning Haskell together together I
don't know Haskell so we are learning it
through a free ebook called learn you a
Haskell there's a link to it in the
description below in case you randomly
stumble over this video and you're
confused you can view the entire series
from the beginning by clicking the I in
the upper corner the topic for today is
lists you can find a link to these
specific chapter in the book that this
episode is about in the description
below so let's jump into it I have how
did you do this
gah okay cool we're going to load lists
not HS which is the file we're working
in here looking at the chapter lists
reminds me a lot of erase in JavaScript
but at the same time it also feels like
lists have a much more important role in
Haskell than Ray's play in JavaScript so
this is how you define a list left lost
numbers and one two three six BAM and
then you go numbers at this point the
book introduces late but I don't feel
like it explains exactly what it's for
the book says that we use left to define
a name in the GHC I you know this if
you've forgotten what names are you can
click there for a refresher they're kind
of like constants or or symbols kind of
however this confuses me because I can
kind of I can just lost numbers two
equals two three four seven and then I
can do less numbers one less numbers two
and they both work I just don't
I don't understand why it wants me why
the book talks about let so if you know
that please comment down below so that
you can educate me and your fellow
viewers one way that lists in Haskell or
different from arrays is that erasing
JavaScript allows you to mix types but
they're not allowed in in Haskell so if
has goal was JavaScript I would be
allowed to do like four eight and hello
and this would be a valid array in
JavaScript but it's not in Haskell so
you get an error message sort of like no
instance for num char arising from the
literal four well I need to have only
numbers in it I can have strings in in
lists waffle cat and that will work
they just whoops but they just have to
be the same type in the array when I
said that I felt like lists are more
fundamental to haskell than arrays or
JavaScript one of the things that made
me feel like that was that strings are
actually lists in JavaScript strings are
like a separate thing from a race but in
Haskell when I write like this cat that
is actually just syntactic sugar for
writing this cat BAM OOP so in Haskell a
string is not a string it's actually
just a list of characters strings or
lists so a common task is to put two
lists together and because strings are
lists we can use the same functionality
to concatenate strings as well so we do
hello waffle cat and we use the plus
plus operator to do this helpful cut so
in the last episode I was come
used about the fact that you couldn't
just plus strings together that in high
school like you can in most other
programming languages that is in error
but now that I know that strings or
lists and you use a special operator to
concatenate lists kind of makes a bit
more sense the book warns here about a
little performance caveat when when
using the plus plus operator or long
strings so let's imagine that this was a
very very long string for some reason
and we just wanted to add a you know an
a very short string at the end
internally haskell will hear how to walk
through the entire list character by
character before appending the the the
string on the right this isn't much of a
problem when you're just dealing with it
like do small strings then you don't
need to bother but imagine like list
like it's a million item small then that
will impact the performance of your
application however if you have a list
that is oh then you can use something
called the cons operator which is colla
and you can add things at the beginning
like this this however is instantaneous
and doesn't have the same performance
characteristics notice then that the
concentrator it takes a single number
doesn't take a list the plus plus
operator needs a needs the thing to be a
list so if we want to do the same thing
with a with a plus plus greater nine
here that would fail we would have to
add lists on both sides and because of
this performance aspect the the course
operator is actually used internally by
haskell so when i do one two three this
that is just syntactic sugar internally
haskell will write who will rewrite that
as
one cons to the cons three cons and the
list Punk and that gives us a list with
one two three if you want to get an
element out of a list at a specific
index you can use the exclamation mark
exclamation mark operator so if I do
like to hear I'm gonna get e because
that is index 0 index 1 index 2 here and
remember that these are just lists so I
could just do 1 2 3 and I could do
exclamation mark exclamation mark index
2 and that would give me 3 because index
0 index 1 index 2 3 here and that gives
us 3 just like arrays in JavaScript
lists in Haskell can contain other lists
so we can do 1 2 3 4 and that can be
inside another list did it that works
and we can't get out the the second list
here by looking there and we can of
course add other lists to our list of
lists by doing this like five six boom
oh no that won't work because doing that
would be like adding this and that's not
allowed because this is this this list
here this is a list of lists with
numbers in them and adding numbers
directly to them would be mixing types
so what is allowed however is doing
doing five six and a list so now we add
a list of Lists with numbers in them
to another list that is also a list of
lists with numbers in them and that will
work hopefully what I need to do plus
plus yes and I could also do this with
the concentrator I guess but here I
could probably actually win this one
yes that would work lists can be
compared if the stuff that they contain
can be compared for instance we can
compare like five is five larger than
six no it's not we can compare numbers
therefore we can compare lists of
numbers so we can see if for instance
like one three we can see if that is
bigger than zero
ah to which it is in a little bit we're
going to take a look at list functions
but first coffee bread
Oh so with functions so let's say that
we have a list like 5 4 3 2 1 we can
call for instance head on it that gives
us 5 because this is the first item is a
5 think of the list like a monster I did
this so this is the head so we can do
tail and that will give us this there's
a tail this is the head tail so you
asked me how do you get the but you do
that by saying list that will give us 1
because 1 is the last item then there is
the inverse of the tail function which
is in it so you just go in it and what
that will give you everything but the
but if you try to do head on an empty
list you'll get an error the type system
of Haskell allows us to catch a lot of
errors at compile time but this is one
of the errors that we can't and in
Haskell we want to avoid runtime errors
as much as possible so it's good
practice to make sure that we're not
passing any empty race to functions such
as head to do that we have functions
like length that's 0 you know like 1 2
that will give us 2 there is a function
that actually checks if an array is
empty and that is funky enough called
null so if it's not empty it's normal
it's going to be false and if it's empty
it's going to be true we have other
functions like of like a reverse which
not surprisingly will reverse the list
there is a function that is called take
and take will grab as many items from
the beginning
of the array that you specify so I say
take three and that will take the first
three items from the array not a right
list still living in JavaScript land and
you're still straight if I take two it
will take the first two items if we take
zero it will not give us an error it
will give us an empty list to take more
than exists okay so it it still works if
I say like a thousand it will just give
us as much as is available this is also
kind of inverse of take which is drop so
it just drops the first two items on the
array and returns the rest there are
functions like minimum well mini mini
mum which gives us the smallest number
and of course there is maximum which I
can't spell these things maxi but
maximum which gives us the largest
number and there is things like some
which summarizes all the numbers and
there is things like product which will
multiply all the numbers like 5 times 4
times 3 times 2 times 1 is 120 and there
is a function called LM which checks if
an element is part of a given list so
let's say that we have 5 4 3 2 1 and
check it element 6 is part of that no
it's not
however element 5 is or 3 some people
find this a bit hard to read so LM is
often called as an infix function and
lamb and then true if you've forgotten
about error in fix functions you can
click here
for rehearsal but they are basically
functions that you place in between the
arguments any function can be called as
an infix function but there are no the
normal infix functions or plus like this
is an infix function no my battery died
on my keyboard and it finally I want to
point out something that the book
doesn't talk about but is a very clear
difference from JavaScript because
notice that everything here are like the
functions are separate from the the the
list in Haskell we have length that is I
just a function that takes a list but in
JavaScript length is a property on the
on the array object and this shows how
Haskell is very much not an
object-oriented language it is function
oriented it's functional in JavaScript
and other languages that has a lot of
object orientation States and functions
are intermingled so length and and and
the array here they are like combined
together
however in Haskell they are cleanly
separated same thing with would take for
instance the JavaScript equivalent would
be probably slice which would be like
0-2 and that's it for today you have
watched an episode of fun fun function I
released this every Monday morning oh
wait hundred Greenwich Mean Time
if you found this interesting you might
want to check out the channel quick
frets below to see if it's something
that you would consider subscribing to I
am mpj until next Monday morning thank
