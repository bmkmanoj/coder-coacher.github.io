to look at how you can do dependency
injection without classes using only
functions I am your host npj and you are
watching fun function
all right so the viewer that I am a
visioning for this episode is somebody
that is coming from a Java or C short
background and you are used to doing
things in certain ways and you are
wondering if those ways are applicable
to JavaScript and if not how to do them
in a more JavaScript D way yeah that's
it
and it might also be that you're just
falling onto this video and you are
wondering what dependency injection even
is and if that's the case you can check
out this video that I made on the
subject of dependency injection you can
also find that episode in in the episode
that linked to that episode in the
episode description words are hard today
it seems how does this work
let's first look at an object-oriented
example of dependency injection the way
you would probably do it f you were new
to JavaScript and you're jumping into
this and you're coming from a c-sharp
background let's imagine that we are
coding a user manager it's a thing that
for now is responsible for adding users
to the database I'm now going to code
this using my hands
yeah I did it
alright let me walk you through this I
just have to start now so say come on
come on come on there there cool
so first line here this is just a
fictitious database the UNICOR database
that I made up on the spot yes like that
app is this is just our main application
we are not going to go through that
because it doesn't exist I made that up
as well and we have this user manager we
are going to be coding this it doesn't
exist at this spot quite yet but I want
to show you first how we use it we begin
here by instantiating a new database
connection here we we pass it a host and
a ported some basic configuration
options and we get a connection object
back from instantiating this class and
this this is some some API that we are
getting from the database vendor we have
no control over this or anything we
wouldn't even have that if it was real
down here on line 10 we are
instantiating
our user manager and we are passing it
the connection object you see see here
this sorry this thing we are we're
passing it in here and we get of course
a music manager object our username is
your instance of the user manager class
here finally here on line 12 we are
passing in the the user manager that we
created here and we're passing it into
the constructor of the app our main
piece of code that is dependent on the
user manager it needs it to do stuff and
then it goes away and it starts it or
something this is not terribly important
it's just to give you some context what
is important is what user manager does
so let's let's proceed to write user
manager boom let's create that file use
now
okay same I'm gonna call that you sir
manager dr. J yes
oh that's implemented
yeah I wrote some code let's walk
through it it's a user manager class all
we need to export it as well
exports default user manager otherwise
who can't get to it from the outside and
then the file doesn't serve much purpose
in the world anyway it takes a it has a
constructor that takes a database
connection remember from the last code
let me show it to you here the user
manager accepts a connection object
let's go back that is what it gets here
and it will assign it to a private
private variable private property that
we call underscore connection and we use
it down here but I haven't typed it
correctly create user here accepts a
name and it will then call table on
users and supposedly get some kind of
object command object of some sort back
from that which we call insert on with
some options I made all of these up its
needs is new here for some ungodly
reason and then we pass the name
property as to the full name property in
there to the insert argument and Edward
seems to return a promise here and when
we when the promise resolves we get a
user and we extract user ID from that so
what great user will do is will it will
create a user where the name that we
pass it and then it will create return a
promise that eventually resolves to the
ID of that user that is what this
fictitious little application does now
let's rewrite this in a functional way
I'm going to switch back to the main the
starting the application the init main
thing first and what I'm going to do
here is that instead of calling this
user manager I'm
going to call it user utils and we're
going to call it from user utils because
it's it's not really a manager object
it's going to be a set of functions and
this is no longer going to be
instantiate like this it's going to be
mm-hmm you know one way we are not even
going to have a containable
we just we are just going to have a
create user function and it is going to
be AHA make create user and that is
going to take the connection of like
that and make reducer is going to be
something that we export from the user
utils
whoops sorry about that tasty paste make
create user and then create user is
going to be something that we pass into
the app because the app is dependent on
on create user alright so we are going
to code this thing the user utils next
but before I do I would like to spend a
little bit of time showing some love for
you the patrons the astute of you might
have noticed that there were no ads
running before this video and that is
because your patronage your financial
support has allowed me to turn those off
no more annoying pre-rolls they are gone
now I no longer need to care about
making advertisers happy or keeping the
view counts up I only need to care about
what you the patrons think as of
recording this there are 1465 of you but
there are 13 of you that have been very
generous and selected either the
incredibly stupid paper waste
celebration tier or a higher one and I
would like to celebrate you now
I don't know thank you so much
old patrons thank you so much for your
support you really didn't have to do
that but you did and that makes you
amazing your support allows everyone to
enjoy fun fun functional free without
ads and it also allows me to pour more
money and more time into fun fun
function and take it to the next level
thank you so much for being a patron all
right back to the code we where we okay
we were creating this user utils and
let's do that ah you know what I'm going
to grab the user manager copy paste that
and keep it here but commented out so
that you can get a reference compare it
alright cool
BAM okay so let's have a look at what
this does because this is for some of
you this is going to be absolutely
nothing strange and for some of you that
are probably new to JavaScript this is
going to be super weird what is
happening here
so what make create user does it that it
creates the create user function for us
it's a is a little factory that creates
the create user function as a bit of
matter but let me walk you let's jump
back to the example and have a look at
what it does so here we call them a
create user and we pass in connection
and that will give us create user so
when we this create user when we when
app actually does use it inside of
itself it will just call create user dot
o
that name like Mark Smith that's the way
it's going to be used so may create user
is a thing that creates create user
functions it's not even a thing why I'm
not saying a thing it's a function that
creates other functions that is called a
higher-order function and you can call
like I have an episode on that and the
long functional programming series that
is following it and you can check out it
out by clicking there you can also find
it in the episode description
higher-order functions they are
fantastic either way let's jump back
into user user utils and see what we
have there
so again may create user it takes a
connection and then it returns this
function it creates this function and
this function it takes name that's it's
only variable only argument and then it
uses that inside inside of itself and
you know what I did a copy paste here
this is this is stupid
in the earlier code it would refer to
the the private property connection
the class but we don't have any class
here we have a connection here as an
argument and we have actually access to
that so connection there and then it
does exactly the same thing as as before
and before because this is an arrow
function and we don't use curly brackets
here and we we can do that when it's
only one when and the arrow function is
has only one line then the return
statement we don't need that because
that is that is implied when we leave
out the the curly brackets so we could
also do it like this turn but we don't
do that in here because we can save that
and what you're observing here with
where we access connection this is the
power of closures in JavaScript if you
need to closures I have a video on that
here and you should watch that but a
quick primer is it's they are so so nice
I'm gonna make a bit of indentation here
to make it perhaps a little bit more
obvious so this first function here the
outer factory function or whatever you
would like to call it it it will create
a new closure so code inside here if if
we had used curly brackets here and it
was there was space for more more
functions so more code I mean anything
here would would have access to the
connection connection parameter of
course that because it's a it's a
function and of course the function has
access to it's it's its own arguments
but the fantastic thing about closures
is that when we declare another function
inside of a function like connection
here we have access to that the the
argot and whatever the whatever this
function has access to here this code
this code here also have access to the
very same variables and arguments such
as the the argument from the from the
outer function so this is what allows us
to do pull things like this off closures
are really really really powerful let me
go back to the previous annotation level
and this technique that we're using here
where we are creating a function that it
is kind of prefilled where the the
connection because you know we could
have just done done this but then it
would have been cumbersome to pass
around because then we would have to
pass around both the may create user and
have a reference to the connection
somewhere like this allows us to
pre-fill the the create user with the
connection like like let me go back to
the main code so what we do here is that
we're creating a function that has we
have a kind of prefilled it for like
loaded it with the connection so it's a
create user that is tied forever to this
this connection here and that means that
app when it gets a great user it can
just call create user doesn't need to
know anything about about how the
database has been being accessed because
that is abstracted away inside of create
user it's a great great way great
example of dependency inversion I have a
video on that as well but I I actually
in that video I call it inversion of
control which is not quite the same
thing I misunderstood subtleties but
what I described there is dependency
inversion and the concept is the same I
just get the labels wrong but either way
I digress let's look back to this thing
here this technique here the prefilling
of the connection of the name it has a
there is a name for this and it's called
Korean I do have an episode on that as
well up there or in the episode
description back when I made that
episode I didn't really fully understand
the need for Korea as much as I do now
and I think that this actually
illustrates the case was better than
that episode did but why would you do
this why you scurrying instead of
classes in order to do dependency
injection why why would anybody prefer
this over classes there are several
reasons but in this case I think the
strongest argument is just the
minimalism functions is something that
we already use in the language closures
is something that we already use in the
language all the time and in this case
we can just get away with not using
classes we we can just not add that to
the toolbox that is our application it's
one less thing also I would argue that
the current solution is simpler it's
it's just simply a lot less code it's a
bit more a lot more elegant the class is
just a bigger construct even if we even
if like I know that classes are going to
get arrow functions so we could do
something like this and you know that
makes the comparison a bit more fair but
as you see there's still a bit quite a
bit of extra syntax in this case and
classes also has the extra complexity
that that involves this this is arrow
functions makes it a little bit nicer
but it's there's still a bit of
confusion around what the hell this
refers to in JavaScript that's it's not
rocket surgery but it's an added
complication when you compare it to this
case where it's just incredibly obvious
what what connection refers to and what
it will refer to in all all situations
there
no way of changing changing this while
in this case if this wasn't an arrow
function this could be like change
depending on what context is was called
classes do in some cases have
performance benefits but those are so
minuscule that they are only in play if
you are creating hundreds of thousands
of objects per second in this case we
are realistically only having a few user
managers as at best so it's going to
make absolutely zero impact on our
application also it's just beautiful
look how good it looks
ah but you might wonder what happens
once we start adding more methods to the
class what would be the equivalent there
like let's say that we had a delete user
or or something like that what would
happen then I will be talking about that
in the next episode
ah cliffhanger you have just watched an
episode of fun fun function I release
new episodes every Monday morning Oh 800
GMT if you are watching from the future
you can check out next week's video here
otherwise you have to wait till Monday
and in the meantime you might want to
check out my patreon video which talks
about why you might want to become a
patron
I am mpj until next Monday morning
