watching fun fun function so you are
watching this on December 26 I'm
recording this on Christmas Day he has
got some whiskey from my father this is
Swedish single malt whiskey called mock
me here it is to be honest not
particularly good but it is Swedish and
when it comes to whiskey I'm a bit of a
patriot now I try to support whatever
it's out there there's not gonna be a
video today or well this is a video I'm
recording a video but there's not gonna
be a programming video because I'm
trying to relax a bit you're in the
holidays and also to take you know a
step back and look at what this year was
like and what we should bring in for the
next year fun fun function just recently
passed sixty thousand subscribers that
is just so crazy at the beginning of
this year we were just above 10,000
people and now we are about 60,000
during the course of this year you
people I've watched 10 million minutes
of fun fun function 10 million minutes
of this face I am so humbled and
grateful to you people for allowing me
to Yammer on in front of a camera to all
you people I am so grateful for this
opportunity to talk to you people due to
this youtube channel i was invited to
brazil ge'ez and in brazil and i was
there and it was I've never felt so
appreciated for something that I do in
my life it was such an amazing
experience and an extra thank you to you
people that were there you made me feel
like a million bucks this journal is
quite possibly the best thing that I
have ever done and during the coming
year I will be doing more of it I would
like to ask the question do you people
how can we make fun fun functional
better how can we step it up a notch
I've been doing different types of
videos during the last year I've been
doing these let's code videos I've been
doing the musings I've been doing this
what why how videos where I explain very
specific programming concepts I've been
doing collaborations pair programming
videos with other programmers I've also
done some exploration into like just
checking out a new programming language
just to try to learn and see what what
works and what feels right how long it
takes and just get a feel for where this
channel wants to go during the coming
year I would like to make the channel a
bit less experimental they're still
gonna be experimental videos and i'm
going to try out new formats but i would
like the promise of what fun font
function is and what you get on your
Sunday mornings to be a bit more
consistent but the question is what is
that I would like you to tell me what
your favorite part of fun fun function
is so that I can make more of that
basically I want your advice this is
your time to give me and put on what the
next year what 2017 of fun fun function
should be like because
I'll make the content here but it is in
the end you that make the channel
otherwise it's just me screaming into a
camera and therefore you need to tell me
what you are and what you need so what
is fun fun function to you and what you
want to be in 2017 if you're the free
throw a kind of person to write it in a
comment down below that is awesome but
if you would rather do it in private and
maybe you are not the common g person
I've also made a little survey that I've
linked in the episode description I'm I
would love if you fill it out the survey
is very short it's just six questions
that's it ah I had nothing else I hope
you have a great time with uh whatever
you like to spend your holidays on here
is to an amazing 2017 until next Monday
morning stay cuties dirty dirty turtle
