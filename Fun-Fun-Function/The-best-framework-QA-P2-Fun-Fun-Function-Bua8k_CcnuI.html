put on the status how do you keep up
with a frantic rhythm of the web
development seen especially javascript
in libraries is changing right so in my
case I don't because I don't do that
yeah like did a game development
industry like you don't have this like
in the JavaScript scene like there's a
lot of talk about JavaScript fatigue and
like you don't you don't you can operate
can you relate to that tooling fatigue
at all no no no no it's great
whenever a new tool comes out and it
just you know it does something that
used to be hard is easy now oh great
like I mainly use unity that's like what
I know the best in game development and
that's a tool that keeps evolving a lot
and you know as with any product when a
new version comes out sometimes you like
oh they changed I don't like it but
overall it's a great improvement like a
while back the electors found system
like introduced a lot of more you know
fine grained mixer controls all these
things that used to be hard it used to
be a thing you had to write yourself or
use some sort of third-party plugin or
you know you you see great advances in
other areas like it's a company called a
mixer mode that made like a really cool
sort of you know animation pipeline pin
where you know now anything can be
animated you know it's like that's sort
of thing yeah it's like it's just a
great improvements all the time that
come out and I don't know I maybe the
difference is that it sounds like in
JavaScript the things that come out are
comparatively like smaller like unity is
like a whole all-encompassing
development platform much like you know
the Unreal Engine or you know a Crytek
or you know it's like a giant engine
and typically you marry yourself to one
of these big engines and then like you
sit with that engine for a long time
yeah but there are a lot of engines
coming up is your insurer in game
develop there's my son yeah number
charge just launched you know yeah bang
and this like this there is tons of game
engine sure but maybe the difference is
that as an outside observer of
JavaScript people you guys do you seem
to fetishize what is new and interesting
yeah this guy comes out in this life now
we do it like this yes now we do it
reactive yes and even though you could
use this pattern before well I don't
think that's the same in game
development there yeah like yeah people
say it's more like a tectonic shift
where people say now unity is slowly
catching up with the rendering potential
of unreal yeah but I still prefer unreal
for these reasons you know like it's
more like a slower evolving so what do
you think that is like it to me it feels
like there is a bit of an inertia in
game development it's not that there are
more like there are more JavaScript
frameworks coming out it's just that
people are a bit more more skeptical in
the game game industry I mean I think
it's like for like slower to adopt like
yeah of course they are people are
extremely risk-averse when they start a
new project because you don't want to be
typically don't want to be you know the
first team ever to try a new game engine
unless you have some sort of deal with
the maker of that engine that will be
what do you think that is big is it
because games games are countries but
you know sometimes they suck sometimes
they suck and then you've commit and is
extremely expensive to change midway
through all the programming might be
different the art pipe I might be
different it's not just a pure
programming viewing this thing needs to
like interface with your art team and
you know and they might have to learn a
completely new way of setting it up but
yes super expensive if you shift these
sort of things and I mean right now
we're talking about Oh shifting your
entire game engine that's madness you
would never do that Midway for the
project and if you do it like between
projects is usually because you are
using something that's kind of old like
saying you cut you know a while back I
used flash for example as the main game
engine that I knew and a lot and a lot
of companies that were like oh but we're
gonna publish to desktop now she'd be
used like Adobe AIR yeah because that's
the pipeline we know but then at some
point you just see like no unity is it's
like so much better than this
we're just gonna use that yeah because
it gives us power and people sort of
know it you usually have like a few
people who might already know it because
they've kind of become acquainted with
it I was tired after main professional
product what do you feel like this the
same risk also exists in India most
approach I mean like you can't switch
from react to angular midstream in your
project might oh you can of course but
it will like cool yes it would be like a
like and like it would be so impactful
on your timeline I think that it like it
I I worked in a product company now for
it for for quite some time and you don't
feel JavaScript fatigue inside of a
product company rather that has one
single report because switching
switching platforms inside of that big
of a project like it's boy phase that
thing is for five ten years old now that
is what like games I mean still games at
least ever like a three-year cadence or
something like that's what if I just
work this is gonna stay around for us so
you guys so much like code already
written in this way that the benefit of
having a structured in a different way
it probably does not wait a cost of you
know changing all this nothing you have
to do yeah it's like like like some you
need to evolve it somehow at some point
of course but that is a that's a very
big decision and it happens very slowly
and very
actually and you you kind of like we're
looking like it react is starting to
take hold now after and react has been
around for three or four years I don't
remember so you just wait for things to
crystallize right I think that
JavaScript fatigue I I have a theory
that that is mostly people that are
working in consulting because in
consulting you come to a company and you
they need some kind of software tooling
to be built right now and you need to
pick a tool for that and this do you
want to pick make a good - of course
you'd you do your research and since you
don't have an existing product and you
might like ha like we don't have
anything to lose so we don't need to
make a super safe bet all right I mean
we can just like yeah but I also think
that that is not the whole part I think
that javascript also has an
overwhelmingly large amount of junior
developers then you not have a computer
science background so it's as if when
you're new to development you want to
stay you want to stay ahead of the curve
you want to find the best way of doing
things right yeah and I remember that I
used to be super into you know like oh
there's a burning architectural pattern
in my head for how to update data in a
web interface or every now and I was
like oh there was one one answer one
answers you're looking for the one that
I said you think like Oh turtle did
these principal this that sort of feed
into it and you know one way is better
than another way yes oh but it's more
complicated than that in real life you
realize as you grow older yes you know
things have advantages and disadvantages
and it depends on the context and the
application that you know which one is
better
yeah so I see it is you get more mellow
as yeah yeah like that exactly and I
think that you're touching on a great
point here that there is a notion like
there's a switch in your programming
career once you realize
there isn't the best tool No so I
realize right now that I once I started
learning about video and photography and
stuff like I was when I started out I
was looking for the best camera that's
not a thing I'm kind of conceptually
understand it but one the more you get
into cameras you start realizing how
enormous li not a thing rise like
there's like I know Potter would be you
know a better camera like it was a
better I don't know yeah I like better
and better look better
yeah exactly like oh the primary
abstract way of go cameras they capture
vivid images yes these things matter
lead oh yeah this camera captures more
like higher resolution yes like the
capturing more light has a consequence
and it's right it's an artistic image
sort of relapse in the end that depends
on your intention but like if you have
the mindset like which is the best
framework angular or react okay yeah I
know that that is a very common question
like I making it in a funny voice and
making fun of people but I like that is
a way I used to think that it was
genuinely a tool that was better than
another tool and in some ways some tools
are of course of just higher quality
because they're just better made but
generally when you build a project like
you can start to look at the different
tooling options available and find that
at this this is a better fit right you
can just not arbitrarily separate from a
project or a task look at the set of
framework and say that this is a better
framework yeah it's more as you can you
can say something like you know
statistically speaking if I were to pick
a framework this one has a higher chance
of being the best framework but you
would be wrong some percentage of the
time yep
exactly yeah and a consequence of of
looking at things that way finding the
best firming and is that you got since
technology improves then you will
constantly have to look at new sites to
find the next yeah Beck's best thing in
the next week next new thing because
that might be better yeah and that that
is the problem with best first thinking
instead of tasks first right thinking
what do I need to like what do I want to
exist and what do I need to do to make
that exist it's like a question that is
more interesting than Oh which framework
is better yep going back to observables
and I have patterns yeah like that is
why it's very important to focus on
having having good fundamentals like
understanding like focusing patterns
focusing on learning how software
interacts with yes its own complexity
sort of and learning to see that when
when you encounter a problem or a task
that you see that ok this problem is
probably going to have these
characteristics these things are
probably gonna be be hard and only then
can you start looking at looking for a
tool you also probably it's it's a very
good approach to not immediately start
looking for a tool it might be a good
even if it's your intent to always like
from the start use a tool like start
coding like on a project a problem a bit
for yourself trying to implement the
tools so that you understand the nuances
right the problem a bit I mean and
that's also like a I mean that's like a
build versus by a sort of decision it's
like a thing with reoccurring sort of
questions right because you know tools
bring you power they make it easier
because they already exist you don't
have to make the tool but a lot of the
time they also come with you know
restrictions they they make you make
things in a certain way
and that the tool prescribes and that's
a negative thing yeah actually that's
like you know you lose control okay yes
like I can still the bank that I just
recently switched to uh-huh I can kind
of see what era of web development that
was because like there was an era where
I don't
asp.net and rails were two examples of
software and that just made applications
look in a certain way if you built it
and they it just became natural to build
the application in a certain way and I
guess if you didn't like the framework
just punish you
yeah so like oh this is built with rails
by just looking at it it's it's
interesting how how they constrain you
it was a framework first era yeah
totally and you just have to live in the
framework and more like you're driving a
car rather than building a road I don't
know Bill yeah yeah but yeah you can
only go where it's kind of all right we
were absolutely out of bounds we have to
get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
