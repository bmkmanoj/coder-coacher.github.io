what measures do you use to prevent RSI
back pain etc this is a great question I
had neck pains for almost daily for many
years and one day I decided randomly to
start walking to work instead of taking
the train which ended up wasn't like a
long walk I just ended up like walking
for basically an hour every day and I
think that when I went from walking 20
minutes a day to walk in 60 minutes a
day and my neck and back pain just
disappeared it was just amazing how much
 was caused by the fact that I was
just not walking enough and that change
is actually backed by a lot of studies
there is just something that is
statistically horrible things that
happens to you when you move less than
50 minutes per day or something like
that sometimes I just have bad bad weeks
where are you sit way too much and my
back yes ah sometimes you want have been
a long slice and stuff like that then I
do I don't know exactly what to call the
exercise its reverse push-ups perhaps I
just lay down with my face on the on the
floor and then just lift my body up like
this and sometimes I just pick something
that is like with a bit of weight
perhaps my laptop or some books and keep
on my head while I'm doing it
and that just tends to help things
remarkably also standing desks that they
are the best I have a standing desk from
Ikea it's it's remarkably cheap for a
standing desk and it just it's just
great I have one at home and I have one
would work and I try to use it as much
as possible and
I actually bought this fluid stance it's
it's a thing that you sit balance board
and the the thing with it is that it
just keeps you keeps you keeps you
constantly moving pretty short just
keeps the brain more active I just feel
a lot more energetic when I when I use
