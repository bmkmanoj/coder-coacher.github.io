did this I don't even
be friendly and have fun free because
programming can be really confusing and
that can sometimes make us feel really
stupid and alone because everyone around
us seemed so smart this board and this
show is near to be a constant reminder
that in reality all of us are confused
and that is fine that feeling of
confusion
that's our friend it means we're
learning fun because programming is
exhausting programming is constantly
changing so the learning never ends both
the show and this form is here to help
you to stay curious about programming so
that you can fall in love with it over
and over
he flew in from Indianapolis USA - drew
from Los Angeles California
for Vienna Austria without
so kindly share your confusion everyone
around you is just as confused but
they're too afraid to us and share your
excitement when you find a piece of code
or anything that just makes you happy to
be a programmer then please
Tokyo Japan I'm actually from eating the
sugar female-assigned Espana
