announcement to make I have quit my job
at Spotify I am now a part-time
consultant and the other part of my time
will be dedicated to thought function so
fun fun function is now officially my
part-time job instead of something that
I cram in on the weekend I mmm PJ and
you are watching the patreon video for
fun fun function so today here come I'm
asking you if you want to become patron
of one function as a patron you chip in
a few bucks every month whatever amount
that you feel is appropriate and I will
use your money to keep the show free for
everyone and just make the show fair and
as a patron you also get some free words
most importantly the newly-opened
fun fun forum that is a summary of
everything that I'm going to say in the
video so if that is all you need to hear
you can go to patreon.com/crashcourse
and
and become a patron right now that link
is also in the video description who am
i who is this person that you are giving
your hard-earned money to well I have
been a full-time developer for over 13
years I've worked for many companies are
but the brands that you might recognize
or Spotify Absolut Vodka and blackberry
my primary language is JavaScript but I
coated in a lot of languages during the
years such a small talk in Danish that
was not a good year in my life
my glorious internet fame was built on
Quora
where I discovered that I really liked
answering questions and explaining
things about programming so I ended up
writing over a thousand answers there my
schooling is actually not software it's
a theatre and TV production don't a lot
of programming done a lot of writing and
explain
programming and I've done a lot of
acting and video production and when you
combine those things together you get a
programming show which leads us to what
is fun fun function I mean I know you
watch the show but what is the show
really about and why is it worth your
patronage I can't really tell you why
it's important to you but I can tell you
why I started fun fun function and why
I've kept doing it almost every weekend
for two years I started fun for function
because I wanted there to be a show
about programming not a database of
tutorials and online courses I wanted it
to be a show a regularly scheduled show
with a different topic every week with
an entertaining host who explains things
well all with the purpose of keeping you
excited and curious on the draft and it
seems like a lot of people agreed with
me that there should be such a show
because I've received so much
appreciation since starting this show
it's been so successful and I genuinely
never received this much depreciation
for anything that I've ever done in my
life over the years you rule the the
audience have made it abundantly clear
that this this thing is what I am
supposed to do so fun for function has
just grown and grown and grown during
the years but at the same time it has
also worn on me a lot to do this every
single weekend for for two years so I
was in this situation where okay this is
very successful but it's also making me
burnout so I kind of need to either I
stopped doing this show and kill it or I
commit to doing it for real
and it was then I decided that Spotify
was the thing that needed to go Spotify
is definitely the dream employer as a
programmer it it's an amazing place from
both of my benefits and career and just
nice workplace environment to be in
but this show is a way for me to
maximize the impact that I can do on the
world with my skill set so I need to
make fun for function my job I need to
make a business out of this and this is
where patreon comes in when you become a
patron you help keep the show free for
everyone because most programming
content and people that produce
programming videos for as a business
keep their stuff behind paywalls I don't
think there's anything wrong with that
but it's not what I want to do with
funfun function I want the show to have
as widespread as impact as possible and
to do that it needs to be free okay fine
mpj but why patreon why why not ads why
not fund the production with app well
the advertising model is dramatic
because it forces the crater into this
race or views creators that wind is
right they do so by making lots of comp
long and to do that they do stuff with
low production costs often stay in the
content often news it's often clicked ad
and most importantly as mainstream as
possible all of this is how you optimize
for making money using the advertising
model like gaining views and all of this
is the opposite of where I want fun fun
function to go the patreon or a
membership business model is so much
more healthy than the advertising model
because it is you the patrons that
directly fund the show it is only you
and what you think that I need to care
about views likes and algorithms and
advertisers and making them feel happy
with your the business model becomes
both simple and healthy keep patrons
happy speaking of making members happy
rewards ok so again the show stays free
but you as a patron you get some extra
rewards as thanks for your support
there's a bunch of stuff there's live
streams there is the ad free and audio
downloads there is the me sending you
real regular mail
you can check out the exact rewards on
patreon.com slash one function but there
is one reward that I am more excited
about than any of the other reward and
that is also the reward that all patrons
get and that is fun fun for my goal for
the forum is to create a friendly
familiar a fun place to have structured
discussions with me program and the
reasons why I'm excited about this and
why I think this can work is because
whenever I show my comment feels my
YouTube comments build to other
youtubers they just turn green within
because you are not look it's not like
you're 10 times more like you are a
hundred times better than the average
youtube comment because you are you're
smart you're polite you're insightful
and you call me on my shit but the
youtube comment system how do I put it
as a technology yes
foggy and and primitive trying to have a
structured discussion in the YouTube
comfy that is kind of like trying to
poop out a rack-mounted server you
really deserve that the hoverboard is
powered by this court called
highlighting real-time of pace so all
the good star the forum is going to be
moderated by yours truly I'm going to be
very hands-on and I'm really really
going to make an effort to try to
nurture a fun friendly environment an
environment where we can get know one
another and where we can welcome and
educate new programmers a place where we
can have interesting discussions about
code and work and life I also hope that
fun fun form can be a place where we can
discuss the show itself I'm hoping that
some of you the ones one can act sort of
like my executive producers giving me
feedback ideas and inspiration having a
back and forth with you before ideas
turn into episodes
as a patron you help make the show
better because the more patrons we have
the more money and time I bore into the
show that means more production time and
polish and just better quality but I
also hope that we can travel with the
show and interview famous companies and
famous programmers about our about the
work if we get really big which I think
we can then we can start doing more
elaborate shows with production teams
and if we get to that point then we need
to start discussing what how we take fun
for function to in the next level do we
want to create the Mythbusters of
programming or do we want to start a fun
fun conference I don't know but I would
like to find out with you so if you want
to support fun fun function get some
cool rewards and a friendly and fun
place to discuss with me and other
programmers then head over to patreon
calm plan fun function
I am mvj until we see each other on the
fun part forum or until next Monday
morning thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
