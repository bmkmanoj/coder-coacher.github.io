announcement to make I am going
full-time youtuber yes this is now like
the channel 4 the function is now going
to be the only thing that I do for a job
I announced in my patreon campaign that
I was going part-time but it has been
evident the the last few months that
that doesn't quite work this channel
needs my full attention and the patreon
campaign went kind of ok it enough for
me to make the leap and try to make this
work financially well enough so that I
can make it my full-time job it's not
quite there yet but I think I can pull
that off so this is this is really for
real now and if you if you want to
support me you can do that on
patreon.com patreon.com slash fun fun
function you only need to back me where
the 1 buck in order to get access to the
fun fun forum which is the are the best
reward really but if you are able to
afford it please consider chipping in a
bit more whatever you like because that
really really helps and makes a ton of
difference there are rewards on the
patreon page or going to get an overhaul
not sure exactly what they're gonna be
yet or have some ideas but I don't wanna
announce it yet because yeah like like
all things that you do for the first
time you learn things like some rewards
are like it felt like they would be easy
to deliver for me but in practice I have
been struggling to to get those rewards
out because it wasn't quite scalable so
if you are one of the people who have
backed on tier
where you get nice and fancy rewards the
hangouts and the mail in candy and stuff
like that and you haven't received the
rewards that you that you should please
do reach out to me on find a private
message on the phone for and more on or
on patreon and I will make sure that you
like that you get it but I've I've been
slacking off on those and I've been like
I've not been on top of those and it's
yeah I did the rewards need to be
restructured one thing that will finally
happen that has been in the works for a
while is that I'm going to start
experimenting with live streams not sure
what exactly those are going to be I
think that they are mainly going to be
do you know what let me first talk about
fears for a bit my fears with going
full-time the problems with doing that
so besides the obvious economical one
that is always in your mind when you are
going going out on your own project
there are three main fears and that is
the social implications of doing that
you I am a very a very sociable person I
mean I'm and I'm an extrovert programmer
and that makes me kind of weird
I suppose in that context and I working
from home like I do here it just it kind
of works when it's part-time but for a
full week I just go bananas it's it's
absolutely untenable
the second fear that I have is
productivity it's a lot easier to get
things done when you have an employer
and a team and like kind of pressure
structure to get you to do stuff
self-discipline is its
seems almost like a unicorn to me I
getting things done and getting them
done on time is it's hard when you're on
your own that's that's a huge fear that
the videos themselves are kind of easy
because you know it's Monday you have to
get one out at least something this week
has been absolutely atrocious from that
perspective I am recording this last
minute which sometimes happens and it's
just been a week where I have just not
been able to get a proper video out
partly because my now being full-time
kind of it kind of becomes too much time
so you start getting oh I have time for
all these things I gotta do these emails
and you it kind of yeah I don't know if
you've experienced that but sometimes
yes too much time becomes overwhelming
and you get nothing done it's it's a
problem I'm gonna solve it but this week
has not been too great also I've been
distracted where the I'm doing a talk in
Finland next week at smartly meet up and
there's also a I'm gonna hold a little
social brunch gathering after it like
the morning after if you so if you're
based in Helsinki you should check that
out you you can find the link if you
I'll link to the tweet and that my third
fear is is learning and that's where
streaming comes in actually or I hope it
well so when when I worked as a
programmer especially when I was
full-time at Spotify has got this
constant inspiration all the time I was
just frustrated with things at work and
I just wrote this down like oh you know
like this is something that I want to I
want to talk about this is something I
should make an episode about and yes
when I started started doing the
episode on the weekend I just looked at
the my all my notes and I found like
many different good ideas for episodes
and it wasn't too hard to find something
to to talk about it just came naturally
but even when I went just part-time
I started struggling with that it's turn
making
finding you out in an idea turned out to
be like this experience where you kind
of squeeze a wet rag squeeze water out
of it and it just becomes drier and
drier and drier and yeah that that's
been a huge problem
I just don't code enough and that's
where I hope that I can like start
streaming and live code a lot of the
time and just try new interesting things
out on a project or projects that is
what I do so the stream is not going to
be any kind like it's gonna be very
different from the from the material
that you see on the YouTube channel it's
gonna be way more freeform very long
form and very like just me doing what I
what I feel like because I feel like
that is very important like and I'm
going to listen to you people of course
but and like I welcome ideas but it's
it's there to inspire and teach me new
things and keep the channel healthy it's
not there primarily for entertainment it
will be entertaining it will be fun to
watch but that's that's the secondary
goal of it oh by the way regarding the
social thing I didn't I don't think I
mentioned that I'm moving to a studio
space
I at the first of 1st of December moving
in there so you're going to see all of
this change it's
probably gonna be very minimalistic from
the start and then grow out maybe I'll
start green screening or maybe I'll
build a like nice studio space with a
nice backdrop I don't know which we'll
see we'll see but that's gonna be very
very very interesting and I'm looking
forward to it tremendously and that's my
update on my life as it is related to a
fun fun function it's going to be an
exciting year for sure and I very much
looking forward to producing a lot of
interesting content for you and seeing
where we can take this channel further I
hope that wasn't too uninteresting for
you people that just wanted a nice
programming video this Monday morning
for you I'm sorry we will be returning
to our or originally ordinarily
scheduled programming next Monday I am
mpj until next Monday morning stay
curious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
