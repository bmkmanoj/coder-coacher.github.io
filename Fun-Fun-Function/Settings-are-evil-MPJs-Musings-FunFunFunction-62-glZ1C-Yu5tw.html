watching fun fun function the title of
this week's video is settings are evil
this has been nagging me a lot lately I
really think that settings are a scourge
in software development and I want to
talk about the costs and problems with
having them what are settings what what
what kind of setting is am I talking
about basically I'm talking about having
a setting screen with toggles in you
know like one of all software has some
kind of configuration for instance like
imagine this set setting screen here
there is a name my name is there and
then there is a time zone and a lock
pick suite now there's no problem with
this this is not what I'm talking about
most software needs some kind of
configuration like this you know at
least if it's a social software that at
some point chose time you could perhaps
do away with the timezone and detect it
but it would still vary per person it
would just be configured on an operating
system level instead know the evil that
I am about to talk about is stuff like
this adding a toggle for something like
auto playing videos this is a horrible
drawing of us so this is necessary
probably and this is evil the difference
between these two categories of settings
or configuration of whatever you like to
call it is that this will give the user
a different path through the application
these are just kind of variables that
all users have it just displays a
different name for each user in the in
the templates in the views but this
toggle does a bit more it creates like a
divergent paths inside of the
application where the users will have
different experiences depending on what
their setting is set to and these are
poison in software development I'm gonna
talk about why why are settings like
this evil because they add a
combinatorial explosion of test cases
what what does that even mean
I'm going to talk about the
combinatorial explosion things but first
I want to talk a little bit about why
people add these features in the first
place settings are added when a team is
unable to make a product decision for
example the the autoplay video settings
is a setting that exists in the Twitter
settings so all the playing videos is
something that vine started the video
app vine starting started doing a couple
of years ago and it got an amazing
results from that so everybody started
doing that Instagram Facebook and then
Twitter also realized oh shit we need to
do this too so they did but also playing
videos is also very annoying so a lot of
users will complain it will be a lot of
negative press there will be a lot of
negative customer service but even with
all those are complaining people it's
clear that you still want to do it
because it it is amazing for engagement
it is amazing for the number of place
and it was amazing for just ad revenue
it made sense for Twitter to do it so
they added this a toggle inside of the
settings screen where you can just turn
the order playing videos off if you are
annoyed by them everybody happy oh no
combinatorial explosion of test case
when you are developing software there
are a number of things that can go wrong
when you are developing it and
maintaining it and then adding new
features and you know as time passes so
as you develop there are more and more
test cases that you need to check every
time you make a change you might be
testing these test cases more or less
formally but in the end somebody has to
go through them you have to check that
you are can create an order in the
system and that you can pay it a little
earlier and given that you get a charge
back this happens and did it is
basically your checking if the things
that could go wrong or or or not going
wrong and as you're developing you're
gonna get
or in more of these test cases test
cases is basically the amount of things
that you need to check every time you
release your software you can
theoretically make perfect software
let's say that you create a small little
NPM module that just does a very certain
thing with a string such as left padding
it with zeros or something there aren't
really any bugs in that implementation
it is it is pretty much perfect because
it does so little in real software the
amount of test cases go up and some of
them are just gonna break from time to
time and that's okay that's something
that we accept because we we want speed
and we want features and we want growth
we don't really need perfect software
it's ok that it breaks from time to time
but we still want to keep the test cases
down because the more things that can go
wrong will go wrong so if we can get
away with simpler software with fewer
test cases we should and this is the
reason why adding a feature toggle to
your application is so sinister because
it adds a combinatorial explosion of
test cases let me give you an example
let's say that you have a feature some
functionality of you or something in
your application and it's not the most
complicated view you have been
developing it for a couple of months
let's say that it has 40 test cases 40
pieces of individual functionality that
you want to make sure works every time
you release now let's say that this
piece of functionality has three toggles
that affects how it functions it might
be a list of tweets where you can have
autoplay videos on or off it might be a
list where you want to show or hide
items that have been deleted in it and
it might be like the size of the items
if they're compact or if they're you
have a bit of more clean space can be
anything now because you've added those
settings the number of test case
that you need to check on your feature
in order to make sure that it works
properly with all of the combinations
are 40 times 2 times 2 times 2 equals
320 test cases and in reality a piece of
functionality will have way more things
that can go wrong than just 40 in real
software development these numbers don't
end up on 320 they end up being
astronomical so if you have manual
testers they need to depend on some kind
of weird gut feel about the application
and what things tend to go wrong and the
problem with setting is because of these
growth curves they are not linear
they are exponential so they they will
just keep growing growing growing
growing like this they don't grow like
this so you can't solve it with
automated testing and hundreds and
hundreds of computers running your tests
for you because the numbers become so
huge that you cannot possibly test them
all even within like an entire cluster
of computers you have simply made your
software too complicated to test and if
you have made your software too
complicated to test you have made it too
complicated to maintain quality ok but
let's think about the other side of the
coin what about the users the annoyed
users that want to turn off the autoplay
videos this is a real problem we're not
making this problem up this this setting
it exists for for it has motivation
behind it it's so that we can tell
customer service and and the media that
well we're all playing videos now but
you have an option to turn it off it's
ok the problem with that is that you are
it's just an illusion of giving users
what they want because studies show that
95% of users never change settings now
this is going to vary depending on your
computer people your user base is but in
general the vast vast vast majority will
never
touch the settings of a piece of
software and this 95% figure this means
that in reality when you add a toggle
like the autoplay videos toggle or any
toggle the thing that you make the
default you might as well have just made
it the only option because that's the
experience that your users are going to
have except for a very small minority
you have not really need to solve the
problem because users won't make a
choice and I know what you're thinking
there is 5% here that will make the
choice shouldn't we do it for them and
yes we totally should if it wasn't for
the combinatorial explosion of test
cases the cost of this it's not worth it
for just 5% of the users a small
minority of those people will leave but
the vast majority of them will get used
to the new feature and don't fall into
the trap that oh it won't affect my app
so much if I just add this setting
because settings is one of those death
by a thousand tiny cuts kind of things
no single toggle that you add is going
to take it slow your development down to
a crawl but all the minut little toggles
that you add over time will have a look
at this this is the Twitter settings
interface and just have a look at this
they have like this is so much stuff
that you can change it's crazy we have
email notifications notifications and
web notifications
let's check this tab okay it's security
and privacy there's a lot of like I'm
not saying that these options are
useless they there they are there for a
reason but they all add a little bit of
this combinatorial explosion and this
this is so many things that it like this
is completely impossible to test there
are things here that they could have
done away with by
not procrastinating on a product
decision and making a proper product
decision with some spine instead of
these half-baked things where you kind
of have the illusion that you're giving
users a choice but not really because
nobody accesses settings like this one
send receive read receipts yes I can
totally understand why there are some
users that don't want other users to see
when they have read the messages because
that is kind of annoying but facebook
Messenger does not have this setting
there is no option to turn the Reedman
receipts on and off and you know what it
is one of the most popular and most
successful messengers in the world they
didn't need it they didn't need it to
survive you could just have skip this
you could just have made a proper
product decision just just have some
just have the courage to believe in your
product that you're making the right
call and if it doesn't turn out to be
the right call roll the feature back
don't have faked it with settings and
this one here this is also one of those
where Twitter kind of believed in their
product but not enough to not add his
setting to turn it off which is this
show me the best tweets first Twitter
sort of kind of wanna move to an
algorithm based feed but they also know
that this will best users off so they
have to be very careful about it if you
want to make a product decision do the
product decision they want to go in the
water the first first dip of the the
summer but they are kind of afraid oh
it's cold and they're dipping their toe
in I don't know jump or get off the pot
or I don't know exactly what this thing
is and I'm making fun of Twitter here
but I know that this is hard this is
hard that is why these settings arise it
is hard to jump in perhaps the best
argument is to just okay it is hard to
jump in but your competitors are
these half-ass decisions they're not
helping anyone for in Twitter's case I
think there's no setting to autoplay
videos in the Facebook newsfeed they're
just order playing videos and as an
example they are massively successful
from it and Twitter knows it this
setting here this video autoplay this is
not here to help users it's there
because Twitter had fear and because of
that fear they were unable to make a
product decision a proper product
decision and some of you might be
thinking that this sounds like a
designer product owner decision and this
is a programming channel what does that
have to do with me I'm just a programmer
well it is because it is your
responsibility as a software developer
to inform product owners and designers
about this problem this combinatorial
explosion of test cases it is not
completely obvious when you're adding it
it feels like you've solved the problem
it seems good it'll seems like a good
thing you've added here the baby cost
that these things have or rather the
habit of adding these things it's not
completely obvious and it's it's very
subtle and it even if you know about it
it feels like it's way down the line and
and probably someone else's problems
maybe the software developer that is
employed after you've left the
organization toggles sinister as hell
okay so to summarize this rant settings
are evil some evil is necessary but it
is your responsibility as a software
developer to make sure that the people
that are responsible for the design to
understand that this combinatorial
explosion of test cases exists and as a
result they will get the futures that
they want in the in the future that they
will get them slower because the speed
of your software development efforts
will slow down if you don't explain this
concept product to your your leads or
designers who or whomever ously
your development effort they have no way
of making the proper prioritization they
need to know the cost of this thing
might still be worth to do it but he
might also be oh yeah okay yeah if we
have to get those problems yeah then
maybe we can just design it away or
maybe just make the default case the
only case that's my rant ad setting
slowly because they're evil
do you agree disagree do you think I am
a hyperbolic yet which I am by the way I
felt like it today either way please
write a comment down below I like to
read your thoughts on mine so you have
watched an episode of fun fun function I
release this every Monday morning Oh 800
GMT some episodes are like this one me
you sings where I talk about the process
of software development while some are a
bit more fun and practical we're like :
illa turd I am mtj until next Monday
morning thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
