a function doesn't take all of its
arguments upfront instead it wants you
to give it the first argument and then
the function returns another function
which you are supposed to call with the
second argument which in turn will
return a new function which you are
supposed to call with the third argument
and so on until all the arguments have
been provided and then the function at
the end of the chain will be the one
that returns the value that you actually
what does it sound confusing good the
feeling of confusion is your friend it
means you're learning before we get to
it I'm going to incorporate some viewer
feedback into the show this one is for
you
Joshua foreground and everything have a
look at this beautiful function this
function is not curried but we're going
to curry it up in just a minute it's a
very simple function it takes a name a
size and element all strings and returns
another string let me call it and run it
fluffykins is a tiny dragon that
breathes lightning let's clear all that
proof here is the same function in the
korean version dragon is a function that
takes a name it will in turn return
another function which takes size which
in turn will return another function
which takes an element which in turn
will return the final strength I'm going
to call it and log the output now
remember
dragon will take a name block Akins and
it will return another function which
takes a size tiny which in turn returns
a third function which takes an element
lightning let's run that again
fluffykins is a tiny dragon that
breathes slightly so you see that it's a
chain of functions and if i just remove
this last lightning call here and just
run the code it would just show that oh
it's a function the idea with carrying
is that your function can pass through
the application and gradually receive
the arguments that it needs the function
goes through your app you sprinkle it
with some arguments here you spice it up
with an argument here and here you add
the final one and you get your output so
for instance you might have broken out
dragon here
into fluffykins dragon and then refer to
it here and you would get the same
output or maybe into three parts
tiny dragon and we run it again and we
get the same result now our dragon
function here is written from the start
to be curable but every functional
library worth its salt has a way of
making nan Korea Bowl functions career
proof now dragon is back in its standard
form the one we saw from the beginning
there is no currying here it's just the
normal arguments as an example I'm gonna
use lo - vs co MP I mean stole low -
dippity-do in stock now we can use it in
pour here we go and then we just do
hungry just overwrite the existing one
BAM and now fluffykins it's a tiny
dragon that means I think you don't have
to use slow - specifically for this all
libraries with any kind of functional
nature has a career option
that's what currying is and how it works
but why is it useful postproduction
Leviosa
so what you see here has no carrying at
all it's just normal code we're gonna
improve it a bit with carrying let's
walk through it we have a dragons array
we have a couple of lightning dragons
here knew me and fluffykins but we also
have a fire dragon and we also have our
time warp dragon that's serious business
we are going to get to line eight and
nine but let's first look at line eleven
and twelve where we filter out the
dragon the lightning dragons from the
Dragons array so we just call filter on
dragons you all recognize this from the
previous episodes filter takes a
callback which will get every item and
that item will be checked
against this has element function if so
it has element lightning and we pass in
the object and we get a true or false
and this will then be passed to
lightning dragons just let me run that
and you see that it's fluffykins and
nume that is filtered off if you look at
has element it's a function that takes
an element this is this string here goes
here and the filtered object or the
iterated the object that filter iterates
goods here and just compares that
against the element property of the the
object let's try to improve this with
carrying let's import lodash
and curry has element and then just
remove this wrapping function just do
that Wow
so now has element is Korea ball
that means when we call has element with
lightning that means that it will return
a new function which in turn expects we
passed the the object to check if it has
a limit lightning which allows us to
pass it as the callback function to
filter directly which is priestly call
occlusion a curable function is simply a
function that takes every argument by
itself and then just returns a new
function that expects the next
dependency to the function until all
dependencies have been fulfilled and the
final value is returned so we call
Carroll functions like this we call them
with the first argument with the name
which in turn will return a new function
which we call with this size which in
turn will return a new function which we
call with the elements which will return
the final value which we output here and
it's Karl is a large dragon that
breathes eyes and that is car people as
usual I would love to hear from you
either on Twitter at MP Jaime or in a
comment down below either just write
something nice or funny
tell me what you think could be made
better or tell me what you would like to
see me make a video about speaking of
which make sure that you don't miss the
next episode make sure that you
subscribe to the channel or follow me on
Twitter
until next Monday stay curious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
