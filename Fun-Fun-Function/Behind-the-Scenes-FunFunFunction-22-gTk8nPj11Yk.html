fun fun function today we are going to
do a little behind-the-scenes I'm gonna
show you how I make these videos because
I've gotten a lot of requests for that
lately and the thought of having more
people do programming youtubing on on
YouTube that excites me a lot because
this doing this channel has been it's
probably the best thing I have ever done
in my life it has been so beneficial to
my career it has been so rewarding and
the thought of bringing that to other
people that excites me a lot so I want
to I want to do something for the people
asking that I realize that this might
not be interesting to everyone on this
channel but if you are one of those I
suggest that you can come back next week
and watch the regularly scheduled
content or you can find one of the
previous episodes they own a lot of them
and find one that tickles your fancy I'm
gonna show you a lot of tooling and here
during this video and I really want to
stress that all this stuff is very
secondary to your process most important
thing with youtubing or any kind of
creation is to just get started just get
going don't spend time reading over gear
or language choice it's much more
important that you get started and get
time in with practice because that is
going to improve your filmmaking or your
programming way more than any gear will
do this is my handheld camera I will be
talking about this later so let me uh
give you a full sense of my setup here
you know what let me turn off those
so this is what it looks like the first
thing I want to talk about is this body
right here this is the most important
thing that you can spend money on this
is a blue Yeti mic this is the first
thing that I bought and I still think
that was a good first first investment
sound is just incredibly important and
it will do wonders for your videos ah
next up I want to talk about these these
things these are soft lights they are
just sheep supplies from the Swedish
equivalent of RadioShack there's nothing
special about these soft lights but as
you see they are very important so let
me turn them back on again to give you a
sense of so you see like huh from that
and there so that is why you have two of
them to the left here you can see that I
have a blackout curtain in front of my
window and I use this even though it is
it's and the reason I do this is that
daylight daylight is totally the best
light that you can have if you can place
your desk in front of the daylight that
is that is a great light however it's
often hard for you to position position
your recording gear so that it is so
that you get probed even daylight
especially if I if I turn these off
you'll see that I'm not getting a lot of
daylight and it's also uneven in my face
and what's more recording a video takes
a long time which means that you will be
the day the light will be changing while
you are recording so you your video will
be darker
darker overtime which is super annoying
so that is why I use one of those they
are really cheap you can get one at IKEA
for almost no money at all
it takes some it takes some time to get
used to having these in your face for a
couple of hours let me tell you that but
it's the name of the game I also use a
little bit of makeup powder because of
this the delight is so strong that it if
you have any kind of sweat of your face
it reflects like Christian you can just
go into any makeup store and tell them
about your problem and they will help
you speaking a little bit more about
blue Yeti you see here that I have these
this shaking like this ring that
protects it from vibration and it's also
on on an arm the arm and the shock
absorber are relatively new additions to
my videos they don't improve things that
much to be honest the reason I got them
was that the vibrations from me typing
well would propagate through the table
and into the into the microphone so
let's talk about my camera I got a lot
of comments asking oh you have such
great video quality what camera do you
use is one of those questions where the
person wants to know one thing why I get
so high video quality but they make an
assumption that this is related to the
camera so they ask something that is
completely irrelevant the reason I have
a good video quality is because of these
soft lights that is what creates the
good video quality D the camera does not
have much to do with it but either way
this is the camera this is a very old
EOS 550d I use this camera because I
have it this camera is an older version
of the the camera that basically all
youtubers use which is called the t6i i
think and that is used because it has
amazingly good optics for the
and it has a flip-out screen my camera
does not have a flip-out screen but I
get around that by having connecting it
to the computer and using the EOS
utility to position myself before I
start recording that's a bit cumbersome
but I just can't rationalize spending
hundreds of dollars on a new camera just
to get that the tripod I have is a piece
of that I bought for no money at
all I don't recommend it and in any way
it's actually pretty horrible but it you
know it does the job because my camera
sits in the same position all the time
so I never need to adjust it I spend a
lot of time adjusting it once on this
shitty tripod and there it sits so it's
fine I don't need another tripod because
I don't do a lot of adjusting the eos
line of cameras has a annoying annoying
aspect to them in that they can only
record for a certain amount of minutes
before they stop online it's like twelve
minutes and on some of the more
expensive variants like the 70d it's
thirty minutes but they stop I think
it's a mesh of legal and technical
reasons but either way that's the
limitation of them but it is very easily
to workaround by installing a custom
firmware on the camera called the magic
lantern which is amazing which basically
just when the camera goes out it just
bleeps and automatically restarts that
works fine for me because when I hear
the bleep if it's an in the middle of a
sentence I just stop and repeat that
sentence it's no problem at all anyway
that is how I record my face and my
voice let's talk a little bit about how
I record my screen I used mind node to
sketch out my episodes but that is not
what we are talking about today we're
talking about the technicalities of
making videos first of all I use a
software called uber layer to record or
not record but position this thing let
me get
and the reason I do this is so that I
can I can all sorry I need to change the
opacity of the uber layer making it less
transparent more transparent me so this
allows me to position the windows in a
nice way here and then this here to get
all the Crofts out of the way that I
don't think is relevant to the recording
and then I do the same thing where I my
position terminal and it's very
important with a huge-ass font or all
the people that are watching the the
episodes on their commute will be will
be annoyed usually I put this this
window here like I make it a little bit
bigger than the oh I want to point at
this this part here now
which brings me to most posts a
positioning terminal windows is evil
because otherwise they are too big or
they are too small so this is space here
right I have not figured out a good
solution for this yet it's ah so
annoying and this is gonna be tricky now
because I'm gonna try to show you how I
record this using using QuickTime
QuickTime you just pick new screen
recording and you see here that I am
recording here from the blue Yeti
directly into this this movie and that
makes for really really easy editing
later later oh this is inception either
way I focus please
I hit record I tend to just do this deep
so I get this approximately and then we
hit start recording and now it's
recording until I
escape to pull all this together
cropping the image and getting my face
in there and editing it I use Final Cut
Pro X if I was using Windows I would be
using Adobe Premiere some people have
asked me what to use if if you're using
Linux and the answer is don't use Linux
for video editing it's the same way you
don't use Mac's for gaming it's that's
not what it's good for when you have a
job pick the best tool for it don't pick
the tool first some of you might wonder
why I'm not doing this in a
screencasting software of that like
ScreenFlow I started out using
ScreenFlow actually and ScreenFlow works
great when you're using a webcam it's
really well adapted for that specific
use case if you're using a webcam and
you are recording your screen at the
same time and you're doing screen
recording things that is that is a great
use case but I am NOT using a webcam I'm
using a proper camera and that is really
important to me and for that
ScreenFlow it it's just a very bad
experience they yeah they just don't
consider that I know that I said in the
beginning of this episode that cameras
don't matter but there is a there is a
limit to that truth like if you're using
a webcam you're gonna feel limited I
started out using a webcam for this show
and I don't regret that it was good that
I got started and didn't postpone things
until I got a proper camera but it's
really annoying that you can't adjust
the the white balance of the camera so
you can decide what points are white
which means it kind of changes that all
the time as you move around so the
screen flickers and also you can't
change the focus so if I if I move
around and stuff the camera would like
try to adjust the focus it's like always
tied to autofocus and not manual focus
and like I'm using here and it was just
really annoying doesn't have to
be the most expensive camera this is
again just an old DSLR but it is a
proper camera you might say that
oh but does really the image quality of
your face matter isn't this about the
code isn't this about the content yes
it's partially about the content but I
think that it pays off to spend a little
time on lighting spend a little time on
making making your space look cozy
I want I want to have the audience feel
sort of like we're hanging out at a
friend's house doing a doing a weekend
coding project or something like that it
should feel personal I think it makes it
unnecessarily hard to relate to someone
if they use a crappy webcam and crappy
lighting and that's why ScreenFlow
doesn't work for me I need the external
camera therefore I use a combination of
QuickTime and Final Cut Pro X finally I
want to talk about this thing this
camera is insanely popular among
youtubers in general I've been starting
to do these walking talks where I just
walk around outside my home and chat
about programming stuff I started doing
them because I felt this a lot of times
where I just feel like talking I want to
talk about some soft subject because
programming is only to a very small
degree about coding often it's about
communication or thinking about problems
or reasoning and yeah not about code but
it's kind of boring to see someone just
talking to the camera in a room and I
think a lot better then I when I walk
around the first Walken talk that I did
I just used my my iPhone 6 that worked
out surprisingly well the both the
iPhone camera and the microphone is just
amazing for a phone but it's only the
back camera that is good so when you
film yourself you don't see how you're
angling the camera which makes it hard
to keep yourself in frame that is really
the only reason why I go
this it's because it has this flip out
screen which allows you to see yourself
I also have this cute little thing which
is a product called a micro muff to
protect against wind this is a great
little camera I but I only use it when I
move about when I'm at my desk I always
use the EOS because it it's a lot better
camera but it is bulkier and it doesn't
have this flip up screen and that's it
that's sort of the entirety of my setup
as it looks today if you have any
questions about things that I did not
cover please post them down below and I
will try to answer them the main reason
that I'm doing this video is because I
want more programmers to YouTube there's
not a lot of programming content on
YouTube which i think is kind of weird
and insane and I think that we could
make programming a really big part of
YouTube because the the combination just
makes sense there's a huge demand for
this I think that night my channel has
but it's so popular in such a short time
so I think that it clearly shows that
there is such a big man for programming
videos so if you're a person if you're
vlogging or if you're active in the
open-source community but you're
thinking about how can I extend my
repertoire in social media to do
youtubing please reach out to me like
I've got a makeup special email address
here don't send any other like if you're
looking for advice in general but not
YouTube I will not respond this is just
to help youtubers program in the YouTube
specifically because I really want this
programming community on YouTube to grow
so if you're a programmer indie thinking
AHA this youtubing sounds interesting
and get going get going this weekend
just to buy a microphone use your webcam
the first few times and see if you like
it and just get going just put something
out there I think that YouTube is such a
great way to teach other people and by
teaching other people also learn
yourself and I really think that we
could build a movement here on YouTube
so please join me in this and yeah well
I'm ranting
I'm mpj this is fun fun function until
next Monday morning stay curious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
