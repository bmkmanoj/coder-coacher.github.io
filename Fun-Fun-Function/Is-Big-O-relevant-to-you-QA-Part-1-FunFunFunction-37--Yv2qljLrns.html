watching fun fun functional normally I
have a specific subject on this show but
today as you're watching this I'm on
vacation so I'm mixing the orbit up flop
it
IES ask straight out of Twitter ask me
questions and I shall respond to them in
the next episode oh that's what I'm
doing now let's get right into it have
you tried Swift what do you think about
this language
I've only briefly tried Swift but I
think a lot of it feels really good it
feels like Apple is taking a lot of cues
from language developments that have
happened in the last few years and it
feels like they have done really nice
pragmatic programming language that's
modern and nice and a lot of my
colleagues around me speak highly of it
I also like the swift playground
announcement at WWDC where you have
basically a scratch like environment for
the iPad where kids can learn
programming using Swift where you move a
little character around that's that's
really nice now that Apple has
open-source it it allows the language to
move outside the boundaries of iOS I
have a lot of people using it that once
you start using it on the server-side
for instance I definitely think that
it's a language that is here to stay
what is your complete workflow machine
Iran on keyboard top five tools used for
coding organizing your life I don't
really have a static workflow I used to
but I no longer do that I try to be more
focused on exactly what it is I need to
get done and do that and not try to set
up these elaborate tool chains or or
to-do list systems in order to I might
make me more productive in the future I
used to do that a lot and I eventually
started found that I was doing that way
more than actually working or at least I
spent the time I spent off spent on it
didn't pay off so I
basically stop doing that I don't do
much to-do lists and stuff like that in
the same way I don't spend a lot of time
customizing my my tools I just use a
plain Adam I don't install any plugins
or stuff like that maybe one or two but
really that's it and I absolutely don't
use tools to manage tools like human and
stuff like that I think that stuff is
just crazy I elaborate a bit more on
this in the what editor do you use
Episode II what is your opinion on es7
what are the best and worst features I
have to Google this is salmon feature I
don't pay a ton of attention towards es7
until it has been ratified but there are
some things I like that I'd learned yes
now you but it's gonna have like this
includes function on array so you just
call array includes value in order to
check if a value is in the array because
right now if you want to do this
natively in JavaScript you just called
index ohm the value and check that is
not -1 and that yes doesn't look as good
and it doesn't this is a lot more
readable because it expresses the intent
a lot clearer I like this improvement it
just feels objectively better I also
like that they are expanding
destructuring into objects as well so
that you can if you haven't seen my
episode on destructuring can you can
fight and find it there but either way
you can like instead of using object
design there's a dot or dot operator
that you can use to mix objects together
Redux uses it a lot if you are not
familiar with redox yet are you living
your life wrong you should check out
west pass tutorial here a lot of people
are excited about the sinc wave
functions it allows you to write some a
synchronous code at-least simple a
synchronous code as as if it was
synchro's and I'm not too excited about
it because I feel like
promises you have to use promises in
order for this to work and if you know
promises the the cases where this can be
used or pretty simple to follow anyway
so I don't know I'm I don't care too
much other people excited about
decorators not super keen on decorators
because I they are a class feature and I
don't like classes and I don't think
that we should propagate classes that
much in JavaScript especially not like
these Java features it's my first small
view I am other people will disagree I
don't like them have you tried using Elm
I'm super interesting but I don't pay
too much mind
partly because it doesn't feel like it
has a strong corporate backing or I can
be going incision backing it and pushing
it and funding it and I feel that it's
necessary for me to even care the
ecosystem of a language is way more
important than the language itself so in
order for me to care about a language it
needs to have a like a sizable ecosystem
or at least the potential of having a
sizable ecosystem and I feel like L
missed struggling there at the moment I
pay more attention to languages like
Swift and engrossed because they have
like they are both pretty interesting in
good languages and they have a very
strong backing from the corporate
community when you encounter a bug in a
tool or framework that you use it blocks
your workflow what's your reaction do
you try to fix it for me that's a very
context sensitive question I if I'm very
focused on getting something done like
delivering a product at that moment and
getting that outdoor getting something
shipped then I will probably just create
a workaround it's extremely rare that a
bargainer in a tool actually genuinely
blocks you you generally can just wrap
something around it and work around it
only other hand if I'm in a situation
where people are a bit more calm there's
not a imminent deadline looming and you
know there's space
and if the library is something that we
use a lot and also anticipate using a
lot for the foreseeable future then it
might be a good idea to create a pull
request into that repository and and try
to get that in it's often pretty fun as
well to do that it gets you out of your
rut and your own products and it's
interacting with other programmers but
it's rare it's it's a lot more time to
get a fix into somebody else's code base
than it is to get into your own code
base so you know it's it's a trade-off
I'd love to hear thoughts on algorithms
and Big O notation and the relevancy
that it plays with in modern day web
development Big O for you that don't
know what Big O notation is it's
basically a way to write I like in a
standard way how how fast a function is
or how many operations it performs
related to the stuff that it gets in so
for instance let's say that we but it
always does the same thing no matter
what what it is that you put in for
instance something that gets in an array
and it checks the length of the array
and some other thing about the array and
returns something that means that it has
a constant time complexity and that is
how you you you express like this Oh
what it's constant on the other hand if
your function goes through the array and
does some operation on every item that
means that it would have an in time
complexity NS the length of the array so
this is a fancy way of saying that the
the longer the array is the more
computer time it will take but let's say
that we have a function that goes
through an array and for in every
iteration it also goes through the array
again so it's a let's say--let's it's a
for loop inside a for loop
that means that it will have n raised to
the N in time complexity in some cases
this can be really important in when
dealing with when performance good let's
say that this first case where we just
do a simple where there's just a for
loop inside of in a function and say if
we plot this like the more so this line
is gonna represent how much juice it
requires from your server form so if you
get in a one I to zero items it does
nothing it you get in one item it does
some some stuff and then as you get in
more more data it's going to do more
more operations this is linear
performance this is linear performance
because it plots like this this however
the the example that has a for loop
within the for loop so the time
complexity is n raised to the N this
performance is exponential and this is
very dangerous because when you get in
your items come at nothing but when you
get in one item it's going to like only
do one but then it's going to do like
two and then four and then eight and
then it's going to like it's going to
rake go more like this instead of this
this curve is its exponential one this
is linear if you have a server form that
looks like this this is no problem at
all because when you get more users you
can just throw more machine side it's
gonna be a troublesome amount of
machines at some point but it's pretty
manageable in this case however you will
not be able to throw more machines at
your problem because since this grows at
like your performance problems grows at
a much much faster pace
the more you items you put into it there
is no chance in hell that you're going
to be able to solve this problem by
throwing more machines
so this is very important in some cases
ah but there is a big hairy butt here
this is important for scalability and
scalability is not it's not the same
thing as performance it is just a field
of performance so if you're hiring a
developer that needs to deal with
scalability and like such a back-end
developer for your new startup which you
think will get an enormous load over
time then you need to have a person that
knows these things in and out however if
you're employing a front-end engineer
like somebody is that is going to write
your your interface like scalability is
not performance and a performance on the
front end is a very different beast I
don't think it's advisable to ask a
front-end engineer about Big O notation
because they might not have run into it
because that is not the kind of
performance consideration you run into
in in front end development
normally when you do in front-end
development you often deal with like
tens of thousands of items but you very
rarely deal with billions of items yet
but you might do on on the back end on
the front end it's more important to ask
for questions like do they know what a
flame graph is do they do probing
questions that see if they know how to
use the profiler and if they're
experienced with the profiler ask them
to talk about a performance problem that
they had in some application and and how
they solve it is of like good one that I
use basically when you're hiring a
person and you think about performance
you need to have a person that knows how
to reason about the performance of their
field so that they are able to solve
performance problems as they occur when
working on huge amounts of data such as
you do when you do back-end development
then Big O is is very useful but I don't
think I've ever used it on the front end
in those cases it's much more important
that the person knows how to
take any empirical approach and is the
Probot that's it for part one of these
questions and answers vacation addition
you have us watch an episode of fun fun
function I release these every Monday
morning this exercise will be different
but it's kind of like this you should
check out this channel below and some of
the other videos I am mpj until next
Monday morning thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
