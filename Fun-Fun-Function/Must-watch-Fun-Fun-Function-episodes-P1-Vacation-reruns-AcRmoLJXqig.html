this I am on vacation so the bad news is
that there it's not going to be a normal
function episode the good news is that
there is a big back catalog of unboxing
videos that you probably shouldn't watch
yet so I am recording these little
vacation updates with some suggestions
on videos that I think partially are not
watched enough I think and some that are
washed a lot but maybe you haven't
watched them yet the first video that I
would like to champion is entitled and
angling I've also put a link in the
actor description which is a video made
about like more than one year ago I
don't remember it was winter utley and
what prompted it was some medium post
that somebody made that I don't quite
remember what it was but it was this
dude that is he was so angry at some
open-source maintainer for fooling
people into using his his project and it
was it was just so horribly
entitled like this like he was treating
open-source project in but in his mind
he thought he found them at product that
like in his mind had put open-source
projects in the same place as he
approached McDonald's cheeseburgers or
something like that but this is
something that is supposed to work in a
certain way and you were here to service
me and like it was so weird he and I
made that video as a response to that
there was this was not yet this dude
this medium article had so many lights
and I asked I was like holy this
industry has
a very large amount of people that do
not understand what it means to be a
developer and I just felt that I really
needed to make a counter-argument to all
that entitlement and and anger that that
was in that that article and all the
people that obviously agreed with it and
recommended it the other video that I
would like to recommend is the one is
called too many tools and frameworks and
that is a video because there was a lot
of people and still are a lot of people
that experience something that is
already referred to as JavaScript
fatigue people and like your people have
trust feel frustrated that oh my god
it's so hard to keep up with the Joneses
so to speak if you don't know which
framework to pick and it feels like a
new framework is coming out at week
month and it is you feel over where and
I don't feel that and I just wanted to
talk about why I don't feel that and
push for instead of having this very
tooling centric mindset you should are I
have a problem centric mindset and that
is what that video is about so those are
my two tips for the week if you have
already watched those then perhaps you
could go and go just go to the fun part
function channel page and look through
all the videos and see something that
tickles your fancy or you could go out
and enjoy the nice warm sunny vacation
whether if you have vacations like me or
you know do something else either way I
hope you will have a fantastic morning I
will be putting up one of these tips
next Monday too so until next Monday
morning thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
