watching fun fun function javascript is
JavaScript is the most popular
programming language in the world but as
a JavaScript developer you are going to
hear a lot of grief from other
developers you are going to hear that
you are not using a real programming
language that you are buying into the
nodejs hype and that javascript is
flawed the people saying this will then
say that they are sticking to their
language it's because language acts is
well-designed and does not have all the
flaws that javascript does and more
often than not they are right their
language X is pretty great but
javascript is way more popular does a
language need to be popular couldn't we
use it anyway couldn't you even argue
that it's better if it's not popular
there is this saying in the Haskell
community that you should avoid avoid
success at all costs because when a
language becomes popular change becomes
slower for example because javascript is
so popular we have to be super careful
with backwards compatibility for
instance in ECMO script 6 var has been
replaced with let pro tip you might want
to check out the other fun fan function
episode on the left and Const keyword by
by clicking in the upper right corner
and the eye or the episode description
what we cannot actually clean out var
from the language because there is
simply too much existing code out there
that relies on VAR b in there so a
popular language moves slower but the
popular language also has the bizarre
power of a big ecosystem PHP for
instance is a very problematic
programming language but it is still
surprised
singly effective because the ecosystem
is so vast every problem of the language
is so well documented and has tools to
fix it and no matter how much grief the
language causes you the extreme amount
of tooling available in the ecosystem
just makes up for that so people stick
to PHP and even if that wasn't true I
would only do that if you build
something good if you have a good
language it is your moral obligation to
make it popular as a creator you should
bring your creation to as many people as
possible what good is the cure for a
disease if it's just sitting in a lab
somewhere or maybe as curing a few
people you need to actually get it out
in order to have a real impact on the
world this is one of my favorite quotes
if you want to go fast go alone if you
want to go far go together so why do
some technologies become popular because
if you look at the most popular
programming languages in the world
like the top list uh the list seems
almost random some of the top languages
can be considered well-designed one some
yes seem to be there it seems like there
is something else than just being well
this sign that determines if a language
becomes popular or not there's an
awesome book called stumbling on
happiness I've linked it in the
description in which the author talks
about something that they call a super
replicator and a super replica it refers
to an idea that is a vehicle for itself
and example that they use in the book is
the societal belief that children will
bring you happiness
it's a generally held belief in society
that Parenthood will bring you happiness
which turns out to be at least
statistically incorrect there's a lot of
positive aspects so having children but
happiness is not one of them
studies show that happiness is inversely
correlated with having children at home
so why do we as a society
do you believe this well it's pretty
simple people in society that believed
that children would bring them happiness
of course went ahead and had children
and the people that did not believe that
children would bring them happiness were
a lot less likely to have children
and over the course of generations while
the people that believed that children
would make you sad oh yes now gone that
is one way in the book called a super
replicator and super replicators make me
think about angular but before I talk
about angular what do you think of this
camera position it's slightly higher
than it used to be so it's more like I'm
speaking to you rather than speaking
down
to you a fun fact is that I did this
because Paul Irish PM me on
Twitter told me that I should and if
Paul Irish tells you to do something you
do it if you don't know who Paul Irish
is you are error and you should watch
this video so anyway
angular I believe my theory is that
angular succeeded for two reasons one is
credibility and two is high switching
costs when angular first arrived on the
scene it got a lot of traction because
it was credible because angular was
perceived as backed by Google in
practice Google wasn't all that much
into it but it was still enough for a
lot of organizations to adopt it and the
more big organizations that started
using angular the more credibility they
added to angular and the more
organizations started using it and so on
besides credibility angular also has
very high switching costs it's really
really hard to switch from angular to
something else angular is not like react
it's not like a module that you put into
your app angular is the app and whenever
you need to do something with angular
you need to get the
and you learn - something on NPM this is
like practice for everything like if you
need to use local storage there is
angular local storage it's like in Japan
where there's like Hello Kitty milk
instead of just milk if you use angular
you are never getting out so my theory
is an angular is popular because it has
this credibility loop and these high
switching costs Java Script replicates
like crazy because of the apes
JavaScript engine that Google made when
v8 was released it was a huge jump over
other JavaScript engines at the time now
the speed of v8 meant that Google had a
pretty good edge over its competitors so
the competitors had to invent engines
that were faster than v8 which in turn
forced v8 to become faster and so on
which led us to the current day where we
have not one but four major and mature
and super fast javascript engines
competing for domination no other
scripting language has this it's unique
to JavaScript and it's such a boon these
simians are crazy fast for a weakly
typed language in some cases javascript
code runs as fast as the equivalent
written in c++ it's just crazy but not
only that these things are also open
source which allow JavaScript to be
embedded into anything not just browsers
so anyone that wanted to create
something programmable could put this
robust and fast and free programming
environment scripting environment that
almost anybody knew how to use into
their thing for free and that is what
made JavaScript popular on the server
side I know in Internet of Things
devices in addition to browsers but
angular and Pa that seems like this
happened organically it's anybody right
now making technology popular with
intent I think so and I think
is rust the programming language rust I
think that we have a lot to learn from
rust when it comes to designing and
popularizing programming languages and
technologies okay here's my list of five
things that I think that rust does
extremely well that will help it a lot
with adoption rust tries to replace C++
and it does it in a way that appeals to
existing developers by sort of embodying
C++ best practices in the form of a new
language to is that rust has learned
from NPM and has included a package
manager and it's the only recommended
package manager so good
three rust is backed by authority it is
the language of Mozilla for rust has a
free ebook that is pushed on the website
as your first exposure to rust and the
bonus is that it's really friendly to
you if all you know is JavaScript the
rust looks familiar
rust don't have some very novel ideas
about how to do programming but it
doesn't look weird if you are as C++ or
Java Script developer and you look at
rust for the first time it looks sort of
what you're used to rust has the good
sense to piggyback on top of existing
knowledge and that makes it very easy to
pick up like if you compare this to say
Haskell or Clojure it just they just
start looking like something that is out
of Stargate Atlantis I know I said five
but I'm thinking six - like rust has an
amazing community the community of rust
it consists of all like almost
exclusively of real people
it is amazing everybody is so nice and
helpful rust good stuff check it out in
summary popularity is important because
of ecosystems and popularity comes from
spread ability not from quality
now I don't want anyone to make a
strowman out of this you need to have
quality of course but you cannot rely on
it to spread your software for you
that's the message here so if you're
thinking about developing a language or
a library or if you just browsing around
trying to find out which library to
learn next don't dismiss popularity as
something for the sheep is just it's
just hype but instead really think about
how the thing that you are building fits
into the industry and how it can spread
