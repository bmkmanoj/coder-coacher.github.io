particularly now that you're doing FFF
full-time it's hard to as a chore to
leave work at work
ooh okay I actually got this space like
away from my home like specifically for
that purpose that and having people
around to serve food socialize with I
running your own company tends to eat
you up a little bit I the way that I
manage it is mostly by scheduling things
after work like having a cup of coffee
with a person or just having to go
somewhere after work that it's schedule
that where somebody expects you if I
don't I just tend to like draw long I'm
not really more effective it's just that
the day becomes diluted and until the
evening it just sucks I'm a huge fan of
time boxing and keeping like rolling
projects in to a certain time and waling
it off and in order to make yourself
more effective if I just allocate an
entire day to a project I just feel like
I just start the day by surfing the
internet for two hours it's just better
just squeeze it in question for both of
you in chat please share with me any
other damn streamers inoue yes please do
I also host some people but please feel
free to like write them shoppin tell
people OFF still using for maduro time
up during your day yes I use a software
called breath time it's not per se a
Pomodoro timer but it just locks my
screen
after every 20 or 40 minutes whatever
time units are used depends on how much
energy I have during a day and how
boring the tasks I have or if I'm do
Texas and stuff like that I actually
just lower it to be like 10 minute
increments just convince myself oh come
on you can do just 10 minutes and 40 is
more when the things that just require a
lot of startup time like complicated
programming and writing scripts and
stuff like that but yeah I really
enjoyed the Pomodoro Technique it's
super nice the right time is a great app
for that
