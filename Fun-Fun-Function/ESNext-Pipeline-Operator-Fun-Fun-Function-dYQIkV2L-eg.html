to explore the concept of pipeline pipes
is absolutely not a new concept it's
built into the UNIX command prompt and
it's very much part of that whole
ecosystem and how things work it's also
a language with feature and built into
the syntax of f-sharp Oh camel Alexei
realm julia live script has it as well
there is a proposal to add the pipeline
operator to JavaScript but the dependent
operator really is just some nice
syntactic sugar so you can implement
pipelines in JavaScript very equally
yourself and that we're going to do that
today pipe life is really not so much
language feature or or a technique as it
is a way of of thinking about data
processing and I want to spend a little
bit of time exploring that that as well
that is what we're going to explore
today I am mpj and you are watching fun
fun function before we do anything else
is like to quickly show you what the
pipeline operator is in order to do that
we need some kind of an example function
let's imagine that we have a capitalized
function oh we don't need to imagine it
because I just pasted it so this this is
very straightforward what it does is
that it takes a string it takes the
first character of the string and makes
it an exit upper case let me use it for
you so that you are completely with me
ah cap better life and I need to say
hello and we take that out and it's
hello
but with the first character made big
big what the pipeline operator allows us
to do is to call functions with a single
argument in a different way all right so
I'm going to under this write the
equivalent call using the pipeline
operator instead so I do
all right the string first and then I
write the the pipeline operator and then
I write capsule
here like that you won't see the
executed here because it's not part of
the language yet but but that's all it
does
this has some implications and we're
going to dive into those in a little bit
but first I would like to talk in
general about functional programming
I've mentioned this before on the show I
feel that the more functional
programming I do the better my habits as
a programmer becomes the thing that I
like about functional programming is
that it gets to the core of what
programming is I feel that when I'm
doing functional programming a lot of
the sluff that is in programming is
shaved away at its core a computer takes
a piece of data and transforms it into
another piece of data and a function a
pure function a function with no side
effects a function that just takes the
value and transforms it into another
value and does nothing else that is a
great analog for what what computers are
in object-oriented programming it feels
like there is like object orientation is
an abstraction of this data
transformation and then there are
abstractions made on top of that
abstraction and at some point it just
becomes these weird abstract factory
 that you're you're building and
you're so far away from the actual data
processing that you just can't you can't
reason about it there's absolutely a lot
of abstraction in in functional
programming as well and you can do
absolutely horrible things there as well
but it feels to me that it lends itself
less to do that it just feels like
functional code is closer to the actual
concept of data processing it just to me
feels more natural to what it is that a
computer program does and I also say
this I realize that it sounds vague
maybe the example that we're going to
look at will give you an idea of what
I'm talking about and maybe it won't
we'll see but that is the way I feel at
least about
programming before we proceed I would
like to bring in two more sample
functions let me delete this for now and
then bring in two new friends so double
say let me show you what these does
which is called X and then double double
double thing and let's just say hello
what does what does that give us it
gives us hello hello and if I do X
exclaim and it just gives us hello with
an exclamation mark because the
screencast has a limited amount of space
I would like to refactor these into
arrow functions also because I just like
arrow functions alright cool as you see
when you have these single line
functions that have just one argument if
you just lends itself very very well to
two arrow functions oh I forgot to X
that variable this thing I'm doing where
I'm replacing the variable with X in
these short functions that is a personal
preference I really like it
but a lot of people don't I I like it
because I feel it is sort of like using
pronouns and sentences in English for
instance if I ask a friend of mine where
did you put the key he can reply I put
it on the table instead of saying I put
the key on the table oh no my OCD sense
is tingling this double quotes needs to
be replaced with single quotes they're
satisfied as I said before programming
is a lot about data processing or
transforming data into other data and
it's also about composing things like
making things modular so these three
functions here oh oh my these hover
tooltips does anybody know how to
disable them what is the flag to disable
these these hover tooltips I have tried
to find it I just can't I
so dumb anyway let's try not to trigger
that all right so let's bring this back
to pipelines these three are free
functions here they are these small
isolated components like modules of
logic this is the nice thing about
functional programming when you have
these these isolated parts that we can
compose and by compose I mean that we
can use them together in different ways
even though they are not at all aware of
the existence of each other the reason
why we can compose them is is really yes
that they are very simple and they are
pure ok so let's see us double say this
thing first and then we also can a
device that and then we exclaim it and
it says hello hello and this is the way
functional programming is supposed to
feel like it's just these small little
parts that are very simple that you
slot together and this works because the
function is a very simple contract it
just take some values and returns a
value and does very few things if these
were classes with complicated interfaces
coming from different sources it just
wouldn't work to do this it yes it works
because functions are simple however
when you look at this it just feels a
little bit unnatural we should not try
to write code that looks like English
but it's kind of nice if it reads in a
in a way that feels natural if I say
this out loud I go exclaim capitalized
double say hello it it's kind of weird
because the way we are saying it is not
the actual way it's being executed it
would be more natural if the the code
actually read
like what is happening in the order that
is it's happening so it would be better
if it said something like I'll take
hello and then double say it and then
capitalize it and then exclaim it
because that is what is happening so
let's let's write a pipeline function by
replying pipe beeline pipe and we want
it to look like this we wanted to have a
want to take the functions in sequence
then exclaim and then we would like to
call it with hello so what we want the
type line to do is to return a new
function that has composed these three
functions into a new function a pipeline
that yes takes a value at the starting
then just types it through all of these
functions and returns whatever comes out
at the end I'm not sure how to do about
this let's say function pipe line and
pipeline should take some of functions I
guess and we want it to return another
function that takes take the value that
we want to transform first you can we do
this recursively that would be fancy
let's see func
take the first function and then call it
with the value now there is a time and
place for recursion and I think that
this does not lend itself super well
let's just do a four and we're going to
call the function with the value and
we're gonna do create a value for lost
computed loss
the salt look a sign that there and now
we want to call this with left for salt
well like this last result or the value
and then we want to return the last
result I think did I work I think it did
my god
so what you see here having a pipeline
function having access to that makes it
a little bit more natural to write these
things it we can now read the code from
like left to right top to bottom like
the first thing that happened is that it
doubles as the then it capitalizes then
it explains well we still have the hello
at the end but it's still a bit better
by the way we don't have to write the
pipeline function I just wrote it right
now because I want to show you that
there's not much magic involved you can
instead use a functional library like
Ram de we're going to do that cons are
required lambda and then we can use use
is our pipeline instead I think this
Python if you just point
oh it spike and then you know I can
remove this one we are added I just
wanted to show a little bit of the power
of composition because these things are
capitalized that feels like a very
general thing it feels like general to
humanity these things things specific to
our application but maybe there is there
is a library that has that it just
becomes like require low - I action all
hang on I need to import that create
into the terminal and install low -
note that all right now we have low -
and instead of doing using this
capitalise we just use the capitalise of
of low - hang on
and I cannot delete Caroline and lower
the whole it still works and again the
reason why this works so seamlessly is
that these functions are very simple
they are both simple in sense that they
are just plain functions they are not a
classes with some specific interface
that you have doing sin shade or
anything they are just a plain function
that takes a value and returns a value
and it does very few operations on it
and it doesn't have any side effects
it's a very simple transform function
capitalize here is just a plain simple
pure function and that makes it
remarkably riu SFIL and composable the
more skeptical of you might be thinking
right now okay but these are all
functions that take a single argument
how does this play where the functions
that have have multiple arguments so you
like some let's let's do that let's say
that there existed a a function that was
called it's just cons append and the it
appended it character so it's the a
generic version of exclaim but you can
expend any anti character so we it has
two arguments it has the string and it
has the know it has the character and it
has the string so it takes a string and
it append that the character that's what
it does so that we we replace this well
Panch or mark and then the string and
then we have left low and now it we
imagine that exclaim does no longer
exist we just have a
Hanjour which is the function that takes
two arguments we can't just paste that
in because that becomes super weird so
how do we provide a Penn char with this
this first argument well there this is
where arrow functions comes to the
rescue and I'm going to X and I'm going
to do a pinch our exclamation mark and
then X that's the way you do it some
examples like to use lodash for this
like oh now it becomes really confusing
that this is named low - little just use
the proper name of the library there
like to use the little use the low - as
the the variable name I'm not sure what
I think about that it kind of makes it
look like a a form that hasn't been
filled out which I like but mmm I I'm
more of an X X kind of guy I think let's
delete this exclaim function we no
longer need it so perhaps now you are
seeing like why pipelines is an
interesting way of programming or
perhaps you don't and you have left what
the pipeline operator does is allow us
to do this in the language without
writing our pipeline function or without
pulling in a library like Ram de having
it built into the language also slightly
not just people towards this way of
programming because it has it becomes
slightly more accessible and all it's
also putting it into the language gives
it a certain sign off as well to do it
but either way let me show you what it
would look like with the pipeline
operator let's remove Ram de and we're
going to take low and we're going to put
it at the start and then we're going to
write a pipeline operator we're going to
take double say
put it active at pipeline operator right
a new pipeline operator take low -
capitalize put it here then go to right
third pipeline operator and we're going
to take the final one put it there and
then we're done so these are showing up
as errors because this feature does not
exist yet in JavaScript it's just a
proposal but this is the syntax that the
proposal is suggesting it also happens
to be the syntax in many of the
functional language is that that uses it
and let me paste in the RAM that example
so that you can compare them side by
side I think that this syntax is very
nice it shows very clearly that we are
taking hello and then we are piping it
to double say and then we are piping
that value to low - capitalized and then
we're piping that value to this function
which appends the character exclamation
mark I like this proposal a lot one
could of course have many objections to
this for one thing it adds yet another
thingamabob to the JavaScript
specification yet another thing in the
language making it slightly harder to
learn then on the other hand I see like
very far gone proposals to add things
like private properties to two classes
and we I don't I think that since we're
pulling in if we're pulling in stuff
from the object-oriented oriented
languages I think that it's it's not an
unhealthy thing to pull in features
really good features from solid
functional languages functional
programming is not the end-all be-all of
programming but I think that it's safe
to say that we are looking at an
industry a little bit too much at
object-oriented programming and a little
bit too too little at at functional
programming I think it's healthy to pull
few functional
what do you think about the pipeline
operator right
hey comments that is it for today you
have yet to watch an episode of fun fun
function I release these every Monday
morning Oh 800 GMT if you don't want to
wait until next Monday morning you can
check out this machine learning
surprised that YouTube I selected for
you I am mpj until next Monday morning
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
