day of my vacation so next the exit next
week is going to be the more normal
episodes are rather than these vacation
updates I think is that this week are
being the last day of my vacation
I would like to yes do I can laid-back
questions and answers so I asked ask you
on Twitter what what kind of questions
you would like me to answer and draw
here we go
Frisco Miranda asks do you play video
games if so which games do you play in
which consoles do you own have you ever
considered game development I do play a
lot of games I play at a less than I
used to
I own an Xbox I and I have our pre
decent gaming computer but I don't I
have it connected to my TV so I kind of
use it as a console to be honest my
lease Miley I'm absolutely favorite
genre is open-world games I can't handle
that
at all because I'm this person I'm a
huge completionist so whenever there is
a game where there's a main story and
then there's like these thousands of
little side quests that you can do I
just get caught up in them and feels
like I'm not completing the game unless
I complete them but I'm not enjoying
doing the side quests because the side
quests tend to not have as much
production quality as the main story for
instance now I'm playing a bat Emma or
Arkham Knight and there's this annoying
side quest thing where you pick up these
green symbols and it's just oh I just I
think my favorite kind of games nowadays
are actually these really story intense
short games over the years I'm kind of
becoming more and more aware of my own
mortality becoming bolder reading into
the Stoics and I just figure that like I
don't want to spend a hundred hours
grinding side quests and open-world
games the most recent really good game
experience I had was so much which is
this horror kind of game from the
creators of amnesia it's scary but it's
it also has a really great story and has
a really nice philosophical questions
posed as forgetting into game
development
I was actually close once I applied to
massive one summer but I invite I don't
quite remember why I decided against it
I just I probably just south of the game
development industry felt a little bit
toxic a lot of very long hours and
sacrificing yourself for the job and
stuff like that and I guess yeah I mean
I like to work but I also believe that
rejuvenation and recuperation is
absolutely necessary in order to be a
good creative professional your time
years can't be spent on 100% output</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
