exploring error handling I'm going to be
talking about how you shouldn't swallow
errors by doing crash reporting inside
on functions instead we're going to look
at how you can let errors propagate up
to the interface by jesus promises I am
mgj and you are watching funfun function
when I first started using promises I
tend to write things that look a little
bit like this okay so what does this
code do and what are problems with it I
will tell you but if you want you can
pause the video now and think a little
bit about it on your own first
okay so let's walk through what delete
tap done so it calls a delete method
here on the database object that we get
from somewhere this is fictional code
deal with it as we see here ah delete
seems to be returning a promise using
the promise here are the code is going
to log to the console whether or not the
tap deletion succeeded what the code
does here is crash reporting what I mean
by that is that it will inform testers
and developers that something has gone
wrong but you know who will not be
notified the user
let me edit this code so that I fit
properly on screen here
I think move it code down at it too the
problem with this code is that if
something goes wrong here the user will
not actually be notified that the
calculation failed
if the delete cat operation fails there
is really no nice graceful way to the
sort for the software to to handle that
error the only thing I can think of is
to have some kind of weird mechanic
where the delete operations are
automatically retried or something but
that seems really weird so the more
realistic thing here is that we need
some way for this code delete tab to
notify it the higher level code the code
that is calling them in tab that the
operation has failed and this is
something that promises solve for you
very easily by the way if promises are
completely new to you you might want to
check out my video on promises here a
link to that is also in the episode
description back in the day when I was
writing code like this I was missing out
on one of the most useful aspects of
promises in this code here I am
basically just using promises as
glorified callbacks in this code I'm not
making use of the fantastic capability
of promises that is that they can be
returned and passed around let's pause
for a bit and think about the concept of
a promise not the JavaScript concept but
the the real-life concept of a promise
I realize examples are I recently bought
an apartment when you do that at least
here in Sweden you go to the bank and
you get something called a loan promise
no the promise is actually its real name
if you do a direct translation from
Swedish basically you show up at the
bank you show them and prove to them how
much you earn that your credit check you
tell them what kind of apartment you are
shopping for in what area what price
range and the bank provides you with a
loan promise they promise you that given
these conditions they will lend you this
amount of money you don't actually have
the money you don't actually have a loan
but you have this promise normally
holding that promise you can kind of
start acting like you actually have the
loan you can go and bid on apartments
with this thing this promise promises in
JavaScript what sort of the same way but
before I talk about that I would like to
address the fact that this Friday the
patreon for wonderful function launched
and asked on recording we are over 800
patient ah that's insane I expected it
to take months to reach this level and
we did it in 48 hours we are now in the
top 20 in the education category on
patreon
this Friday was so intense ah it was one
of the best days in my life in a very
long time so if you are patron thank you
so much if you are not a patron and you
are curious about the walks and the why
of becoming a patron for fun fun
functions you can go to
patreon.com/scishow
or just click here where would I go yeah
promises in JavaScript they work sort of
like my real life loan promise when we
call database database doesn't delete
here in this code it returns the promise
of a delete operation so it doesn't
return a success or a failure it returns
the promise of success if you wanted a
courageous queue that has a watch my
video on monads you know that promises
or Moana you really don't have to watch
that video or know about monads
in order on attendance but if this is
happens to be a very good example of
what monads conceptually are so promise
it's not the success itself it's the
promise is actually more like an
abstract concept that allows us to act
as if we had success it's similar to how
I could use my loan promise to buy an
apartment I could go to people and say
given that my known promise resolves to
an actual loan I will buy this apartment
and they would say why are you speaking
like a robot but this video is not about
success it is about failure promises do
not always resolve to success they
sometimes are rejected with an error
perhaps my bank is big on semicolons and
they watch my youtube channel and they
go like screw you you standard jazz
hippie nothing likely but it could
happen
and this is why promises in JavaScript
can be rejected and that is very very
useful but only if you actually
return Providence and let them roam free
instead of trapping them inside your
functions like I've done here look now
what happens if I remove the handler yes
submitted and I return the promise
unless that get out of the function and
just imagine that we have a click
handler that's all right so check out
this delete button click handler that
are your cemented always unique events
there as well so it grabs the cat ie
here from the fake elements the
officious ball element here and what is
then does is that Copley's catch it gets
the promise because we are now getting
the promise here and here it will handle
the success and remove the item element
from the page using the cat ID and and
if we get an error to catch that and
it's going to show a message message
message dialog where it says that item I
can this cap here swappigans probably
was was not delete it notice here how
the delete button click handler is in a
much better position to handle the error
than the previous example because this
live in the UI layer where we need to
present the user with with information
about the deletion failures and the
reason why we can pull this off now is
because the lead cap doesn't swallow the
error from the data distillation inside
of itself it returns me the promise so
that it can propagate up to the to the
UI this is a very simplified example
this is just one layer in a real
software you would have multiple layers
of this with that just kept returning
promises but it's really the exact same
principle so what I'm trying to say here
is
if you are not able to great totally
gracefully handle the error that happens
inside your function you should let that
error propagate up to the higher level
the calling calling code so that that
code can a deal deal with it if it if it
likes or you crash reporting if it's at
the top level don't do tragic reporting
inside of functions let promises
propagate up and let the top level code
deal with the crash reporting I want to
make a shout out because this episode
was kind of like the brainchild of my
ex-colleague philippe as x45 i've linked
his twitter handle in the episode
description you should follow him
because he has a lot of interesting
source like this you have just watched
an episode of fun fun function I
released leaves every Monday morning
Oh 800 DNC if you don't want to wait
until next Monday morning you can check
out this episode right now that robots
are selected for your viewing pleasure
I am mvj until next Monday morning thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
