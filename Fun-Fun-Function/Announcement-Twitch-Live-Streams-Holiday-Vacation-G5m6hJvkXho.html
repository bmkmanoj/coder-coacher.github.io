today is almost the last you'll see of
me before Christmas because I'm going to
be a good person and take a proper break
so that I can gather energy and return
to the year of 2018 with new energy so
the next episode of the unit testing
series is going to be on January 8th
however your holidays are not going to
be completely fun fun functioned less
because if you have not noticed yet I
have started which live streaming live
streaming what's up with that mpj well
the live streams are something that I do
where the you the audience where I sit
around a program on a little project of
mine the project is actually not too
important it's just be coding around and
me being interrupted by your questions
and thoughts on the channel maybe about
the thing that I'm coding maybe a
tangent from that or maybe something
completely different like it's not a
very productive stream code wise it's
more about hanging out and discussing
programming concepts and sometimes
productivity is sometimes creativity is
sometimes psychology in sometimes yes
life in general so fun fun function the
YouTube channel is very much about me or
teaching you something that I've learned
before the video but the the twitch
livestream is much more about me
learning while I am doing something and
also about talking with you having a
debate with you so when do these streams
happen well I have not quite set a
schedule for them yet but the next one
and the final one before Christmas is
home is this Thursday at 4 p.m. 1600
hours in the GMT time zone and you can
find the stream on twitch.tv slash fun
fun function if you want to know too
when I go live you can install the
twitch app on your phone the live stream
is free for everyone and so is
interacting in the chat but if you are a
patron on the five dollar plus here or
more you get access to live stream
recordings so that you can enjoy the
stream in the comfort of your own time
zone in conjunction with this I am also
announcing a new type of video on the
fountain function YouTube channel
because sometimes on the stream one of
my ramblings are oddly coherent and then
they turn out to be pretty good
highlights Friday morning highlights
that's a new video it's released at the
same time in the morning as the fun fun
function videos but they are shorter and
they're more relaxed and just an outtake
from the stream and they are released on
Friday mornings and those will be
released even during the holidays they
are oh so nice they are scheduled to
automatically be released while I am
gone all right that's all I wanted to
say make sure that you tune in on
Thursday 1600 hours GMT that is 4 p.m.
for you Americans you can find the
stream on twitch.tv slash fun fun
function or in the twitch app if you are
otherwise engaged at that time there's
always a live stream recording steer on
the fun fun function patreon or if live
streams are not your thing at all we
will be returning to our ordinarily
scheduled programming
programming on January 8th I am mpj
until the stream on Thursday stay
curious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
