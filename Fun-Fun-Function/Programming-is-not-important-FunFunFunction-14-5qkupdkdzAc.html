morning show where we try to become more
excited and confident about programming
by exploring old wisdom while ideas and
having fun so I do realize the irony
when I say that today I want to talk
about how I try to remember that
programming isn't really important it is
solving problems for people that is
important I'm trying out doing this here
episode walking outside partially
because I really needed to get out of
the house since I started youtubing I
have watched a lot of videos where
filmmakers talk about what kind of
camera gear they use it is remarkably
similar to how programmers show other
programmers how their tooling setup
works and how they work with a certain
framework and stuff but there is one
very very interesting difference they
almost always start out by saying that
it doesn't matter what camera you're
using you don't need a fancy camera to
make a good movie what matters is the
story that you're telling over over the
last few months I have developed a
serious man crush on a guy called Casey
nice - Casey Neistat is a scary
productive videographer hidden HBO show
a couple of years ago and he now does
this amazing video blog that he posts
every single day at 8 a.m. sharp
case is interesting because it's he he
often says that he doesn't like video
production
he likes telling stories and video
production is just a way for him to do
that for example he uses a Final Cut Pro
X to edit his videos and it's a tool
that he is constantly frustrated with
and feels limited by but he doesn't want
to take time away from making movies
just in order to learn a new piece of
software I am at this every time I
start a new project I end up being
frustrated with some part of my tooling
and I am hope
starring the sub-project within the
project where I where I start creating
it a new piece of tooling it takes away
time from the main project but I
rationalize it and say that well it's
gonna save me time in the long run
but while the tooling question often
makes me a little bit more effective it
is in no way even close to making up for
the time that I spent making the tool
Hey look at this it is it is slightly
smaller than my last apartment in
Stockholm I don't want to put this down
too much I mean somebody has to create
tools get low - rails and Express and
whatnot these are all tools that I've
used or or used today and I enjoy them
and I appreciate that somewhere along
the line somebody
yes went I am NOT going to take the
shortest route to solving this problem
using existing tools no I am going to
spend hundreds of hours creating
something that is slightly better a new
solution and I'm going to share it with
everyone I appreciate that and I and I
benefit from the fruits of that labor I
do but I noticed that I have this
tendency to over glorify the the
development organizations of Twitter and
Facebook and and Google because they
have these all these popular frameworks
that are used by people and bootstrap
and angular and and react and I don't
want to put that down again I don't want
to put that down but oh how do I put
this they're not the best examples of
companies delivering actual innovation
tortured at consumers anymore Google has
not created a product like Adsense or
Gmail for a very long time
hangouts that's an acquisition facebook
Messenger that's an acquisition Tesla
uber Square slack snapchats oculus
Airbnb we need to remember that the most
interesting stuff created nowadays it
isn't created inside of the tech giants
I think that we as programmers could be
a little bit better at
glorifying or giving some love to
programmers that are very good and
productive at making Jennifer for lack
of a better word real things not not not
just developer tooling I think a great
example of such a programmer is Jonathan
Blow he's the creator of braid which is
which is an amazing game but what is
more amazing is that he made it almost
single-handedly in three years which is
amazingly productive considering the
quality and scope of the game Jonathan
Blow is definitely a person that does
something right when it comes to
producing software I have referred to
this before but I really think that you
should listen to his talk how to program
independent gates it is he thinks about
programming up in a pretty different way
and he made me question a lot of the
assumptions that I have or on
programming so the moral of this snowy
and cold and damp brand is that try to
be more excited about the problem that
you are solving rather than your craft
because while programming is important
and awesome it is just a tool as usual
the next episode of fun fun function
will be released on Monday morning o 800
GMT time do not miss it watch it for
breakfast until next Monday morning stay
