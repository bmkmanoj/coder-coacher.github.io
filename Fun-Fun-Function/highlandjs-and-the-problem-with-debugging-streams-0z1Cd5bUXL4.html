screaming interface and which I dropped
I was really into Highland at the moment
it was Highland jeaious like I really
liked programming with streams it's
conceptually streams are really nice to
deal with but the problem with them is
that because of their nature you lose
access to the to the stack trace like
you loser and it kind of doesn't give
you anything to replace the stack trace
for debugging purposes it just stops you
know like and it just becomes the stack
trust becomes this garbled and what's
worse is that Kyla uses the note stream
semantics which has this concept of back
pressure so which means that a stream
doesn't really do anything unless you
connect it to another streams that sucks
values out of that screen so if you
don't have suction nothing happens which
is super tricky because when you just
find yourself in a situation where
nothing happens in your program ah
debugging that is really hard because
you have no idea where things are
breaking because nothing's it's nothing
exposed it's really hard to fill your
heart while acting but yeah I I have big
hopes for streams as a programming
concept but we need better tooling for
that so this is basically what we're
going for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
