watching fun fun function you are
watching part three of the let's code
and editors series where we code an
editor or well a fiddle really there's
really no need to watch the previous
episodes in order to understand this one
you can really just jump in straight
away we're just having fun but if you do
want to watch them from the beginning
there is a link to the playlist up there
and in the episode description if you
have followed funfun function for a
while you know that I am a tooling
alcoholic and this project is me going
on a spree not only am i in this series
building a tool and editor no I am
inside of the tool building another tool
and messaging bus in order to make this
project easier to unit test that's what
we did last week it is this messaging
bus that we stick in between our
dependencies that we need to mock input
from and our code on the other side I've
had this messaging bus in the project
for a little while but it was written
merely as a consequence of the test so
doesn't really have any test itself and
it's a bit wild groan so last week we
rewrote it from scratch using tests
first principles since the last episode
I have added some more functionality to
it so I think it's ready to try to
integrate into the app in replacement of
the of the old bus so that is what we're
gonna do today I'm not sure what to call
that in order to make it good and click
maytee I was thinking of masturbatory
refactoring because that is let's be
honest what we're doing here but that
might give people the idea that this
episode is more exciting than it really
is so I'm thinking that I'm going to
call air
okay roughly coupe the refactoring my
worst title yet ow
oh alright so let's get this train wreck
going let's run the test and p.m. test
but buddy puppy poop oh no fun run off
okay
oh past what we're gonna do is that
we're gonna walk through module by
module and replace the old bus in that
module with the new bus and when I say
module I'm just using developer weasel
words oh I have to talk about this for a
little while because it's my favorite
new thing ah maybe so we saw words
weasel words is actually a term that
Wikipedia coined or at least that's
where I heard it first it's one of the
ways and Wikipedia articles can be
flagged in the same way that are like an
article lacks citations it can also
contain a lot of weasel words and weasel
words or turns that sound like they mean
anything and and see important and
specific but actually mean nothing at
all weasel words like they add a sense
of authority to whatever you're saying
without you actually having to say
anything so the example would be to say
that some people say that weasel words
are great sounds like you made a factual
statement but you didn't really because
it didn't specify some when I first
heard this term I was elated because I
had finally found a word for something
that had been frustrating me for a very
long time in development the number one
worst king weasel word that I know of is
enterprise so people might say that in
enterprise programming you cannot do
this or use terms like enterprise grade
do you know what enterprise is
synonymous with business
everybody does enterprise-grade
programming it programming it
professionally if Enterprise sketch oh
yeah just all words can make me so mad
but there's also weasel words used
purely in programming and one of the my
favorite weasel words is module another
developer recent word that I see a lot
is manager health Bert is another one
there are words in computer science that
actually means something because they
have this definition such as observer
state machine or facade but helper
manager and module are just fancy ways
of saying thing when you see an
applications with a bunch of managers
then the developer that wrote the
application just had no idea what it is
that they were writing no idea what
patterns they were or what to call them
so they use the word that kind of seemed
like it was like and not just an
afterthought of a word I would think
about I like writing a linter that
prevents you from using these things if
something is just a thing and you don't
know what it is yet yes
oh calling a thing anyway that's a
tangent I have these modules that I am
trying to find find a good name for
because they do follow the same pattern
i i currently call them effects because
in the sense of side-effects they are
when a function is causing somebody is
something else to happen that is just
not part of its input and output is not
a pure function then it will call
another function and will cause a
side-effect and that is mostly what
these things are
mmm but it doesn't quite fit so I will
be renaming it later probably to
handlers in the sense that they handle
messages perhaps message handlers either
way we're going to be replacing the bus
in them one by one and we're gonna begin
with the the test that we
we wrote in the first episode the delete
delete segment the lead segment command
and it also has an ADD segment command
that was there when we started so I'm
really just gonna get into it so first
of all we have this described common let
me talk about what that is describe
common is just a function that creates a
a described like in the same like a jest
or mocha describe and this is what it
looks like I have some common here
refactor this to be more modular I'm
using it
wellmaybe module actually does have some
kind of description because module means
like separate thing but like everything
in an application is a separate thing so
maybe it doesn't mean anything at all
maybe I'm guilty of of doing this here
what do you think like do you think that
module fits the description of a weasel
word or do you think that a module
actually means something in programming
right comment come on anyway this did
the describe coming here you see that it
just creates a describe and it then then
just calls this body function which is
this thing that we're passing in and the
body function gets this get Buzz
function which will have the get the the
bus instance that we create in in this
description block because we can't in
JavaScript we can't really pass the
reference to this one we're creating a
new one on every every loop so in order
for this closure here to work we it
needs to be a function it also does a
couple of other things it does it has
this thing it has this observe href
which is something that I generalized
into describe common because I
anticipated it to be used everywhere
observe href callback is basically
a way for the application to observe
what URL or location the browser is
pointing at so it can react accordingly
and I gotta figure this is something
that we would be using everywhere so I
moved it up into this describe common as
a test helper in order to make every
test simpler and that was me breaking my
own cardinal rule of like seeing
duplication like a good number of times
before generalizing but I figured that I
would be clever here and try to predict
the future and of course I failed
because this this is only used in one
single place
this really dumb generalization never
generalize until you see a bunch of
duplication golden rule secondly it also
does this it starts listening to
unhandled rejection and uncaught
exceptions and this is because if you
don't catch a rejection from a promise
that will just be swallowed in a node or
more specifically in node versions older
than seven in seven they actually start
printing this to the console so and
since I'm running these on node seven
this is completely on unnecessary so
what I'm saying here is that we like the
need for this generalization this
describe common here it's just
unnecessary we can remove it replace it
with a normal describe and I can just do
a new variable here for bus and go Beach
how do you create a bus don't you remove
this we no longer have this and we are
going to duty duty duty to import the
new bus and the it
exports the default that it exports is
create the function call create buzz and
it did you get that from direct parent
directory parent directory and it's in
boo sig because that's what we're
calling our great quick post quit bus
and we're going to do this so this is
going to create a bus bus equals great
buzz this now I believe things are gonna
start failing nah only one so far it's
getting a bit confused here because
mocha normally expects a download
parameter here and baby beam okay now
we're getting somewhere
get bus is no to defined now because
we've removed the described common which
gave us the get bus function so we're
gonna replace that with bus and no
longer calling this reply because yeah
reply was a bit weird like handle was a
model a lot more descriptive to what it
actually did so there's this a new
syntax and otherwise it's it's the same
I was kind of contempt with the API as
it was so I didn't change it much but
handle five is set and this bus boss dot
sent sent we're still calling it's and
it's the same thing and we're calling
this bus don't handle and we're calling
this okay this is new we are it no
longer call a smaller and call a third
message it is instead called expect and
it turn has the same syntax with syntax
structure as
as the the send send method so it first
takes the topic and then it takes the
the options object for the message
message is what we call them you send
message on the bus on a topic and if you
miss the previous episodes these are
just strings but set in constants okay
say I don't know I did it's not running
automatically I should probably restart
my computer anyway okay we're getting
some error messages here given delete
comment you know what I'm gonna focus on
this one can i I kind of F it focus it
and it will run only that DVD tip tip no
it didn't it why didn't this work or did
it no yes no oh it's but it has to stop
it is actually the same set the same
test just it's just two errors on each
one so okay let's see here cannot read
property find of undefined
and let's see Busiek line 32 no no okay
it's it's it's inside the bus let's take
a look inside the bus on line 32 well
okay
cannot read property find or undefined
okay so this is because we are trying to
send a message on a topic that doesn't
have any handlers and the bus does not
handle that like it or well it kind of
does it just breaks but it would be nice
to have a pretty error message for that
because we want the bus like one of the
main points of me spending so laborious
amounts
time with this bus is that I want this
thing to assist me and constantly give
me error messages as I go along and they
should be helpful not like this one
obscure I want you to be sort of hate
driven development where I constantly
get an error message that it's kind of
tells me what to do
error fix it error fix it error fix
anyway so let's implement this on the
bus
baby baby doing where should I put this
here's some errors related to throwing
if arguments are wrong it throws an
error if no handler exists on topic and
and they're all right cool so how do we
do that
let's first sit up okay let's say that
we are calling bus godsend and we're
calling the topic that does not exist
and we're sending a just an empty
message doesn't matter what let me just
run this one and not yeah let me remove
this bit here we can focus what do we
get yeah okay no no stop it
I don't want you to to run that thing I
want you to run this thing say run
uh why are you sir I mean rerun this
just what are you doing to me why are
you why are you so disappointing you
should you should only be running this P
filter by panic Oh God does that
force you to okay cool yeah I have to
okay okay okay I'm making a lot of
sounds alright it may if it fails the
way we wanted to fail but it should well
it should just fail prayer we want this
so expect DDD function the better to
throw error yes death and we want that
to say something nice such as did not
find a handler for top big topic mmm
topic that does not exist like that I'm
gonna remove the sidebar for a bit there
and run the tests okay it expected
function to throw an error matching blah
blah blah blah but it got the error that
it doesn't find okay let's go to the
boss code and locate the a rule or have
like located where we are messing up so
what's missing up on line 32 yeah but
there was a space empty row here for
some reason
aunty row empty we have to extract this
out first to make sense of this and
we're gonna extract this out into
constant called handlers on topic let
the tea you to do like that and then
we're gonna do if handlers on topic dot
length equals 0 we got
okay I do have this
ergonomic keyboard it is amazing it's a
Microsoft scope it's one of the best
economic keyboards that money can buy
and it has genuinely fixed my arm pains
I did a bunch of stuff but I put my
stock in that it was this that did it
but the the the keys are in slightly
different locations that I'm used to and
it makes it hard to type the curly
brackets and I'm still not getting used
to it even though it's been months where
was I yeah sometimes I just type when I
get stuck in the hopes that it makes me
remember where I was okay yeah I want to
throw an error throw new error and what
was it it was this thing I'm just gonna
copy it from here because I want to and
it should not have backslashes does that
work yes no oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah
because this will not be an array even
it will be totally undefined totally
undefined mmm would that make a good
ghosts noble story title totally
undefined no it dont
anyway this will be undefined because in
when we do set up the handlers they will
actually create the array here so this
will be undefined if there is no one no
handlers so I'm just gonna remove this
and and and and and if they don't exist
no handlers on topic exists it's going
to throw let's let's does that make
sense
expect no wait oh now it's back on
reporting the delete segment just you
you suck at watching
I guess that it only focus like when I
do have focus it only focuses on on a
test inside that file it still runs all
the other things but that is that is not
not what I want and that's not what I
intuitively want okay so let's see
success succeeds but as you might have
noticed I hard-coded this value in here
now I'm going to teach you that there is
there or English there are two schools
of thoughts when it comes to unit
testing or driving TD either you are a
triangulating person or you are a remove
duplication person the remove
duplication person will simply fix this
and go and do a handlers on topic here
now on the right topic here
just remove the duplication and reg X so
now we're we're passing or you could
triangulate and like if you triangulate
you would simply add another test here
and do the exact same thing but like do
topic that does not exist - in order to
ensure that the test the covers all
cases they kind of it kind of treats the
the code as hostile I used to be a
triangulating person because it feels
good you know you you write a lot of
tests and it also feels like you're
adding a lot of security but in practice
I found that it really didn't catch a
lot of errors like I mean I won't deny
that I could just have forgotten to
remove that duplication there but that
that is not a subtle bug it would just
have been when I ran it
production and I would have found the
error and when somebody is changing my
code around later like my future self
it's it's just not the kind of bug that
I would introduce so in my experience
your mileage may vary you you should try
both ways and see which ones you like
but in in my experience triangulation
does not really add any benefit you just
write a lot of tests
it feels emotionally good but in
practice it's waste I think personally
don't kill me so let's go back to the
original tests here and run all now I
actually do wanna see these bastards
okay okay okay okay did not find a
handler for topic commands delete
segments oh yeah it's because we don't
actually install install the handlers so
in the way these handlers work is that
they have an installed function and they
are given a bus let me just briefly show
it you're gonna see it later so get this
bus and then it takes these the reply
and send functions on it and it just
attaches these handlers so reply is the
old name for handle and done but the
bump up and I forgot to add that so
let's see what happens if I run it now
okay it's still nothing okay ah we get a
we get a a new error here so just like
gives you the errors in the order that
they happened like why doesn't it just
stop after these I'm not sure why I wish
it just stopped and just gave me this
but either way reply just anybody know
why just continues executing after it
hits the first error can I somehow get
it to stop
once it hits this first error anyway
reply is not a function as I said before
if you look at its installed it the
reply handler liked it this is now
called handle and that's the only change
so I'm just gonna call it handle but we
also have to call this handle loop and I
think that's the only change we need to
do there and we also changed this to
handle that looks okay I gotta go here I
have this thing this any string which is
I'm not sure if this is a good idea I
have the the it's inspired by Eve kind
of it's a message pattern matching thing
so it will only get messages if they it
has a method that is of type string my
idea with this is to add a tiny bit of
safety to this so that you you can be
sure that when this executes that this
will actually be of a a certain type and
exists and it also gives a bit of of
documentation because it shows you here
it shows you what arguments to expect
and what what they will be but if
practice I'm not sure if this is
actually helping anyone so the new bus
does for now it doesn't have this type
filtering so this is just an empty
object and a function and like that and
in the same way we remove this remove
that gonna be peep
slap and yeah that's all the replies
replaced and there's no any anywhere I
can remove but move that any reference
and let's run it again and see what
happens
whoopsie-daisy oh hello what happens ad
segment ad segment ad saying okay okay
cool
there is a bunch of ad segment problems
but we don't care about those right now
I just wanna for refocus on this test
ttttt bus is not a function
install the test J s online 31 yeah okay
yeah because if I exit because it was
get bus a function before and now it's
just that a funk I am area ball then I
accidentally forgot to remove it
parentheses okay see run it again see
what happens were expected to see
firebase sat you can see here now that
we're seeing this that I talked about
before node in version 7 now gives these
unhandled promise rejection warnings
before these were just swallowed up and
silent and that was super annoying so
that is why I had those catchers and
described common before but I don't need
them anymore kind of though it says type
error cannot read property of undefined
but it's not being particularly helpful
it's not giving me any stacktrace or
anything the bastard so maybe it was a
good idea to keep those there anyway
why can't you this is not helpful yeah
node does anybody know if you can get
these rejection warnings to be more
verbose by default is there
configuration option in note or do I
actually have to do this thing where I
listen to the unhandled rejection of the
process and forget out there but anyway
we perhaps we can figure it out you
cannot read playbook of undefined where
it is the playbook playbook where might
that exist so maybe it's there could be
this one or it could be this one no it
can only be this one because we're just
looking at delete segments for now so
okay segment data is is undefined so
that means on the front that is because
it comes the undefined that it comes
from this Sandefur base yet so perhaps
or fibers get here is is incorrect
so my my intent here is that the
firebase get should given this part it
should read return a promise that
resolves into this object here but in
practice it is resolving to two
undefined
interesting interesting interesting
let's first see what this send actually
returns done don't sit return a promise
at all let's Const promised equal send
promise and I'm gonna do a console.log
promise promise promise promise drip
drop running this okay what happens
comes what
promise on the fine no it it turns on
the fine
perhaps I haven't implemented this yet
perhaps you haven't gotten that far yet
let's see did it no I don't think we do
yeah we haven't gotten that far
let's see let's implement that because
this messaging bus it's not a pub/sub
parent it's a request response so if the
handler returns something we want that
to be passed as the return value to
whatever called send so it the passes on
the bit that that that though we turn
value from handler let me show you we
want this behavior so given bus don't
send your topic and we just send
whatever and we want the return value to
be some Const and we let's say that we
detected that that we just called this
song you know bus dot handle and that
should handle your topic given that and
given an empty filter because we wanted
to handle all calls to your topic given
that it should pass it to a handler
which doesn't care about what gets in
and it's going to return it's going to
return just some value and we then
should expect the return value
to be your topic bamm-bamm Papa booth
yeah we still have the same problem of
course because we we have not
implemented it yeah let me fail to just
have the music file there we go
expected your value to be your topic no
no no no I want it to be some value all
right sorry about that running it again
oh I could oh I don't have to press a
for all tests could you just press o to
run only the files that have like
related to the change that's convenient
but either way let's jump into Busiek
and actually implement this sand
lela lela lela Lulu yes and here's the
only change that we need to make return
I think yes ok cool that is e now we can
go back to our the test like we were
working on before let me just remove the
focus test here where am I oh let me
remove the promise as well I've no idea
where I'm where I'm going now I'm super
confused ok I think that actually made
everything pass
running it running everything okay cool
now I can move this back to there and
then pum pum pum cool okay so now this
handler here the command center that
handles delete segment messages or had
messages on the delete segment topic and
on the add segment topic and their
corresponding tests have now been
migrated to the new bus successfully we
found some shortcomings with the bus as
we did that and we corrected them but in
the end that was pretty smooth when
we're doing this kind of refactoring
it's and where we have verified that the
code works and we're changing the tests
the the code kind of verifies the tests
which is kind of cool oh hang on a
minute hang on a bit we have a fit left
let's remove that we're probably gonna
get some errors
yeah yeah yeah okay we have not dealt
with AB segment yet so we have migrated
AB segment to the new syntax but not the
tests of ad segment so let's do that but
get bus it doesn't get the bus anymore
it's create bus it still has install
works the same way reply does not work
the same way
let's go handle and it also has always
needs a filter and same we're here we
need to handle this looks fine this also
looks fine send syntaxes not change
between the old and the new version of
the bus
this has changed and we also need to
pass a an empty filter to be honest I'm
kind of I wanted to always have the
filter here because I wanted consistency
in the handle in the handle syntax but I
kind of starting to have second thoughts
because I've seen a lot of these empty
empty hundred Wasi wells
buzz a certain message we want that's
nowadays called expect and the first
argument is the topic much better syntax
I'm really happy about that and it's
called buzz expect here and it takes it
topic as the first argument message just
a second and we run all the tests and
see what happens screen it is green baby
even though all the tests are green the
application is now as a whole broken
because we have one part of the
application using the new bus and one is
the rest of the application using the
old bus and that this will of course
break even though the unit tests still
work because all the unit has depend on
on the bus for communication unit tests
are amazing you must have unit tests in
your application but you also need a few
integration tests to torpedo through the
application and test that all the
application components work together I
have a video on unit tests versus
integration tests you should check that
out but when you're writing an
application start with the unit tests
because unit test is extremely hard to
add later in your application because
otherwise we will be writing your
application in a way that makes it hard
to test because your your code will be
jumbled together and not neatly
separated like it needs to be
in order to write unit tests integration
test is something that you you generally
can add later in your development cycle
but I still think that you you should
have both in place before you release
the first version of your app so you
will be writing integration test for
this thing not today but as I said this
application is now now in a broken state
so we're gonna commit but we're gonna
commit as like a work in progress if I
was working in a team I would probably
create a branch for this you know let's
create a branch
let's do get branch you I'm gonna call
it boss migration the data and I go and
go get did you did it if I do get like
because right now we are not we are not
on the the new branch that we created
yet now we're on master if I try to
check out the the buzz migration branch
it's gonna shake out check out and boss
my it's gonna give me a warning good god
i can't type today check out ya know it
could switch I was I thought that he was
gonna warn me that I had uncommitted
changes but it seems fine so now we were
on the branch we're gonna commit to that
branch
let's Newt ah I was taught by the
comments from the last video that I
should go get a DP not sure what that
does let's see oh did it did I do that
it was good
commit P that I did before okay either
way it's giving me the the parts the
honks this seems fine we've removed a
new land this just looks like the thing
I want I'm stage that hunk stage this
hunter says yes that is that is exactly
what I want this is a test that
passes from the return value from
handler that's what we want this is
another test that throws a nice Arif
know Heinrich system topic we want that
one wow this was a big one okay this is
the refactoring of the of the commands
Installer Cooper yes we want that and
this is the refactoring of the installed
tests and we want that as well cool
what is this our still in that with it's
just another hunk in that test and this
is also another hunk in this test it's
going through giving me parts and asking
me if I want to commit certain ones did
yes just gonna go yes that also looks
good and we're gonna commit this get
commit Miss Judy - Judy no hang on we
have it I can just do git commit and
because I have hooked up Visual Studio
code to be the editor of the commit
messages and this is going to be worked
in progress bus migration but it babe
it'll be bad you know we can just my I'm
just gonna top my gray come on handlers
to new bus that's fine I'm gonna close
that lose cool and the committee's done
now since I'm working a Brett on a
branch your I can just push this get
push what if I do push now well it push
that little push master will it push the
branch what do you have to spare
by the brown Shh no configured push
destination either specify the Earl from
the command line or configure a remote
repository you sing I have don't get
push on this before it's just because
I'm on a branch get remote yes if I have
to get push and pj m pj i use i use m pj
instead of origin in case i have
multiple origins because i at at work we
have like the team name as one remote
and my own as one remote and i guess i
guess I could call impersonal and origin
but I just like the specificity okay but
I think it only pushed master now I
think I need to go get push mpj bus

new branch that's the way a well did ah
