some questions from the fan fan forum
program artist how to manage pull
requests in a team how to maintain pull
requests pile as low as possible while
keeping the team focus high from one
hand if you want it to be on one hand
you want it to breed be reviewed as
quickly as possible from the air and on
the other hand you don't want to create
too many context switches for your team
members yeah getting a good pull request
code review culture in a team is the
it's a bit tricky to establish it
doesn't come naturally you have to spend
a little bit of work like so you just
just be patient with this it takes a
while but that said in the last team I
was in on at Spotify on the desktop team
we we had an agile coach Jimmy which was
fantastic and he was big on this thing
called a working contract and a working
contract is something that you develop
in a meeting it's usually in the form of
a post-it note and it says something
that the team agrees to do it's not a
task it's more like a habit so for
instance in this case the working
agreement was I do code reviews every
day that was the working contract and in
the thing with the working contract is
that every single person in the room
must agree that this is a priority task
and that this is something that we do or
you don't put that working contract up
it needs to be completely unanimous if
someone is is on the fence you need to
convince that person or if that person
is not convinced you put that work a
contract thing and into like this maybe
column where you where well we're gonna
perhaps try it but not
everybody's convinced that this is a
good idea so it's very much in trial
mode and we're just observing it for
instance I don't remember any that was
in the column hmm off the top of my head
but either way the important thing is
that it has to be unanimous and as the
week's go by like after a week or two
you start putting like checking going
through the working contracts and seeing
which of these are we actually doing for
instance you might do like we always
write unit tests for our code might be a
working contract and you just observe
that you realize that and it doesn't
really work with old ways we figured out
that hmm we had to there are some pieces
of the code that just isn't suitable for
unit tests or it's just an insane
bizarre amount of work to get this part
of the code under test so we have
figured that no we're not really
adhering to this contract so we decide
either that we double down on it and
focus on it or we decide to make it more
realistic so that it actually
corresponds to the working process that
we have that case we decided to change
it to write unit tests or write a very
good excuse so that yeah I always add
unit tests or have a very good excuse
and that turned out to be a really good
balance because then then people can
challenge that excuse a little bit
Justin that you you avoid the case where
you just don't write the unit test out
of lethargy and but it also allowed us
to skip unit tests for the cases where
the cost was simply too high but going
back to the the case where with the
palookas so the working contract there
that we decided upon
was code review every day so that means
that you realistically will never have
to wait more than a day for your code
review to be to be completed often a lot
less because everybody reviews all the
time and some people would like to put
their review block in the morning some
will you do it just because before they
go home so like they became this pretty
nice distribution and you you got your
code reviewed in a pretty expedient
manner I think it turned out to be
pretty nice it allowed also allowed
everyone to build a routine around the
work because they they could choose a
time of day where it was suitable for
them to do code review like in the
morning or in the afternoon and it also
allowed you to it kind of become became
this thing where you slammed in your
thing and somewhere during the day and
then you just okay there's gonna be a
like it's gonna take a day before I get
this back so now I go do something else
so just just send them away for this
feedback loop and then I do something
else it required some context switching
of course that's that's the nature of
pull requests the only other real
alternative to do - that is - is to do
pair programming which is something that
I I love but it's it also has some other
logistical problems and and culture
problems it's not it's it's not as
trivial to get working in a team as as
pull requests or but but it's great if
you can if you can get it if you want to
look at a company that does pair
programming well you can look at pivotal
they do it a lot they don't even have
personal work sessions they only have
shared work stations they only do pair
programming which is cool if you try to
do it faster for instance that like
start pinging people on slack to do code
reviews you start into
rapping other people's work and that is
that is a lot worse it creates that
creates context switching in a very bad
way and I don't think that you should do
it if you have you're doing pull
requests I think that was that was at
least the best the best flow that I have
seen working contract that everybody
agrees to I do code reviews every day
you have just watched an episode of fun
fun function I release these every
Monday morning Oh 800 GMT you can watch
another episode of the show by clicking
here or if you are a patron of fun fun
function you can discuss this specific
question on the Fun Fun forum by
clicking here I am npj until next Monday
morning stay curious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
