the decision back in the front than in a
word press agency oh this is interesting
I used to work for an employer where the
division between front-end developers
and back-end developers was was kind of
extreme the back-end stack was so
complex and specific to the company that
it was very hard for front-end
developers to get going with it and vice
versa actually was just the front-end
stack was also very elaborate so
back-end developers didn't have much
much chance to to working that stack and
the reason it was extreme is that having
this this division of labor in front-end
and back-end it it will breed
specialization because if you're
specialized on back-end or specialized
on fronting you have quite a bit of time
to do more elaborate things for example
if you're a full stack developer you
your attention is spread across more
things and your cognitive load for each
things need to be lower you're gonna a
full stack developer is going to have a
less elaborate tool chain across the
board than if there is a specialized
front-end developer and of specialized
back-end developer you can argue that
that it's a good thing that these these
complexities they also add value but it
should also be noted that it makes it
very hard for a person to work in either
of these stacks makes it make the flow
of people very fixed and they kind of
become these silos you have to in order
to build something you per definition
need at least the front end and the back
end developer probably mostly think it's
a mistake to do that division like that
specific division front and back-end
perhaps
should instead be application and
infrastructure because when you're
building an app you you almost always
have to touch both the front end and the
back end and if so you have to involve
multiple people even though it's a very
small feature and that that adds a lot
of friction so it would be interesting
to me to see like an architecture where
you have I think more generic
complicated services that are maintained
by the infrastructure team which are
basically the backhander saga and then
there are like these more lightweight
and aggregation services backing
services that interact with these
services they are still back in services
and there is the front end application
and the people that work in the
application domain they work on both
these things and send people back in
services and stuff and the the
infrastructure team that is the more
traditional back and developers domain
and the idea of that architecture in my
mind would be that the people that are
working the abdomen would not have to
get the help of the infrastructure team
every single time they make a shot it
make a change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
