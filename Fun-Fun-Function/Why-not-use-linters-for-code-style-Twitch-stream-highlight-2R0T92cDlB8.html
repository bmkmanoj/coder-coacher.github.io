great dot es limped for C dot J zone BAM
so I use standard naturally no
semicolons and then I just start
disabling things as they annoy me and as
you see like I disabled a lot of things
that I I don't believe in using linters
for purely for style because it's it's
kind of like the same thing as with type
systems just distract me a lot I just
find myself like it
whenever I see errors I tend to like be
distracted and start fixing the errors
and I forget what it is that I was
actually working with so yeah oh
switch back to desktop damn new beam
escape sorry about that sorry about that
just use prettier hmm
I'm skeptical let's see prettier because
this is probably way too opinionated for
me this is probably like opinions on
like it will probably like be angry with
me if I did I don't know no no I don't
like enforced formatting bar perhaps in
a build system maybe but I don't know I
think that for me for this for pretty or
something like a anything a linter like
with styling would have to be separated
from my editor I would like I want one
link to a link or set of rules that is
much looser while I am working and
solving problems and one like on
pre-commit I don't know if that's
possible but that's how I would want it
yes so that I don't get distracted by
friends like say that I had out of space
they're like that is not relevant to the
problem that I am solving that is just
completed super like that is way later
that's something that I want to fix
later not while solving a problem but if
it's in mile intervals that will get
like that is gonna warn me about that
and then yeah I don't like that who's
typing in the editor strict linting
inbuilt I would really like that
I would I would buy a limiter like I
would use Sullinger like that
programmers don't buy software
development tools and you were
continuing to figure this out so this
handlers started what are these let's
figure out what with this how this looks
like image sneaky having the formatting
consistent and run without me thinking
helps me solve my actual problems so
much better though because it keeps the
code consistent and it makes the code
illegible without me worrying about it
yes that reasoning works if all the
people on your team does that however
the problem is that it start distracting
me as soon as it comes to committing
things so it will start if because if
the code is not formatted according to
your your formatter it will start like
fixing things for you and when you when
you're about to commit it will do this
little like changes all over the place
and I'm a person that really really
don't like fixing styling in the same
commits that I have that I have logic
changes but yes if your entire team uses
the exact same styling guide and you
enforce that then yes it will work but
yeah
like 10 whenever I use anything like
that it just tend to be so annoying and
just be in the middle
I just fundamentally don't think that
worrying about things like let's see
like if there is a space there really
doesn't matter really doesn't matter I
know that's controversial for to say but
it's really not it doesn't matter
nobody will know like the end user well
not know I'm not saying that you
shouldn't have have linters but it's not
saying that we shouldn't worry
completely about style I'm just saying
that don't worry too much about it let's
