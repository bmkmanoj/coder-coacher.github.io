settings in your source code I think
it's fine because at like in the case
for example in the case of es code the
settings oh I don't know actually
like in a team that might actually be
very annoying because I don't know I
don't know I think that it needs to be
up to the the team because in some cases
if the team is very homogeneous and
everybody is using the same editor and
everybody is happy about that then a
shared configuration file might be super
useful but then again that might also be
tremendously annoying for people and it
might be but then again you could just
let me just keep that locally and just
be careful not to commit it perhaps
perhaps it's just nice to have like the
BS code the configuration files is kind
of sensible default so you in the
repository you don't actually commit
that vs code it's just that you commit
like a BS code
- default or something like that it's
just renamed so that it doesn't isn't
picked up and then if you want to use it
you just remove that from the remove the
extra - default from the file so that it
becomes the complication a configuration
file that might be an like sensible
thing to do then you can have a good
place to share your projects and your
fault editor settings and also you get
version control when you're suggesting
changes to it and stuff like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
