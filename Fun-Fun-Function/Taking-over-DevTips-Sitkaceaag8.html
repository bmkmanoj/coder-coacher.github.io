episode with some huge huge news this is
finally happening it finally happened
this is the official announcement for
something that I we've been working on
for over a year
well it's almost exactly one year okay
here yes here's the thing
me and David have you seen on channel a
couple times we are taking over
one of the biggest programming channels
on YouTube
damn tips so this little YouTube
business of ours is now multi channel
this is massive massive news
the combined subscriber power of the
orphan phone function and dev tips
together is over 400,000 people four
hundred thousand like there are okay so
to put that in perspective there are 56
countries in the world that have a
smaller population than that
including Iceland suck it Iceland okay
this is gonna be me talking a lot in
this video rambling but the most most
important thing to get out of the way
should you subscribe to deb tips we're
still experimenting with content but the
general idea is that dev tips is going
to have two types of contents that fun
fun function does not the first one is
videos for beginners fun election
doesn't have that and videos about truly
like libraries and frameworks and stuff
like that
when i make videos for fun fun function
i imagine people a person a developer
that is about one year into their first
full-time job they're like that's just a
persona there are a lot of people that
have more or less experience at that
that's that's the archetype that I
imagined when I'm making the content
convert function is also very focused on
teaching general programming concepts
like programming programming so it
doesn't spend a lot of time teaching
specific libraries or specific
frameworks and stuff like that doesn't
mean that's bad it's just not what fun
fun function is about however it's
really cool to do both of those things
beginning videos and and tooling videos
so we have decided that dev tips at
least initially that's going to be an
outlet for that that way fun for
function and depth tips they complement
each other so probably the more early on
you are in your programming journey the
more likely it is that you are going to
appreciate the content that we put out
on dev tips if that sounds like your
thing you can subscribe to dev tips
there there's also a link in the
description that's the most important
stuff out of the way the rest of this
video is going to be me talking about
behind the scenes stuff why all this
happened why are we taking over dev tips
who's David really what is the strategy
moving forward if that stuff doesn't
interest you then that's perfectly fine
that's meta fun fun function stuff just
skip this video and come back on Monday
for the regularly scheduled programming
but if you are still here I am now going
to vent because this has been a big
secret since last year and I really hate
keeping secrets it is the worst and I'm
so glad so glad that I can finally talk
about this there is a corresponding
announcement video on dev tips where
Travis the the previous owner of dev
tips talks about why this is happening
he also does an interview with me and
David so you might want to look at that
if you're interested but I also wanted
to make a video here that is more from
the perspective of fun fun function and
more towards you the fun
audience what is depth tips deb tips is
a huge programming channel it's it's
bigger than funfun function it's older
than one function has over a quarter of
a million subscribers it has been run by
Travis Nielsen who is a designer that
knows coding the channel was actually
originally called dev tips for designers
the production quality of dev tips has
been consistently stellar Travis is very
good at video production when I started
from production about three years ago
there was basically no competition when
it came to production quality except dev
tips so that meant that I kind of set
dev tips as my my bar to reach where the
production quality of fun for function
like that is the level that we have to
hit this got Travis this amazing this
 is so amazing I'm gonna live kind
of hate him that it's how good I want to
be but jealousy that's a very good
motivator for me but why but why take
over another channel how does fun fun
function fit with dev tips why not just
focus on one channel almost exactly one
year from today
Travis reached out to me on via private
message on Twitter at that point dev
tips had been on a hiatus for a couple
of months so I kinda sort of guessed
from his message where this was going
and when I talked to him I got my
suspicions confirmed that he was indeed
looking for someone to take over death
tips properly like pick up the torch
Travis had been recently been employed
by Google and he was career wise he was
getting a lot out of that
and dev tips wasn't a good fit in his
life as it had been previously but
Travis is he's like this is really great
I he also felt this very strong sense of
duty towards his audience when you build
something like a YouTube channel that
such a massive amount of work and such a
big relationship with with so many
people that expect your content if you
produced and haven't liked your content
it's it does something with you even
when you feel like you can't do it you
want that thing to live on I can really
really understand that feeling so he he
wanted someone he wanted that to live on
or on under good stewardship someone
that he trusted would make sure that dev
tips lived on in kind of the same
fashion not that it was form then like
with our touch of course but I not lose
the spirit of that tips from my
perspective like a business strategic
perspective taking over dev tips made of
course a lot of sense to be perfectly
honest it's kind of like the an offer
that is stupid to refuse as I talked
about before the the target developer of
fun fun function is a developer that is
sort of one year into their first job a
lot of the stuff on the channel is
pretty advanced like we do I have a
 monad video also on fun fun
function I try to focus a lot on the
fundamentals of programming like what is
composition how do we modularize
software what's a func door so I have
boy did stuff like specific tooling like
angular jQuery stuff like that basically
if funfun function had been about making
movies it would have been more about
filmmaking how to frame shots rather
than talking about cameras so dev tips
kind of revealed itself as this place
where maybe we could put the
beginner stuff here and maybe we could
do some tooling things here on this
channel it felt like it could be a
really great compliment to find
malfunctioning but there was a tiny
drawback of taking over another channel
and that meant that I would die heart
attack
space die explosion because at the point
when I was talking to started talking to
Travis I was very far from I was still
pretty far from doing fun her function
as a full-time job the patron had not
launched yet I still very much had a job
a part-time job but still job the
prospect of taking over and and running
another channel just seemed unthinkable
weird no I could not do that on my own
and that is where David comes in who is
David do you've seen David on the
channel a couple of times unlike me he's
actually a real engineer by trade but
for the last few years all right you
know a lot of the last years he's been
working as a data analyst while doing
this video I calculated that have
actually known David for 15 years that's
bonkers we started our first company
together when we both turned 18 which
was the legal age to start a company and
we've had a few businesses since David
is one of those people that's those very
few people in your life that I would
just easily trust with my life is so
reliable and I communicate very very
well with him those two things are very
very good to look for when you're
looking for someone to run a business
with
and we've been talking on and off trying
to figure out what if there is a such a
business that we could do together like
what's the next big thing that we could
do so when Travis offered me to take
over dam tips that turned into this very
obvious opportunity like it was time it
was time to grow from from function
beyond one person and beyond one channel
or to something bigger and that is where
we are now we are officially going
multi-channel it's very scary we don't
know if this works but if it does there
might be more shows in the future with
more posts any thoughts or ideas and
reflections that you have or questions
just post them down below can't reply to
everyone but we read them all I am LBJ
