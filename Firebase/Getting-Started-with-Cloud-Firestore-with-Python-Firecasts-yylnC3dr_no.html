talk about two of my favorite things
cloud fire store and the admin SDK so I
love that firebase has such robust
client-side SDKs for iOS Android and web
but did you know that firebase also has
a server-side option the admin SDK the
admin SDK lets you access firebase
features server-side so you can for
example read and write to Claude fire
store outside of the client this is
especially useful for offloading CPU
intensive tasks and keeping secrets away
from the client now if you've seen
Todd's videos on getting started with
cloud fire store for iOS or Android
you'll already be familiar with the
sample app I'm going to use one that
stores an inspiring quote
if you haven't seen these videos I
highly recommend you check them out Todd
gives a great overview of the fire store
structure I'm going to use the iOS
version of the inspiring quotes app
which looks like this you can see the
quote and author as well as text fields
to write a new quote and a new author in
this video I'll show you how to use the
admin SDK to make changes cloud fire
store which can then be seen here in the
client so you may be wondering how can I
keep my quotes fresh with new
inspiration every day I could rely
solely on users to write quotes or just
try to remember something interesting
and type it in the console manually
after all there's no shortage of
misinterpreted quotes on the Internet
didn't George Washington say that anyway
one neat way I could handle this is
server-side I could use one of the many
quote generating REST API is out there
to get my quotes for me and then write
them to the database using the admin SDK
I can also use server-side code to send
a notification to users or something
like that if I wanted to so that's what
I want to show you today how to get
started using the admin SDK to read and
write data to cloud fire store I'm going
to show you the firebase admin SDK for
Python but no js' Java and go are also
supported let's get started
first I need service account credentials
which I can download from the console
under the firebase admin SDK tab I'll
select generate private key
now this service account JSON file
contains sensitive information including
your service accounts private encryption
key remember to keep it confidential
never add it to version control never
put it in a client app and never store
it in a public repository now I'll
create a new project I'm going to use
PyCharm but you can use whatever ide you
prefer I'll generate a new virtual
environment for this project and then
I'll install the firebase admin package
I'll do it from the PI charm preferences
but of course you can run pip install
from the terminal if you prefer I'm
going to create a new python file oh and
I'll add the service account file to my
project again
remember not to add it to your version
control this would be a good time to add
it to your get ignore all right finally
let's get coding I can initialize the
SDK using my downloaded service account
key file like this know that if I were
using the admin SDK on the Google cloud
platform
I can initialize the app using the
application default credentials like
this no matter how you initialize the
app I'll Ben initialize an instance of
cloud fire store the same way calling
fire store that client now that I've
initialized the admin SDK I'm ready to
get a random quote and write it to the
database but before I get coding let's
briefly examine the structure of the
quotes app at the top level I start with
a collection called sample data this
collection contains just one document
called inspiration this document will
itself have two key value pairs or we
can call them fields one called quote
and another called author now as an
aside keep in mind I'm not storing one
quote per user everybody in the world
will be altering this one document if I
were looking to save a different quote
per user
I'd probably setup a user's collection
and create a different document for each
user and again if you'd like to see how
to build this app on iOS or Android
check out Todd's fire cast on getting
started with cloud fire store now I'm
going to call function I'm calling get
quote
result of which contains adjacent object
with a random quote there is although
the function looks something like this
alright let's generate a quote and then
add it to cloud fire store first off I'm
going to call the gait quilt function
which returns the response from the HTTP
endpoint
I'll get the quote and the author from
the body of the response I'll make a
reference to the inspiration document in
the sample data collection I'll then
call set on the document reference which
sets the documents data to whatever data
I pass to the function if the document
does not yet exist it will be created do
keep in mind this replaces all data in
the document with the data that I just
passed if I wanted to update some fields
or add to the document I'd use the
update instead of set function once that
work is complete I'll log that the quote
was written to the database all right
let's see this code in action the
console logs tell me that the new quote
was written successfully and we can see
that quote here in the firebase console
I can also see the new quote but I think
it's cooler to watch the quote change
from the app so here's the iOS version
of the quotes app with the current
randomly generated quote when I run my
Python app again I can see that the
quote changed in the iOS app as well see
pretty cool
my server-side code can now generate
quotes great that's sure to keep users
motivated but I may also want to be able
to read data from Cloud firestore
server-side say if I wanted to sanitize
bad words from quotes or send
notifications when new quotes are
written so let's look at getting data
from fire store first I'll start with a
reference to the document holding the
quote then I'll get data from the
inspiration dock in the sample data
collection using get I'll use try so I
can create an exception for when the
document is not found but if the
document exists I can use the document
data on whatever my app needs such as
sending a notification and there you
have it now you know how to use Cloud
firestore for Python on your server I
hope this inspires you to incorporate
cloud
our store and the admin SDK into your
firebase projects so be sure to
subscribe to be the first to know about
new videos from firebase including fire
casts like this one thanks for watching
and I'll see you in a future episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
