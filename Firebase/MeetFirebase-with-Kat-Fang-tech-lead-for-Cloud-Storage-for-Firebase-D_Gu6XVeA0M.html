when you get to meet the Googlers that
make firebase out my name is Doug
Stevenson and on the show with me today
is my friend cat Fang hey thanks for
being on the show thanks for having me
what's your role on the firebase team I
am the tech lead for cloud storage cloud
storage for families so that means like
the SDKs I have a little bit of say into
the SDKs the SDKs are mostly implemented
by other teams SDK team so guys
I'm more focused on the backend server
for it and the underlying infrastructure
and there's a lot there I understand so
if you read the cloud storage
documentation says it scales to exabytes
yeah I don't even I can't picture how
big an exabyte is so we all ask you more
about that later we're not strangers
right we've done some events before we
know each others but there's some things
that I don't know about you that I would
like to ask you about I understand that
you were into robotics in high school is
that right yeah that's true
I kind of was into robotics all the way
through college and then at some point
discovered that I actually like systems
better and want more the systems
direction what kind of things have you
built I'm curious yeah first robot I did
robot or a thing like that was okay yeah
it was a Lego Mindstorms
and it used the nubs on the Legos and I
made like little Braille blocks with it
so could read Braille music and
basically beeped out whatever it written
oh that's cool I know about Lego
Mindstorms I played with those two there
was a lot of fun and then I did FIRST
Robotics where you build like
washing-machine sized robots and compete
your own like a team of three robots
against another team of three robots so
it's like a team battle kind of event
yeah one of the robots was actually
named after me and this robot was my
height 5 foot and my weight 100 pounds
yeah my team decided to you name it
after me and this was this was not my
favorite robot but it had your name I
think I'm supposed to be proud of it I
know you studied computer science at MIT
and one of the events we did together
was a hackathon yeah MIT and some of the
students used fire
which is a ton of fun yeah but I also
just learned that you got a master's
degree from MIT oh yeah I'm curious to
know what your thesis was about yes I
tried twice actually at a thesis my
first one was with a robotics lab and I
discovered over time I actually liked
systems more the thing that really drew
me was this thing called Ross robotics
operating system that's how I kind of
realized that more than robotics I liked
systems so my thesis was with a Systems
Group and what we were doing was looking
at if we recorded requests for like a
web server could we figure out if there
was then like a bug in the web server
could we figure out how many of those
requests were actually affected how many
users were affected and could we kind of
reverse the effects automatically like
damage control yeah a sense
yeah those the basis of the system and
what I built on top of that was well in
order to do this you're recording
requests which could include passwords
and you know addresses and what-have-you
which is not great from a security point
of view probably not yeah so the
question is like can you like
automatically tag that information and
then not record it the thing I really
liked about the system was I turned I
gave my thesis to my adviser and was
like okay what can I do here to like
improve this or is it ready to turn in
and he's like you have to name the
system not an appropriate name the thing
I mean this was the solar system I could
say my thesis on the solar system oh
yeah it's a big topic yeah where solar
actually stands for the Sanitation of
logs and requests
that's very cosmic I have some questions
on the point later
you joined firebase when it was a
start-up before it became part of Google
I'm curious to know what drew you to
work there I graduated from MIT and then
I came to San Francisco looking for a
job because that's where a lot of tech
jobs are yeah and I heard about firebase
through Greylock one of the VCS okay
that originally backed it and kind of
the thing that drew me was I really
liked systems things if that wasn't
obvious I really liked some things and
so it's kind of like looking for
something infrastructural but
I also really appreciate human-computer
interactions and so a firebase had was
it did both the user kind of experience
and like making it so that there's like
a really awesome real-time database
which is like a complex problem making
it actually usable for more developers
so one of the things about working at
firebase and I think I mentioned this
before when James Tamplin was on there's
a special day at firebase in the office
called bring your pineapple to work day
and I understand you like this a lot I I
love this it's probably one of the
things that caused me to actually you
know sign on with firebase really I was
like are these people weird enough for
me and the answered test yeah absolutely
weird enough for me this past year I
made like this giant balloon sculpture
of a pineapple and is bigger than you
and it's bigger than I am I listed the
help of my roommates and I just covered
that one of my roommates knew how to
make like balloon animals she kept
turning like we we used like the lung
balloons for like the fronds of the
pineapple but she kept turning them into
dogs and flowers but I did let her
design the top of the pineapple what do
you like about working on the firebase
team I like the fact that I'm not just
an engineer I like the part where I got
to go out to you events with you yeah
did the hackathon at MIT together I
remember the last time you did some
speaking there you did a live demo of
firebase in the web I think maybe more
impressive is you were involved in this
thing called 0-2 app which is like this
live coding thing that happened at i/o
yes so the past to iOS we had zero app
which was a talk where we got four of us
together and we live coded on three
platforms so one person would be
speaking and the other three people
would be coding away on Android iOS and
web in the background and giving talks
there is kind of amazing yeah how many
people's that sit
it's like thousands right many more than
we had in the audience but probably not
as many as we have views on YouTube oh
so it's very popular of you we now have
like almost a hundred oh wow that's more
watches than most of my videos have so
far more interesting to me you said a
lot about what you do at work but I'm
curious to know what you do outside of
work yes
recently I've gotten back into figure
skating okay I skated as a kid growing
up that was like my activity when I was
younger the hardest jump that I'd been
working on was called the axel it's the
hardest single jump okay so that's a
spin there's a spin in there yeah you
jump up you turn one and a half times
and then you land okay you can say you
can do the axel to the skating community
well like you at least got to you know
the beginning levels of being actually a
figure skater you could compete with
moves like that I couldn't really
compete I don't like competition
would you like robot competitions
collaborative and so you're on a team it
was just me and my robot I wouldn't do
it because it's like a lot of people so
you work with cloud storage and I was
looking on the cloud storage page and it
says that cloud storage scales to
exabytes now I don't have a good picture
in my mind what an exabyte is I know
that the the prefixes go kilobyte
megabyte gigabyte terabyte petabyte
exabyte yeah that's a lot of bytes I
don't really have a good picture in my
mind okay now I have the quiz I don't
expect the joke that's all right but I
was kind of curious if the USB stick in
the low USB Drive is about five
centimeters long how many would it take
place to end in to circle the earth
what do you think what's your ball
forgive me evolve I computed it out so
I'll give you the answer this one so the
the earth is 4 billion centimeters
around in circumference
so that means 800 million USB drives
eight to end end end go
yeah if each one of those sticks holds
32 megabytes a little 32 megabyte Drive
it's tiny just imagine if it's 32 about
how much storage is that total 800
million of 32 Meg's okay so about 1,000
what's happening gigs terabytes yeah one
thousand terabytes so about a petabyte
I calculated out the 24 petabytes yeah
so that's oh yeah that was in the
ballpark so that's about what a petabyte
is yeah all these sticks in your line
damn oh yeah okay here's another one if
you had took one of those two and a half
inch SATA drives the kind as you have in
your lab oh no
and they're they're measured about 4
inches long so in its enclosure how many
would it take place end in to reach the
moon Oh what ok so we've got 4 inches
that we're going to the moon yeah I'm
just gonna go with a bucket I don't know
ok the moon is roughly 15 billion inches
from the earth so that means it would
take three point seven five trillion
hard drives to really trillion yeah
three point seven yes imagine if each
one of those hard drives held 100
gigabytes which again is kind of small
by today's standards that's 350 exabytes
of storage so now we're getting into X
of a range so that you can store that in
Google right on earth you don't have to
go to the moon yeah so here's another
one how many five and a quarter inch
floppy disks would it take placed end to
end to reach the Sun from Earth oh my
god what's after trillion quadrillion
yeah sure let's say that ok so here's
the answer the Sun is about five point
eight nine trillion inches from the
earth which means it would take a total
of roughly 1 trillion disks
you're an order of magnitude up and it
turns out so here if five and a quarter
inch floppy disks stores 160 kilobytes
this is like the original storage that's
about 1 petabyte of storage so that's
that's how I think of petabytes and
exabytes of storage I know it's really
goofy anyway cat thanks for being on the
show thank you are you gonna say ok all
what you saw your file yeah I'll sort of
end-to-end going to this yeah cloud
storage is probably a better way to do
that so thanks for being on the show and
thank you for tuning in and dealing with
all of my goofy comparisons and sighs
and be sure to watch cat do some live
programming at i/o so click that link
and be sure to subscribe right here to
the firebase channel on YouTube and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
