metrics in firebase I'm Lawrence and I'm
Beryl back again pirate metrics is a
framework for growing your business
that's based on acquisition activation
retention referral and revenue that's
right in this episode we'll be looking
at referral is when your users tell
other people about how awesome your app
is so they can become your users too so
it's a bit like a press-gang shiver me
timbers
no not quite like that it's much
friendlier oh I see so in firebase we
have technologies that you can build
into your app to make referrals much
simpler exactly research has shown now
the number one reason that people
discover an app that they install is
through word of mouth from someone they
know and truly trust so by putting app
invites into your app you'll give your
users a OneTouch way to do this in a way
that's really smart you see it won't
just give them an alphabetical list of
their contacts
it actually sorts it according to the
likelihood of that person being
interested based on past behavior so if
I'm trading a game with my friend who
says I play too many games will that
friend be at the bottom of the list
exactly and as a developer it's really
easy to implement as it uses a widget
that you can literally drop into your
app and all of this is built on a
technology called dynamic links which is
available for you to use - have you ever
tried to share an app with a friend
telling them about content that was in
that app like good recipes
biscuits I have to call my friend tell
them to go to the Play Store find the
app do you know how many recipe apps
there are and then once they've found it
they need to install it and by the time
they've installed it I have forgotten
what the recipe was that's a lot of
friction and dynamic links are all about
saving you from that you'd simply create
a dynamic link to the sea biscuit recipe
and and once my friend opens it if they
have the app they'll go straight to the
recipe and if they don't they'll get
taken through the install flow and still
end up with the recipe that's pretty
clever yes it is not bad for scurvy
