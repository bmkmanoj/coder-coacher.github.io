today's episode of fire cast we're going
to be covering angular and firebase but
as a reminder to you this is just one
episode in many on firebase in the web
so we're going to be covering things
like authentication real time database
storage firebase Cloud messaging
firebase hosting so pretty much anything
that's firebase in the web is going to
be in that series including things like
JavaScript frameworks like angular ember
react and polymer so if you want to see
those videos make sure to subscribe so
you can get updated when we drop those
but today we're going to be covering
angular and firebase and we're going to
be using the angularfire library which
is the official library for using
angular and firebase together so it's
super easy to get started with and it's
also really easy to use so let's get
started so to setup angular and firebase
you create an angular app module as you
usually would with angular module and
the module name and then inside of the
dependency array you declare the
firebase module to get angular fire once
you do that you get a whole host of
Awesome services that you can use in
your app and while all these services
are super cool we're going to be setting
up a project from scratch today and then
talking a little bit about firebase
object so I'm in my terminal and I'm
going to set up my project from scratch
using the firebase CLI so I'm going to
write firebase in it and this is going
to give me some sweet emoji arts and I
know I call it out every single time but
I mean come on
it's amazing so now I'm going to select
a hosting project and then I'm going to
select my firebase project set the
default database rules and now this part
is super important I know I call it out
like every single time but this can
really really trip you up if you don't
get it right so it's good to focus on so
what do we want to use as our public
directory and this is where your index
dot HTML file lives and so this is the
entry point to your application
so for me I'm a simple man in my public
folder is usually called public so I'm
gonna have the firebase CLI write my 404
and my index.html and then after that my
initialization is complete so I'm going
to clear the console now I'm going to
set up my local development server and I
can do that by typing firebase serve and
this is going to throw a local server on
port 5000 so right here in the browser
you can see we have our default page and
now I'm going to set up angularfire so
all the angularfire information you're
going to want to read is a get up comm
slash firebase slash angular fire and it
contains all the source code and
including some documentation so you can
see there's a table of contents where it
has a little QuickStart information on
downloading it documentation examples
and lots of other awesome stuff so to
see how to download it I'm going to
click that link and I'm going to copy
these three scripts and so it's angular
itself the firebase SDK and the
angularfire library and just to note you
can also do this through an NPM install
or a Bower install if that's your thing
so now my app I'm going to go into the
header section and paste in these three
scripts and then I'm going to delete all
of these filler elements now the first
step for initializing an angular app is
by providing the ng app directive so on
the body tag I'm going to write ng app
and give it my apps name which is super
creative by being called app so now that
we have this initialized I'm going to
create an app J's file in my public
folder and I'm going to wrap everything
in an iffy because you know Java scripts
got function scope so to declare my
angular app I'm going to use an angular
module so I'm going to angular dot
module and then my app name which is app
and then
safai the dependency array and this is
where I can include the angularfire
module so it's module name is firebase
and this will give me access to inject
all of the services that we saw in the
beginning of the video so angular really
loves dependency injection and that's
how you use every single firebase
service so I'm going to create a
controller and I'm going to call it my
controller and then going to provide the
controller function and it's right
inside of this function where I can
inject anything I need from angularfire
as a parameter so this is where I'm
going to use firebase object so I'm
going to specify that I want firebase
object and then now on my controller I
can create a property called this dot
object and then set it to firebase
object which is a function that takes in
a database reference so since I've
provided the firebase JavaScript library
I can just go and create a reference
using firebase database so firebase
database dot ref so I'm going to dive
into the child of angular and that's
because this database right here is kind
of like one big mega database and I'm
just pretending that angular is the root
of this database so from here I want to
nest one more time into the child of
object so essentially what I've done
here is I've gone to root and then I
have a property of angular and then with
an angular it has a property of object
and then this ref variable points to
this location right here so by passing
this reference to the firebase object it
will be able to synchronize any of the
data at the object location to my
angular app so anytime any updates occur
in the real-time database it will
synchronize those changes to my angular
app and update my template and real
and lastly I need to initialize firebase
so initialize firebase you say firebase
initialize app and you provide a config
variable and this config variable you
locate in the firebase console so this
is all my config information and with
that I'm ready to create my template so
back in index.html I want to make sure
that I'm referencing this script so
source to app J s and then now I once
you specify this div as the container
for my controller so I can do that by
using ng controller and then setting the
name to controller as controller so
inside this ng controller will be my
template and so what I want to do is I
just want to display this object in a
pre tag so I'll create a pre and then
I'll do controller dot object and then
do a filter to JSON and actually do to
the nature of pre tags I need to move
this all the way to the back so at
format's correctly so here in the
browser we have my data to the left we
have angular and then object and then an
object as a property of name but over
here in the actual web app we have this
object with this dollar ID and dollar
priority and then the only thing that
really looks familiar is the name
property so if these dollar IDs and
dollar priorities don't exist in the
database why do they exist here in the
page well that's because when you
synchronize data from the real-time
database to your application it comes
back as a snapshot and a snapshot has
properties like key and priority and if
you want to get the value back from the
snapshot you call the dot Val function
so in any other fire we want to
automatically unwrap the snapshot to get
back the value but having the key and
priority is still really really
important so we surface them through
these dollar properties and these dollar
properties are always stripped from the
clients so
you'll never see them here in the
database and you don't ever have to even
think about maintaining them so to test
out this app I'm going to delete some
data and you can see that it updates in
my app in real time
so now we know that our app is working
so rather than deploying it locally
let's deploy it using firebase hosting
so in the command line I'm just going to
do a firebase deploy and this will
deploy everything in the public folder
and once it's done I can just open up my
hosting site at this URL right here and
just like that we've deployed to
firebase hosting with that sweet SSL
lock so that's how you get started with
angular and firebase and if you want to
learn more then just stay tuned because
we have another screencast that'll take
you deeper with angular fire and also if
you want to learn more in the meantime
