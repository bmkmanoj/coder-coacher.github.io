system that allows users to sign in and
sign up for your application it allows
federated identity through providers
like Facebook Twitter and of course
Google now when doing this your users
generally demand a rich user experience
and providing this as well as solving
identity problems can be a lot of work
luckily for our base off UI it makes all
of this really easy and in this video
I'll show you how to do sign in and sign
up with Google in an Android app as well
as using email password combinations
before we start you'll need to create a
firebase project and then enable
authentication on it the console will
provide you a code snippets that you can
put into your app let's take a look here
you can see I have a project set up in
firebase console I've associated it with
an Android app in the typical way then
in the authentication tab I set up email
password and Google as my sign-in
providers and that's all I need to do in
the console if you don't have it already
be sure to get the Google services JSON
file for your app by going to the app in
the overview and then clicking settings
firebase UI is open source and it
contains a sample app that shows you how
to do sign-in flows you can download the
source code for the app at this link
I'll be using that app to demonstrate
how sign-in works so let's take a look
here's the firebase UI sample app in
action when you start it it will ask if
you want a chat activity an off UI demo
or storage image demo pick the off UI
demo and you'll see this screen I'm
using the Google services JSON file that
I just downloaded from the console and
they're where I picked email and Google
as my authentication providers as such
it will show that the Facebook and
Twitter services are not configured
let's look first at how email sign-in
works so just check email and leave
Google unchecked press start and the
first thing that you might see is a list
like this
this is a list of the emails that I've
configured in smart lock for passwords
ie other emails that are associated with
my main account on this phone it's a
nice shortcut for your users and if they
want to use that one of those emails as
an Associated ID but I'm going to say
none of the above
and what will happen is I can now sign
up with a new email I'll just enter
something and then asked to specify
first and last name as well as the
password for this account remember this
isn't the password for that email
address on its host
it's the password that the person
identified by this email address we'll
use to sign into this app once I save it
I'm asked to save it also with smart
lock I'll say yes I'm now signed into
the app and if I sign out and try to
sign back in again the framework is
smart enough to know that I had
previously tried to sign in with this
identity and it will just allow me to
use it you just saw a lot of
functionality that makes your user
experience a lot easier and you probably
thought that that would take a lot of
code well guess what it really didn't as
much of this flow was handled for you by
the off UI classes let's take a look at
how they did it next in the source code
find the off UI activity it should be in
the comic firebase no UI demo namespace
as you can see here scroll down to find
the sign-in function this is what gets
called when the user clicks the sign-in
button you'll see it starts an activity
for the result from creating an intense
builder for the off UI class this class
is part of the firebase off UI framework
and is completely open-source you can
see it here when we start the activity
we give it a code or C sign in so that
when Android detects an activity results
it will give you a call back with that
activity code and you can see that here
upon the activity being our C sign-in we
call handle sign in response in this
function we simply handle the different
sign-in conditions
if the seinem was canceled or failed for
no network we can show a snack bar
otherwise if it was okay we can start a
new activity the signed-in activity
passing at the data the signed-in
activity renders that you are signed in
message it's really that simple what's
really neat about this code and this
class is that it encapsulates the entire
user flow signing up signing in using
smart lock stuff like that earlier we
left Google turned off so now let's turn
it on and we'll see what it looks like
to go through that user flow and we
didn't write any extra code to do it now
when I run my app I will see that when I
try to sign in that I have two options
I'll pick the sign in with Google one
and I'll get a list of Google accounts I
use on this device there's only one so
let me just pick it you can see that I
get signed in and the basic profile
information from my Google account is
given to the app if I sign out and try
again this time supposing I don't want
to use that account I can select add
account this will take me through the
standard Google flow for either writing
an existing account to this device to
sign into the app or just creating a new
account so if I for example sign in with
a different gmail account
I'll get taken into the app subsequently
when I try to sign in with smartlock or
just Google sign in from the button
I'll get the ability to choose this
account saving me from having to
remember and as I save the password with
smartlock I can sign in without a
password this is optional of course but
I just chose to do it that way and
that's it
that's how easy it is to use the
powerful open source off UI libraries to
add a full sign in sign up experience to
your app that uses the standard Google
workflows or gives you the ability to
have your own email based identity
provider in a way that's simple to
implement and friendly for your users
