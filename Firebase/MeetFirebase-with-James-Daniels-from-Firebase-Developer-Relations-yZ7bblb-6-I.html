when you get the Googlers that make
firebase happen on the show with me
today is James Daniels from the firebase
team James thanks for being on the show
thanks for having me well tell me what
do you do with the firebase - I'm
actually a developer programs engineer
with firebase so what that means is I
actually am developer relations so I get
out there I talk at events I meet
developers and I'm also an individual
contributor so I mostly work on our open
source SDKs okay and the documentation I
guess you work on odd functions yeah
yeah I did quite a bit of work with the
cloud function samples we have some two
dozen examples there
I also did a fair deal work on the
documentation and then did usability
studies into the API and also the
documentation we love the samples I
refer people to those all the time that
answers a lot of they had a lot of fun
filming them - yeah it's nice to
actually get to play with the technology
yeah you're going to make sure it works
before we can actually exactly so often
we get caught up in the building it not
necessarily they're using it and then
we're Deverell comes in yeah we actually
just got done with IO that was Rio from
you actually man for a good part of it
the meet the experts area so where
people came and asked us questions as
fire races they brought out their gnarly
technical questions and we gave a stab
at giving them good answers in the heat
and then I also manned app ship 3000
okay that was our collaborative video
game built on firebase okay you use your
systems direct links to content and
hopefully people will learn something
playing is a yeah and that's a trivia
game too so you know if you have ever
played something like space team that's
very okay sounds like a party game a lot
of yelling and shouting and this is yeah
exactly like that also at i/o you know
after all this on Friday I got a chance
to sit down with a couple of our GT
e--'s I caught them I you know so what's
the GD he has a PL ace come on I'm
telling ya so a GD e is a Google
developer expert so they are an external
developer nan
Googler that has been blessed by Google
to be one of our experts in a certain
knowledge er there's a bunch of
different ones Android Chrome play
firebase IRB IOC right things like that
okay so yeah you took some time to
interview some gdes at i/o so we have
some video of that so why don't we take
a look at that real fast
hey there I'm here at i/o 2017 with
crisp
Estlin from how to firebase.com that is
a cool domain name what's on it how to
firebase comm is all about taking
developers from the docs to actual
production worthy application
architecture what do you do as a gde
aside from out of firebase attend events
like this answer lots of questions
online I try to communicate as much as
possible and help people get started
with firebase
what's a month look like to you right if
it's the month of May obviously I'm at
i/o but in general I try and find
sessions that I do presentations on I
try and interact with the community
spreading the word about firebase a
firebase gde and Brazil tell me a bit
about that I love to do yeah I'm the
first firebase dede in Brazil that's
pretty cool I do a lot of community
stuff go to event conference planning
workshops and teaching people like how
to use firebase features what is your
favorite application of firebase that
you've seen today well Santa's record
for sure awesome Santa tracker is very
cool anything that made your job awesome
or easier I think the one that really
sticks out for me is files functions for
five days at first we had to do a lot of
the development using other Google form
products to build backends for five
based applications but right now it's so
much easier to actually build that
back-end what has been your favorite
talk so far there's so many to pick from
right it was about angular firebase and
progressive web app it's so nice that
you can combine angular CLI firebase to
be a really cool progressive web app you
know because PWA is the thing oh no no
no wait I saw like the firebase hosting
with cloud functions two favorite talks
I don't know if that's a laugh
go go get all right so it looks like you
had a lot of fun there with the enemies
exactly you know as good you know
decompress after yeah a long couple days
and the Sun as you heard they described
a bit about what they do we tend to send
them to events and have them speak and
really help us
firebase developer relations scale
across the entire globe so if someone
wanted to become a GTE what what does
that process look like yeah yeah they
are actually brought to us by our GDG
leads our we she is Google developer
group at Google developer group Hornet
la ok and so you did use real fast what
is what is a Google developer Google
developer group is Google sanctioned
meetups so you'll probably have one in
your nearby community ok yeah well
they're all over the world there's a
bunch of them some of them very very
large some of them smaller so if you're
interested in becoming a GTE it really
starts with getting involved in your
Google developer group in your local
region going to those meetups speaking
where you can and getting to know the
people organizing it because it's them
that need to refer you I see or if
you're friends with a Googler right
right so it sounds like you need to find
one of these GDG let's go I mean I'm
good involved start talking don't wait
for us to call you an expert before you
start acting like one
I hope more people get involved with
that yeah exactly tell me where you from
I'm actually from Maine so New England
boy I hail from the most easterly
sitting in United States Mooseport Maine
Eastport yes okay and it's a small
fishing community my mom's I have family
all fishermen dad's auto mechanic so I'm
a bit of a rebel in terms of using
computers yeah yeah I was a little bit
of a rebel myself how did you end up
getting into computer science or
software engineering
my first experience actually programming
was actually video game modding I got
into it as a command &amp;amp; Conquer monitor
back in the day you know had a lot of
fun with that but wasn't sure if that's
where I wanted to get into until college
so when I went to college University of
Maine I originally thought I wanted to
get into genetics on biology but that
was a lot of
school yeah it bounced around a little
bit ended up in math comps I and then
eventually left school to start my own
startup okay what was that like it
sounds right yeah yeah it was bun timing
with the financial crisis and all but we
managed to build a cool application had
a lot of users who's a golfing startup
and that went on for a couple years and
eventually crashed and burned is most
kind of yeah right about that but I
learned a lot okay well yeah yeah what
did what came from all that for you I'd
say startups you know they tend not to
fail because of the technology they fail
for you know reasons around people and
not knowing the product and the fits and
you know it's really the lesson is you
know get out there meet people talk to
them and build the right thing as a
programmer you often get caught up in
debating algorithms and speed and you
know ultimately if you're not building
the right thing then there has to be a
product exactly I don't have to use it
someone has to pay money for yeah well
James thanks for being on the show
