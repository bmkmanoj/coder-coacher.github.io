getting started with the firebase
platform in your app well you've come to
the right place there are two main parts
to getting the firebase platform up and
running adding your app to the firebase
console and installing the SDK let's go
over these one at a time for starters
let's go to the firebase console at this
URL here depending on when you're
watching this video the UI might look
slightly different but the general
concepts should remain the same now
depending on your situation you might
see a blank create a new project screen
or you might see a list of existing
projects Oh before we go further let me
take a moment to explain the difference
between projects and apps a project
consists of one or more apps now all the
apps in the same project use the same
firebase database back-end and if you
want you can use features like firebase
Cloud messaging to talk to all of them
at once you don't have to but you can
which is sometimes convenient so if
you're a developer that has a
cross-platform app you generally want to
put the iOS and Android versions of your
app in the same project now that will
give you some nice cross-platform
benefits your user can access the same
data if they switch back and forth
between the iOS and Android versions of
your app things like dynamic links will
work across both platforms you can send
one notification to all versions of your
app and so on on the other hand
completely different apps you should put
those in completely different projects
there's nothing gained by cramming them
into the same project except tears and
heartache I guess so if you're working
on a cross-platform app and your Android
or web team has already created a
firebase project you should probably
select that project and connect your iOS
app in there otherwise if you're the
first one to be adding firebase II
capabilities to your app you can be the
one to create the new project in my case
I'm the first app associated with the
project so I'm going to create a new
project here I'll give it a name and
there we go once you've selected or
created a project you're going to want
to connect your client app I'm going to
select the iOS button here and I'll give
it my apps bundle ID you are eventually
going to need to add your app store ID
here if you want features like firebase
invites or dynamic links to work but you
can leave this blank for now and change
it later now when you click continue
your browser should automatically
download this Google services info
plist file for you note that it needs to
be named this exactly so if you get that
little one in parentheses after the name
like I just did you're going to need to
do a little bit of renaming in finder
okay next up drag the file into your
Xcode project like so and let me go back
to the console and hit continue here and
it's telling us that this would be a
good time to install the firebase
cocoapods now I'm assuming you know
something about firebase cocoapods but
if you don't here's a little video for
you to check out it's fun so I'm going
to jump into my project directory here
and do a little pod in it will open up
the file and I'm going to uncomment this
line because I am using Swift and this
line because my app happens to have a
base SDK of 8.0 although at the time of
this recording firebase is supported as
far back as seven dotto next up let's
add some pods now it's important to
remember that to keep your app nice and
spelt you should only install the cocoa
pods for features that you need in fact
there is no all-encompassing goober fire
based cocoa pod that installs everything
for you you're going to need to pod
install each individual feature and you
can find a full list of the cocoa pods
and the features they correspond to over
here now for starters I'm just going to
add firebase slash core which includes
everything needed to get the basics up
and running and also enables firebase
analytics so now I'll make sure my
project is closed
I'll run pod install and then let's open
up the generated workspace all right
we'll build it make sure everything
compiles okay and it does so we can move
on to the next step okay looks like the
last step here is to add some
initialization code I recommend putting
this in your app delegate did finish
launching method first things first
let's import firebase in my app delegate
note that this is usually the only thing
I'll ever need to import no matter what
we've installed we're doing some pretty
nifty work behind the scenes to make
sure this works properly I know this
sounds like the exact opposite of my
only pod install what you need advice
from like two minutes ago
but trust me here this makes development
a whole lot easier alright so next up
we'll add the line for app configure to
make sure firebase gets set up properly
and that's actually all you need to do
this configure method we'll take a look
at what libraries you have installed
initialize them grabbing all the
appropriate constants from
at Google services file that you dragged
in earlier into your Xcode project so
we'll give it a quick run and if
everything is set up and working
correctly you should see a few lines in
your console about how firebase
analytics is up and running
alright so congratulations you are now
up and running with firebase so there
are a lot of places you can go from here
you can add sign in using firebase auth
or get your app talking to the real-time
database or start tracking more of your
users usage with firebase analytics you
can check out these links to get started
and have a little fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
