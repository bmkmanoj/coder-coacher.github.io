listening experience could be outside of
the radio it's the radio but better it
has all of the great stuff that we've
spent 40 years perfecting with NPR 1 we
see the opportunity of reaching a more
diverse audience that have a device in
their pocket at all times my name is
Mike safely in the lead mobile developer
for NPR digital media my name is Nick to
pray and I'm the innovation accountant
at NPR
my name is aja Smith Street and I'm a
senior product manager of NPR work
there's some of the biggest challenges
and any mobile app are that first
impression when the user first installs
the app you've got a very limited amount
of time convince them to keep the app
and to get engaged in the experience
trying to figure out how we can get
users into the content as quickly as
possible was the real focus of
integrating firebase and dynamic links
using dynamic links we were able to
shorten a number of interactions it
takes for a user installing the app to
get from the promoted content to the
content from 20 to 3 so that user is
able to get right into the content we're
driving more and more listening for user
every week it's really astounding
creating playlists of content that are
configured by the podcaster or by a
member station or by us internally and
with firebase we have that in our hands
having the analytics product interact
with things like dynamic links remote
configuration cloud messaging it adds a
real multiplier effect and the
integration with the broader firebase
suite I don't have to go outside the
platform to figure out what's working so
it's not just about shipping the product
faster
it's about analyzing the results faster
and that the integration with all the
other firebase products we're really
excited about
