another episode of hash tag ask firebase
my name is David and fun facts about me
I have two small kids so I pretty much
don't ever sleep so we had a lot of
great questions that came in this week
and if you still have questions that we
want answered just make sure to go onto
g+ twitter youtube Stack Overflow and
just use the hashtag s firebase and we
will try to get to them but let's dive
into what we have this week hello mom no
no I'm recording no so the first
question comes in on Twitter from me on
and me on asks what is dynamic links can
you give me an example
beyond yes I can think about a regular
link so you go to Google calm in your
web browser and that takes you to Google
and the great thing about links are is
that you can go to specific parts of a
web page let's say you're building a
social media app and you want to provide
a link that maps to a user's profile
well you just go to my app comm slash
the users ID and it takes them right to
their profile but what do you well in
apps this is known as a deep link a deep
link can take you to any part of the app
rather than just launching up on the
home screen so while deep links are
really useful they can be really
difficult to configure cross-platform
and what happens if the user doesn't
have your app installed so dynamic links
really fixes this problem so a dynamic
link is a deep link with behavior that
you can customize so if the user clicks
on a dynamic link in an iOS app or an
Android app or even a web browser you
can do different things on each platform
and if the user doesn't have your app
installed you can change the behavior
for that so you can take them out to
your website to the Play Store or even
show them an interstitial letting them
know how awesome your app is and then
what's great is that if they download
your app all the information that is in
this link is still retained when they
launch the app so you can give them a
specific first time experience or send
them to the part of the app that they
are actually interested in the first
place you can view all these statistics
in the firebase console as well so if
you want to get started we have great
documentation on that which the links
are in the description that was a really
really good question me on
question time that's what's up I've been
asked what is the scope of a real-time
database listener if the app is closed
will the listener still sync the data
that's a really really good question
Ivan actually if the app is closed the
real-time database will not synchronize
the data and that's a good thing because
if your app is closed you shouldn't be
resynchronizing that data because that
data is downloaded over the network
which takes up battery so if your app is
closed you don't really want to do that
and you're gonna save the user some
battery but sometimes you are going to
want to be able to refresh the data
while the apps in the background and for
that you can use firebase Cloud
messaging firebase called messaging
allows you to send downstream messages
and this will wake up the app and allow
you to do a background refresh and if
you want to see how you can do that it's
available for both iOS and Android
she's check out the link in the
description on getting started beautiful
question Ivan come on monkey this is
there another question in here yeah
there is so the next question comes from
the musical I Guerra I think that's what
that is I wanted to know if there's a
way to associate firebase database with
firebase storage when making firebase
Storage rules mom so the user wants to
know how I map the stuff and firebase
storage together ok so just share the
same page structure ok all right cool
Thanks so this is a really good question
because security is a big deal so the
firebase database and firebase storage
both use references and references are
mapped to URL paths so if you use the
same data structure on the firebase
database as you do in firebase storage
it makes creating the rules for these
really easy because the security rules
they map rules at the paths for instance
let's say you're storing user data in
the real time database and you're
storing their photos in firebase storage
well in the real time database you can
store data at slash users slash one and
that's all the data for the user with
the UID of one and to get their profile
photo all you have to do is go to
firebase storage and store data at slash
users slash one dot jpg and then now the
rules for these two are really easy
because you're mapping into the same
path fantastic question the musical I
Gera Simon simply said so this next
question actually was asked three times
this week it's how do i order data in
descending order by date from the
real-time data bits this is a really
good question because by default the
real-time database returns everything in
ascending order so to get a good picture
of it let's take a look at this data
structure so this is just a list of
items and we have two items item one in
item two you can see that they have a
title and a timestamp and if I want to
get them back by ascending order then I
can do a query ordered by value and just
pass through the timestamp but for
descending order I can do a little trick
and what I can do instead of having a
timestamp field I can also have a
negative timestamp field that is just
the timestamp but as a negative value so
now when I do an order by child of the
negative timestamp it returns everything
in descending order so good question -
all three of you Marco Chris and to you
on Stack Overflow super Silex mom I'm
not done yet and another question so
this next question comes from Rafael and
Rafael wants to know how to use firebase
storage in angularfire - hey each go I
have question on angularfire - stop
calling you okay beds as you said last
time you meant it okay all right so
right now angularfire - doesn't have
support for firebase storage and we are
working on it but what's great about
angular 2 is is that you don't have to
use angular fire - for everything you
can actually just use the regular
JavaScript SDK so let's take a look at
this component right here in this
component all we have to do in the
constructor is create a storage
reference out to our file and then just
call the get download URL method and
this method returns to us a promise with
the string URL and then from here we can
store this as a property to our
components
and then in our template we can just
bind to this image tag right here to the
source and it will display our image
from firebase storage so the great thing
about angular 2 is is that you can use
the regular firebase jeaious library and
it'll work just fine so great question
Raphael I'm a question answering machine
so the next question comes from Gustavo
on Twitter could you tell us some great
companies that use firebase
well yes Gustavo I would love to so
pickle aaj is a photo collage app that
has more than 120 million downloads and
they use firebase also there is fabulous
which is a great habit breaking app
which you should totally go and download
Shazam uses firebase and like seriously
who doesn't know Shazam and Skyscanner
is also one of the best travel searching
apps out there and they use firebase and
NPR uses firebase in their MPR one app
and if you want to see more companies
that use firebase go to our website at
firebase that Google com
and we have a whole list of them there
so great question Gustavo so the next
question comes from Ian and Ian asks
David are you going to start using a
helmet when you skateboard and yeah
so this last question comes from
francesco on twitter and francesco asks
how can i login with a custom token
using the firebase nodejs SDK so
francesco if you're want to get started
with nodejs and firebase obviously
you're gonna need your own server
because you know it's the node j/s sdk
but would you have that it's a pretty
simple process after you've installed
the node sdk there's a method called
create custom token and this takes in a
UID and this UID is whatever your users
UID is so if you're coming from your own
system or your own back-end system you
populate this with their unique
identifier and there's also an optional
second parameter to this method which is
additional claims and these claims are
properties that you can actually use in
the firebase security rules so this is
really powerful for when you're securing
your data in the real time database and
this will spit out to you a token that
you're going to send down to the clients
and then once you're on the client all
you have to do is call the method sign
in with custom token with that token and
your user is logged in so from Jessica
all we have to do is call create custom
token pass in any additional claims take
that token send it to the client and
login fantastic question
so that's all the questions this time
thank you all so much for sending them
in and remember you can keep cinnamon
use the hashtag ask firebase it's been
amazing to see these questions that just
benefit the community and everyone
around them I mean I honestly have
looked at some of the questions and I'm
like how would you do that and so I've
learned a lot too so thank you everyone
so if you found this video helpful
please subscribe and that's all for this
week I will see you guys next time
on hashtag ask firebase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
