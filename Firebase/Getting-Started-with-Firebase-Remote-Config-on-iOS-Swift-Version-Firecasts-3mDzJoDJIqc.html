interested in getting started with
remote config on iOS well you've come to
the right place let's update our app
from the cloud on this episode of fire
cast so here's an app I'm going to
configure using firebase remote config
I've got a button here my view
controller and often the code you can
see that I've gone ahead and added both
the button as an IV outlet as well as
the constraint that positions it near
the top of the screen now in the course
of this video we're going to do three
things first we're going to take our two
values the text of this button and the
constant of our constraint and supply
them to remote config as defaults second
will ask remote config to download new
values from the cloud if they exist and
third we'll wire up our app to use these
new values that we can change the look
of our button from the firebase console
without having to touch our app so go
ahead and get your own app to follow
along with as long as you have a few
values of your own to play with you
should be just fine now I've already
gone ahead and created a project in the
firebase console add in my Google
services plist file to my Xcode project
installed firebase through cocoa pods
and initialized firebase if you don't
know what I'm talking about you should
check out this video first that's for
the rest of you let's get hacking so
first up we need to make sure remote
config is actually installed so go to
your pod file and add in the line pod
firebase slash remote config if it's not
there yet we'll save and run a pod
install keep do-do and then open up your
XE workspace okay we're ready to use
remote config but before we do let's
take a moment to understand a little
about how remote config generally works
so with remote config you first start
off by giving it a bunch of default
values stored as key value pairs and
these are just defined locally by your
app either in a dictionary or a plist
file next you tell remote config to
fetch updated values from the cloud very
often this will be a subset of the
default values here right you only need
to supply ones where the values that
you're downloading are different from
the defaults you supplied locally wrote
config will then keep these values in
kind of a cached holding pattern on the
device until you tell it to apply them
and the reason these values don't get
applied automatically is that you could
get into weird situations when your
app's values change we are not expecting
them to
so when you tell remote can sync to
activate these recently downloaded
values they will then be applied on top
of whatever values you already have then
when you ask to retrieve a value for a
certain key remote config will either
give you the default value or some newer
value that you've downloaded from the
cloud and apply it on top and so our
recommendation here is go ahead and put
all the values you might ever want to
change into this dictionary all your
hard-coded strings magic numbers
anything you've gotten that app constant
Swift file that you know we all have in
our app somewhere remember because
you're only downloading values from the
cloud that are different from your
defaults this won't really increase the
size of your network calls but it will
give you the flexibility to change any
of these values later if you want you
don't want to be in position three
months down the road when you decide oh
I really should change the speed of my
animation and then you realize you
haven't wired up those values to use
remote config make sense all right well
let's try that now with our app so I'm
going to jump into my view controller
here and before I do anything else let's
go ahead and import firebase remember
this is the only importing I need to do
no matter what firebase cocoapods I've
got installed next I'll create a set up
remote config defaults method in which
I'll supply my default values now there
are a couple of ways you can set up
default values in your remote config you
can add them through a plist or you can
use a dictionary of strings and NS
objects and I'm going to go with the
dictionary approach here so let's create
our default values with our button text
equal to default text and our button
constraint constant key equal to 50 and
yes if this were real app I wouldn't
want to be typing out the names of these
keys like that that's bad form I would
use an enum instead next up we can
access remote config which we always do
through the remote configured singleton
instance and then we'll call set
defaults and pass along our dictionary
okay so far so good now that we have
these defaults we'll fetch in any new
values from the cloud so let's create a
second fetch remote config method to do
that so one method you could call at
this point is fetch with completion
Handler that method by default will only
fetch new values if the ones that
already has are more than 40 3,200
seconds old that's 12 hours to you and
me but that's kind of a long time to
wait if you're trying to test out remote
config
your app so instead we can call fetch
with expiration duration completion
Handler and give our expiration duration
a value of say zero seconds to make sure
we always fetch a new version
normally this would cause our app to get
throttled pretty badly by the remote
config library but you can fix this by
turning on developer mode which will
increase this calls per user throttle
locally on the device so I'll create a
settings object with developer mode
enabled set to true we'll set our config
settings to be this new object and we're
good to go this will let your apps fetch
remote config file use a lot more
frequently before it gets throttled but
don't do this in production or you'll
start hitting the server-side throttle
and remote config will stop working in
fact let's put in a big old fix me to
remind myself later to take this out
anyway we can now go ahead and fetch
these values so let's tackle our
completion Handler and I'm going to use
the trailing closure method here which
is what all the cool kids do these days
so first I'll confirm that we don't have
any errors and then next we'll print out
a happy little message to our console
and then we will call activate fetch
remember this call is what tells remote
config that it's okay to take these
values that we fetch from the cloud and
apply them on top of our current values
and then let's make sure we call this
after we set our defaults and now we can
run it and all right we can see that
we've successfully made a call to the
Internet awesome of course we're not
actually doing anything with any of
these values and remote config so our
app looks exactly the same as before
which is kind of boring so let's tackle
that step next I'm going to create a
method called update view with our C
values which will basically set my
button text and constraints based on the
values I get back from remote config and
I'm going to call it in two places
first down here right after I set up my
default values and then again here in my
fetch callback so that I can apply any
new values that might have come in now
remember calling self from within a
block like this could lead to a retain
cycle so just to be safe let's add in a
week reference to self like this okay
time to fill out this method so grabbing
values from Robo config is pretty
straightforward you're going to call the
config value for key method which
retrieves the corresponding value from
remote config you can also access these
values directly with bracket notation
like
so now these values have a type of
remote config it's basically a wrapper
around your value which is like a UTF
encoded string but you'll almost never
use this type directly instead you're
going to call one of its follow-up
methods string value number value data
value boom value etc to convert it to a
useable data type now it's up to you to
know what type of value you're expecting
and call the appropriate method so that
remote config can parse it correctly
let's do that so going back to my app
here I'm now going to grab remote config
config value for key button text string
value and this comes back with an
optional string remember the wrote
config library has no idea if the key
that I'm providing actually exists so
I'm going to use the double question
mark operator here to give it a default
value of empty string if for some weird
reason this comes back as nil and now I
can set that as our buttons title for
control state normal and then let's get
our buttons constraint constant I'm
going to use the brackets notation here
so you can see it in action
very exciting we'll get its number value
which is an NS number and then float
value well said that is our constraint
constant and now let's run it again all
right now you can see that my buttons
text and position are being set by the
remote config object it's pulling all of
its values from the defaults right now
so all we're seeing are the defaults but
let's see what happens if I set these
values in the firebase console I'm going
to head over to the firebase console for
my project and we're going to select the
remote config tab you can see that I'm
being asked to create my first parameter
so let's do that
the key parameter here is really just
the name of the key I want to change and
so I'll start by adding button text here
and we'll change its value to hello
from the cloud and that's it I'll
publish my changes then we'll go back
into my app and run it again and check
it out we got some new values and for
fun let's change the value of this
constraint constant to we'll go back to
the firebase console add an entry for my
button constraint constant we'll publish
it and then go back and we'll just
restart my app I'm going to kill it and
run it directly from the simulator I
don't even need to run it from Xcode and
whoo look at that button scoot down so
exciting so you may have noticed there
was
tiny moment when my text flickered from
the default value to the latest values
after it loaded them from the wrote
config service and that's because I
called applied fetched and then update
my view immediately after fetching them
instead of waiting for a more opportune
moment now obviously this can lead to
some awkward user experiences so there
are better ways to load and apply your
values from remote config and as it
turns out I have a whole other video all
about it you should check it out but
that there is the basics of remote
config for you there are certainly some
other topics to cover including
delivering different values to different
users running an a/b test and applying
fetch data intelligently so you don't
get that little flicker when your app
gets new values all of which are very
good topics for other videos in the
meantime please check out the remote
consume inton and go configure your apps
from the cloud mmm thank you very much
for watching once the more exciting
fighter based content well check out
