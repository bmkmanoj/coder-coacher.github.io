I have a quick and easy fire cast for
you we're gonna get up and running with
firebase and the web and this is
actually gonna be the first of many
screencasts in a series so make sure you
subscribe to get notified of tutorials
on authentication storage hosting and
web push notifications with firebase
Cloud messaging also if you're a fan of
JavaScript frameworks I'm gonna be
dropping videos for angular 1 and 2
polymer react an ember so you better
subscribe because you don't want to miss
those but today we're going to start
with the very basics I'm going to show
you some mad copy and pasting skills by
getting the project initialization code
from the firebase console and then we're
going to set up a small web app so let's
go and dive in so I'm in the firebase
console at console firebase google.com
you can see I'm logged in as myself up
here just smiling at you but to get
started I'm going to create a new
project so I'm going to click create new
project I'm going to call it web
QuickStart and then we'll create it my
project is now created so I'm going to
click Add firebase to your web app and
this brings up a little model with all
the initialization code I need to get
started it has things like my API key
auth domain database URL and storage
bucket so I can go to the bottom right
and then I can click copy' and that's
all the code I need to get started but
just as a little fYI you can access all
of this information by clicking off and
then going up to the top right where
there's web setup but now to the editor
so here on my editor I'm going to get
crazy I'm going to create this web page
from scratch so I'll start with my basic
HTML boilerplate to give it a title and
now I can just paste in all the code
from the console and this is all you
need to get started and just to prove
that it works I'm going to use the
database as a little tiny demo so I'm
going to create an h1 and give it an ID
and every single time the value changes
and the rails
database I'm going to sync it to this h1
so the first thing I need to do is get
that h1 by its ID and then now I'm going
to create a database reference using
firebase database ref and then create a
child location to the text location now
I can synchronize any changes using the
on function and then using es2015 arrow
functions I can just do it all in one
line so to the left right here I have my
projects in the firebase console and to
the right is just my blank page to use
the database I'm going to remove all
security so I'm going to click rules and
then I'm going to say read is true and
write is true and click publish you
should totally know that you only do
this while you're developing because
that means anyone can read or write to
your database so now I'm going to give
my browser a refresh and then I'm going
to add a text location and it
synchronizes to the browser and so I can
change it and then it changes as well so
keep in mind that the real-time database
is just one of the many features
firebase offers for the web you can also
use authentication storage hosting and
even firebase cloud messaging so that's
all text a good start a firebase in the
web and if you want to go and learn more
then check out the link in the
description for our official
documentation and if you're super
excited to learn more about firebase on
the web then please subscribe to our
channel because we're gonna have tons of
more content so that's all for this time
and I will see you all later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
