cast my name is Doug Stevenson and I'll
show you how you can get started
monitoring crashes in your Android app
with firebase crash porting in managing
you've spent a lot of time developing
and testing your Android app and you've
just published it's the Play Store for
everyone to use
now obviously you want your users to
have the best possible experience with
your app so if there's a bug that causes
problems in it you need to know that as
soon as possible so you can fix it to
help with this you can integrate the
firebase crash reporting SDK with a
single line of configuration before you
publish if you haven't integrated any
other firebase features in your app yet
watch this other video first to get
started then you can follow along here
to use firebase crash reporting I
already have an app that's using
firebase so I'll integrate crash
reporting into that I'm going to open my
apps build.gradle and find the project
dependencies block then I'll add the
dependency for firebase crash reporting
the latest version at the time of this
recording is 1001 you should find and
use the latest version then I'll synch
my project and that's it
adding the dependency is all you have to
do if you want to record when your app
crashes there are no additional lines of
code to write it just works whenever an
exception is thrown that crashes your
app you receive that exception with its
full stack trace in the firebase console
to improve on that there are some
additional things you can do with a few
lines of code using the firebase crash
reporting API for example you can log
messages that will appear in a crash
report so you can get some more context
into what was happening just before the
crash and you can report exceptions that
you catch if you don't know how to
handle them these will show up as
non-fatal reports in the console
typically you don't need to report
caught exceptions but it can be useful
for diagnosing rare or unexpected
problems I'll add some of these calls
right now first I'll add a line of code
to log a message that I know will happen
just before I report an exception then
I'll report a fake exception that I'll
create on my own it works the same as if
I had caught the exception inside a
try-catch now I'll build and launch the
app and examine the log file if I want
to see the report for this I'll load up
firebase console for my app and select
crash reporting on the left
you can see that the console for my app
now shows my exception as a non fatal
error that didn't crash the app if I
click into it I can see details about
the device in this case we see it's from
my emulator the full stack trace is also
there in addition to the message I
logged after I fix the problem I can
close this issue with the close button
so it won't show again when a new crash
is discovered by firebase crash
reporting i'll also receive an email
notification this email gives me some
basic details about the crash and a
button to collect a view and in the
console it should take less than a
minute for a report to show up in the
console after it's sent when you're
trying this yourself be sure to have a
good network connection and also try
launching the application again to make
sure any unsent reports have a chance to
make it to the console a new app like
mine doesn't have very many interesting
crashes to view but you can use the
firebase demo app to view much more
interesting data you can get read-only
access to that project by using the link
in the description below the demo app is
called flooded by lab pixies which is a
game that you can download from the Play
Store let's see what crash reports look
like for that app right now this project
has both an Android app and an iOS app
associated with it and I'm going to
choose to view the crashes for the
Android version here we can see the
recent history of crashes with details
in the table below sorted by the number
of times each has occur if I click one
it will show me the stack trace and if I
click view details it will show me some
statistics about this particular error
notice that you can view each and every
occurrence of this crash by clicking the
arrows this entire collection of crashes
is called an issue and an issue is
formed based on crashes that are similar
to each other they all represent the
same error but the stack trace and
device details may be slightly different
from each other for an individual crash
you can see detailed information about
the device at the time of the crash in
this particular error the most helpful
part of the stack trace happens to be
hidden so I'm going to expand that here
you can see that the problem starts in
the extra steps activity and it's on
resume method if I scroll down further I
can see a log of what happened just
before the crash here there are a bunch
of log items that were automatically
created from firebase Analytics events
at the time the
these events are logged automatically
you don't have to write any code to make
this happen and that's a basic tour of
firebase crash reporting but there's a
few more things you need to know before
you publish your app to the Play Store
first be sure to separate your
development environment from your
production environment the usual way to
do that is to create a whole new
firebase project for each type of build
that way any crashes that occur while
developing your app will remain separate
from those that happen to your users in
production you can read this blog post
to get more information about that
second if you're using ProGuard to
obfuscate and shrink your code you'll
need to upload the mapping style
generated for the build that you publish
to the store you can either upload it to
the console or use a Gradle plugin to
run a test that performs the upload be
sure to read the documentation about
that because you won't be able to read
your stack traces without uploading the
correct mapping file if you have any
questions about firebase crash reporting
reach out to us on twitter with the
hashtag ask firebase or any of the
firebase support channels my name is
Doug Stevenson thanks for watching and
be sure to squash all those well thanks
for watching our video check out some
