another episode of hash tag ask firebase
and today is a great episode because we
have v1 the only Fontaine Foxworth who
works on the firebase analytics team fun
fact about Fontaine
she has a n-c-double-a championship ring
in men's volleyball and one of my
favorite things oh oh and also she's a
prize-winning crow Cher
I would love it also one more thing
she's a state champion mathlete Fontaine
Fox with everyone so we got a lot of
great questions this week on Twitter
Stack Overflow and YouTube all with the
hashtag ask firebase and they're all
firebase analytics specific this week
and if you want your question but in
fact about Dave Dave actually used to be
left-handed but he no longer is you win
Fontana you win
so Fontaine should we dive in yeah let's
do it question time so the first
question that we got submitted was from
huh guy on Twitter and huh guy wrote
we're building an Android SDK we need
analytics for us and for our customers
does it make sense to use firebase
analytics so certainly your customers
should definitely be using firebase
analytics it's built for app developers
but we also know that sometimes app
developers are sensitive to adding too
many SDKs to their app so you could also
integrate with Google tag manager so
that way they're not adding an
additional SDK to their app rather
they're using this common data layer
that's being collected by firebase
analytics and then sending it to any of
the relevant third parties that need
that data so you could still have your
cake and eat it too
I love eating cake thanks a guy for
submitting that question super awesome
more questions
so this next question comes in from Russ
and Russ ass so we had Google Analytics
you know for apps for awhile so why do
we have firebase analytics so when we
were talking to app developers many of
them had Google Analytics in their app
what they weren't necessarily using it
to make decisions for their app and we
found it's because they didn't feel like
it was truly built for mobile and so
when we set out to build firebase
analytics we knew we wanted to build
something that was explicitly for mobile
so it's a lot simpler it's very event
based it's no longer revolving around
pageviews we also have metrics that are
specific to mobile things like our poo
or Mau these are terms and concepts that
come up a lot in mobile tracking but
aren't as common on the web and another
thing on Google Analytics it all
revolves around session based tracking
but when we are talking to our app
developers they really wanted to get
more of a notion of user based tracking
better than session based tracking so we
really pivoted to focus on user metrics
focus on mobile metrics and really bring
more of a mobile experience to our
analytics product great question Russ
thank us by my calculations it's time
for another question the next question
that we had was submitted by Cameron and
he wrote in I see some highlights that
firebase also does marketing analytics
and AD tracking what do you mean by that
what we mean is some analytics tools are
just tracking what's happening inside
your app how many level ups a user might
accomplish or how long they're sticking
around during a given session but with
marketing analytics what we're trying to
bring in is an understanding of how
users got to your app in the first place
what were the channels or sources that
we're actually driving them to your app
was it push notifications was it a
particular ad was it a link that they
clicked on in an email all of these
things they should be able to get
insights into whether you're a PM or a
marketer so you're not just looking at
what's happening in the app but you can
see how the users got there as well
thanks for that question cameron temple
but i'll approxima if I go that see so
the next question comes from my and my
ass what makes firebase analytics
YOUnique excellent question so when we
set out to build firebase analytics a
while ago we asked developers what tools
are they using for analytics and what we
would hear was people were listing out
four or five different types of
analytics solutions that they were using
to do different things so maybe they had
crash reporting push notification
analytics behavioral analytics marketing
analytics each one of these were often
logging very similar events but being
used by different people in the
organization so fire bants analytics is
unique because we're trying to tackle a
lot of different types of analytics in a
single tool so it doesn't matter what
role in the organization you are anybody
should be able to do what they need to
do in firebase analytics whether you're
a developer product manager or marketing
manager great question my more questions
so the next question comes in from Steve
and Steve asks can firebase Analytics
bring in data from AdMob and play yes
actually in fact we already have
integrations with both AdMob and play if
you go into the account settings part of
firebase you can actually link to AdMob
and link to play now we want to make
sure that you have all of your data in a
single centralized place even today you
can see some of your in-app purchase
data that's being processed by Google
Play showing up in firebase analytics so
that's just the beginning of a lot of
exciting plans that we have to continue
to bring in additional metrics into
firebase so that you no longer have to
be going to several different interfaces
to actually get at the data you want so
if I just have an AdMob account just
like click button link it and yes
exactly that's what's that great
question Steve next question so the next
question comes from Joe on Twitter and
Joe asked how does firebase analytics
come up with gender data it's a pretty
good question so it's actually all an
approximation remember Google is an
advertising company so we've got a
pretty good understanding of how through
all these ads that are being shown
across thousands of apps in the industry
how users are actually behaving and
navigating through these apps so we're
able to approximate different
demographic data like age and interests
so you might notice it doesn't line up
one-to-one with whatever's in your own
internal database but that's of course
because
that's not what we're reporting on it's
the behavioral analytics that we're able
to approximate based on what we can
understand about what users are doing
great question Joe and that was a really
good answer you want your question
answered make sure to reach out to us on
Twitter Stack Overflow and YouTube just
use the hashtag ask firebase so that's
all and we will see you next week same
time on hashtag a spy base what is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
