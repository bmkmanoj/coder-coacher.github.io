you will remember I think ok hello
everybody my name is Ron and I work in
the developer relations at Google I
spend most of my time on Launchpad lunch
by these Google developers global
startup program today I'd like to share
with you some of the things that we've
learned working with startups globally
mainly common challenges related to the
never-ending question of what should we
build next I will also share with you
some best practices that we know that
are working for startups and how we can
leverage firebase to use them let's take
a quick look at launchpad so today we
operate in more than 30 countries we
work in 2015 we worked with 6,000
startups worldwide and we provided more
than 50,000 hours of one-on-one
mentorship
now through those 50,000 hours of
mentorship we've learned what drives
startup success and what doesn't what
works and what don't what doesn't work
now we know that startups are not the
same okay you can say they all start up
the same but there are some common
challenges and problems that every
startup needs to solve first there is
the technical challenge can we build it
next there is the product challenge all
right we can build it do people need it
will they use it next there is the
market challenge
all right we've built it there are some
people who need it they want to use it
can we reach them it's not that trivial
first challenge is the scale challenge
when you think about it
startup scales is almost any aspects
from users to number of employees to
operations how do you do that and still
maintain your insanity and last but not
least the financial challenge how do you
make that profitable how do you make
money out of your app or your business
today I'm going to focus mainly on the
product challenge or the way I like to
call it how to build products that
people need that people actually use now
usually when I talk about the product
challenge people automatically think
that it's related only to early-stage
startups to teams that didn't release
the product yet that are seeking product
market fit those three guys with a mac
and a hoodie walking down University
Avenue in Palo Alto but the truth is
that product challenge is a never-ending
challenge and you live it every single
day in this amazing journey of building
successful products that drives
successful businesses it doesn't matter
if you have zero users 10k users or ten
million users you keep asking yourself
what should I build now and I'd like to
start and sharing a story with you it's
a story about good
friend of mine she was supposed to be
here but you couldn't make it I'd like
you to introduce you to Ronnie now
Ronnie is awesome she is super smart
she writes Android code she writes iOS
code and she has this lovely dog named
Nala and Nala loves Android she also
likes to run outside to go and long
walks hang out in the park and Ally is a
very playful dog and very super friendly
dog she likes to play with other dogs as
well so one day Ronnie thought hey why
don't I build these hyper local social
networks for dogs and their owners and
you know what being this super awesome
girl that's exactly what you did she
said that on over weekend and came up
with this app that basically lets you
see other dog owners walking other dogs
around you so you can know when to walk
the dog and potentially make new friends
for you and your pet and she released
this what you might call MVP and
suddenly boom she tweets about it some
bloggers picks that up and suddenly
ronnie has 20,000 installs five
thousands daily active users people who
use her product use this MVP every
single day she lands herself two hundred
thousand dollars in seed money quit the
job and focuses on adding features in
other word words building her product
now Ronnie is smart I've said that in
fact I can't say that too many times and
she knows everything about Lean Startup
and she knows she needs to validate
things she knows needs to do user
research and that's exactly the very
first thing that she is doing she built
this amazing landing page again
featuring Nala telling people about the
product that she's about to release and
allowing them to leave their email
address if they're interested to hear
more about it or join a private beta and
of course she checks conversion rates
then she sends out some potent if
occations to her
users asking them hey would you like to
get vet recommendations based on user
ratings would you like to see that or
that in the app and users can say yes or
no and of course she checks conversion
rates lastly just to be extra sure she
went out and she speaks with her users
like in the real world speaking with
them she buys them coffee she shows them
her mock-ups and she asked them asked
asked them three questions would you use
it would you pay for it and how much
will you pay for it based on on her user
research she builds what she thinks is a
great product she publishes it on App
Store and Google Play she is ready to
take off but unfortunately she crashes
she didn't get the traction that she
wants now let's see and let's take a
look at what went wrong here the very
first thing drona did was using a
landing page she used it in order to
figure out if people want such an app if
they if people need it but in fact
landing page can answer only one single
question are people interested enough to
give me their email address it doesn't
say anything about do people need it and
will people use it the second thing that
Ronnie did is listening to her users
either in person or via push
notifications but the very first rule in
user research is never listen to users I
know it sounds funny but bear with me
for a moment never listen to your users
instead watch and observe their behavior
the reason is that we human being we're
very bad at predicting our own behavior
there is almost zero correlation between
what we say we will do and what we
actually
do psychologists note that user research
is now that developers don't so I'm here
to help
let's see what Ronnie could have done
differently I'd like to introduce you to
a mythology proved to be working build
experiment optimize now being an
engineer I feel very comfortable with
the build stuff to me writing code is
not a job it's a hobby it's something
that I like to do and I you know that's
my sweet spot and I'm pretty sure I'm
not the only one in the room so let's
move to experiment what is a good
experiment what do I want what AM what
am I looking for in my experiments a
good experiment is fast I want to get
results quickly I don't want to wait
forever to figure out what my next move
is a good experiment is efficient I'd
like to be able to run experiments
without investing a lot of manpower I'd
like to run experiment it doesn't matter
if I if we're talking about a small team
or a big team ideally one person will be
able to run multiple and manage multiple
experiments simultaneously and last but
not least good experiments provide me
with real data what your users remember
be observe their behavior we want we act
upon real data and not gut feeling I
need a system that will allow me to
track data analyze it and act upon it
all in one place make data-driven
decisions now unfortunately if you
wanted to run experiments you'd have to
use multiple products from analytics to
a/b systems to push analytics to whatnot
that means that you need to integrate
multiple SDKs into your apps Android and
iOS
that means that you need to write some
code in your server-side that means that
you need to face some data integration
issue and deal with data discrepancies
between system it means that you don't
have one single place with all the data
well there was the situation
till we announced firebase today so if
you've been to the keynote today you've
probably heard about firebase if you
haven't been to the keynote I suggest
you get up go outside find a trying time
travel machine go back in time to watch
the keynote because the keynote was
awesome and for the keynote there is a
t-shirt here all right you know what can
I get a hell yeah for the keynote all
right let's do it be testing this this
side can I get a hell yeah what about
that side t-shirt goes there all right
firebase 5s is a suit of integrated
products designed to help you build your
app grow your user base and ar-rahmani
it basically it helps developers build
better apps and grow successful
businesses in firebase is cross-platform
because we know and we understand that
there is more than one platform out
there so firebase says this all these
great features that you can see here and
obviously I would not go all over all of
them I will focus mainly on what makes
firebase such a great experimental
framework firebase analytics and remote
config so let's start with firebase
analytics firebase analytics is the
heart of the firebase platform first
it's free and unlimited now you can
learn and understand everything that
your users are doing without
compromising 100% free that means no
hits limits no quotas no sampling 100%
pure data for free it also has automatic
Event Reporting which means that as soon
as you integrate fibrous analytics into
your product without adding any lines of
code we automatically track some key
events like app opens
cetera and in-app purchases and other
stuff and you get out-of-the-box key
metrics that are important to you things
like monthly active users average
revenue per user average revenue per
paying user and some more therapist
analytics is so powerful because it is
tightly integrated with firebase and
with Google now you can take the data
make some insights and immediately turn
those insights into action item and
we'll see how you do that later and last
it's your data all the data that we
track and collect in firebase analytic
is your data with very few single clicks
very few clicks you can export all the
data to bigquery connect it to whatever
tables that you have and run anything
from queries to machine learning to
prediction API it's your data now let's
take a look what it takes to add
firebase analytics into your product you
you started the firebase console and you
get this lovely screen when you can add
in the Android app iOS app or web app
you go small configuration phase you get
a config file that you download and add
to your project and then it is a single
line of code in iOS grabbing firebase
from cocoa pods and single line of
change in your build.gradle file that's
it you do that you log in to firebase
console and you immediately get the
analytic dashboard right out of the box
here you can see so many things from
active users one day ten day one seven
thirty days to retention cohorts to are
posed and demographics and so much more
I don't have time to go through all of
it I will focus on the things that
matter to us alright remember our goal
we want to watch and observe our users
behavior so let's take a closer look at
how far away's analytics helps help us
do that
and like many other analytic systems
fabrice analytics is an event centric
system it means that it's trucks and
collects event and logging event is
super super easy first you grab a
reference to firebase analytics object
and it initialize it then you can use
the log event API here is a short
example how I would use it when a user
clicks on some item in my app to view
more details about it as you can see the
API is pretty straightforward you build
a bundle and you call log event with
that bundle now deciding what to log and
when can sometimes be a little bit
tricky and that's why we came up with
some suggested schemas like you see here
item ID item name and content type but
of course you can use whatever schemas
if you want in case just in case you
don't like ours once you do that you can
go back to the console and you'll
immediately see all the events and you
can drill down an event to see more
information about it now thing is that
we want to track users flow we don't
want to track single interaction we want
to track a whole interaction with it and
what the user is doing and that's where
funnels come to help funnels come to
help great so a final is a serious event
that are important to us that were
interested in as soon as you define a
funnel let's say user brought through
some items add an item to a cart and
purchase it that's a series of event
that we're interested in as soon as we
define this panel firebase analytics
will track users that go through this
journey and will tell us at any given
stage what's the conversion rate how
many users moved from one stage to
another how many added an item to the
cart how many actually made the purchase
it's a great tool to check where you
need where you're losing users and where
you need to improve now
I've said a minute ago that firebase
analytic is an event in eccentric system
and that's true but firebase analytics
is also a user centric system and that's
what makes it so unique being both event
centric and user centric we all know
that users are not the same okay and
different users behave differently so in
order to really understand our users and
what they're doing we need to to mean to
be able to define different groups of
users we call those groups audiences and
we need to break down every single
report based on those groups or
audiences everything from funnels to
event to our post to active users to
retention everything and firebase
analytics does all that now when you
think of an audience you immediately
thinks of males versus females different
age groups maybe some gay location
language or some other common attributes
like device OS tab OS version app
version etc firebase analytics all
obviously has all that but it also lets
you define your own user properties like
I don't know users that shared an item
at least once or uses that reached level
five in my game now remember what we
need from our experiment firm work
firebase analytics takes care of
providing us with real data and data we
can act upon but we still need to be
able to make quick and fast changes in
our apps and the way our app behaves and
this is exactly why we've built remote
config as a matter of fact remote config
started as internal system we used at
Google first we used it in the framework
GMS and then we opened it to internal
Google Apps like Gmail play and it saved
us so many times and it proved to be so
valuable to us that we said all right
maybe other developers can benefit it
and we opening it today on Android and
iOS
remote configured store keen value pairs
in the server and change them remotely
you can change them to all users or a
specific demographic like language
device app version OS version etc you
can also do staged rollouts like change
values to ten percents of the users in
North America and since everything is so
integrated with analytics you can target
different audiences with remote
configure for example let's say that I'm
building this great game and I'm not
sure how hard I need to make this game
so I set up with the mod config the game
difficulty level and I can change it
remotely but I can do even more
alright let's say I can make the game
harder for people who reach level 5 in
less than 2 days and I can make the game
easier for people who are struggling
with level 1 for more than 2 hours so
they won't get frustrated you know what
let's see how I would do that first I
initialized remote config and set some
default values to it so just in case I
don't have any network or something I do
have the default values then I call
fetch and activate fetch to grab the new
values from the server and then anywhere
in my app I can use this value of these
values in my code simply by calling get
int get long and string etc as simple as
that pretty straightforward
now don't worry about calling multiple
fetches and stuff we have under the hood
we have caching mechanism and we know
how to turn encase the cache it's valid
to make fetch and no op and there is a
good remote config talk I think tomorrow
alright back to our game plan so with
firebase analytics and remote configure
can run experiments and I can change my
game difficulty level pretty easily but
I still don't know what is the right
difficulty level
that I should stick with in other words
what am I trying to optimize here now
everything that you optimize everything
that you change every feature that you
add every little thing in your app needs
to show significant improvement in one
out of the three conversion from free to
paid actual users that are paying for
your app are paying for your service
time spent enough increase the time that
users are using your product and
retention make your users use your
product or app more often so I'd like to
show you how up in the year use this
framework of a similar framework and
firebox to run those experiments learn
and optimize the product and their
business so up in the air is a basically
a personal travel assistance it gives
you consistency and all the resources
and the information that you need but
your flight and travel regardless of
what airline you're using and where you
fly they also released an SDK recently
so other developers can plug into it
what I like about up in the air it
provides some additional features that
can actually save you time and money
like Airport trips and the queue for
security in the airport or is like that
let's see how up in the air used
firebase to validate things that are
doing first thing that I did they
defined the funnel that represents the
main goal of the app or their main KPI
if you wish which is user opens the app
at the flight and makes a purchase
that's the core metric of the business
they defined a funnel and this is what
they got you can see that 29% of the
users added a flight and 7.2 percent of
those users actually made a purchase but
that is across all users
so they started filtering this funnel
based on different demographics and
other parameters actually they used
about 18 different properties and
attributes to filter and take a look at
take a deeper look at what their users
are doing and here are some interesting
things that have learned users between
age 18 and 24 have two x yeah they have
two x add flight conversion they add
more flights and have 1.5 times purchase
flight conversion purchase conversion
they looked at other user properties and
fadh also found out that users that are
running marshmallow also convert better
almost two times add flight and one
point one point four times make a
purchase so just by looking at
fibrinolytics with audiences breaking
out what user is doing they immediately
got some very interesting and crucial
action items first we need to
investigate why we have this difference
in performance second let's check issues
on bed OS versions maybe users with
KitKat the app doesn't crash in KitKat
but maybe there's a problem there
maybe we're slow maybe we were laggy
nobody do you know there's a glitch in
the UI I don't know but it it worse it
makes sense to experiment that and it
also allows them to know which users to
engage that are more likely to make a
purchase so one of the things that it
they decided to check was the onboarding
process of the app so they used remote
config as you can see here to define a
quick experiment 50% of the users will
get a welcome screen explaining what the
app is doing and they will get one free
credit to get flight a lot to actually
test the service before they buy and the
other 50% of the users will not get a
welcome screen
will not get the free credit for flight
alerts and they compared the conversion
rate based on those groups and when they
compared this is what they saw so Edie
flight conversion is pretty similar okay
the welcome screen having the welcome
screen and Africa late or not having a
workers coming off regretted they didn't
change the conversion for ED flights but
one group actually purchased two times
more than the other group now here's the
question for you guys and girls which
group purchased more the group that got
a welcome screen
nice welcome scream hello welcome to up
in the air this is what we do here's a
free credit you can try before you buy
or the group that installed the app
opened it and they were immediately in
the screen they needed to figure out
what to do who thinks it's the group
with the welcome screen who thinks it's
the group with the no welcome screen who
doesn't think
all right yeah it doesn't you know it
doesn't it up all right yeah that's
exactly why you need to make data-driven
decision and not gut feeling apparently
having a welcome screen and offering a
free credit made people buy less so the
very first call to action that app in
the air did was going back to remote
config and changed that group that
doesn't get a welcome screen from 50
percent to hundred percent and the
result two times purchase across both
iOS and Android actually if you started
team who actually implemented all of
that is sitting here another thing that
they did which is very interesting so up
in the air they ran their application
service server sorry on App Engine and
obviously in their server they in their
back-end they have lots of data but the
users like preferences and history
purchases and tons of other stuff but
now with firebase analytics now with
firebase analytics fabrice analytics
also stores data about users behavior so
up in the air linked the two and they
started running some secret sauce of
prediction API and some crazy queries
and they found out something very very
interesting and they found out that
there is a group of users that you can
define based on multiple parameters
which is more likely three times more
likely to fly business okay immediately
the user opens the app you can predict
that this user may fly business okay
that means that those users they value
convenience over price
so immediately as soon as a user in that
group opens the app for the first time
before they do anything up in the air
can customize the suggestions and the
ads that this use those user sees
because they know that maybe they like
luxury hotels or better cars or better
flights and this is what what I call a
win-win-win actually the results from
this thing was a significant increase
not only in the conversion rate of how
many people actually purchased but also
in the average revenue per paying users
because they purchased more expensive
items again win-win-win just by looking
at data and mcdhh additive in decisions
so back to Ronnie she starts using
firebase to validate error ideas and now
she is super super happy this is a
picture from Duke today
actually that she sent me she's super
super happy with new friends for her and
for her dog Nala so for more information
about firebase analytics and remote
config and how you can start using it
today to validate your ideas to run
experiments and to optimize everything
in your app please go to our Doc's our
support and there are office hours today
we just ran out of them but there are
office hours tomorrow and on Friday look
for the people with the yellow shirts
that are hanging around here they will
be more than happy to help you integrate
firebase today thank you everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
