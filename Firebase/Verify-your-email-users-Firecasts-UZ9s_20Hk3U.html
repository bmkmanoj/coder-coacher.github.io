casts I'm Laurence Moroney a developer
advocate on firebase and today we're
going to talk about email validation
with firebase off when firebase first
launched it allowed you users to create
an account on your app when they signed
in with an email address and a password
but this email address could be anything
it wasn't linked to the original account
so your users could identify themselves
as just about anybody to solve this
e-mail verification has been added to
firebase off where once the user signs
up for an account with an email address
firebase will send an email to that
address containing a validation link you
can then check to see if the account is
verified at sign-in and take an action
in response such as blocking the sign-in
attempt for accounts that aren't
verified let's see this in action I'm
going to show the sample app from the
firebase off quick start available at
github calm the link for which is in the
description below this video
this can be adapted for your app pretty
easily enough when you run the app and
select email password authentication
you'll see this screen it gives you the
option to sign in if you have an account
already or create a new account if you
don't when you click the Create account
button you'll go to a new activity
showing the user identity and the
firebase user ID that's associated with
it
you'll also see that the email isn't yet
verified but there's a button allowing
you to verify it once the user clicks on
this button an email will be sent to the
address this email will contain a link
and once that link is clicked the
account will be verified you can see
what the email looks like in the email
templates tab in the authentication
section of the firebase console this
offers you some customization such as
the action link or the reply address
being editable so the email can appear
to come from your domain now if the user
verifies their email address by clicking
on that link once they sign into the app
you'll now see that they are verified
you'll also see that the user is present
in the firebase console and you can
manage them from there including
changing their password
or removing them from your app all
together so let's take a look at the
code details on the coding can be found
in the manage users section of the
firebase documentation the links are in
the description below the core
functionality is found on the firebase
user object like this on it is a send
email verification method which returns
a task which is used to manage sending
the email and reporting on its status if
the task is successful you'll know that
the mail was sent in this case the user
is retrieved from Emma get current user
and the send email verification method
is then called on that when the task is
successful you'll see a toast that pops
up after the user clicks on the link in
the email subsequent calls to user is
email verified will return true here's
how it's used in the sample app to
render the text that we saw earlier you
can learn more about firebase off
including sign-in with other providers
like Google Facebook Twitter and more on
