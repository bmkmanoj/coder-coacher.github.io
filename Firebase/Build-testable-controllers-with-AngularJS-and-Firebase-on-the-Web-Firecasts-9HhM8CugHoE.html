episode of fire cast we're gonna be
covering angular again and we're going
to be building off the last angular and
firebase screencast we were to be
talking about dependency injection of
firebase references which kind of sounds
like you know complicated but it's
actually really easy and it makes your
code really testable so you should
totally do it and just as a reminder
this is just one episode an entire
series on firebase in the web will
recover all the firebase services as
well as all these JavaScript frameworks
but today we're gonna focus on how to
make our angular apps great for firebase
and dependency injection so let's get
started angular loves dependency
injection and it's everywhere you look
throughout the entire framework and that
makes sense because dependency injection
makes it easy to test our controllers
and our services so how do you do to
pendens the injection with angular fire
well angular fire provides a bunch of
services that are automatically
available for dependency injection but
things like database references by
calling firebase database dot ref are
not automatically available for
dependency injection so there's a little
work you have to do and that is what the
firebase ref and firebase referee R is a
little app that I built in a previous
video and that is the getting started
with angular and firebase video that you
can check out over here so what this app
does is it creates a route reference and
then a child reference from there and
then synchronizes the data at that
location to the firebase object but
while this works it's not easily
testable so let's say we had a function
called say hello and all say hello did
was it returned hello plus this object
named so I'm gonna break out this
function into its own name I'm gonna
call it my controller and then I can
hoist this up to the controller
declaration so if I wanted to test this
controller I could actually do something
like this or I create the instance of
the controller by calling
new controller but the problem is is
that right here this controller takes in
a firebase object and this firebase
object takes in a database reference so
since the firebase object is a parameter
I can actually easily just mock that in
and provide some dummy data but the
problem is is that this database
reference is an external source and what
this means is is that we can't actually
do real unit testing because of the
database reference and that's because
unit tests should be isolated which
means they do not depend on any external
sources will like a database so we can
use the firebase ref to fix this so I'm
going to go and create a config phase
and the config phase just takes in a
function and this function is ran before
any controller or service and just like
a controller or service we can specify
something for dependency injection so in
this case I'm going to specify the
firebase repre and the firebase ruff
provider allows you to configure
database references for dependency
injection and you can do that by calling
the register URL method in this register
URL method takes in an object that has
one required property and this required
property is the default key and the
default key conventionally points at the
root of your database so in this case
since we have a config object we can
just say config database URL and at this
point we have the root reference
available for dependency injection but
we also can specify any other reference
that we want to so what I want to do is
I want to specify this angular slash
object reference so I can inject it into
my controller so to do that I can just
provide a new key of object and then I
can just say it's the config database
URL slash angular slash object and now
that I've registered both of these URLs
I can inject it into my controller so
now that I'm injecting this firebase
reference like
actually delete lines 22 and 23 because
all they're doing is creating this
reference that we specified with the ref
provider so you might be wondering why
we specified firebase referee in the
config phase but only firebase ref in
the controller so what is the difference
between these two well an angular a
provider allows you to configure
something in the configure phase and in
this case we're configuring the firebase
references that we want to inject and
then by convention when we get into the
run phase in which we are injecting
things into the controller it strips
away the name provider because it
creates this firebase ref service so now
rather than creating the reference like
we're doing on lines 22 and 23 we can
actually delete them and use the
firebase ref service so rather than the
ref variable we can say firebase ref
objects' since that's exactly what we
specified up here so while this is great
we can do one better we actually can
take this firebase object and turn it
into a standalone Factory so it can be
used by other controllers so to do that
we can create a function and just call
it object factory and then we can inject
firebase object in firebase ref and then
we can return the value returned by
firebase object and passing in the ref
and then we can just declare it as a
factory and then just specify it down
here as the object factory and what's
great about this is is that this object
factory can be injected in any other
controller or service in my application
so now how does this make my application
easily testable because it's the whole
purpose of using firebase repre
well to do that we can go back and
create a new instance of my controller
so say controller equals my controller
and as we can see right here a
controller takes in an object Factory
but we know that we don't want the
object factory to talk to the database
in this case for the test we want to
mock out just some fake data so to do
that I can just
provide a plain old JavaScript object
with the property of name that is David
so to test the say hello message I can
just call controller death say hello and
then rather than setting up karma and
jasmine and all that I can use the magic
of console dot assert so I'll say
console dot assert says the message
equal hello Alice
now I know that the message is not going
to equal hello Alice because the name is
David but one of the rules of thumb of
unit testing is is that you
intentionally wanted to fail at first
and then have it passed so you have a
good idea that you actually know what
it's doing so counsel about assert also
takes in a second parameter and this is
the message if it were to fail so I'm
gonna say the expected value is hello
Alice but the actual value is the
message that we are passing through so
now in my application you can see that
the assertion failed which we expected
it expected hello Alice but we actually
gave it back hello David
so let's go and make it pass so let's
change the name to Alice and then now
back in our application we don't have
any errors in our console so immediately
this is not a legitimate form of unit
testing but you can easily see how you
could do this with your own jasmine and
mocha chai or whatever you're using for
unit testing so if you learned one thing
from this video know that the firebase
ref to register your database references
for dependency injection through the
firebase ref service and then once we
have that it's super easy to unit test
our controllers and services so that's
how you set up your angularfire apps to
use dependency injection so there easily
testable but before I go I have a
question for you what are you using to
test your angular apps and are you doing
unit tests with angular fire so that's
all for today I will see you all next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
