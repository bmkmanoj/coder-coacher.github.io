get to meet the Googlers that make
firebase happen today on the show we
have Zana Shahzad she's joining us from
the firebase accent on the show thank
you so I'm really curious to know what
is your role been with the firebase app
indexing team so I am a developer
programs engineer for firebase developer
relations and what that means is that I
engage with the community of developers
and sort of provide the tools that they
would need in order to get started with
firebase app indexing so that typically
means providing some sort of a video to
help them get used to that API and show
them how to integrate it with their apps
I also provide code labs just
educational material to tell developers
how they can use some of the offerings
of firebase okay great and so in
particular you have one video that I
think is coming up about app indexing
and also a code lab that people can
follow so if you're interested in
finding out about that the links to that
are in the description below so there's
new features in app indexing for
firebase for Android I should say oh
well I asked you about that later but
right now I'm really curious you have
two of the letter Z or Zed in your name
that seems pretty exotic to me tell me
where are you from I actually grew up in
Canada and the suburbs of Toronto but my
parents are originally from Pakistan and
so my name is Arabic it's as funny that
you just said Zed as being a Canadian we
typically it's I mean Z and Zed there's
this huge American Canadian yeah my new
Canadian pronunciation so I'm curious
how did you get into software
engineering it's actually a really funny
story so I was originally planning on
going to school for becoming a lawyer
and to major in criminology I had every
intention of doing the LSAT sand and
going to law school afterwards but I
kind of got scared last-minute before
going to university and I ended up
trying to apply for something completely
different and I didn't know what that
was going to be but during the
application process I had been filling
out my birthdate that's 10 24 October
24th and it's a good round number for
there you go yeah so I mean it's a
number I knew my screen resolution at
the time was 1024 by 768 and 2 to the
power of 10 is 1024 you know binary
numbers a it's just a number that comes
up in computer science a lot and so just
based off of that I applied for computer
science okay so you entered you hundred
1024 into the form where you choose your
major that is that how I'm reading that
yeah I mean I put that in there and then
right next to it I did put computer
science yeah because I knew what you
were getting into but it was almost kind
of accidental maybe serendipitous that
you right I mean before I got to that
form I actually didn't even know
computer science was a major that you
could go into well now you know and
you've made a career out of it and I
haven't looked back that's great
so I'm curious what do you do with your
free time when you're not working with
computers here so I actually like to do
something called geocaching do you know
what that is no names tell me okay so
it's this treasure hunt that's around
the world and it's everyday people they
they go to spots that are special to
them like something from your childhood
a waterfall that you found beautiful so
what you do is you you hide a container
there and the container typically has
things like a log a pen that you can
sign the log with and then usually a
little collectible of some sort you take
that you hide it in that location you
take the coordinates of it and you put
it into a website on geocaching and and
other people will come along they'll
take that coordinate put it into their
phone for example in Google Maps and
they'll go and try and find this cache
that you put so it sounds like you can
have kind of a mini adventure even
within your own neighborhood exactly so
tell me what kind of adventures have you
had what's been most interesting the one
that sticks out in my mind is one
instance where I was at a park and there
was this large tree and I had a rock
right next to it I remember I was
looking for this cache for the longest
time I couldn't quite figure it out I
ended up kicking the rock and and moving
it and I found underneath it was
actually hollowed out and that was the
cache there was like a Mayo container
that was sticking out from the bottom it
hadn't been hollowed out so I opened it
up and immediately I think it had been
raining recently and there was like
spiders and bugs and everything just
came out and jumping out at me and it
was absolutely disgusting well
sounds like probably not the adventure
you wouldn't intended to take yeah it's
a good break from geocaching for for a
little while but I did go back to it
that's perfectly okay so I understand
you also have a pet what's that I have a
half Chihuahua half Corgi she's about 14
months old now I like to take her on my
adventures Cali Cali yeah I think she's
super cute I suffered from terminal
cuteness watching these pictures earlier
very beautiful now Google offices it
turns out our dog friendly right so
people bring their pets in and that's
okay as long as they're well-behaved
have you ever brought Cali into the
office before I tried once she barked a
lot letting me know that people were
around and she wanted to say hi to
everyone so it was very distracting
I see so she's not office friendly it
sounds like no not really and I think
I'm gonna I'm gonna keep her at home
so going back to app indexing --zz new
features could you tell me what's new in
the firebase app indexing execute please
yeah sure so firebase app indexing
allows you to get your Android app into
Google search if users have your app
installed they're able to launch the app
directly from google search results and
that just helps them reengage with your
app quickly find the content that
they're looking for it even provides
query auto completion if you start
typing something in and if they don't
have your app installed it shows a
little install card directly in the
Google search results so that people can
you know you can drive traffic to your
Android app in that way now with this
new update that we just had with version
10 of the library firebase app indexing
API lets you put personal content into
Google's on device index so you're able
to put messages music bookmarks things
that are very specific to your app users
into the Google on device index and
you're able to update real time with
interactions that they take in your app
so that you can provide auto completion
and log like actions that they've taken
on that content in real time so it
sounds like it's a great way for users
to rediscover the content that they once
interacted with after having used the
app some time so they can re-engage with
your app after any amount of time
exactly so it's funny you mentioned
autocomplete you know how sometimes
Google
can give you suggestions on how to
complete your query and sometimes those
suggestions can be kind of funny or
interesting or maybe a little awkward so
I've got a game for you to play on that
point
I call it guess the suggestion and what
you have to do is guess what Google
would autocomplete for a certain phrase
so there's 10 Zana you'll have up to 3
wrong guesses so three strikes and
you're out you get points based on how
relevant the answer was so you want to
guess the most common searches first and
the least common last let's do it all
right great the phrase that you'll have
to complete is do corgis what you have a
corgi right so do Corgi snuggle let's
take a look at it up at the board like
the cuddle so we'll give that one to you
that's that it's close enough all right
so you get three points for that
congratulations hey would you like to
take another guess all right do corgis
like to is that what what was the
original corgis what do you Cory's sleep
a lot okay let's look at it up on the
board oh I'm sorry that's not right
that's not one of choices so I'll give
you a hint one of the hints is some
things that and potential dog owners
might be concerned about when they get a
dog for the first time oh do corgis bark
a lot do corgis bark a lot let's see it
up on the board all right yes that is
the number two answer so you get into
nine points for that very good alright
let's take another guess do corgis two
things do corgis two things all right
let's go to the board oh I'm sorry
okay this is our game I think so that's
two questions we have wrong ago one more
wrong answer I'll give you another hint
what are some of the distinctive
physical features for corney's I know
they have short legs they wiggle there
but while they
walking but what would someone search in
a query do chords do corgis shed a lot
do corgis shed a lot let's take a look
at it up on the board answer you get 10
points for that very good yeah as
something dog owners may want to know
all right take another guess
oh man I'm running out of ideas well it
does get harder do corgis have a lot of
energy okay let's see it up on the board
oh I'm sorry it's not there it was a
good guess I would have I would have
probably guessed that too so let's take
a look at the at the answers that you
didn't guess so
you've got number one shedding number
two barking the other one is do corgis
no chance do corgis have dewclaws do
corgis like water
you mentioned short legs one of the
questions is do corgis have knees do
Corgi smell okay do corgis like cats
so maybe hat people were wondering if
corgis get along with cats and the last
one is do corgis like monkeys okay now
that doesn't make any sense to me at all
actually I'm gonna go say Nate did you
have any influence in that answer huge
what's wrong
I am preferred not to tamper with the
results of the game so we're gonna talk
after the show Nate has been a little
unruly lately we'll talk later
Zana let's take a look at your final
score up on the board
hi alright pretty good alright thanks
for playing Zanna
good to have you on the show thank you
so much and for those of you who haven't
seen app indexing yet go check out the
SDK the links are in the description
below that's all we have time for see
you next time on another fire</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
