firebase where you get to meet the
Googlers that make firebase happen I'm
Doug Stephenson developer advocate with
the firebase team and with me on the
show is amber heinbockel amber hi nice
to meet you thanks for being on the show
I pleasure and I understand you're here
from the Cambridge office I am yes I'm
part of the fabric team
okay so fabric just had some news what
is that well we joined forces with
firebase and we just launched it dev
summit crashlytics and beta so we're
really proud to announce that okay so
now you can do you can use crashlytics
in your firebase app and view it from
the firebase console exactly exactly and
so what was your role in making that
happen well I'm part of a team that
worked on the app home Parshin so more
on the analytics side okay well
congratulations on the launch and I'm
sure developers out there are finding
that very useful by now so what
specifically are you doing to help the
fabric and firebase teams like team up
well since joining Google as a whole
we've had this opportunity to do
something called Sprint's and since
joining I have decided to become a
sprint master so so far I've already
held two sprints for the fabric and
firebase team to meet join forces be on
the same coast I jokingly say exchange
pheromones and then we can build great
products together the one thing that I
find that's really interesting is that
we're all really passionate about
developers and so when we join forces it
was like meeting brothers and sisters
from another team that care as much
about developers as we do on fabric so
those are really it's a really easy
transition to be prepared yeah yeah and
that's what we do with firebase very
developer focused fabric very developer
focused so we have in a sense the same
mission but now we have all these new
products coming together exactly when I
know that we already did digits right so
we pulled digits into firebase
authentication so that's one thing we've
already done now crashlytics will be the
primary crash reporter for firebase so
I'm excited to see what happens there so
the crash licks folks are mostly in
Cambridge right so is that where you
live yes I live and I live in Boston and
Cambridge
before we join firebase we were at
Twitter which was right down the street
so the neighborhood that we're in is
this like really dynamic tech community
and then right in our backyard is MIT
and Harvard and so there's a ton of
energy towards developers and developer
advocacy so we have hack weeks and all
kinds of things where we bring students
on-site to work with us and also all
kinds of public speaking opportunities
within Cambridge itself where we bring
the community in to work with us
you mentioned hack week so I just got
back from two dev fests where we did a
couple of hackathons there so I love
those so much and I'm actually gonna
write a blog post about that if you have
anything to contribute to that I love to
talk with I loved about hackathons later
so you also at home you watch Silicon
Valley yeah yeah so I've watched all
those I love it I think it hits a little
too close to home it really does it
really what do you think absolutely and
it's one of those shows where the first
three times I watched it and this was
like over airplanes or sitting on the
couch like I really had a hard time
getting hooked on to it and I'm not sure
what the turning point was maybe i sat
through three episodes of binge watched
it and started getting into the seasons
and I think my favorite part of it is
being from Mountain View being from the
Silicon Valley and having seen through
the you know late 90s and into the 2000s
how this area has changed so much and
especially coming back and working here
at Google there's so many humorous
moments and the way the actors portray
the area but it hits a little close to
home because there they definitely get
it right sometimes well understand Mike
judge the creator of the series was an
engineer in Silicon Valley during that
time early 2000 yeah I guess he did
beavis and butthead as well I don't know
what the connection is and you have one
other guilty would you say a guilty
hobby
oh yeah sure so you watch makeup videos
in fact there's a name in Cambridge that
the team calls me which is when I do us
I'm a UX designer when I do a certain
polish thing or I get a tweet from a
developer about some delightful moment
that they have
the console our team internally calls it
glam bird it's been glamoured so back to
the YouTube videos and I have a little
bit of a hard time following asleep and
so I was trying to find something that
didn't get me to invest it like Silicon
Valley is not the show to watch you know
minutes before you go to bed and so I
found YouTube makeup tutorial videos
awhile ago and now I just nerd out over
them it's a little bit of a hobby this
summer in particular I had two very
close girlfriends get married and they
gave me the great pleasure of doing
their makeup so that's not her simple
for a big day so yes it's been okay I
should probably roll off of it a little
bit so you have worked with young women
who are trying to get into engineering
and coding tell me how that's gone for
you so far so growing up in Mountain
View I never saw women who looked like
me talk like me or bubbly and energetic
ever in a engineering role or working in
tech companies I just didn't even know
that that was a possibility and so one
thing I've been trying to do lately is
going and talking to public school
students I just spoke to Lawrence
Academy and then also women techmakers
which is a Google hosted event as well
as girls who code and I really want to
show a different face to working in tech
I think being designer in technology is
it's like such a wonderful ability to
show to billions of users what your what
your work can do and honestly sometimes
you know when people don't even realize
that they're doing something within a UX
experience that I've developed and
they're just they can complete the task
that they're trying to do then I know
I've had the greatest success so when I
see tweets like oh that was easy or wow
I had this cool moment when I clicked
this button and something happened
those are the ones that bring me a lot
of energy and life and excitement to my
job and I want to bring that to more
women and girls in the industry okay so
for everyone watching at home if you're
watching you're thinking like I would
love to get started on coding or
engineering of any kind how would you
recommend getting started well I would
say that coding and engineering is one
way that you can be in but another way
that you can come in is through design
and art
and so when it comes to designing
commercially I'd really focus on things
like typography legibility usability and
think about the experiences that you
really struggle with when you open an
application or a website and the
frustration points that you have and
imagine a world where you could make
that better because ultimately what
we're here to do is solve problems
together and so if we're solving
problems successfully then you're not
going to have those frustration points
so I would honestly start with thinking
about the experiences that you have
today and how you would make them better
yourself and then really simple piece of
paper and a pen start drawing out those
screens of how you might consider making
it better and it all starts from there
okay so either way it's problem-solving
so if you're on design and UX you're
probably solving the problem of
usability and of someone's perception of
what's going on on screen and how to
actually accomplish tasks and your app
wears engineers and we're concerned
about how to actually like push the
bytes around and maybe even push the
pixels and stuff like that yeah I feel
like it comes a lot down to empathy to
like I myself am a user right we're all
users we all use these devices and
experiences and I try to empathize the
most with the experience that somebody's
having in that moment so for instance
like you're at a bank and you're trying
to withdraw money from an ATM and your
fingers are cold you have gloves on
right and so how big do the buttons need
to be on the console for you to be able
to hit them with your gloves on like
those are the types of empathetic
moments that we can engineer and that
was a very tactile experience but those
come through on mobile devices all the
time well yeah and it's interesting
because if that system was developed in
the Bay Area where everyone is in a kind
of warm area you don't even think about
the fact that you have to wear bulky
gloves and that you're you know
desperately trying to push a button but
you can't because it's too cold outside
so we need we need diversity we need
multiple perspectives I'm so glad you
brought that up too because in
particular when we work on firebase in
fabric as we've been working together we
really start thinking about other
countries and internationalization and
how to make our experience easier for
developers all over the world and so
oftentimes of the designer we have to
think of you know maybe it's not the
fastest internet connection well how can
we give them the information that they
need
in order to be successful like on
crashlytics how can we let them know
where the bug is in their app without
bogging down their computer so basically
we want to get out of the way so that
they can do the best work
yeah with technology needs to get out of
the way so that the the product can do
what it is our developers build better
apps for everybody absolutely buddy wins
yeah so if you have feedback for us on
that definitely we like your feedback
because more ideas more perspectives
definitely make our product better
definitely well amber it was so great
having you on the show I'm glad you were
able to make it out here from Cambridge
yeah it's nice to meet you too and thank
you for watching this episode of meet
firebase be sure to subscribe here to
the firebase channel on youtube to get
more video content on which other meet
firebase with people like amber and
other engineers on the team and I'll see
you here next time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
