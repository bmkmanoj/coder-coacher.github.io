a successful mobile app has lots of
responsibilities for example apps build
on firebase uses authentication feature
to sign-in users and they typically read
and write data to its real time database
they might also store files in the cloud
using its scalable storage these are all
great features for building your app but
sometimes you can't put all your logic
inside the app to run on the user's
device for example prying eyes may try
to reverse engineer and modify your apps
code or maybe you need to change your
apps behavior instantly without
publishing a new version that your users
have to install and sometimes it's best
to have a single place where expensive
work is performed traditionally to solve
these problems you would deploy your
private code to a back-end server that
you manage the app would then use an API
or library to communicate with that
server and issue requests however with
cloud functions for firebase you don't
need to set up maintain and scale that
back end to get its benefits instead you
can write and deploy code to our servers
that automatically responds to events in
your app did a user just log in for the
first time you can send them a welcome
email with a function did that user
insert a value into your real time
database you can update it right away
with a function and did that user upload
photos to your storage bucket you can
analyze resize and manipulate them all
with the function and finally with the
function you can also send a message
with firebase Cloud messaging to that
users friends so they can know what's
happening right away you can even create
functions to build a web-based API for
your data that anyone can use you write
your functions in JavaScript for the
node environment and all it takes is one
easy command-line to deploy your
functions for immediate use with cloud
functions you can seamlessly integrate
many features of firebase to provide the
backend services that your app requires
to be fast secure and complete and you
can do it all without having to
provision servers tune them upgrade them
and scale them up or down to meet your
users demand we handle the maintenance
and you write the code so you can
quickly build apps without all the ops
to learn more about cloud functions and
how you can use it to build out your
firebase app check out the documentation
right here we can't wait to see what you
build</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
