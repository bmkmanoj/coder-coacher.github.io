check out this awesome hidden feature I
found in firebase analytics so I'm over
here looking at all my reports in the
firebase analytics dashboard here for
instance I've got my active users for
the last 30 days and while these graphs
sure are pretty I'm thinking it'd be
kind of nice if I could get these
numbers into like Google sheets or maybe
Excel so I could analyze them a little
better right well watch this I'm going
to select my graph here in the firebase
console it's kind of hard to tell that
you can see by like the highlighted text
here that my graph has been selected and
then I'll hit command C to copy it and
then I'm going to switch to a blank
Google spreadsheet and hit command V to
paste and look at that all my values are
right there in the spreadsheet for me to
analyze so you can see here on the
leftmost column I've got the date and
then all the actual numbers are in the
columns next to it now you might notice
that I seem to have two columns of what
looks like the same data right I've got
monthly active users here and then right
next to it I've got this monthly users
column and then the same goes for my
weekly actives and same for my daily
actives and so basically that first
column is for the value that corresponds
to the date here on the left the second
column is basically for that
corresponding day in the previous 30 day
time period basically it's the values
that belong to this dotted line here in
the graph that I copied make then okay
and then I can do the same thing for a
bunch of these other graphs here I can
copy and paste my daily engagement
numbers let's get these into a new sheet
here and again you can see I've got my
engagement numbers from this time frame
in this first column and then those same
numbers for the previous 30 days in this
second column and better yet I can jump
over to an individual event like this
completed five levels event and copy all
these graphs here at the top and you can
see I'll get event counts user counts
event per user counts and values for
every one of my events that I am
recording in firebase analytics and this
lets me do some pretty nice calculations
right here in Google sheets for example
let's say our game designer is curious
how often people are failing a level in
our game well for starters I've got my
level start graph here
to show when people are starting a level
in my game so first I'm going to copy
and paste these numbers into a new sheet
so put them in okay great
and then I'm going to do the same thing
for my level fail graphs and that will
show when people have failed a level so
we'll copy from here and we'll paste
them right in next to my other numbers
and once I've copied and pasted these
values into Google sheets I can then
calculate my average failure rate per
game stat by dividing this number here
by this other one I'm going to copy this
formula down for all of my dates let's
give it a percentage format so it looks
nice maybe we'll add an average at the
bottom here let's do average for all
these numbers and there we go looks like
my game has an average failure rate
somewhere in the low 30s which sounds
like it's just challenging enough for
our players so our game designer is
happy now a couple of disclaimers here
first this doesn't work on all the
graphs I've tried some of them just
don't seem to copy and paste as well as
others but it does work on a surprising
number of them you'll just kind of have
to try them out and see if they work and
second this will never be a replacement
for some the awesome and sophisticated
data analysis capabilities you get by
exporting your raw data into bigquery
and you should totally go watch this
video if you want to find out more but
if all you want to do is maybe compare
two graphs to each other or calculate
some standard deviations or averages on
a particular event this trick can work
surprisingly well so give it a try
yourself have fun with it and we will
see you soon on another episode of fire
