episode of fire castes I'm Andrew
Brogdon from the mobile ads SDK team and
on today's episode I'm going to show you
how to get firebase and AdMob working
together in an Android app using Gradle
first we'll link an app with firebase
then we'll download the Google services
JSON file next we'll configure the
Gradle plugin that uses that file and
finally add the individual services that
belong in the app alright so step one is
linking an app which we'll do in the
AdMob console so I'll see you in a
browser window I'll include a guide at
the end of this video with more info on
how this linking works but for now one
of the easiest ways to get started is
just to go to the analytics tab in the
AdMob console and click this nice get
started with firebase button when I
click that I get to a list of my AdMob
apps and I can click the link to
firebase button to link one to firebase
that gets me a prompt from my apps
package name which is needed for the
configuration stuff to work later and
depending on whether you've already
created a firebase project or not you
may have some choices on the next screen
this is what you get if you've never
created a firebase project before
clicking continue will take you to the
next screen one that looks like this
telling you that you now have a link tab
and so that's step one step two is to
download the Google services JSON config
file which is really easy because the
screen I just showed you has a link to
it right there just click that link and
you'll be sent to the firebase console
and the download will start
automatically once it's downloaded I can
go into an Android studio project and
drag it right into the source tree like
that it goes in the root folder of the
app source and it'll be used later by
the Google services plugin alright so
I've got an app linked and I've
downloaded the JSON file that contains
configuration info for my firebase
project now it's time to get the Gradle
plug-in for Google services configured
so we'll head into Android studio
so here I'm back in Android studio and
I'm looking at the project level build
up Gradle file that's the one that
applies not just to the app but
everything in the project source tree
and so I'm just gonna add a little class
path here for the Google services plugin
which is new and we're doing a Gradle
sync there we go with that done I can
head into the apps build Gradle and add
a line at the bottom to apply that
plugin there we go
this plug-in uses the Google services
JSON file to inject configuration data
into the opponent builds and it also
does some other firebase ease set up
kind of stuff cool so that steps one two
three finished now it's time to add
individual firebase services I'm just
talking about AdMob today so that's the
one we'll be adding I can do that the
same way I always have through Gradle
dependencies so for AdMob with firebase
the Gradle artifact is called firebase -
ads there we go there are by the way a
ton of these artifacts available here's
a list of the services along with Gradle
dependencies that go with them which you
can find in the firebase Android setup
guide and you can see there's a bunch in
here real time database authentication
everything you might want alright so
that's all four steps finished which
means I can come back into my activity
file now and start messing around with
AdMob classes like add view and you can
see the type is resolving so you know
the sdk has been properly imported and
there we go
firebase an AdMob in an app working
together and it only took a couple
minutes that's it for this fire cast
please leave your questions in the
comments below or reach out on Twitter
and G+ with the hashtag ask firebase by
the way if you like seeing videos about
mobile ads I have a whole other series
just about that
it's got screencasts feature breakdowns
clones moose repellent hairless cats and
sweaters you name it it's called a
mobile ads garage so if you're
interested in mobile ads tech check it
out
in the meantime we'll be dropping a new
fire cast every few days so don't forget

to date I'm Andrew Brogdon and thanks
