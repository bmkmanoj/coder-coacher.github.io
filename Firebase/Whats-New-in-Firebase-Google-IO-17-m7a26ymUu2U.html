thank you thank you I think I think the
weather's been okay today Ryan seems
like it's been a good day to be outside
anyway thank you for being here at i/o
thank you for joining us at one of the
first session slots my name is Ben
Galbraith and I'm franchise na together
the two of us product managed firebase
along with a big team and we're really
happy to be here to talk to you about
what's new in firebase this is our
agenda what that what we do is first
give a bit of an overview to firebase
for those of you who are new to the
platform and then we're going to spend a
few more minutes talking about fabric
and what you can expect from fabric and
firebase working together and then we'll
spend the majority of our time on a
whirlwind tour of what's new across the
wide swath of firebase we have a lot of
material to cover so we're going to keep
it pretty high level but we're going to
point you to more detailed sessions that
are happening after this talk that will
go into various more levels of details
so since day one our mission has been to
help you build a better app and grow
your business by providing many of the
tools you need in solving the common
problems throughout an app development
lifecycle for example if you're just
starting out building a new app we're
looking to build a new feature you may
need to set up some back-end
infrastructure quickly and easily like
having your own login system or a
database to store and sync data or let's
save your built an app and you're
looking to fine-tune the performance and
the stability of it and you need a tool
and have a way to monitor where their
errors are happening out in users hands
and if you're a serious developer
looking to run a business it's important
that you have insights to how users are
using your app and perhaps a way to
refine and fine-tune your app experience
to enhance user engagement and retention
now we want to provide many of these
tools to help you solve these common
problems so that you can channel more of
your precious time and energy into
building a differentiated business and
app
and focus on running your app to be
successful so this sort of vision that
that Francis talked about comes together
in two basic categories in firebase
tools that help you develop your app and
tools that help you grow your business
or grow your user base and all of these
are designed to help with common
problems that we've found in our own
careers as software developers and that
we've learned from you as we've
partnered closely with the development
community to understand what problems
you're facing and what you'd like to see
us address we also find opportunities to
base firebase off learnings from
Google's own internal tools that we've
developed to help us develop at scale
and release some of the billion user
applications that we talked about
earlier today we try to have all these
tools integrate really well together and
also integrate with the rest of Google
some of those integrations include the
Google cloud platform
many of our develop tools are built
right on top of Google Cloud which gives
you that scalable foundation that can
get the planet scale as you need it
another example is Google Analytics the
analytics tool inside of firebase is
built by the Google Analytics team and
Adwords and so all of these integrations
really give you these on-ramps into
these these sort of scalable growth
paths as your app gets bigger but
firebase gives you this great way to get
started in a really easy way generally
all of the firebase products are
available on iOS and Android with one
exception test lab which is Android only
and then we're appropriate we've also
introduced SDKs for other platforms such
as the Web C++ and unity and we had
games developers in mind with the C++
and unity support when we created it you
hear how all these tools work let's hear
from one of our partners Wattpad
right now we're working on a brand new
storytelling experience called tap which
is all about stories told through text
messages through chats the tap team
started off very small didn't have a lot
of resources to test out a lot of
libraries to help us grow very quickly
firebase gave us the ability to take
what we would have done in many
different places and integrate from many
different services all in one place in
one convenient package and it allowed us
to integrate that package and just get
going with our development almost
immediately the real-time database
allows us to have cumulus storage which
means we can ever change the schema
whenever you want we wanted to have the
tab counters increment on the stories as
the users were browsing through them so
you could kind of get a sense in real
time what people were doing and what
they were reading and with firebase this
is a trivial thing to implement you to
basically just add a watcher onto the
count nodes and it comes back to you in
real time since our app is supported on
both Android and iOS platforms cloud
functions come in really handy when user
mix and publishes a story the cloud
function gets triggered and we send a
notification to all the friends of the
user so that they know that they made a
story and published it there are times
where we don't know whether or not to
build a feature to roll out a feature
and so we would use remote config and
test it out with a smaller group of
users first and then we would look at
the analytics dashboard and when we see
that you know the feature is actually
performing really well we would deploy
it at a larger scale remote config
really made it fast and easy for us to
make these really really important
product decisions we've reduced our
typical app deployment schedule by more
than half that allowed us to go from
effectively zero to a working product in
production and that time spent was was
just phenomenally fast for us
the app has been really really
well-received in both Google Play and
the iOS App Store we've had over 1
billion taps in tap so far through tap
stories we've had in the first weekend
that we launched our story writer 25,000
people wrote stories firebase gives us
the ability to focus on what we know
best
that's storytelling and that's giving
our users the ability to immerse
themselves to interact and to
participate with stories in ways that
were not available before
so congratulations the ipad team on the
success of tap and thank you for
building and growing with firebase so we
have just highlighted one story and we
feel really privileged to have many
partners from a work from around the
world who have taken this journey with
us and have also found our own success
story to firebase fact over 1 million
developers have built apps with firebase
as I mentioned earlier today and this
incredible momentum since we have in
Vail this expanded firebase so we just
want to say thank you to all of the
developers who partnered with us thank
you thanks for starting the applause
over there and it's through these
inspirational stories as well as the
feedback from developers like you that
help our teams continue to work hard and
expand the platform over the last year
we've made 40 major releases and over a
hundred updates to continue to refine
and expand the platform some of which
you've heard today and also we're going
to go into some of these in more detail
now as we walk through each one of these
sections we're also going to be
mentioning additional sessions that
you'll find at i/o to learn more about
each one of these topics over the next
coming days all right so as many of you
know in January we join forces with
fabric they'd previously been at Twitter
fabric was this mobile platform that
provides great tools for app teams to
build understand and grow their apps the
missions of our team and their team are
really similar and so from the beginning
this has been a really really great
arrangement coming to
we've long admired the team that they
the team and the impact that they've had
over four hundred and five hundred
eighty thousand developers have used
fabric they've been a pioneer in this
space with crashlytics and we're working
really hard to bring the best of these
platforms together we're going to talk
about progress we've made in two areas
here the first step we're taking is to
bring crashlytics into firebase as our
combined flagship cross reporting
solution crashlytics is a tool that
provides real-time insights into the
stability of your app with information
like app crashes and errors they're
happening out in the field and it also
provides info like stack traces and
device info to help you diagnose issues
now what's cool about it is that in
addition to showing you these errors it
also shows you how these errors impact
business metrics like user retention so
that you can prioritize and fix these
errors accordingly if you're an existing
user of crashlytics or firebase craft
reporting we're going to be bringing
these products together and paving a
smooth transition path forward over the
next coming months and if you're eager
to get started right now with the
industry-leading crash reporting
solution we recommend crashlytics all
right now I want to talk about digits
fabric pioneer this great phone of
authentication solution and the digits
team and the firebase team teamed up to
create firebase authentication phone
number authentication features I want to
show you how this works so you start out
with a screen like this and with
firebase authentication you can use
third-party authentication providers as
well as your own email authentication
system and it manages all that for you
and now you have sign-in with phone
number so you enter the phone number and
then we verify that this is a new user
or an existing user and then we generate
a one-time code associated with the
request the users sent the code through
SMS they enter the code in the phone and
then once they've done that we verify
that the codes right we handle all the
deduplication logic that's necessary for
multiple resending and then we meant to
secure user token and persist the
session on the device
and you've got a signed end-user we've
built on top some of the best learnings
from ditches and have also added some
additional benefits for firebase
authentication first it's greater
stability firebase auth is built on the
same telephony infrastructure that is
used by Google's own login system and in
many of its own products second we are
providing a headless API for you to
fully customize the UI of that login
experience so this isn't just a template
where you can configure a couple
parameters you can implement the entire
UI layer on your own using this headless
API and to make it easy for you to get
started we have an open-source UI
library that implements some of the best
practices of the sign-in experience that
we've learned over the years so that you
can use that as a quick way to get
started and since it's open source you
can go in and tailor that specifically
to the look and feel of your app the
third update that we've made third
upgrade to this is improvement on the
Android experience now with deeply
integrated with Android so that the user
sign experience a lot more seamless
first a spent showed you through the
login experience we're able to
automatically read the device's phone
number and the verification code so the
users don't have to manually enter those
and also if the device has been verified
recently we wouldn't even send the
verification code and what that means
for your users is just a one tap
experience forward to get started on
phone number off we're making this free
for up to 10,000 verifications per month
from our learnings and digits we expect
that over 90% of apps will be able to
use this for free now if you're wildly
successful and you want to continue to
scale is that one cent per verification
for users in US Canada and India and six
cents for users worldwide to help us
focus and continue to innovate faster
will be sunsetting the digits brand and
the SDK
for existing digits integrated apps will
be creating a migration guide and an
auto import tool so that you can import
the existing user base and auth tokens
over what this means is for your users
they will not have to reoffend reoffend
today when you migrate systems so we're
working hard to ensure there's a smooth
passport for you
firebase auth is available today on iOS
and web with Android rolling o in the
coming weeks as well for existing digits
developers will be releasing the
migration tools in the coming weeks as
well so you've just heard some updates
on this front we're super excited to
have the fabric team join us it's only
been four months but we're working
really hard to bring the best of our
platforms together now we're also moving
deliberately to ensure there's a smooth
transition for developers going forward
if you have more questions and if you're
interested to hear more about our vision
will be hosting a fireside chat right
here at state 7:00 tomorrow morning with
rich for a the general manager of fabric
and Julie one of the original cofounders
of firebase as well as Jason Titus they
BP and head of our developer product
group ok so let's get into our next
category of updates around the build
faster and easier segment this
incorporates the real-time database
authentication which we just talked
about cloud storage hosting and cloud
functions products and let's dive in so
two months ago we announced our public
beta of cloud functions for firebase
this gives you an easy way to take a
directory of JavaScript functions or
many directories and deploy them to the
cloud using our CLI tool or command line
tool firebase deploy each of these
functions that you create is
automatically mapped to a URL so you can
directly invoke them but you can also
map them to firebase events such as an
analytics conversion event when your
users have done something that's
particularly important to your business
or certain types of real-time database
updates or anytime a user signs in all
of these can trigger one of our
functions that you've deployed you can
use these integrations to do things like
send out user notifications
users signed up or thank them for an
in-app purchase you can do image
resizing video transcoding or machine
learning on photos that have been
uploaded you can transform data before
you save it to your database and you can
also integrate with external service
providers using web hooks one of our
startup partners arm wu integrated with
cloud functions and had this to say
about it they found that they were able
to move three times as fast at 15% of
the cost of apps a 50% of the cost of
their normal processes using functions
and we think that this is really a
powerful model for your development
moving forward relating to functions one
of the announcements we have today is
the integration with hosting hosting is
an easy way to serve static content like
HTML CSS and images you can configure
your own custom domain and we
automatically provision an SSL
certificate for you and also serve it
behind a global CDN so your users get a
secure and fast download now with the
functions integration what we do is we
can now take requests coming into
hosting and proxy it over to functions
to for additional server-side processing
so what that means is in addition to
serving static content you can now use
hosting with functions to build a fully
dynamic web app and so the other cool
thing really cool thing about it is
because functions is integrated with
other parts of firebase and also with
the Google cloud platform you can
continue to integrate your web app with
things like firebase author we talked
about earlier or really any other
back-end components put more simply you
can create a powerful progressive web
app completely serverless right on
firebase with an additional session to
specifically talk about the functions
and hosting integrations tomorrow
afternoon as five-thirty with david east
on our team all right so hosting is how
you can store static files that you need
during your apps runtime and we have
another product called firebase storage
which is about storing assets that are
dynamically generated at runtime
this is backed by the Google cloud
platform storage product what's new for
us this year are two things first we've
unlocked the ability for you to map
existing Google Cloud storage buckets
that you've signed up for already into
your firebase project whereas previously
you couldn't do that before the other
piece is you can now choose the region
in which you want to store your data
there's two reasons why this is
important one for regulatory reasons you
often want to control the country in
which your data resides and secondly it
can often lead the performance
improvements if you're able to specify
where in the world you want your data
located so these are the improvements we
made the cloud storage and then of
course there's real time database
firebases
original product the real time database
is the cloud host that JSON database
lets you store and sync data across
connector clients in real time so if
you're building any real time
synchronous apps like a chat app or or a
shared whiteboard or any kind of
real-time collaboration apps database
makes it really easy because whatever
you write data it would automatically
push the updates to keep all your
concern connected clients sync in real
time now we've we have concurrent limits
of up to 10,000 users today and now
we're expanding up to a hundred thousand
simultaneous connections with this
updates so think about this a hundred
thousand simultaneous users can plug in
and connect a database and we would
automatically push this keep them and
think in real-time for you additionally
we're also we've recently introduced a
profiler to allow you to introspect the
bandwidth and latency at path level
granularity to help you understand the
usage of your data so we just talked
about several of the backend services of
firebase we have a dedicated session
right after this here same stage at 3:00
p.m. with Angele one of the original
co-founders and also Michael by one of
our Angelis to talk about how we can use
firebase along with Google cloud
platform to build modern app
all right the next section we want to
run you through is app quality this is
critical no one wants their user
sessions interrupted with a crash or
poor performance and in fact over 50% of
the poor operating zwi see in the Play
Store come from quality related issues
so we have three products focused in
this area crash reporting test lab and
performance we talked about crash
earlier we're going to start with
performance monitoring so performance
monitoring when you declare dependency
on performance monitoring in your
firebase product project you
automatically get monitoring of your app
startup time and also of network
requests we show you four aspects of
your network requests we show you the
response time the payload size your
success rate and time went time spent
waiting versus downloading for network
traffic so this this is a powerful
introspection into what's happening with
your app and you can also add your own
time-based measurements we call them
traces with these you invoke a function
at the beginning of your code and at the
end that you want to measure and then
you can also supplement them with
something that we call counters so the
scenario you can think of here is you
can measure how long a certain request
takes and you can track how often you
were able to successfully cache or miss
on that on that request and the cool
part about performance monitoring is
that we collect all these metrics for
you and then you can through the console
drill in through a variety of different
filters to see exactly what's happening
across the world yellow really one of
our partners WPS office implemented this
we had an EAP program for performance
and they found that they were able to
increase performance by a significant
amount as measured by click-through
rates they said they got three to five X
improvements on their click throughs
after they used firebase performance to
see how long a certain part of their
application was loading this automation
had no idea about and in our experience
this is typical for developers we just
don't do a good job in general with
instrumenting this data and we think all
of us are going to be pretty surprised
once you start to see this data so
easily at what's happening all over the
world with our apps
yeah we're so excited about the new
release of the foreigners reporting tool
so sure to check that out so we
mentioned crashlytics earlier we just
talked about performance reporting these
are tools that help you monitor errors
after you've shipped your app out in the
users hands for Android developers we
also have firebase test lab with the
diversity of the Android ecosystem you
may now always have access to the most
popular devices to test your app with
and so this is where test lab comes in
tests lab gives you access to physical
and virtual devices hosted in Google's
data centers it's super easy to use all
you have to do is upload your app apk
and we have a robo crawler that would
automatically traverse through your app
to find errors and crashes and when it
does find a will will send you the bit
error laws as well as a video capture to
help you diagnose and fix the issue now
what's cool about test lab is that you
can also run many tests in parallel so
you have a full team of QA engineers so
you can configure this in a matrix of
different tests for example testing
different devices device models the
different device orientation and
portrait mode a landscape mode different
OS versions as well as different locales
now one of the new things that were
adding is first-class support for games
so if you're a game developer you can
now use test lab as well to
automatically run through your test loop
adding to that we're also reporting
performance metrics so that you can see
the CPU memory and network utilization
so I just talked about being able to
test in different configurations we're
also expanding test lab for you to
simulate different network connections
or network conditions whether it's 4G 3G
or slower to see how your app behaves in
the real world when the network
connection varies also we have expanded
our device selection you can now test on
samsung s7 as well as the Google pixel
and of course with test lab you get
access to the latest version of Android
Oh
is a great way for you to get started to
make sure your app runs well with
Android oh now I talked about the simple
path of using the Robo crawler where you
just update you use upload your app and
will test automatically it for the more
sophisticated developers you can also
upload your own custom test scripts
using frameworks like espresso and test
lab would run those manual tests for you
as well test lab can also be integrated
with popular continuous integration
systems like Jenkins so that you can
integrate this right into your
development flow for example every time
you have a build it can automatically
kick off a test through Tesla so we just
talked about some of the tools on how
you can use firebase to improve your app
quality we have a dedicated session
later on today here as well at 4:00 p.m.
with Nolan and Justin the product and
Ensley in this area to talk about how
you can use firebase to improve your app
quality okay that brings us to the next
section what's new in our grow related
tools so this is a broad category that
includes a lot of stuff we only have
time to cover analytics cloud messaging
and remote configuration we'll dive in
now so starting with analytics analytics
is this free and unlimited tool that
lets you instrument your app and the
reason we made it free and unlimited we
wanted to open up the opportunity for
you to deeply instrument your app we
want you to add events every everywhere
you can so that you can have a really
really rich and granular view of what's
happening in your application this tool
was built by the same Google Analytics
team that's been doing this for over a
decade and so we've been able to take
all the learnings of running the largest
web analytics platform into this product
we've also integrated it with the rest
of firebase which practically speaking
means that you can target audiences of
your users that think of groups of your
users with all of our products that are
identified by analytics so you can use
this to for example send messages to
just certain types of users to use
remote configuration to test your
application on just the right set of
users um and it works really well it's
also integrated with bigquery this is
important because bigquery gives you
this
ability to dive in and explore your data
in a variety of different ways using a
sequel like dialect that's really
powerful so you can explore your data in
depth and find out exactly what's
happening so what's new in analytics
well recently we had announced a feature
called stream view stream view provides
a real-time streaming view of events
that are coming into your app rendered
in this new UI as you can see on the
screen you can drill in by location user
properties and events to see what how
users are using your app right now for
example how many users are at level 5 of
my game right now in Brazil so it's a
great way to see what's happening now
relating the stream view you can also
drill in deeper specifically down to the
individual user level in a view called
users snapshot so you can zoom in this
is a big user and see the events that
are coming in so this is a great way for
you to it's like during a user study and
watching how users are interacting your
app with your app to see if they're
using it in the way that you're
expecting it's kind of like doing lock
ad remotely on the device and able to
see how users are using it relating to
stream view is another feature called
debug view that is near and dear to my
heart as a developer now instrumenting
your app and getting it all the details
right before you ship it it's oftentimes
pretty hard it's kind of like writing a
thousand lines of code and expecting it
to compile syntax free bug free all in
one shot now maybe some of you can do
that all the time but certainly I'm not
that good and so this is where debug
view comes in debug view provides this
dynamic Timeline view of events that are
coming in with from your connected
development device you can again zoom in
to see the events are coming in examine
the values and user properties to ensure
that you have instrumented your app
correctly and if you do have a syntax
error or say you have your you have an
invalid character or the string is too
long it would also automatically fly
that for you so it gives you a quick way
to iterate and make
sure that you've instrumented correctly
before you package package up your app
and ship it out to your users in other
enhancements that we've made to
analytics is the integration with Google
bigquery as Ben mentioned bigquery is
our petabyte scale cloud host the data
warehouse where you can do data analysis
using SQL queries and with the analytics
integration what we enable is a raw data
export from analytics into bigquery and
what's cool about that it means you can
also join additional data that you might
have for example one of our partners NPR
one had created a universal user ID
across their mobile app clients so
taking that data the analytics are
coming in from their mobile clients
they're also able to map that ID from
their server-side logs to see m2n how
users are interacting with their app and
it's a great way to also join all the
data across platforms to get a full view
one of the enhancements relating to this
is that we have enabled real time event
streamings for conversion events from
analytics into bigquery another aspect
is we have enabled the connection of a
tool called data studio which is part of
the Google Analytics suite that allows
you to build custom data visualizations
and reports on top of bakery so think
about this you have analytics that can
export raw events into bigquery and now
we can use data studio to build your own
custom report right on top of that so
what that means is essentially you can
create your own analytics UI suiting to
your needs and as I mentioned earlier
because the conversion events can be
streamed in real time these reports can
be fresh to show you the most important
metrics for you and another thing that
we're providing relating to the baked
goods at a data studio are pre-made
templates so that you have examples to
work off from to get started quickly in
building your own custom reports all
right let's talk about cloud messaging
firebase Cloud messaging gives you an
easy way to send notifications to your
users
either programmatically in response to
events for example or manually with the
console you can use in the firebase
website the firebase console to go and
then send a message to a particular set
of users FCM works across iOS Android
and the web and our recently released
SCM JavaScript SDK makes it even easier
for you to set up your website to
register to receive notifications we've
also made a series of other enhancements
to FCM first we've expanded its ability
to target users with notifications by
letting it send notifications based on
user properties so user properties are
really really granular attributes of
users that include things like the
version of the OS that they happen to be
using the version of the app that
they're using and it can be properties
that you come up with as well that you
assign to your users and so now you can
send notifications just to the set of
users that map particular custom
attributes that you're interested in for
iOS youth developers we've also made a
series of enhancements first we've added
support for token-based authentication
for APNs which is really important for
the iOS community
we've also added support for Apple's
HTTP version 2 API which means you can
use larger payload sizes in your
notifications and we now have a bulk
import feature for APNs tokens so it's
easier for you to migrate from using
APNs tokens to fcm tokens as you
interact with SCM and finally we've
simplified the logic involved with
registering with sem on iOS so we've
made FCM a lot easier to use if you're
an iOS developer and expanded his
capabilities overall another tool to
help you with user engagement and tuning
retention is remote config as the name
suggests remote config lets you change
the configuration of your app remotely
and on-the-fly very similar to FCM you
can also do this targeted based on
different user segments by different
user properties device type OS versions
and also custom audiences that you
create through analytics the config
itself it's just a simple key value map
so it's simple and yet flexible to do
many things for example you can change
the value to control a future rollout or
say you can change the value of to
manage a different price for something
that you're selling in your app or maybe
even changing a value to modify a button
label to different audiences to see
which one performs better as an example
we have one of our partners cookbook
recipes that a juice remote can fake to
customize their own user onboarding flow
based on the user's location so users
who are from India would get one
personalized experience and users from
Italy would get something else by using
remote config not only were they able to
get this started quickly because they
don't have to worry about creating their
own infrastructure or manage to scaling
it'll allow them to modify and chew and
fine-tune the user experience an
onboarding flow and what they saw
through the tweaking of these onboarding
flows was the increase of over 200
percent of new user signups so we've
just touched on some of the tools that
help you use firebase to grow and engage
more users we have another session here
tomorrow at 9:30 at 9:30 a.m. with
jimana and John two of our product
managers in this area to talk more about
how you can grow with firebase ok now
we're going to talk about the last
section which are the new developer
resources that we've created to help you
make the most out of firebase to start
out with we want to talk about Fastlane
so Fastlane came in to firebase through
the fabric team and it simplifies
releasing your iOS and Android apps by
automating many of the tedious tasks
associated with that process so think
about building your app generating and
localizing the screenshots that you need
code-signing deploying to the app store
all of these things can be automated
this product is fully open source and
customizable it's got over a hundred and
eighty built-in actions and another 160
actions created by the open source
community and it's passionately loved by
its community of users so we encourage
you to check it out
we've also created resources to help
developers learn more about firebase for
those of you who are inner interactive
learning we have an online video course
through Udacity to teach you more about
firebase in a weekend to date we have
over 15,000 developers that have
completed this three-day course so if
you're into interactive learning as
opposed to reading the documentation
alone this is a great way to learn more
about firebase whether you're just
getting started or looking to expand
your integration check it out at Udacity
comm slash Google hearing from our
customers and incorporating feedback is
a key part of our product development
process and we would not be here today
without the developer community and
feedback from developers like you so
thank you for that and we're looking to
expand our ability to collect feedback
with the launch of a new firebase alpha
program the firebase alpha program
provides early access to some of our in
development features so that you can
have the opportunity to provide early
feedback and also help us shape firebase
so we're really looking we're really
looking forward to hearing from you
please sign up at firebase Google comm
slash alpha finally we're also shared
there were open sourcing many of our
SDKs this is a really big effort for us
and it's a long-running effort and we've
made enormous progress at getting to
this point we've open-sourced these SDKs
at our github repository github.com
slash firebase and you can see the
source for many of our iOS JavaScript
and admin SDKs right now with more to
come in the coming months this is a
really important initiative to us and we
love your feedback on these projects
we'd love for you to get involved and
we'd love for you to tell us more about
what you want out of our open source
efforts finally we have a bunch of
additional sessions today tomorrow and
Friday on firebase we have a short URL
there that takes you to the Google i/o
site with a firebase filter for you to
review all those sessions you can
so filter it yourself we'd love for you
to come to the sessions to learn more we
also have dedicated office hours times
when you can come and talk to the fire
based team generally the firebase team
are all those folks in the yellow shirts
there are a few sneaking around in the
blue shirts and do but they're all
they're all back there and we'd love you
to just stop us anytime ask us questions
this is really your opportunity to
engage with us let us know what you
think and how we can better serve you
and then after the talk we also have a
sandbox area where we'll be where you
can also ask us follow-up questions so
you've just heard us talk about some of
the updates we've made to firebase you
might be wondering so what's next oh we
thought we share a couple of thoughts
about where we're headed overall we're
on a mission to simplify development and
app success and we're interested in
making the biggest impact we can in this
area and so you're going to see us
continue in this next year to update
firebase throughout the year to do more
things here
more specifically server this is a big
theme for us we're really excited about
empowering you to focus your energies on
the client which is really where your
users are interacting with you and let
us do the heavy lifting behind the
scenes on all the infrastructure and
give you a world-class high performance
back-end
I think it's sort of the idea of full
stack development and taking that stack
of things you have to know and reducing
it down so that you can be really
productive knowing less and worrying
about less another big theme for us in
the year ahead is to continue to deepen
the integrations within fire based
products so that you can continue to get
more value out of firebase as you
continue to use more and have these
components working better together
speaking of working better together we
had mentioned about having the fabric
team join us at Google and we're going
to be continuing to work hard to bring
these platforms together to ensure they
all work better together another key
theme is also with analytics being the
core of firebase we want to continue to
provide more insights to you so that you
can better understand how users are
using your app and also provides
insights to help you use firebase more
effectively we want to do is we want not
only provide the tools
but to make it also easier and empower
you to continue to build a more
successful business so we're going to
continue to help you develop and we're
going to continue to help you grow your
app success thank you very much for
spending this time with us we just
barely got through the overview please
continue to engage with us here also
through our Google Group and and
everywhere else that we are also on
Twitter and help us understand what we
can do to better serve you thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
