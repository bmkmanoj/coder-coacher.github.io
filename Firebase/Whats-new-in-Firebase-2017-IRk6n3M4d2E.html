quest to make it easier for you to build
successful apps and since we've expanded
firebase to a fully featured app
development platform we've been working
hard to build the improvements and
enhancements you've been asking for for
instance we recently added stream view
which lets you view samples of your
analytics data in real time so you can
see how users all around the world are
interacting with your app at that very
moment we also added support for debug
view which lets you view every analytics
event recorded and sent by a test device
to make sure you've implemented your
analytics exactly the way you'd like ooh
looks like you forgot a semicolon there
we launched cloud functions for firebase
which gives you the ability to run
server-side logic without ever needing
your own servers you can use cloud
functions to do everything from sending
out notifications to users in a chat app
to performing server-side image
processing to running sensitive business
logic that you just don't trust your
client with we've also launched support
for a number of firebase products on
both unity and C++ for all you
cross-platform game developers out there
and this year at i/o we announced a
whole new set of features to make it
even easier for you to build successful
apps we're adding phone number
authentication to firebase auth so you
can sign in your users with the simple
text message because it turns out nobody
is really all that excited about the
idea of creating yet another password
we've also added firebase performance
monitoring because we know you're fast
and responsive app might not be so fast
and responsive when your users aren't on
the same awesome Wi-Fi connection as
your office now you can find out when
your apps are running slowly for just
taking too darn long to get you the data
that you need based on performance data
from actual users in the real world and
while firebase hosting has always been a
great place for you to serve fast and
secure static content for your web app
we've now added support for you to
perform server-side processing through
cloud function this means you can now
serve dynamic content in your firebase
hosting website all about needing to set
up or manage your own servers in Google
Analytics for firebase the product
formerly known as firebase analytics
we've added reporting for custom event
parameters so you can now view summaries
of up to 50 parameters that you're
passing along to analytics whether
that's a final score in your game or how
long it took your user to complete the
tutorial right there and the firebase
console and if that isn't enough
you can always export your raw analytics
data to bigquery Google's super powerful
data warehouse in the cloud to perform
more sophisticated analysis and we're
happy to announce that we've added a new
free tier that lets you store analytics
data combine that with our recently
added one terabyte of free query data
and there's a lot you can do in bigquery
for a very little amount of money we've
also enhanced our analytics data up with
event data from AdMob Google's in-app
advertising solution now you can
automatically view reports for ad
impressions exposure time and clicks for
all ads served through AdMob this also
gives you a more accurate view of your
users lifetime value and ARPU because
these reports are based not just on the
in-app purchases your users make but
also on how much advertising revenue
they've earned for you so you get a much
better understanding of where you are
and aren't making money in your app
we've added firebase test lab support
for games because it turns out that
automated testing is something Game
Developers wants just as much as the
rest of us finally we started open
sourcing many of our SDKs to help
empower all of you in the developer
community to build out firebase the way
you want and then we decided that's
basically everything you need to develop
the perfect app and we've stopped
working on anything new
now just kidding we're constantly
working on all sorts of new features for
you and we'll have a lot more news to
announce over the next several months so
make sure you subscribe to the firebase
Channel and maybe check out our blog
post from time to time to see what's new
but until then it's never been a better
time to start developing your app with
firebase why not give it a try today you
can check out our fancy new website to
see what firebase can do for you and
then start using firebase in your own
app we can't wait to see what you built</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
