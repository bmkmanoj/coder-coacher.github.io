little bit emptier and it has been the
last day or so
oh but there was actually an event going
on right yeah it was kind of the reason
we were here beautiful venue we launched
some stuff we did we launched
predictions
I predict that's gonna be a big game
maybe testing for our config so you can
figure out what you want your app to be
like super excited about crashlytics -
I'm so glad that's ready I know so cool
Todd did a talk on analytics with
bigquery we had the cloud functions
writing great code and getting able to
scale from Thomas and Lauren
we had the flutter team here we had the
fabric team here we had the firebase
team here it was just this great amount
of talk that we got to listen to and we
gave a talk to zero there are so many
talks so many great presenters the only
thing I enjoyed more than watching the
talks with talking to everyone who came
I loved the ask firebase life it's so
great seeing what people are building
answering their questions I always end
up learning so much more there were some
great code labs going on where people
got to do this like hands-on training
while the engineer is very sitting there
at helping them and then after we talk
to them we do all this business we hear
what they're doing we got to go party
with that they had a DJ yep I don't know
he made it made me dance
let's do it again next year
do it for the sheet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
