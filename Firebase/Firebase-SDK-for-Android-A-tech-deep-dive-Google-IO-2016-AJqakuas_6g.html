don't know about you but I was dying
yesterday it was so hot up there I
talked to everyone in the tent next door
I felt bad for them because I'm sure I
smelled terrible went home had to take a
shower wash my fire-based shirt for sure
to to be able to be here today my name
is Doug Stephenson welcome it's great to
see a packed room and for everyone on
the livestream welcome as well
hmm I have sort of an eclectic mix of
things to share with you today with
respect to firebase in the Android SDK
so firebase as you may have seen is a
suite of integrated products designed to
help you develop your app grow user base
and earn money mm-hmm now I won't go
into all of firebase I'll go into some
things that I thought was interesting
when I sort of helped build and promote
firebase from an Android perspective so
first of all you should know firebase
works with Play services in fact
firebase for Android is part of Play
services firebase is distributed with
Play services and so it might be
interesting to know that from the
beginning
if you've tracked Play services
progression the lot of people like to do
apk breakdown so the Play services apk
used to be just a single apk with a
single Dex with code in it so everyone
knows what this is like this is just
like everyone else's app then when Play
services started to grow we had to do
multi decks now as you know Dex has a
limit of 65,000 or so reference methods
in it when you exceed that limit and
then you have to start multi dexing so
Play services is just like any other app
where it had to do multi dexing now Play
services is kind of special in that they
have to take very special care to
determine which objects go into the main
decks so the main decks normally is
constructed by the build tools for you
and we'll pick out that the classes in
it that need to be in the main decks but
there are certain things that that that
need to be in there that maybe you have
to tell it so if you're using reflection
or if you're doing anything prior to the
creation of multi decks that has to go
into the main decks and if you have
questions about the nuances of how this
works go find the Android office hours
they can help you work through that now
when play services continued to grow we
found that we needed a more of a maje of
our architecture so new features of play
services are now being embedded into the
apk as modules and the the value of
having modules here is that this lets us
do things like independent updates of
modules so in the past if we wanted to
update Play services we'd have to do
this monolithic apk download and that
took you know a lot of bandwidth and a
lot of time and it disrupted apps that
were trying to use it so now with this
modular interface we're letting the
entity modules update themselves outside
of the normal play services release
cycle so what this means for your app is
your apk and your code can now link
directly into the modules that are in
the firebase or that are in place
services so when you use firebase a lot
of times you're actually referencing
code that lives within play services
that code is being pulled directly into
your app not physically but in terms of
linking so you can think of it like kind
of like a shared library now this is
great because now you don't have to go
through a binder interface to get things
done like you did with Play services
previously now to get Play services you
to get firebase you will have to
download the latest update Play services
so be sure to get version 30 this is a
screenshot of the standalone updater
once you have version 30 then you can
start developing with firebase on
Android so the firebase Gradle plugin
which I guess is more correctly called
the Play services plug-in for Android
you might be curious what happens with
that plug-in well I'll tell you a little
bit about what happens three things one
it will read a configuration from your
Google services JSON so firebase is just
like play services was where you go to a
console you get a JSON file you drop it
into your app this contains
configuration that your app will use in
order to operate correctly and the other
two things we'll do is inject maven
dependencies so if you're looking at
this bit of code here it might look a
little bit strange this is actually
groovy code this is not Java code so
you'll notice the lack of a of a
semicolon and single quotes around some
of the strings so what we're doing here
is the the plug-in will reach into your
project look into its dependencies
collection and
add a compiled dependency on firebase
core now this firebase core module is
kind of interesting because it contains
no code now why would we add a
dependency on something that contains no
code that seems kind of weird
until you look inside the maven pom file
for this so a pom file is just sort of
metadata about how a dependency works
and you look in the highlighted section
here you can see that the firebase core
module depends on firebase analytics so
when you apply the Google services
plug-in to your firebase app you will
get analytics for free now this is kind
of important to note this is how
important we think that analytics is for
your app you get it always it's a
crucial part of firebase applications
and you'll see that throughout this
conference you'll see how firebase
analytics actually enhances the
capabilities of the other components
that you use in your app the third thing
that the plugin will do is inject some
resources so you can see in this bit of
code we're reaching into your project
into the Android configuration and for
each of the variants that you're
building what we'll do is find a unique
location for that variant that's your
file output directory and then we'll
create a task in this task what it does
is it will generate resources when it's
called so on that variant we can
register a resource generating task pass
it that that task that will actually do
the work and feed at the output
directory now what happens here is this
is this is an API within the Gradle
plugin that when it's called you can say
if this if this plug-in wants to
generate some resources this is an
output directory that that the rest of
the build will use to look for those
resources and what this does is it
actually drops fully-formed
valid Android resource files XML files
that will be merged into the build so
what all this task is doing is it's
reading out of that JSON file all of
those values and keys and configurations
and storing them as resources and that's
how your app actually gets a hold of all
the different things that it needs to
operate properly so if you're developing
with firebase you'll likely come across
this new task API now this is how the
this is how Play Service is doing
concurrency within within your app so
this is like the API that pretty much
all products will be
using going forward this is created just
for firebase api's however this could be
applied to any sort of Play services API
in the future now for firebase
specifically if you're using remote
config authentication or file storage
you will run across this task API so
it's important thing to know so the
general form of the async API is let's
say you have some API and we're calling
firebase thing and say you call a method
on that do stuff now this do stuff
method if it wants to do things
asynchronously it will return
immediately and generate a task object
and this task object is parametrized by
some result type whatever it wants to
generate so here we just have a task
that returns some result and on that
task is this as a representation of
background work on that task you can
register listeners so you can have a
success listener and then there's a
callback in there that will receive the
result type when it's been generated you
can register a failure listener which
then receives
an exception of whatever happened that
caused the task to fail so that that
right there is all you actually need to
handle these things correctly now
there's a third version where you can
just register an uncomplete listener and
what this does is it bundles both
success and failure up into a single
callback and if you choose to use a non
complete listener what you do is you get
a task and you can ask that task did you
complete successfully if you did give me
result if you do not complete
successfully well then give me the
exception so you can choose you can
either register success or failure
separately and independently or you can
do a completion listener and handle both
in the same callback so there's four
ways to get tasks results I've showed
you the general format but there's four
different ways and you should know each
one of them first of all there's a
callback on the main thread so this is
what I just showed you in the in the
previous slide you can add a successful
completion listener give it a listener
and this listener will be invoked on the
main thread now there's a different
format and you should know this one this
is actually more important than the last
one where you can get a callback scoped
to an activity and what it means to be
scoped to an activity is this listener
that you register will not get executed
if the activity goes through it's on
stop so if an activity is being stopped
the listener will be automatically
unread
and will not execute now this is really
important because if you register a
listener without unregistering it when
the activity dies you can have an
activity leak and that's terrible
you know the long running tasks that
exceed or go beyond the life cycle and
event of an activity can cause a leak
this causes out of memory problems and
they're actually very difficult to
diagnose so if you're calling this API
within an activity use the second format
use the format where it accepts an
activity object and you only register or
only have that listener for that one
activity now if you want to receive your
result on another thread so not on the
main thread if you if you want to handle
something in the background thread and
say you want to do more blocking work
after that you can feed an executor to
to the task listener now if you've never
dealt with an executor before it's
basically a Java or a JVM construct that
that identifies a thread to do work on
so the executor will make a decision and
say how do I deploy this to another
thread it could be just a single thread
or it could be a pool of threads or it
could be a growing and shrinking pool of
threads this API doesn't care the
executor cares where the thread goes you
just hand it an executor that makes that
decision and the last way is you can
actually just block the current thread
if you want to wait for the result in
line now I say right away don't do this
on the main thread don't block the main
thread we can't say that enough don't do
that in your hand your Android
applications it can lead to a fairly bad
user experience but if you do want to
block some other thread there's a
utility method on tasks called await and
you can call tasks await give it the
tests that you want to wait for it will
block and then the result will come out
of that now if you're not willing to
wait indefinitely you can feed it a
timeout and that timeout will sort of
time box the amount of time you're
willing to wait and it will return with
that with an execution exception now you
will have to catch both an execution
exception if the task fails or an
interrupted exception if the thread is
interrupted so you'll have to handle
that case here so let's say what do you
want to how do you do a sequence of work
now this is this can be common in some
android apps where you have task one
which leads to task two and so on and so
forth you have to do them in order
there's a special way to express this in
the tasks API using continuous or using
continue with tasks
and there's a subtle difference between
the two and I'll unpack those right now
so if you're using continue with you
will have to create a continuation
object and what a continuation object
does is it says I know how to there's
some result type for input and there's
some result type for output and within
my method when it's called then within
the ven method
it receives the task that's generating
the input type so you can see inside the
method we're calling task get result
that returns the input type then we can
do some transformations on it do
whatever we need to do and then generate
an output type in response and to make
use of that you just call on the origin
task you call task continue with feed it
the continuation and that feeds you yet
another task which is parametrized by
the output type now if using continuous
tasks it's very similar but slightly
different in that continue with task
generates a task it doesn't generate the
result type directly it generates a task
that is responsible for generating the
output type and the format for execution
is just the same task not continue with
tasks it returns a task object that you
can then wait on to get these results
now it begs the question oh I'm on the
wrong slide ok so dope shot of all this
test chaining business is that you have
a sort of syntactic sugar for executing
a series of tests so if you're like me
and you've worked with data processing
frameworks like spark you know that you
have a series of steps that you have to
execute so say for example you have a
query and that's going to generate a
result set then you want to filter and
maybe do some mapping so translate from
one data type to another sort those
results and group them by type you can
express that very succinctly like this
so this is how you do serialized chain
of execution so if you want to do
parallel task execution and I would say
this is actually more common than than
serial text at task execution if you
want to do it in parallel and this is
very common if you say I want to kick
off I don't know an authentication and a
query and do a database read and you
want those all to happen at the same
time but you only want to progress to
the next step
when all of those are complete so you
you only want to wait as long as the
longest one of those tasks
so to run things in parallel you can use
tasks dot win also tasks again as a
utility class win all is a utility
method that says I'll take each one of
the tasks that you want to wait on and
I'll generate from that a final task now
this is asynchronous you'll get a task
in response a synchronously parametrized
by void itself doesn't generate anything
but it gives you a target to listen to
to know when all the tasks are complete
so on this final task you add a success
listener and inside there you can reach
into all the other tests that were in
flight and get their results now it's
worth noting that if any one of these
tasks fail the entire thing will fail so
you'll need to check for that as well
same thing with serial tasks execution
if any one of your tasks in the serial
chain fails the whole thing will fail
and in fact that exception will get
propagated on from task to task until
the final result will receive the
original exception that caused the
failure ok so the easiest way to create
your own task is to create what's called
a callable and if you've never dealt
with a Collard ball it's a Java
construct very similar to runnable so
runnable takes nothing as input and
generates nothing as output but callable
takes nothing as input and generates
some parameterised type as output so in
this case right here we're creating a
callable it's parameterised by some
result type and it simply returns that
result type so put your work in a
callable
and then all you do is call tasks dot
call and then you feed it that callable
and immediately you'll get a task object
that is that you can wait on to get that
resolved now it's it's important to note
that tasks dot call will schedule your
work to run on the main thread so if
you're doing some blocking work and your
caller but you probably don't want that
you probably want to schedule that on
another thread and again there's a
format that takes an executor so create
an executor schedule your work on that
schedule your task on that and then you
can use that task in serial or parallel
tasks along with the firebase tasks so
now if you have your own threading
framework and I know there's a bunch of
them out there and everyone has their
own you know favorite asynchronous
writing framework you don't have to
abandon that to use tasks and you don't
have to abandon you don't have to wedge
tasks into that other format there's a
way to do some interoperability and
there's a bunch of code on this and I'll
try to unpack it so the interrupt method
here are the
class here is called task completion
source and what a task completion source
does is it provides kind of an empty
task for other threads to feed their
results into so when you have a task
completion source you can get a task out
of it and then register a success
listener and then that success listener
will again be parametrized by the type
that you're expecting now in this
example I'm below that I'm going to fire
up a new thread now you shouldn't do
this in an android app but this is here
just for illustration what you can do is
in that other thread whatever it's doing
if it's going to generate some result
and you need to feed that result into a
task you can just call source set result
and what that does is the task that's in
that result will then be fully completed
or fully resolved and so that's how you
can have things in your other
asynchronous framework work with the
task framework so that's all great now
I'd like to move on to some specific
product details so I'll tell you a
little bit about firebase crash
reporting now crash reporting is special
to me because I actually worked on this
like this was you know I I'm actually
the developer advocate for crash
reporting in test lab and so I have a
special place for me with a crash
reporting so you might ask the question
how do you actually detect a crash you
know that seems like a strange thing how
do you do it so I'm sure you all know
this dialogue if you're an Android
developer you have seen this dialogue if
you haven't seen this dialogue I'm
willing to bet you've never written a
line of Android code or a really darn
good developer so and actually I think
this this dialogue is actually kind of
funny because it's saying something
rather unfortunate happened and I'm
asked to be ok with it now I don't think
this is okay this is this is not okay so
the button should actually say not okay
I really think it should say not okay
but in this case I'm being asked to say
that it's okay and then when you push
okay then the then the process finally
dies so the way to handle this case is
using something called an uncaught
exception Handler and this is a regular
Java construct this is an interface
under under java.lang thread you can
register one of these and this will get
notified if there's an exception that
popped off the call stack so if there
was usually a runtime exception more
often than not a nullpointerexception
that made its way all the way back to
the top of the call stack and you want
to know
that happened use an uncaught exception
handler so the interface of that is
pretty simple here I'm creating an
anonymous uncaught exception handler I'm
I'm going to receive the thread that
actually generated that and the
throwable that made it outside the call
stack and then what I can do is to
register this for all threads within my
JVM or art or dalvik or whatever you
want to call it you can call set default
uncaught exception handler a great
verbose Java name pass it that handler
and then what happens is any time for
any thread if it's going to crash with
an exception you'll get called before
the process finally dies now actually I
advanced a little too soon so if you if
you wrecked your own Cod exception
handler that does nothing so like in the
previous slide there was no there was no
implementation there if you register
that it will actually keep your app from
crashing it will continue to run which
is probably not what you want because if
a runtime exception gets thrown that
will actually you know that's a bad
thing for your app it really should die
things could be in a bad state you don't
want to continue so what you really want
to do is call through to the prior
exception handler so this is the best
practice this is kind of the the
understood practice for exception
handlers it's the first thing you do you
get the prior default exception handler
then you create your own and call
through to the prior one when you're
done this let's use this let's a bunch
of components all create a different
sort of like chain of restraint of
responsibility but a chain of action so
you can register a bunch of default
exception handlers each one of them will
run in turn until the original default
exception handler the Android exception
handler which is responsible for putting
up that the crash dialog will finally
run so you've probably seen this as well
this is an ANR or application not
responding this happens when you run
something on the main thread that takes
more than 5 seconds and more often than
not then that's sort of like Network
access or file access that's of too long
or some sort of algorithm that got out
of control this is a bad user experience
again it's asking me to be ok with that
I'm not really okay with it and I
probably don't want to wait but this is
not a this is not generated from an
uncaught exception handler this is
Android kicking in and said look your
main thread is
you know is out of order you know that
user needs to be able to decide do I
want to keep waiting for this now it's
worth noting that inside your default
uncaught exception handler if you block
too long and Android you can still ANR
the app so your uncaught exception
handlers still have to follow the
general rules of Android development
where you don't block it it's a kind of
a bad idea and if you do block for more
than five seconds and the user chooses
to terminate the app by saying okay
you'll lose that crash the Android as a
platform will kill your app so in your
uncaught exception handler you need to
be quick you need to get out and let
that app crash and let the user move on
okay so all that aside now hold that it
all in your mind for a moment and say
now let's talk about how crash reporting
actually works so at some point we need
to register this uncaught exception
hammer crash reporting needs to do this
and we use a content provider for this
now that seems weird why would you use a
content provider to register crash
reporting isn't a content provider
supposed to provide content you would
say yeah of course supposed to provide
content but there's some interesting
properties about content providers that
make this interesting and it's it's
worth a while to look at how an Android
process actually starts up so there's a
there's a procedure that every Android
app goes through so the first thing that
happens when an Android process starts
up is every content provider that you
declare in your manifest goes to its on
create in order of priority so if
there's a priority definition there it
will go in that order
now it's also worth noting that this
happens in your main process only if you
have a multi process app and most of you
probably do not but if you have if you
have a multi process app this process
the content providers will not be
created off the main process the second
thing that happens is your application
subclass will be created so if you've
defined an application subclass which I
think something like a third of all
Android apps do this that will be
initialized go through it's on create
after all the content providers then
once that happened the third thing that
happens is whatever component that needs
to be invoked will be invoked so usually
it's an app launch and so an activity
will come into play or a service could
have been started or a broadcast
receiver whatever the invoked component
is it will not be
created and run until content providers
and applications all in it
so it's worth noting here content
provider is the earliest hook into the
Android process right so that's why we
initialize crash reporting there if we
initialize crash reporting in a content
provider that means we will happen
before application and before everything
else so that's one benefit the other
benefit to using a content provider is
that content providers participate in
Android manifest merger so in Android
you know that if you have library
projects and all of those things from
all of those manifests all get combined
into a single manifest for your app so
if we define in our crash reporting
library a content provider that doesn't
it that automatically gets pulled into
your app and that automatically causes
initialization this is great because you
don't have to write a line of code to
initialize all you do is depend on the
library and manifest merger will bring
our content provider and do the
initialization and it's super easy for
you
now the reason now you say couldn't use
application for that well you could use
application but applications don't
participate in Android manifest merger
the only way you can define and an
application object is you and your
manifest library projects cannot
contribute to applications they can't
hook into on create so that's why we're
using content writer now the firebase
uncaught exception handler does a number
of things the first thing it does is it
collects a lot of information about the
device so this is when we go off and
find the device type and measure memory
and serialize the exception and what
we're going to do is dump that all into
a proto buff and send that to a crash
service now the craft service is an
android service and the way we built it
at least for launch for this launch is
to run in another process so the crash
services that do persistence of the
crash will write it to disk and do the
transmission all happens in another
process now this is a clever idea right
if you remember back before you can say
you know the idea of causing an aien are
within your crash handlers a bad idea so
what we wanted to do is get all that
data as fast as possible and ship it off
to another process let that do the
blocking let that let that do the
writing to this let that do to the
writing to network and then let the main
app process crash gracefully and let the
user move on and do it
they want this also lets us do
persistent retry so this other process
can go and keep retrying and sending
that crash so we can get as fast as
possible now there's a little problem
with this with this scheme so let's look
at what the problem is now I don't know
if you can see it right away
we didn't see it until until late in the
in the development cycle and I'll say a
little bit more about that but here's a
situation we have we have a main app
process and it goes through its content
provider goes through its application
and it goes through its invoked
components now we have this background
process that's handling the crash it
goes through its application in it and
the crash service gets invoked the
problem here is that if your application
object is writing to some shared
resource to a database or to a file
there's a potential for a race conflict
here
if so most app developers don't actually
depend or expect that their application
object would be run twice the normal
expectation is that it's run once in a
single process but because we're running
crash reporting in another process that
means we have a second application
object just like the first and it's
doing the same thing as the first so if
your application object is writing to a
database you could actually run into a
locking problem so we actually didn't we
didn't detect this the people who
detected this were our early access
partners we had a couple partners who
had some strange errors and we couldn't
figure it out and it turned out this was
the problem and this is one of the
reasons why we're launching crash
reporting for Android as beta because of
this now it should be it should be told
that crash reporting is you know it's
production-ready
we want you to use it we really hope you
use it we think it's a great tool but
you should know if your application
object is doing any of any of this
writing to a database or writing to a
file crash reporting may cause problems
for you and this is something we're
hoping you revolve or resolve now
there's another problem with this this
plan of using a background task is that
there's a movement within Google to
encourage apps to eliminate background
invisible work no I'll define what
invisible work is invisible work is
something your app is doing without a UI
displaying so if you have no activity
that started in the foreground so that
would be visible work or if
have a service that has a notification
in the curtain that's visible work so if
you don't have either either one of
those situations that's invisible work
and at Google work trying to you know
encourage developers to cut back on the
amount of invisible work because that
can you know caused battery drain or
unknown like data usage so for crash
reporting this actually you know is
we're doing invisible work so we need to
cut down on that now I was expecting to
have a URL to a blog post we talked a
little bit more about that unfortunately
it's not available I'll have that on
Monday I think the plan is to publish
this on Monday so if you join the spaces
for this talk I can get you that you are
on I think it'll be posted on our medium
blog so if you want to read more about
that follow up with that so in the next
version of crash reporting we will
actually not have a background process
we're working on eliminating that the
upsides of course it will work more
widely so we don't have to worry about
apps with application objects that that
that aren't compatible and it'll be more
compliant to development trends we'll be
cutting back on this invisible work the
downside is that there is an increased
chance of latency so with the old
solution we could be verily certain that
we can get that crash packaged and sent
in very quickly but if we're competing
with the idea that the app may die
before we can get the crash you know out
of the you know into our servers and out
of the app there's just a risk that we
just can't get it immediately and also
this gives us a sort of constraint of
being able to retry less frequently so
that said there's trade-offs we're going
for the for the no background processed
version okay so that's crash reporting
I'll say a little bit about how things
work on didn't advance firebase
analytics okay so another interesting
thing you might be wondering how does
firebase analytics track user behavior
now if you recall earlier we put
analytics in every firebase app this is
a very important component and what it
does one of the things it does is it
tracks the usage for your app now this
is great you do nothing you actually
write zero lines of code and you get
tracking and you might be wondering well
how does analytics actually do that if
you're not writing code how does it
reach into my app and know how the user
is using it
so the question that we're trying to ant
ask is how do we determine when the app
is in the foreground and when the app is
in the background how do you how do you
track the time spent in the app and how
do they navigate activities and this is
useful for determining things like how
long a session is or how how frequently
a user is using your app now the way we
do that is using something called
activity lifecycle callbacks this is an
API in android
it's available since Ice Cream Sandwich
and Beyond so API level 14 if you create
one of these and register it with your
app you can receive callbacks for every
activity in your app so this is like a
universal listener for all activities so
you know all activities clearly have to
go through you know they're a create
start resume and so forth you can listen
to every single one of those and this is
how firebase analytics determines how
users are using your app so if for this
interface we have created started resume
pause stop destroyed and save in sustain
you can listen to all these but there's
two in particular that are of interest
to us and determining how a user is
using your app and that is unstart and
onstop so here's a bit of code it's it's
kind of a it's a little bit pseudocode e
but this is something you could actually
do in your own app if you want to track
something similar so I'll walk you
through these lines of code so the first
thing we want to do is count the number
of activities that have been started so
that's numsa
the moment at which the user first
enters the app and that's user entered
time now when we listen to on activity
started what we can do is say if there
are no activities currently started so
num started equals zero what we can do
is record the current time and that's
the time that the user launched the app
or first entered it from say the task
switcher and then we what we do is we
increment the number of started
activities then as an activity is
stopped we'll turn around decrement the
number of started activities and say if
the number of started activities is zero
meaning there's no activities visible
right now record the time that they left
the app do a little math and say this is
how long the user was in the app now
this is pretty handy right this this is
a fairly bulletproof way of knowing when
the user was looking at your your app
and when they were not because as long
as you have an activity started you can
be certain that you were on this
when your activity is stopped you can be
certain that you are invisible so this
is how we track that so what's next
after here so I've given a bunch of
information I hope you found it useful
now if you're an iOS developer there's
another talk in this room after lunch
from an iOS perspective if you have
questions we want to know anything about
firebase there's links here and if you
want to join the space and ask questions
and interact with each other and I have
that link to the blog post that'll be
here as well so it looks like we have
some amount of time left I'll take some
questions if anyone's if anyone like it
and thank you for being here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
