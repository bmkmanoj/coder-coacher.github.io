lead on firebase this talk is how to
grow your a pic firebase so as you know
firebase is a suite of products to help
you develop your app grow your user base
and make money our goal at firebase is
to make appt success simpler and this
includes a range of tools to help you
develop your app but we also care about
helping you grow your business and the
new grow pillar in firebase is our first
step in that direction to see how it can
help let's meet Mary who is building a
brand new app her focus in the beginning
is not user acquisition her focus is to
figure out is there a market for her are
her questions are like are people using
it what are they doing with it and does
it solve a problem for them firebase
analytics can help her answer these
questions she integrates the core
firebase sdk and analytics starts
tracking key metrics like usage and
retention and as she iterates with her
app it shows her how her metrics change
by cohort and once she gets the product
market fit then she's ready for growth
her approach to growth is to focus first
on retention and then on user
acquisition she understands there's no
point in acquiring users if you can't
actually keep them so her goal is to
ensure that when she acquires a group of
users a good fraction of them stick
around and become long-term users once
an app has good retention then effort
spent on user acquisition is worth it
from every Co heart that she acquires a
good fraction stick around and this is
what leads to growth to help you with
growth firebase has five products that
help you acquire an engage on Google
search
on devices that have the app installed
on with web email and SMS channels
wherever you can use URLs and with paid
ads these products to help you acquire
and engage are complemented by two
products that help you measure what's
happening and that lets that let you
quickly iterate through experiments so
Mary decides to start integrating with
firebase to start her journey on growth
by integrating and trying out the first
and easiest product which is get her app
into Google's index by doing this Google
search can surface or app whenever it's
relevant to tell us more about app
indexing please welcome jennifer lynn
thanks Raghavan hi i'm jennifer lynn the
inch LED for app indexing so what is
happened XE it's similar to indexing the
web but for apps we index content from
android and iOS apps and then we rank
and serve the app content on google
search so why should you care about app
indexing well there are more than 100
billion searches per month on google and
more google searches take place on
mobile devices than on computers in 10
countries including US and japan so how
can you get these billions of mobile
searches to your apps the answer is app
indexing app indexing brings organic
traffic from Google search to your
Android and iOS apps it not only drives
reengagement but it also helps increase
installs let's see how app indexing
achieves this with examples from
integrated Apps users that have these
apps installed can see search results
that are enhanced with your app icon and
your app name these search results are
also ranked higher tapping on them takes
users directly to the right content
within the app such as the homes for
sale page in realtor.com app the coke re
restaurant page in the tripadvisor app
or the top 10 Tokyo hotels page in the
Expedia app app indexing not only brings
you organic traffic from the Google
search result pages but also from search
auto completions let's say some users
signed up on their Eventbrite app to
attend the Maker Faire event and a day
before the event they wanted to check
the details while typing in the Google
search box they get a search auto
completion result for the Maker Faire
event and tapping this opens the right
page within the eventbrite app in
addition to driving reengagement from
search auto completions app indexing
brings you organic traffic from Google
now on tap both of which are currently
available only on Android
let's say my friend received an email to
watch a movie when she taps and holds
the home button on Android Google now on
tap slides up with the relevant content
including her installed apps like IMDB
and Wikipedia which are best guess of
what might be helpful for her in the
moment tapping on the IMDb app icon
takes her straight to the Martian page
within the app so once you've integrated
with app indexing google search
re-engages your install base from the
search result pages search auto
completions and Google now on tap but
what about the users who haven't
installed your apps yesterday's keynote
announced android instant apps which run
instantly without requiring installation
when an app becomes an instant app users
can now discover it on Google search the
search results will still show the app
icon and app name but now with the text
instant tapping on them takes you
directly to the right place within the
instant app and later on users can
upgrade to installing the app by
publishing your app in the Play Store
and the App Store Google search shows
results for installing your app like
these it's possible that the search
result for installing an app like cook
pad isn't ranked high here we see search
results from coke pads website and
knowledge panel but after integrating
with app indexing the search result for
installing cook pad is now ranked higher
so app indexing can help you influence
the ranking of your search results so
that you can get more installs from
google search so how is app indexing
doing we first launched app indexing in
December 2013 with 13 apps and two and a
half years later tens of thousands of
apps like Pinterest Twitter cook pad and
myntra have integrated we now have over
200 billion at URLs
in the index we also have success
stories from apps like the guardian etsy
Aliexpress an amoeba all of them have
seen increased traffic to their app
content for example Aliexpress a
shopping marketplace increase their
transaction value by two hundred percent
from users who ordered from app you are
ELLs compared to users who ordered from
mobile web URLs has introduced in
yesterday's keynote app indexing is now
part of firebase this means you'll now
access app indexing from the firebase
SDK this is the same app indexing
product for those of you who've already
integrated so what do you need to do to
get the benefits of a of app indexing
there's two steps to integrating with
app indexing first you need to get your
app content on Google search you can do
this by adding HTTP URLs to your app we
discourage custom scheme your eyes
because we think it's easier and cleaner
to maintain one set of HTTP URLs for
cross-platform content second second you
need you can get your app content ranked
higher on Google search in order to get
more installs and more reengagement you
can do this by calling the app indexing
API now I'll briefly go over each step
first for iOS apps then for android apps
on iOS the first step is to implement
universal links which was introduced in
iOS 9 in your entitlement stop he list
you need to associate your iOS app with
your domain in this example seatgeek com
then you need to create and host an
apple app site Association file that
associates your domain with your app ID
and includes the HTTP URLs that your app
can handle in this example see geek.com
splash star dash ticket
the second step is to call the app
indexing API with your iTunes ID so
Google can show your app icon and app
name in the search results to your
install base you can find this API in
the firebase iOS SDK on Android the
first step is to implement app links in
your manifest every activity that you
want Google search to send traffic to
needs to specify the HTTP URL that your
app can handle in this example events
dog google com io 2016 schedule star
then you need to create an host an asset
links JSON file that associates your
domain with your app package name in
this example we're associating events
dog google com with the Google i/o app
you can find oh I'm sorry and then the
second step is to call the app indexing
API with the title and the HTTP URL of
the page that the user viewed this is so
Google can rank your search results
higher and you can find this API in the
firebase Android SDK next you can verify
your app indexing integration with the
search preview tool this tool lets you
preview what your search results will
look like for a given a qrl otherwise it
returns error messages to help you fix
your implementation now you're done
within 24 hours to a few days Google
search will start indexing your app once
that's completed you can go to the
Google search console to measure your
apps performance on Google search the
search console provides Search Search
impressions and clicks for your app
content as well as any error reports for
from indexing your app we've also
started an early access program with
partners like viber and LinkedIn to
index personal content such as messages
and documents to learn more and to sign
up please attend our deep dive session
on
app indexing today at 2pm at stage 7 at
this point Mary's Android and iOS apps
get organic traffic and more installs
from the billions of mobile searches on
Google the next thing Mary can do to
increase user retention is firebase
remote configuration and firebase
notifications to tell us more please
welcome Francesco
Thank You Jennifer good morning let's
see how remotely configuring your
application can actually help you drive
user engagement if you recall at the
beginning of this session ragavan talked
about Mary focusing on retention before
acquisition that's because the retention
play a really big role in a success
story of application development merry
as a problem her users when try the
application they stopped Midway during
the signup flow and this is a common
problem signup flows onboarding flows
they tend to have a lot of friction drag
event himself before joining Google he
was working on application called
Odyssey that lets you manage and upload
photos in the background and the big day
when it came and they launch the
application he saw that only thirty
percent of the population would complete
the signup flow and use the app so what
they did I went back packaged new apk
published in the App Store back and
forth every two or three weeks now you
fast-forward seven months and they reach
the staggering result of eighty percent
signup flow completion which is a pretty
good results for all of us and Mary but
what many doesn't like is the churn the
investment the seven months that took to
get there for Mary's lucky because now
there is fire base and she doesn't
introduce her I'm introduced a new
service called fireplace remote config
which lets you instrumental application
so that you can change the values of the
variables that you used in application
and change the behavior or of your
application on the fly firebase remote
config is a web console when you can go
and a manually change all the variables
are used to instrument and then you can
select populations or devices like
different groups of devices at the same
time what you can apply those new values
so you can select groups of devices by
its own language country application
version over insistent I and more and
for each of this set you can specify a
small percentage of population that gets
the new values first
so you can do staged rollouts staged
rollouts are important for two main
things one if you activate a new code
path or change the behavior you might
have a bug and you can contain the
damage on a small population and to you
can collect early feedback for your
features so let's say that mary has a
Buy button in the application but she
doesn't get my traction she wants to try
if the label to get or try get more
traction so she can do so with staging
the roller and this last example will be
very useful formalities target the
population of users that actually made
the purchase we integrated far based
remote config with firebase analytics so
now we can do that in the signup flow
Mary could target those users that
initiated a signup flow and then I'm
fell off to try a new flow for mr. mode
config works for both iOS and Android
and you get started it's really simple
you're pulling the 5s SDK and this is a
objective-c example in iOS you
initialize fireplace remote config you
do an initial fetch when the application
opens and now you can play with your
variables throughout the code we have a
deep dive session tomorrow about config
please join us if you want to learn more
but you can use it today for free and
it's available to everybody now back to
our signup flow example Mary now can do
a/b testing to see what works and what
doesn't and in every AP testing
experiment that is the lucky population
they get to explain experience the good
flow on a and the not so lucky
population they get and not so good flow
on being so how does Mary get those
users to try the application again now
the figures out a good flow one very
powerful tool to the sir notifications
notifications of those messages that get
displayed in front of a user they grab
their attention and the let them do
something notifications are really
powerful there are studies that show
that users that opting into
notifications are ninety percent more
likely to come back into the app as
opposed to those that don't
a few years back we launched a very
powerful tool that I to send messages
and notification called Google Cloud
messaging you guys aware of it anybody
use it we launched a new version of it
this year a fire place called firebase
Cloud messaging which is a very similar
service just the reach of API this
service lets you send all the messages
that you want but sometimes send in too
many messages drives the opposite effect
we overwhelm our users and they either
silence the notifications or uninstall
the app so it's very important to figure
out when we should send a notification
who should we target and what is the
content of the notification and it's not
an easy task so to help you in this task
have firebase we decided to build a new
product on top of firebase Cloud
messaging called firebase notifications
for base notification is a web console
where American go in and type a please
come back try a new flow you can target
users based on language country
application version and more and is also
integrate with analytics so she can
target the users that try the sign up
first and they drop off firebase
notification is a comply and composed
analyze feedback loop but you can keep
improving your engagement strategies by
analyzing what worked and what not with
analytics in fact firebase analytics
comes right away with the final analysis
in our example of try the signup flow
again up Mary what firebase notification
tells her is during the campaign how
many messages being sent so far and also
out of the box it has how many users
open that notification came back to
their now what's important to marry is
to know of those users that came back
how many to complete the signup flow so
she goes on the firebase notification
set up the goal and far with
notification tells Eric of those 500 + +
now 300 got completed saniflo when we
built this products in firebase we
partner with some early access partners
that helped us shape the products and
give us feedback one of these partners
was bus but which is an application that
lets you buy bus tickets and they use
firebase notification very similar way
as Meredith when the user start the
purchase of a ticket and then doesn't
complete it they'd send a notification
to get them back to that and that
conversion event is those users that
finally made the purchase another
partner is aces they build a home
management application and they use
firebase notification to notify the
users where there are new features as i
mentioned firebase notification is built
on top of firebase Club messaging so
it's available for both iOS and Android
and to use it to get started you don't
even have to write code you just make
sure that you pull in the dependency
this is a pot 5 for iOS of firebase
called messaging here is a great example
for Android and you're done if you want
to learn more there is a session this
afternoon called firebase notifications
where we going to show some demos of how
easy and powerful this product is so now
back to mary has a very engaged
population because they use app indexing
remote config fibrous notifications and
their next goal is to increase the
population how she does she acquire new
users one powerful tool is dynamic links
please welcome back Ragavan to tell you
all about that thank you
Thank You Francesco samaire is now ready
to start active marketing for higher up
which now has greater greater tension
and this includes basically putting
posts on social media by email by SMS
even some physical sources like putting
URLs and NFC tags on Billboard's perhaps
but all these marketing sources have one
thing in common they are based upon URLs
being posted and Barry wants two things
first from these URLs first these URLs
need to have analytics and attribution
so that she can figure out how they are
performing and which users are coming
from which channels the second she wants
them to be shot so that she can post
them on SMS and Twitter and and media
that requires short sources but she also
wants see URL to tackle some other
problems when the order list tab Mady
really wants to provide the best
possible experience and this best
experience depends on a few things when
the app is installed she may want to
open the app and opening the app
actually depends on is a link being
clicked on a modern platform that
supports HTTP URLs or not and even if it
is if the link is clicked for example on
a web view inside iOS 9 it doesn't
automatically obey Universal links you
have to use a custom scheme it's an
older platform like pre Android M or iOS
8 you have to use custom schemes if the
app is not installed she may want to
choose should I take them to an app
installed flow or should I take them to
mobile web and if she does take you to
mobile web what page she shows would
actually depend on where the user is and
what they were doing so doing all this
can get complicated so firebase dynamic
links provides a single URL that handles
all these cases it is two things first
it lets you configure for each of these
cases what you want user experience and
second when the link is actually tapped
it detects a client that is trying to
access the lake and then executes the
right code so
that user get the right experience on
that particular client so we are
launching this today with a limited set
of core features so in many start using
dynamic links her app gets its own
subdomain under app goo GL and once she
has a subdomain she can actually put
this in our app and make this universal
link or Appling so that clicks on this
will open in the app if the app is
installed so with this URL she can then
start adding query parameters to
configure what the URL does when it's
actually clicked and to configure the
behavior here the URL has one parameter
which is basically a deep link that
needs to be given to the app when it's
opened so we recommend a two step
process to start using dynamic link step
one is to set up regular deep linking in
your app this is basically using your
own domain too deeply into the app to
create peopling should open the app and
they are installed and if the app is not
installed he just goes to mobile web
these links don't provide tracking or
any of those features but that is the
first step to get started step two is to
set up dynamic links this requires
getting an app code just like you saw
earlier and and then calling our AP is
which will go into briefly in a little
bit so dynamic links have three
properties they're dynamic which means
that first as we talked about you can
specify the behavior you want and second
the link will detect the client work
that is accessing it and try to make
that behavior possible some other things
that you can do with these links is you
can ask you to check is the right
android app version install if it is not
take the user to an upgrade flow you can
configure different apps to be installed
depending on the platform iOS or you
know an iphone or ipad you can on
desktop we can make sure it behaves
properly even though it's meant to be a
mobile link it behaves properly on our
most most platforms android priam iOS 8
but the link is to click on the web view
in all these cases so with all these
parameters here's an example of a link
with a few more parameters specified and
as you add parameters the link can get
pretty long and this is fine if the link
is being used
as an extra in an email or in a web page
but the link is being used in a text
message or on Twitter you want something
shorter so dynamic links has a built-in
URL shortener which lets you shorten
these links on the same subdomain that
the app has been allocated and you can
post these wherever you want the second
property of dynamic links is that
they're durable this means that the
links can survive app installs so let's
take a look at a few few apps that have
used both these features to provide a
great experience for their users so here
is a nap but a user landing from an
email finds out that the app is not
installed and so he has to go through an
app install flow and after the app
install since the app doesn't know why
they came here it takes the user through
an onboarding flow and at the end of it
the user has to go back has to find a
search screen in the app and then search
for the content they came for it takes
to order doesn't clicks to get to what
they want but when they actually clicked
on the link with dynamic links the app
knows why the user install the app on
first open and it can directly take the
user to the desired screen producing it
in this case 2 four klicks so what
benefit does this bring so one of our
partners who actually improve their
onboarding link based on boarding with
this flow saw that retention after four
weeks increased by a ninety-two percent
for users who came from links
so this is this is one my use case and
this is Shazam who is running a very
interesting promotion on Android where
they have coke bottles and you can scan
a special text or logo on the coke
bottle which takes you to a very special
lip-syncing experience and once you
record your lip-sync you can share it on
social media when you tap and your
friend tabs on that social media share
they are taken to a mobile web view
where they can play that shared video
and then they are given the option a
call to action allows them to actually
make their own video but making the
video needs the app so if you didn't
have dynamic links this particular use
case would require multiple buttons here
one for the case I have the app okay
click on the link and take me to the app
and a second for the case i don't have
the app so take me to the App Store
download it and then I hope I'll find
experience in the app with dynamic links
it handles both these use cases with a
single click and in both cases takes the
user to the right experience this is a
third use case where if you have a lot
of cus users on your desktop app then
you can use dynamic links to convert
them to mobile app users if that can get
them to a better experience so if the
user has searched for some some content
on the desktop you can offer them the
option to email that to themselves which
is what they're doing over here right
and when they get that email email and
click on any platform and if it happens
to be a phone and iOS or Android device
then if that email contains a dynamic
link which detects is the app installed
if it is open the app at the right place
if it is not install the app and the app
can take them to the right place on
first / and if it ends up on a platform
where there is no app for that
particular service then it can take them
to a default web page for that
particular platform
so third property of dynamic links his
attribution dynamic links are built for
growth and growth is all about
measurement so dynamic links come with
analytics and tracking you can specify
UTM parameters on the link and these
parameters automatically show up and
propagate to firebase analytics and you
can track you can attribute a conversion
events to figure out hey this particular
conversion even that happened you know
which source medium campaign it came
from firebase console also shows you all
the links you've created and the number
of clicks on each one and their trend
line as to how they are performing we
also know that one of the big use cases
of these links is app installs and
installs do show up on firebase but
sometimes you also want the installs to
show up properly attributed in the app
store itself so we can do that too so
far base so on each link you can add
this is an iOS example you can add the
affiliate tracking parameters so if this
link results in an iOS app installed
then in the iOS app store it we properly
attributed these campaigns that you have
wonder like so what does it take to
actually implement dynamic links so we
already saw that we start the first two
steps which is to get going with the
regular deep links and to get an app
code what's left is to actually call our
API and we'll go all that very briefly
here so since then I make links apart of
firebase set up a straightforward they
get set up as part of our base once they
are set up you need on iOS our API needs
to be called in two places in openurl
and in continue user activity in both
those places the API call it should
check the URL that came is that a
dynamically or not and if it is you the
link is given to you for you to process
and handle it's similar on Android on
Android once an app is installed you can
actually open the app from three places
it could be open directly from the Play
Store it can be open from the
notification that comes
let's say hey a new app has been
installed or even open it for the first
time from the launcher so to make sure
that the deep link propagates properly
in all these three cases we have a new
API called get invitation which needs to
be called in your main activity on
create so for more details on these ap
is and for any questions about this
please be sure to come to our session
that's about dynamics in whites today at
11 so in this section we have seen how
dynamic links provides Mary with
powerful URLs for marketing one of the
big use cases for heard user acquisition
with dynamic links is actually sharing
and sharing by users who already have
the app and this is such an important
use case in such a common use case that
we had actually built and out-of-the-box
flow for this called app and whites and
and announce that at last iOS app in
white is not part of firebase as far
base in lights ok so in whites now
leverage is Google smarts and dynamic
links to provide a very effective in
white flow for email and SMS from start
to finish let's take a look at how this
works in in a sample app and this is
yummly so each content screen has a
share button and tapping on that leads
to a share sheet and in the share sheet
far base in which allows you to have a
single button for shedding by both email
and SMS having a single button that lets
you do both increases the number of
shares by ten percent when you tap on
the invite button it leads to the UI
composer UI and in the composite you I
in whites actually shows the user
suggestions on who they should share
with the users from this list are forty
percent more likely to actually engage
with the email then the everyone list
that comes later for each person in this
list in whites also suggests the best
channel treesome is an email
SMS invites now allows you to fully
customize the email so you can have a
rich HTML email in this case they are
showing a nice recipe and a call to
action that says they opened this this
particular item in the app the link used
inside this is a dynamic link so in the
app opens it knows why the user came in
here for so the app can show the context
can show the item they came in for and
take the user to the desired experience
and we already know from dynamic links
that delighting the user like this on
the first open has a very big impact on
retention so what does it take to
implement in whites on iOS the first
step is to basically create an invite
dialog object and then you set it up and
then you just call it so an Android is
equally straightforward you create an
intent builder you can intend for my
intent builder and then you activate it
so let's take a look at one app that is
using in whites to as part of a very
effective sharing floats this skyscanner
which is an app for business travel and
what they have done is they have
actually used firebase analytics to
identify the users who like their app so
in the app they ask them do you like
this happened they asked you to rate the
app from one to five right and people
who rated four or five other people love
the app so they they make an audience of
these people who like the air and they
then they target these people hey you
know since you like the app so much why
don't you invite your friends to also
try the app maybe they combine benefit
from it and that flow leads them through
the firebase in why it's flow what what
they have found from early results is
that the invite sent from this flow
result in about seventy to eighty
percent of the invite center on this
flow are resulting in actual app
installs so it's an amazing conversion
rate from this floor
to learn more about boats in whites and
dynamic links we have a dedicated
session at 11 today please join us there
so by now made his app has got high LTV
it's got great you know it has got great
retention she has organic channels for
