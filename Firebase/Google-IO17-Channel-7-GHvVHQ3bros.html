» All right, thanks is everyone
             everyone for coming
.  I know it's early, hopefully 
you all got copy      coffee 
sore      or something to wake 
up  .
I appreciate you coming out.  My
 name is Dan and I'm a project 
manager on fire base.
» Good morning, I'm Sam , on the
 teamager and lead engineering 
on the strashgs app            
Santa Tracker app.
» DAN SCHLOSSER:  Many of you 
may know every year Santa flies 
on a sleigh pulled by rain deer 
around the world.  A lot of work
 but he delivers over a billion 
presents in just over 24 hours, 
that's Google scale  .
As any kid would tell you it's 
actually a huge pain when you 
don't know when sant is
       Santa is going to come 
down your chimney, right?  You 
have to stay up, cookies and 
milk, the whole thing  .
Here we figured it's 2017, you 
shouldn't need to stay up all 
night wondering, so now, there's
 an app for that  .
Santa Tracker is a holiday 
tradition here at Google and 
kids can play games, track stant
       Santa as he flies around 
the world  .
We publish a web version and 
Droid       android ap.  We're 
going to talk about how we use 
fire base to modernize and make 
sure holidays went off without a
 hish      hitch  .
Fire base is the mobile ap 
platform.  But today we're going
 to be focusing on how we 
combine Google Analytics, Remote
 Config               crash 
reporting and Remote Config to 
be sure we can roll out the app 
to over a million users last 
December  .
.
» SAM STERN:                    

describe the nightmare scenario.
  Every queer       year Santa 
Tracker rolls out to a million 
new users and with a base that 
big there's a lot that can go 
wrong.  This is         This 
keeps us up at night, this is 
where   y we're proactive about 
using fire base in the app  .
A bunch of Google        elofs 
meet up in Mountain View, we 
have to address last year's 
feedback, fix crashes, any bugs,
 add new features, games and 
fresh coat of paint to team     
 keep the app feeling new  .
December 1 is the first big 
milestone when we ship the APK 
out to the Play Store, and we're
 biefting our           yte ing 
our nails, refreshing twitter, 
looking at news, we want to know
 if there's reaction good or bad
 to the new version  .
What if something goes wrong?  
Let's say it's December 18 and 
Dan is playing Penguin swim is 
one of his apps and gets the 
floul     sfrul       un
fortunately Santa Tracker has 
stopped.  Clearly something has 
gone wrong.  What can we do?   .
First of all, how do I even know
 that something has gone wrong 
in the app?  At this point it's 
because I'm refreshing more
    blor reviews and they are 
not                         
    Play Store reviews and they 
are not good.  People are I is a
        saying they hate it or 
it sucks, people are blaming 
they didn't good presence, but I
 don't think that's my fault.  
Yet these are all real reviews 
from this year  .
So we need to fix the bug.  We 
come into the office next 
morning and we're hunting for 
the app for the bug.  If we're 
lucky we fix it that day.  It's
      If it's complex it could 
take longer.  Then once we think
 we fixed, we make a new MPK and
 start the Q&amp;amp;A process all over.
  Then we ship out an update to 
the store 15 days after the 
first crash  .
If Santa Tracker was a web app 
we would be done, users would 
refresh and be    have the fix. 
 On android as many of you know,
 uptake can be a problem.  Users
 have to manually accept the new
 version.  So by the time our 
average user cease the working
                   sees the 
working version of the penguin 
game it's December 28 and for 
this app it's no good, we 
totally missed the holidays  .
As I said, updating uptake is a 
problem for any mobile app but 
particularly tough for Santa 
Tracker because this is our real
 user graph.  December 1 we 
release the app, twoun down     
     2000 downloads first day, 
eager users, but mitt      
middle of the month six figures,
 100,000 new users.  December 24
 when sant      Santa is a      
is flying, we have a million 
unique users in the app.  Next 
day when he has landed, interest
 dropped off and we're back down
 to the low six, maybe five 
figures again f  .
If our app update comes out 
December 28, we didn't really 
fix the problem at all.  Non    
 Nobody of           None of our
 users saw the fix.
» DAN SCHLOSSER:  Right.  We 
don't guard against errors like 
these we might ruin the holidays
  .
Let's jump in a time machine to 
December 21 and see if we can 
make better decisions  .
First things first, we need to 
know immediately if the app is 
crashing.  Clearly waiting for 
negative reviews and bad tweets 
is a terrible way of knowing 
there's a problem.  Then once 
you do just reading a bunch of 
screen shots of unfortunately 
strashth        Santa Tracker 
has stopped gives few hints 
where to begin debugging  .
So    
To solve the problem let's add a
 crash reporting solution.  We 
started budding Santa Tracker 
today       today we'd recommend
 using crash Analytics.  Bosch 
in December we used it for fire 
base and poor      importantly 
here it   , it's easy to use and
 that's why we used it  .
It provides the technical 
details and diagnosis details  .
Let's jump into the code.  Well,
 turns out there's actually no 
code to get started with krrg
    Remote Config.   
               crash reporting. 
 All we need to do is add single
 report        line reporting 
and crashes will be upletted 
automatically to fire base 
console in 20 minutes.  Again no
 code, just the one dependency 
 .
So let's head to the console and
 see what kind of reporting we 
get just from that single line 
dependency  .
All right, here's our crash 
reporting dashboard.  You can 
say a fair number of crashes and
 almost 2000 users impacted.  
That's no good.  We can see down
 at the bottom our number one 
crash is an index out of bounds 
exception in el    elf 
controller.Java and it's freight
el           fatal.  Normally 
this would be bad but I'm 
excited because at a glance I 
can see what krashs        
crashes are happening, which are
 impacting users the most and I 
know what to focus on  .
Let's drill into the number one 
error and we key     see a lot 
more detail.  We see what cough
       kind of days      devices
 ice happening on, individual

krashs        crash records     
    records or full Strak      
                 reports or full
 stack trays  .
It's easier to use.  We get all 
the reporting with a single line
 of code.
» SAM STERN:  This is pretty 
good, right? We're getting crash
 records, it's certainly better 
than Play Store reviews.  About 
you we're not really much closer
 to actually fixing the bug.  
Our app is still passing QA, we 
shouldn't have shipped yoth     
 otherwise, so we need to figure
 out what's going on  .
We know when the app is crashing
 with fire base but we need to 
know why the app is crashing, 
what specifically is happening 
to the real users and not 
happening to our tests  .
So wouldn't it be great if we 
could basically look over the 
user's shoulder and see every 
screen they enter, every button 
they press, basically all the 
steps leading up to the crash.  
Then we would have the best kind
 of bug report, which is full 
reproduction steps  .
So this is why we're going to 
use gl Analytics              
Google Analytics for buyer base
            fire base to 
understand behavior.  It's a 
free solution built smiks for
           specifically for 
mobile and integrates 
automatically with fire base 
crash reporting so we're going 
to understand in the crash 
report what the user is doing 
before thing       they 
experience the crash  .
So again this might look a 
little familiar.  To get started
 with nks   Analytics there's no
 code.  You add this one 
dependency and now you will get 
the default reporting.  What do 
I mean by that?   .
If you are an Android dropper 
this image                    
developer, you have seen this 
image on the left.  It's the 
activity life      life cycle.  
Fire base can hook into the 
activity life cycle to detect 
when a new activity is launched,
 when it stops.  You get 
automatic events like first app 
opened, screen view, session 
start, stop, all automatic.  You
 get a basic sense without 
wiring anything up at all  .
So let's head back to the fire 
base console with Mrs. Claus and
 take a look at what our crash 
reports look like now that we 
have added Analytics to our app.
  Remember we haven't written 
any custom code yet  .
So this is the same report as 
before.  This is our elf 
controller.Java crash that we're
 stuck on.  In the log section 
where   y     where we 
previously had fatal, one red 
bubble, we have two new efforts,
 both called screen view  .
We can see first one is user 
going to home screen and second 
one is user going to penguin 
swim game and they experienced 
the crash.  So this is pretty 
good.  About you we probably 
could have guessed as much from 
the reviews and crash reports.  
I mean we knew the penguin swim 
game was crashing and only way 
to get there is the home screen.
  From our situation this is not
 enough detail  .
Now finally we're going to have 
to write some code because we 
want to get a custom 
understanding of what's 
happening in our app.  So what 
we're going to do is log a 
custom event to fire bays      
base Analytics and this will 
help us understand a user's 
behavior  .
First we get an instance of the 
analytics by passing a context. 
 That is how we hooked in the 
activity life cycle before.  Now
 we're going to send an event 
name and map of parameters.  
These are custom efforts.  It 
can be anything you want.  The 
name of ourest is going to be ap
 game and the parameters will 
tell you what buttons the user 
pressed.  It's a bundle.  Weaver
 going to say the           
              We're going to say
 the button name is new game  .
Let's imagine that we have built
 our app with tons of custom 
events like this because 
Analytics is totally free and un
limited so really no reason not 
to.  We need to get more 
information about the crash.  
Now let's see what the crash 
reports look like enhanced with 
all this information  .
This is what we were looking for
, right?  This is the magical 
look over the user's shoulder 
and see exactly what they were 
doing.  We have the same two 
screen view events that we had 
before, about you we have a 
bunch more now.  We         

       bunch more.  We have 
quick sign in, game start, game 
finish, submit score.  Natural 
progression.  Then we have the 
crash.  I'm focusing on sign in.
  Twong       I don't think our 
tests were using a signed in 
device, so I bet that is why    
 where our crash is coming from.
» DAN SCHLOSSER:  What next?  We
 love to push out a fix and roll
 out update to our app, but that
 would take too long in our    
    and users will miss Santa if
 we go that route.  So what are 
our options for damage control? 
  .
Well, let's think about our app 
a little bit.  This year we're 
adding the penguin swim game and
 what we're worried about is 
what happens if penguin swim 
gets a bug or two or three  .
If penguin swim will super 
popular, it means that if it 
breaks, users might have a bad 
opinion of our app as a whole.  
But some games like memory match
            Memory Match have 
been in our code base for years.
  We know they are stable and 
that these games are super fun. 
 So if we have a problem in 
penguin swim            Penguin 
Swim, users should play memory 
match or some other game  .
What if we could box off the 
crashing game and hide it until 
it starts to behave better?  If 
users never play Peng      
penguin swim            Penguin 
Swim they wouldn't have anything
 bad to say because they have 
other games to play  .
By the way, even if your app is 
in a collection of games like 
Santa tracker, you can still 
dine?         design in a 
modular way so new features 
don't exhaust regression in the
                   cause 
regression in              
               cause regression 
in the code base.  Releases 
shouldn't case problems in the 
rest of the app  .
We are going to be able to stop 
crashes quickly, in is them and 
do whatever we can to put the 
app in a working state.  At 
Google we call this roll back 
first which is put the         
putting our app in the last 
known stable say it        state
 before we ever start trying to 
fix the bug  .
Now a lot of engineers have an 
instinct to fix forward instead 
of roll back.  This means as 
soon as there's a bug, go and 
try and fix and push that fix 
out to users.  But as many of 
you may know from bad 
experiences when you try and fix
 bugs on a short time scale, you
 end up with re    producing new
 bugs and the whole process 
repeats itself.  Right?   .
So to make changes in our app 
without pushing an app update we
 usefire base              use 
fire basically remote configure.
  We can change the behavior and
 appearance of the app on the 
fly from the fire base console 
 .
Not only will we be warned of 
errors when they happen with 
crash reporting and be able to 
diagnose why they happened with 
Analytics, we'll be able to fix 
them in just a matter of minutes
.  Let's dive into some code for
 remote    -Remote 
Config                  remote
    -Remote Config              
  Remote Config  .
This is the way we're going to 
fetch a parameter with fire base
 Remote Config.  It's pretty 
simple.  First we get the single
 ton instance of the configure 
object.  We'll call that config.
  Then we'll call fetch on the 
config object and passing in an 
expiration value.  This 
expiration value will tell us 
when to hit the cache and when 
to make a request to fire base 
 .
This makes sure that your users'
 device doesn't get hit with 
drained battery life or high 
network bills  .
When the request comes back 
successfully we activate the 
latest valves and the config 
object has all the new values in
 it.  For Strak    anta Tracker 
all we do is call GIT goalian 
within                Boolean 
and wool get an app we can use 
to hide or show penguin swim
            Penguin Swim when 
it's broken  .
So with just that amount of code
 let's head to the console.  
Hope you're not tired of this GI
 F.  
We'll turn off the ping win    
      penguin swim game with a 
flew      few clicks.  User     
 Users will have p   the updated
 version in a few minutes  .
We go to the remote configure 
section of the fire            
    ond           section and 
find the parameter and set it 
from true to false.  We click up
date and users will start 
getting this app update, or this
 modification, in just a few 
minutes.  A lot faster than 
eight days  .  
» SAM STERN:  So Dan has turned 
off penguin swrim       swim
            Penguin Swim and the
 app is back to healthy state 
because the crashing game has 
totally disappeared.  If you 
think about it, this is not 
really the best user experience 
that we could offer.  The reason
 it's not the best is because we
 have disabled the game for 
every single user.  V is getting
            Everybody getting 
enable swimming game is false.  
Only a small subset have the 
crash to begin request.  Now 
have                    with.  
Now we have taken the best game 
from everyone.  If every game 
has a small number of crashing 
users, we have to turn all the 
games off, with I would leave 
the app empty and that's not 
going to work  .
What away real      really need 
is to target these changes, to 
turn the game off for users who 
have experienced the crash or 
are likely to experience the 
crash in the future  .
When you target changes like 
this, you're going to get each 
user the most complete 
experience they can have based 
on their own conditions, which 
is really powerful  .
So let's think of a few ways you
 month it want to target this.  
Maybe we have no           
           you might want to 
start       target this.  You 
have might want to have a 6 po
   0-40 split to see if we're 
headed down the right path.  Or 
maybe we want to target by 
country, so if we think 
something           it's 
something to do with being in 
fans, we'll turn            
      France, we'll turn on the 
frin of users         
             French users and 
everybody else can keep playing 
 .
Or maybe something to do with 
language.  You might know German
 strings are long and it might 
be floor       overflowing the 
layout, turn it off for German 
users and on for everybody else 
 .
Or what if it's something to do 
with API level, let's turn off 
for jelly bean devices and on 
for everybody else  .
All of that is built into Remote
 Config by default.  Let's on   
 go back to console and see how 
that works  .
I'm going to create a simple 
condition to see     turn the 
game off for users in Antarctica
.  They already have penguins so
 probably don't need the game.  
Safe change.  I'm defining a new
 condition, I can give it any 
name and color I want.  That's 
for me.  In the apply section I 
say this applies if the device 
region or country is Antarctica 
and device region and country is
 automatically detected by fire 
base.  You don't have to do 
anything  .
Once I created the condition, I 
can add it to the parameter that
 Dan defined before.  This is 
enable swimming game, controls 
whether the users see the game 
or not.  If you match the is is
    an and the art ka condition,
 it's false and true for 
everybody else  .
Once I saved that, we can see 
our config is no longer a bunch
       list of static values.  
There are branching conditions. 
 You can add many conditions to 
a single parameter, a   and if 
users doesn't maech       match 
any they always fall back to 
default  .
We can target by country, but I 
don't think that's the problem 
with my game.  I have some ideas
 that are specific to the way I 
built the app that I think might
 be affecting it.  For one thing
, I know I didn't have great 
test covered on tablet devices 
with large screens.  Maybe I 
want to do it about I screen 
size.  Or maybe somebody 
released a new connected toaster
 on kick starter and it's crash
ing every time the user loads on
 that device  .
So    
Or what if it's sign-in state 
like I guessed before.  Maybe I 
want to turn the game on for 
signed out users and off for 
signed in users  .
Or maybe I just want to turn the
 game off for Dan because I 
don't like Dan.
» DAN SCHLOSSER:  Hey!.
» SAM STERN:  So now we're going
 to write some code because we 
need customization in how we are
 targeting.  What we're going to
 do is use user properties
 of glchl     clchl       Google
 Analytics  .
It's kind of like herds.  User
              headers.  User 
properties get attached to every
 event after you set them  .
I'll set the device forward, 
which would be galaxy X8 or 
pixel, device brand, Google or 
Sam sun un       sung, and goat 
user to check if the user is a 
goat.  That is a real call.  I 
did not make that up  .
Now that we have set a bunch of 
user properties in the app we're
       we go gak     back to the
 console and make changes to the
 configuration based on the 
custom properties we just made 
up.  Now we're going to be 
delivering values over the air 
based on properties set in our 
app without any servers or 
really and configuration at all 
 .
This is the screen where e   I 
define a new condition.  Last 
time I was doing is in and the 
ashth call            art call
                  Antarctica you
 a       about you now I'm going
 to                          but
 now I'm going to do on    is on
 pixel.  How am I going to match
 the users?  I want to know if 
the        if the device covered
 pickle, it will cover pixel and
 pixel XL and if the device 
brand matches Google exactly  .
Here you can see you can chain 
operations on strings and number
 of comparisons and create 
really advanced conditions 
without having to just fall back
 on the default that our     
fire base provides  .
Now that we have learned all 
this about config we know what 
to do when there's a problem in 
our app.  First thing we're 
going to do is roll back.    and
 box off the app.  What we're 
going                  We're 
going to do this only for users 
that have conditions that we 
think might cause the cran      
crash  .
So by disable ing penguin swim 
in this case, only for the users
 who have the crash, everybody 
else can still play.  We're 
giving the best experience to 
all our users by using Firebase 
 .
Now we have the reviews we 
wanted, all five 46 star.   
         had of   -star.        
    -star.  People are saying I 
love you, best game in the world
.  These I agree with.
» DAN SCHLOSSER:  So this is 
great.  Next release we can just
 relax.  Crash comes in, stay 
cam     calm and address in the 
fire base console.  We use fire 
base to make a crashing app 
stable but can we use it to make
 a good app great?  Of course we
 can.  We can use Remote Config 
and Analytics to fine tune and 
improve the app for users in 
between updates  .
Here's the work flow to think 
about the process  .
First we use gl Analytics for
                  Google 
Analytics for buyer       fire 
base and identify an area for 
improvement  .
Next we use Remote Config to 
make a change to improve the 
experience for the user.  Here 
is what I mean  .
To better understand the user 
behavior we use Analytics stream
 vee     view which gives a real
 time view of the efforts being 
logged from the user devices.  
It's a great way to get 
intuitive understanding of 
what's happening as opposed to 
running big query scripts.  You 
do it on the fly.  Then use 
Remote Config to sends the 
improvements  .
Before we get into krl it's 
important to know        
                         into 
Remote Config it's important to 
know it requires advanced 
planning.  You can't change 
anything about the app at any 
time.  We're not there yet.  But
 what you do is replace magic 
numbers with call to fire base 
Remote Config.  Every app has 
some amount of magic hard code 
skring is that                
string that makes the hard copy 
work.  Here we have ice cube 
density value we're setting at 0
.97 because that was the best 
value in testing, about you we 
don't actually know if that     

ice cube density is going to be 
the best thing in production.  
So we set to fire base re
  Remote Config call and change 
on the fly.  We can change over 
the air and not worry if we 
chose the right magic number 
back in testing  .
Let's look at our dashboard.  
Penguin swim running fine by 
half the users are dying before 
they score a point.  You can see
 zero up at 48 percent.  The 
game is harder than we thought 
and we need to do something 
about that  .
Well, just by adding the call to
 re  Remote Config we can lower 
the ice cube density parameter 
from the console.  We'll set to 
zero    0.8 for random subset of
 users and leave the default at 
1.0  .
We can change this value without
 spinning up a whole new APK, 
which is how we would have had 
to test the hypothesis without 
Remote Config.  If we're 
successful we should see score 
distribution smoothing out on 
stream screw       screw  . 
         view  .
This is great and the gam is 
crash free.  Let's see we get a 
ton of usage in U.S. and 
lackluster in Canada.  Let's 
delivery a custom experience, 
maybe change colors, red and 
white, a few maple leaves, maybe
 they will like that.  After 
defining a few key UI parameters
 with Remote Config in the app 
we can it rate on design in re
tile over the air with Remote 
Config                          
           time over the air.  
Hopefully Canadians will like it
 and if not we can roll it back 
 .
Back to dashboard.  We set 
ourselves up for success but 
something always goes wrong.  In
 this case we lost contact with 
the sleigh and we're getting a 
bunch of 500 errors.  We can do 
more with just fiddle how the 
app looks.  We can also use it 
to react to unexpected events 
like this  .
Whale Sam works on             

the 500 error I can use krl
   Remote Config to sends a 
friendsly error message to the 
users.  Santa is fuelling up the
 sleigh, be right back, is more 
easy to understand and more 
friendly than server error try 
again or something like I   
along those lines.  We count 
have hard coded that message 
into our app because we didn't 
know what was going to go wrong 
ahead of time 
 .
.
» SAM STERN:  We did it, right? 
 The users can play the game.  
We made the app better over time
 using fair      fire base  .
Let's compare to    where we are
 now to where we were in the 
nightmare scenario.  This is the
 same time line as before.  
Shipped on December 1, crash on 
December 18.  Now I   we 
identified the crash and fixed 
on the same day using fire base 
crash reporting, Google 
Analytics and fire base Remote 
Config.  Now when December 24 
comes arounds and Santa is ready
 to fly, users will have a 
smooth experience  .
If you have been following along
, and I hope you have, this 
should make you feel really 
powerful.  Fire base is your 
command centers.  You can sit 
behind the computer and have a 
min yort report                 
  a min yort     ority report 
interface.  You never have to 
use an update.  Best of all, 
everything we showed you can be 
set up in a few lines of code 
and all completely free  .
So if you don't believe me, 
Santa Tracker is entirely open 
source.  Go check out the code. 
 Maybe you want to get some cool
 views of penguins and that is 
fine but you can also see how to
 use fire base
.  Wb wb github          .   
   .
» DAN SCHLOSSER:  If you have 
questions for Sam or I, we will 
be outdoors in the left in the 
sandbox area as soon as we are 
done here.  Remember there are 
lots of fun fire base talks 
happening here on stage 7, live 
stream, today.  10:30 we have 
the fabric and fire base teams 
both on stage to talk about how 
we're bringing the begs of these
 platforms                   
      best of these platforms 
together, and at 1:30 pirate 
metrics  .
At 4:30 we dive into details on 
app performance, the new feature
 we just launched today  .
Thanks for joining.  Enjoy the 
rest of the day.

9 children         :30, drgs
    Android Things


                (9:30, Android 
Things.) 

.
» Good morning, everyone.  
Everyone excited?
» Come on, come on!.
» There we go, today we have 
some really cool stuff  .
I'm Wayne Piekarski and a 
dropper advocate      d voe    
             developer advocate.
» DAVE SMITH:  I'm also a 
developer advocate here at gl.
» WAYNE PIEKARSKI:  We're is 
going to be talking about how to
 Mike      make or I don't know
              own cows to me
            custom drgs
    Android Things.  It's 
possible you can create your own
 custom hardware designs and 
start from a simple pro     
prototype and take it into a 
full production device that you 
can then sell specially  .     
         commercially  .
Let's start talking about that 
 .
In the sandbox area you would
       may have seen this candle
 demo we have set up.  If you 
haven't been to the sandbox, 
definitely check that out  .
It's an example of a little LED 
candle Dave built.  So basically
 you have an android thing, it 
flickers the lights.  It's a 
candle, built a plastic housing,
 it'sically  .
Check that                      
cool  .
It's a project Dave started 
working on, something he built 
from scratch because he's a 
talented electronic engineer, 
and I pretend on a day-to-day 
basis  .
The thing I like about it, it's 
a really compelling example of 
how to make something really 
simple that fits within the 
development model of Android 
Things.  You can think of it as 
a world example of Android 
Things, a set-up that does 
something simple you can expand 
later on  .
Its turns out building something
 like this is reasonable y 
possible for a developer at home
 using a set of simple tools.  
You don't need a fact      
factory or anything crazy to 
build something like this.  
Everything we're showing you in 
this talk we're going to show 
you all the steps, and 
everything is open source.  So 
later on Dave will show the 
links of where you can find the 
information about how to get it.
  But everything is open source 
so you can modify, study, and we
 want to show you how this works
 a bit because hardware design 
is one of those things I have 
always found is krauf       kind
 of show rud     rouding        
      Shrouded in mystery  .
Developers think hardware is 
scary, and it's not a real 
problem, it's based on real 
things.  It's come dated to 
build              take it   
      plicated to build high 
speed electronics.  If you look 
a   at a modern mother board 
over      or circuit board, 
there's fine tracks.  You can 
see on the screen an example fl
   .  A loss      lot of dense 
packaging, empedance           
impedence requirements and noise
 considerations.  These are 
things you deal with when 
building a circuit that runs at 
high speed  .
If you're building a LED and 
battery, that's spell, not high 
speed.  But something fi    
vibrating at gigahertz or some 
frequency, you need to start 
thinking about these issues  .
One of the interesting things 
Dave pointed out, when you look 
at the bottom right underneath 
the semi conductor chip, there 
are phrases       traiss whichel
                traces wiggle
 ing around.  A smart tell gebt 
design                  
intelligent design person looked
 at that and said we need to 
match the speed of light in an 
electron on a wire, and they did
 that.  I didn't know if you had
 to do that, so if I made that 
it wouldn't have worked  .
This tuff    stuff is tricky but
 turns out the way we do Android
 Things we can solve those 
problems and make it easier for 
developers to play with.
» DAVE SMITH:  Thanks, wane
    Wayne.  One of the things 
that's a core philosophy when it
 comes to enable ing developers 
to help build hardware using 
Android Things is the idea of a
somesome         System-on 
Module.  We think of this as a 
deto developer success          
              key to developer 
success and let me walk you 
through and give you some 
examples  .
If you were to look at a typical
 developer kit you would buy for
 Android Things, it might look 
something like this.  And what 
you may or may not notice 
looking at this, this is 
actually two different boards 
stuck together.  So if I explode
 those out a little bit, what 
you can see is that we actually 
have this larger baseboard, what
 we often refer to as a carrier 
board, then the smaller module 
sitting on top, and that's what 
we refer to as asome     
System-on Module or commute 
model               commute mod
             compute module.  
That has all the connectivity 
and soldier hardware, everything

 build.  That's why     where 
the hardware lives, the high 
speed stuff, all the impedence 
requirements Wayne mentioned, 
all those things live on that 
little module.  The only piece 
you're responsible for as a 
developer building a new product
 is to essentially design your 
own version of the baseboard 
that applies whatever is 
specific to your application.  
Could       So you might just 
have a handful of little IO 
pieces, maybe connectors for 
power  .
The reason that the baseboard 
design with the developer kit is
 so large is because it has all 
the possible IO that could ever 
come off this chip expanded out 
so it's easy for you to work 
with, you can connect pieces 
where you need them.  But when 
you go into production with your
 design, you can make this much 
much smaller and much more 
compact based on just the 
elements that you need to apply 
for your specific application  .
One of the other really big 
things that people don't always 
think about when it comes to 
working withsome     SoMs is 
this idea if you're going to 
build an electronic product, 
something to sell so customers
        onsumers, you have to 
get the thing tested for safety,
 regulatory testinger  .  Things
 are            These are things
 if you DOP swor          
develop software you not 
necessarily have thought about. 
 This can cost money and waste 
your company a lot of time.  
Certification testing for FCC 
and UL, things like that, these 
can cost on the order of tense 
of thousands of                 
tens of               tens of 
thousands of clars or more.   
             dollars or more.  
One of the things SoMs solves, 
these are precertify ied 
components according to those 
standards.  They are FCC certify
 ied for the wireless interfaces
.  Power supplies and other 
things are safety tested ap    
for whatever is required in your
 specific country.  That drastic
ally reduces if not eliminate 
the requirements for testing on 
your final product.  So it's a 
huge cost safer       save to 
use these precertify ied 
components in your design  .
A couple other benefits of using
 asome     SoM.  At least with 
the symptoms       ochlz   
   SoMs we work with, are number
 a fairly interchangeable.  This
 reduces the amount of rework 
you might have to do in your 
design if you decide to move to 
a different platform or 
different vendor.  A couple 
examples of this  .
First of all some of our sochlz
    mz, the ed         s   
ymptoms and                  
some      some      SoMs, they 
are PIP     pin compatible, they
 will work exactly the same.  
You don't have to make changes 
to your base design.  If you 
decide you need to move from the
 ed sn to the NXP or back, you 
don't have to make any changes 
to your hardware to do that  .
In some other cases we also 
provide variance from different 
vendors so that you can solve 
supply chain issues if you run 
into them.  Another example is 
that Pico board uses the NXP-IMX
6 chip.  We have so thesome     
SoM that uses the same chip 
called the Argon.  You can 
target a specific platform but 
if you have supply chain modules
, you can use the other module 
in its place.  It helps you 
reduce the amount of rework you 
might have in your design based 
on having to deal with some of 
these vendors  based issues  .
In addition SoMs are highly 
available.  These are 
essentially commodity components
 that you can buy singly or a 
handful or large xant      
quantity for production.  You're
 essentially leveraging the 
economies of scale the vendors 
are participating in on your 
behalf.  Could       To give an 
example, if you grow direct
             go directly to a 
chip      chip vendor and buy 
the spoig       CPUs, the memory
, you would buy the components 
in very large quantities, 5,000,
 10,000 or more at a time, which
 is proribtively expensive   e
                 hibitively 
expensive for basic prototyping 
 .
With a SoM, the vendors who 
build the modules absorb the 
cost for you.  They buy 10,000 
of the chips and build and sell 
in such a way that you can buy 
one if you need it for your 
prototype, or a hundred or 
thousand or even more  .
Finally,some     SoMs are well 
supported both from Google's 
perspective but also with the 
individual en    vendors.  So 
all of the vendors that we work 
with have long-term support 
contracts in place so that the 
hardware that you choose to 
build your product on is 
guaranteed to be supported on 
into the future so you don't 
have is to worry about building 
something off a design that goes
 end of life next year  .
Let's talk a little bit about 
the tools and processes that you
 might actually go through to 
build one of these things  .
The first stage generally, and 
those who have played with 
Android Things may have done a 
bit of this already, but when 
you first decide to start using 
the platform and you want to 
start building something, you're
 probably going to purchase one 
of our supported developers kits
.  This is an example of one 
using the Intel Edison.  And 
from here you would generally 
use that developer kit baseboard
 to just start prototyping your 
idea, generate the proof of 
concept.  So you're going to 
start connecting in this case 
maybe some LEDs, inputs, display
, whatever you want to do to 
sort of test out if this thing 
is actually going to work  .
Then from there you can kind of 
carry it around, show it to the 
other folks that you work with, 
say okay, I think this idea 
might actually work.  Then you 
can move forward from that      
that process  .
There's a couple things you 
might be using to build these 
particular designs.  One is you 
might use a bread board, which 
is essentially just an solder
less component that allows you 
to specifically              
stick wires in and pretty #250i7
           ototype however works
.  Those board are not that port
able.  If you move often from 
here to here you lose a 
connection because the wire 
comes less      loose.  
Generally we typically would use
 a prototype that you want to 
show to someone else is 
something called a proto board. 
 That's what we have in the 
example here  .
If you want to get up close with
 this particular piece of 
hardware, it is in the sandbox 
along with the final product so 
you can look that the          
at that design up close and see 
how it's put together  .
Once you certify ied your idea 
is going to work, you're 
probably going to went to   
      want to build a custom 
design out of it.  This is 
really cool and fun to post on 
line and see     show your 
friends what you have done, but 
that's probably not something 
you can ship in high volume to 
consumers.  So you need to re
design into more of a custom, 
compact, integrated system  .
In order to do that you're going
 to be using a couple of new 
tools that you may or may not 
have ever worked with before, 
and there's two pieces of 
content or what we call hardware
 design files that you have to 
create to build this custom 
design.  First is called a 
schematic and a layout.  We're 
going to look at both so you get
 an idea of what's inside  .
A schematic for an electronic 
product is essentially just a 
definition of all the components
 you want to use and how they 
should be connected together.  
This example       inn this 
example                       
This example is the exact 
schematic for the candle sample 
you saw earlier.  You notice 
there's not really a whole lot 
there.  The reason for that, all
 of that complicated hardware 
that grows along with the CPU, 
memory, et cetera, is on the 
module.  So I don't have to add 
those pieces to my design.  All 
I have to design in are the 
pieces that are specific to my 
application.  So this design has
 connector for the USB, which we
 use for power, power supply to 
do voltage changing from input 
to output, the connector for the
 actual module, so we don't have
 to actually layout all of the 
pieces that are on that module, 
just a single connector where we
 stick it on to our board  .
Then the IO pieces, in this case
 the LEDs that we can blink that
 you saw in the image before  .
The schematic is responsible for
 defining all of the things you 
want to use and how each of 
those elements can     
interconnect.  And if you have 
never done this before, there 
are a number of tools that are 
really good to get started with 
this.  I have them listed here. 
 So EAGLE, there's who don't
           two products called 
circuit maker and studio, and 
key     KI CAD.  All these are 
approachable design tools that 
allow you to get started 
boulevarding scheme          
           building schematics. 
 One of the benefits, they are 
wp supported in the         
            well supported in 
the community.  You can find 
tutor ales.  All of these have 
library support on line.  This 
entire schematic was built in 
eagle and all of the parts came 
from open source libraries 
provided by spark.  So I didn't 
have to create any of those 
parts.  I just used libraries 
that already existed  .
When you use tools like eagle 
and Kicad, you will find good 
support for doing that.  
Actually another reason why 
these are good chuls to   
     tools to choose, and we'll 
get to that in a minute  .
So you built the schematic.  
This is what I want this 
electronic thing to do.  Now we 
have to actually design what the
     is it physically going to 
look like, and that's what the 
layout is for  .
The layout definition, basically
 you're drawing a picture, this 
is what I want the board to 
actually be.  Where do I want 
the components to be placed, how
 do I want those wire 
connections to be routed, and 
get everything laid out perfect
ly, any holes that we want to 
drill in the board so we can 
mount it to something easily, 
all of those pieces are defined 
by the layout  .
This layout is also defined in 
the same tool.  So when you use 
an electronic design tool
 like EAGLE, you design the 
schematic and layout.  When you 
make a change to the schematic, 
that can be reflected on the 
layout and vice versa  .
If you have never actually 
looked at one of those bay     
layouts before, it might look a 
little strange.  I put the 
physical board next to it so you
 can get an idea, okay, this is 
where this connector goes and 
these are the holes for the LED 
in the middle and all of that  .
As soon as            
Essentially once you have a 
schematic defined and a 
subsequent layout, this is now 
something that you could take to
 a vendor or manufacturer, and 
you can have that thing produced
  .
I want to talk about a couple of
 different definitions because 
there are two ways that you can 
go about actually building one 
of these.  First stage pretty 
much always required, you have 
to fabricate the board.  Here
      You hear someone talking 
about fabric indicating a PCB or
 the process, that's essentially
 building the actual base 
circuit board.  It's taking that
 layout, giving it to a vendor, 
having them actually etch out 
all of the pieces on the 
fiberglass and lay down the 
copper and all those things for 
you so that you have a basis to 
actually build your product  .
Then the assembly process is 
essentially just taking that 
bare board and installing the 
components on top of it.  
There's a couple of ways this 
can be done.  The reason we 
split these out is because you 
can generally probably don't 
want to try and fabricate your 
own PCBs  .
There are people who do it and 
tools that you can use, but 
that's a process best left to a 
vendor.  It's relatively in
expensive to do this even in low
 value  .
You might decide for cost 
reasons or time or whatever that
 it's easier for you to assemble
 the board yourself.  You might 
decide to simply buy the 
components and solder them by 
hand or using any other tools 
you might have available to you.
  But you can also have a vendor
 do this for you as well.  A 
little later on we'll look at 
some different options around 
where you might be able to get 
the PCBs fabricated versus 
having them completely fully 
assembled and delivered with all
 the pieces in place  .
I mentioned the schematic and 
layout before.  You could sort 
of thing of these design files 
as the source code for your 
hardware.  These are the pieces 
that you develop.  Then from 
there, those can be fed into a 
number of different tools to 
generate the content or the 
files necessary to actually have
 these pieces manufactured or 
created  .
There's a couple other terms I 
want you to be farm      
familiar with if you are toying 
around with hardware at all.  
First is Gerber.  Gerber file is
 generated file used by CNC 
manufacturers to actually build 
your board.  It's what takes 
your layout, turns it into a 
bunch of CNC instructions, then 
a machine goes around and puts 
drills down and etches all the 
pieces on the board and all 
that.  It's essentially the 
generated file that turns into 
your finished PCB  .
The bomb and X Y RS files are 
used in the assembly process.  B
OM stands for billable terms, 
it's essentially a list of all 
the components on your board and
 the part numbers of those 
boards so that you can purchase 
those and how many of them are 
on each particular design  .
The X   xyrs file basically is a
n automated file that tells the 
computer, in this case a machine
 called a pick and place machine
, how to take those components, 
pick them up and drop them on 
your board.  It's the exact 
location, rotation and all of 
that where the component needs 
to sit so that it can be 
assembled in the right location 
 .
Each of these files are 
necessary in some cases if you 
want to fully automate the 
production process of building 
the board  .   .  However, you 
could think of these files as 
sort of your com piled          
 compiled code or machine code. 
 One of the issues with the     
these files, however, there's 
not a lot of pure standards 
associated with each of these.  
There's different form mats for 
better better               
Gerber, a BOM could be something
 as simple as CSV or something 
more complicated.  Different 
vendors have different 
requirements about how you 
produce those files so they can 
import into their systems.  This
 turns out not being quite as 
simple as you might imagine  .
Generally speaking if you're 
just getting started with this 
or you want to do some very 
quick basic prototyping, I 
recommend finding vendors that 
allow you to ignore these files 
completely.  And there are a 
number of them out there.  I'm 
going to show you a few in a 
minute.  But there are a lot of 
great PCB and simply vendors 
that will accept your design 
files directly.  The way I'd 
like to think of it, if you're 
new or not very comfortable with
 this and you start going around
 the web looking at different 
places where you might be able 
to build a PCB, if they ask you 
for Gerber files, look somewhere
 else.  You will be able to find
 someone that can take your 
design files directly so you 
don't have to mess with export
ing those and making sure they 
are correct and all of that  .
You may get there eventually, 
and you might want to do that at
 some point, but at least 
getting started, that's 
something you can Igor    ignore
 completely.  There are a number
 of great haven't         
vendors, and I highlighted a 
couple, that can take these 
directly for you  .
The   On the fabrication side 
one of the United Nations with 
we         ones we        
                ones we used is 
ash park.  This is great because
 they accept your EAGLE files
 and Altium files directly.  
They are low cost in low value 
because they are what we equal a
 shared PCB vendor.  What that 
means, when you give them a 
board to make, that      they 
take your designs and designs 
from other customers submitted 
isn't and panel them all up 
together on one big piece to run
 through the machine.  So they 
reduce the cost for you because 
they are actually running your 
design along with others at the 
same time  .
That works really well for 
prototyping because it means you
 can get low quantities at low 
cost
.  It has some disadvantages in 
lead time because it 
skwenly         generally means 
you can't get things that 
quickly because they have to 
wait for other designs to come 
along they can panel up together
.  You generally can't get 
something next day or the day 
off that with ash part but it 
works well for making sure your 
board is actually correct before
 you go and have it fully 
assembled.  One of the common 
issues with hardware is when you
 build your design, you might 
have accidentally crossed a 
couple of wires.  Unfortunately,
 unlike with software we can't 
just delete and recompile that. 
 We have to actually scratch off
 the trays, jumper a wire or 
throw the boards away and make 
new ones  .
Until you are certain the 
schematic you made is correct, 
it's good to stick with very low
 cost vendors like this and hand
 assemble the prototypes until 
you know for sure what you 
designed has everything in the 
right place  .
On the assembly side, there are 
a number of vendors that also 
make this easy that we have 
worked in    with in the past.  
I are     have circuit hub and 
market fab listed here.  Circuit
 hub is like hub for hardware.  
They allow you to upload design 
files and you can share that 
design under an open source 
license.  Other people can fork 
that design, and you can even 
buy those designs directly from
 the website.  So they are an 
assembly vendor as well as a
 way for you to sort of share 
designs between folks in the 
community  .
You'll see actually a bit later 
circuit hub is where we have up
loaded this sample for you to be
 able to see the hardware design
 files and play around with it 
 .
Macro fab is another output 
vendor that basically also takes
 your design files.  One of the 
nice things about macro fab, 
they do more than just 
electronic assembly.  They will 
assemble your boards, and they 
are very good at doing that at 
low cost and low volume, but 
they will also assist you in 
package ing that into a 
mechanical housing or whatever 
your final package ing is, and 
also can often help you with 
inventor as well.  These 
actually can be a really great 
partner for start-up building 
hardware where they will help 
sort of manage all that process 
along the way in building your 
designs and maintaining them and
 actually getting them shipped 
out to real consumers  .
Now Wayne is going to talk about
 what happens when somebody does
 this for the first time.
» WAYNE PIEKARSKI:  And how not 
to burn your fingers, which I 
did multiple times 
 .
As Dave mentioned, to get your 
prototypes done you have two 
different steps.  You have the 
fab cakes      rication step and
 code      soldering components 
on to the board.  You plight 
have act                 might 
have access to a local company 
that can make the PCBs where you
 are.  The problem with some 
companies, they are far away, on
 the        other side of the 
country or around the world and 
you don't want to wait for ship
ping.  Sometimes you want to do 
iterative debugging.  When we 
make code on the computer, we 
make changes and it takes three 
changes.  With electronics 
there's the production iteration
 that you hak     make that 
could take days or weeks  .
What we wanted to do, rather 
than having the boards assembled
 by someone else, I wanted to 
see how hard it would be to sulg
 solder    d     actually    
           actually solder them 
myself.  I have some kind of 
electronics background, did 
electronic engineering many 
years ago, but have only solder
ed really large boards with 
through holy mounts             
hole ujts month.  You can    
               nlts month.  You 
can                       mounts
.  I have done stuff like that 
but enough        never surface 
mount.  I wanted to see what 
kind of mistakes I would make 
and talk to you about how we 
could       do it  .
The most challenge ing part is 
the SoM connector that 
connection the baseboard to 
thements      little SoM.  
That's the most challenge ing 
ank we will talk about   
                       e and we 
will talk about how we went 
about soldering them  .
The SoM connector is really 
small.  Those are images I shot 
through a microscope.  On the 
right you can see the microscope
 I used.  You can't work with 
this thing with your own eyes.  
If you hold thesome     SoM 
connector, it's a tiny thing you
 can barely see the pins, and 
you're like how am I ever going 
to solder this  .
I bought a cheap soldering 
microscope, about $200, and you 
put it up to your eye, put the 
board under, and see the detail 
on the board really easily  .
It's interesting because it's 
actually pretty surprisingly 
easy to work with.  You on    
would think your mandz and erg 
are too                       
hands are too large, but turns 
out when you're under the 
microscope looking through it, 
your body adjusted and I are    
         s and you are able to 
make fine motions without too 
many problems  .
I did find you have to anchor 
your hand, so you press one 
finger against the table.  
Understand the microscope I 
occasionally touch the soldering
 iron, obvious everything is so 
close and I didn't realize.  
Kind of fun.  A lot of people 
around wondering why I was 
screaming from the soldering 
station  .
Make sure you don't tring coffee
 before                     
drink coffee because that gives 
you the jitters, also a tip  .
So I have a basic soldering 
iron, the microscope, and with 
that we're going to try to start
 soldering one of these things 
 .
Problem with the regular solder
ing iron is that it's too large.
  So under a microscope, on the 
left you can see I have a ball 
point pen which shows how big a 
real pen looks like, the kind 
you write with.  You can see the
 pen is the size of like five of
 the put ins on the symptom 
connector.                      
SoM connector.  The tip of the 
soldering iron was a huge chisel
 chip designed for soldering new
   huge objects.  We needed 
something really fine, so you 
can buy a tiny Millie a   meter 
tip.  You can see that tip, 
point one millimeter wide, and 
still looks quite big compared 
to the pins there.  Turns out 
you can soldering    with this. 
 If you take the tip and pick 
yourself with it, it's really 
sharp.  Fels  els like a needle.
  This thing under a microscope 
has a huge round tip, incredible
  .
That's what it looks like.  You 
can see how small everything is 
relative to the soldering iron. 
 That's the challenge we're 
dealing with under the 
microscope  .
First thing you need to do when 
you're doing fine soldering like
 this, you need to make sure the
 solder sticks to the board 
cleanly.  We use what's called 
flux for that.  Most solder has 
flux built in.  Dogs      Doing 
fine connections you need, tra 
to make              extra to 
make sure it works  .
You can buy the pen and it fills
 up half the microscope.  It's 
huge.  You paste a bit of flux 
and put the SoM connector on top
.  You maneuver with tweezers or
 fingers, and you have to hold 
in place somehow so you can do 
the soldering operation  .
You basically bring the solder
ing iron up like you can see in 
the picture here, bring it up to
 the pin, then you bring the 
soldering against the pin at the
 same time.  What you don't want
 to do is touch the solder 
directly on to the soldering 
iron.  What happens is the 
solder melts and wicks up and 
doesn't go on to the board 
itself.  You need to make sure 
you touch the solder on to the 
pins and keep the tip away, and 
at the same time touch the wire 
to heat it up and make sure you 
solder correctly  .
So initially when I started I 
had problems getting everything 
to flow, then Dave talked to me 
and said you have to angle 
everything apart to avoid the 
touching.  The solder itself is 
point four Millie meters wide.  
If you look at a picture, it's 
quite wide.  It's possible to 
sneak it in there.  After doing 
a bunch of practice runs, I was 
actually able to make it work  .
This picture here shows a work 
in progress as I was working 
across the board.  You can see 
some of the pins on bottom right
 are not done and on the top are
 finished  .
This is a zoomed version of the 
same photo.  This is actually 
the first ever SoM I ever so 
thorred.  I'm           e       
      ever soldered.  I'm going 
to document.  I did a terrible 
job but this is my first ever 
attempt at soldering pins on a
some     SoM.  Dave was coaching
 over hangouts to tell me some 
hints  .
You can see that in the top left
 issue      -ish there are nice 
pins and bottom left some better
 ones  .
Occasionally you notice pins 
where I blobbed the so thor.  
Those are bad.  If you turn the 
board on with those shorted out 
like that, you probably blow it 
up.  You have to make sure if 
you bridge the so thor across 
the pin                 e     
       solder across the pins, 
there's a solder praise that
           bra is that sucks 
                  brace that 
sucks it out and you can use 
that if you need it  .
Rough getting started but after 
a while I did some jobs that 
looked kwies       quite nice.  
You probably shouldn't do this 
on your very first board, but 
after one or two you will be 
better at it.  It's actually 
something you can do  .
There's actually a lot of mess 
around there.  It's not the 
solder, actually residue from 
the flux, 24    this shiny 
material that's what makes 
everything look kind of dirty.  
You can clean it a bit but we 
were trying to find Q tips and 
things but everything is so fine
, you can't get everything in 
there to clean it right.  We 
sort of cleaned it but the mess 
left over is the basic residue 
from the flux  .
While this is time consumingen 
might take              and 
might take a few hours, it's 
nice because you can reduce 
debugging time.  You have the 
ability to take the border    
ards, solder yourself, do some 
testing, and if you find 
mistakes use the     that 
ability to make patches.  In the
 same way we patch source code, 
you can patch hardware.  It's 
not fun but it's possible.  If 
it saves a week that's something
 you can do as well  .
I have seen plenty of boards 
where you see a wire running 
across, and why is that there?  
Well, the designer forgot to put
 something in like magic pad.  
It's the equivalent of writing 
code and leaving one semi color 
out except                 colon
 out except that's the one that 
powers of the circuit  .
You don't have a compiler that's
 going to run your circuit to 
tell you if it's going to work, 
so you really have to be careful
.  You have to really think 
about that  .
Here is a microscope shot of one
 of the boards that Dave had 
professionally fabricated.  You 
can see there that everything is
 super clean, like you can tell 
that a machine has gone and laid
 these soldering   s down 
perfectly.  The way these 
machines work, you put a solder 
paste on the board, put the SoM 
connector on top and put it 
through a reflow oven that melts
 the solder and attaches the 
components  .
You went      end up with a 
really clean joint.  When you 
buy professionally made 
electronics, it tends to look 
like that.  My soldering John, 
obviously you               
      job, obviously you won't 
put that on the space shuttle 
and fly, but in this case it's a
 reliable circuit where 
everything is nicely sodrd, so
       ldered, so not done by a 
new by like me  .
You pair it up, the lights start
 blinking.  We have the demo in 
the sandbox.  You stand back and
 bask in the warming glow of the
 interpreter.  It uses the 
bounce interpolator to make the 
LEDs flicker and you hold your 
hands in front and get that warm
 cozy feeling  .
On the software side we could
       do it with the LEDs but 
like a whole new world.  Uses 
something basic, basic 
components like a few LEDs and 
resistors and now you're on fact
 to building whatever 
electronics you want to build.  
You can take this once you're 
familiar with it and you can 
expand on it from there to do 
some      something more come 
indicated for your          
                    more 
complicated for your needs  .
Once you do that, think about 
next steps for commercial 
production.  Before you can sell
 a device, you have to think 
about how am I going to package 
and enclose this.  You might 
need to find an industrial 
designer to make a plastic 
housing for you.  You can use a 
CNC printing machine to make 
something but those housing 
don't tend to be very strong.  
You probably will need something
 professional made for that  .
When you ship the device to your
 customers you need to package 
it so you have to come up with a
 cardboard box for it, maybe 
some documentation.  It needs 
padding inside to protect the 
product dur shipment         ing
 ship, make legal documentation.
  It's not something you can 
knock up on the laser printer.  
It has to look notice.  There 
are industrial design companies 
that help with these final steps
  .
Finally little things like if 
you need a power supply or cable
 for your device, you might have
 to include a U SB charger or 
something like that.  While they
 are cheap, they are not free.  
They cost a couple        couple
 dollars and that adds to the 
overall cost of the device 
you're selling  .
Finally evercountry has 
different rules about what 
devices they allow, 
certifications, safety 
requirements and so forth.  So 
for every country you ship to, 
you have to investigate and find
 out who those processes are.  
So the SoM has had a lot of fes
     testing and certification, 
but the overall packaging and 
device needs so toe also be 
checked  .
All of these things I outlined 
do cost some money and it's 
important you think about these 
things before you get started on
 your next big crazy start-up 
idea and think about what the 
costs are going to be.  Remember
 that if you have a fixed cost 
like $10,000 for design or 
certification, you need to sell 
enough units to bury that cost 
in each one.  If you sell 10,000
 of something, that adds dollar 
to the price.  If you make ten, 
it adds $1,000 dollars to the 
price of the unit.  You need to 
think about those issues  .
One final point, the nice thing 
about Anne  droid Things is we 
have helped to simplify the 
software side of things as well.
  So building an IoT device, it 
might seem easy and you can 
build your operate ing system 
and put it on there, it comes at
 a price to il    maintain and 
security updates and so forth.  
One of the nice things about 
Android Things is you have the 
power
 of Android.  You can hire phone
 developers and get them to 
write code for your device and 
they using the same libraries 
they are 23578       familiar 
with.  You don't need to hire 
someone who is microcontrol
       controller with assembly 
language.  There's more 
programmers available  .
Also the SoMs, we provide up
dates from Google, security up
dates, we push the updates out 
to the devices so that you don't
 need to worry about maintaining
 that will stuff yourself  .
Final you get all the power
 of the Android security.  We 
have a huge team whose job is to
 scour the internet looking for 
security problems and to patch 
libraries.  We take care of that
  .
If you would make the device and
 do all the software, you would 
have to have huge team of 
security people and everything 
to make sure that's taken care 
of.  With Android Things we have
 really done a lot to help 
simplify the software side of 
things as well so that you can 
focus on what makes your product
 good and not have to worry 
about all the little details of 
trying to secure a device and 
pushing updates and things like 
that  .    that.
» DAVE SMITH:  The moral of the 
story, if Wayne can do it, you 
probably can too  .
If you're interested in learning
 more about the various hardware
 platforms that Android Things 
does support, and as we add 
support for more that will be 
listed here as well, you can 
check out the hardware support 
documentation on the website  .
The candle sample you see in the
 sandbox as we mention is open 
source, so the source code and 
the hardware design files 
themselves are on github and the
 design has been youp uploaded 
to circuit up    hub where you 
can purchase directly if you 
don't want to mess with this 
whole process.  Look at those 
links as well.  Also join our I
OT  oT developer community so 
you can connect with us.  Wayne 
and I are both there answering 
questions.  Give us an idea of 
what cool stuff you are doing so
 we can share it with the rest 
of the community  .
We have a few minutes for 
questions.  If anybody has any 
questions, feel free to hop up 
to the mics and let's see what 
we have.
» WAYNE PIEKARSKI:  Thank you.
» DAVE SMITH:  Thank you  .
Plus plus           
(Applause) 
 .
.
» What is your sandbox?  Where 
is the ban box.
» Straight out to the left, 
first dome that says ifrment ot 
on the                   Iot on 
the front.
» Hi, as far as solder, is there
, I feel like I've gotten some 
solder off Amazon to work with 
and it sucks.  Is it just me or 
is there a better solder to 
purchase and use?
» Probably yes.  If you buy 
regular solder from a hobby shop
 or something it's going to be 
really big and you have to have 
the right kind of flux in it.  
Soldering iron has to be the 
right temperature as well.  
There's a lot of different 
factors  .
So buying the right solder is 
critical.  If it doesn't have 
flux, that can be a problem.  So
 if you just grab some random 
solder, that's definitely part 
of what can be the problem.
» I have to look to see what it 
has like a percentage of flux in
 the solder?
» DAVE SMITH:  Yeah, as long as 
it's more than about ten percent
 Rossen per flux, that should 
help on those finer pieces.
» WAYNE PIEKARSKI:  Come as see 
us afterwards and we can chat 
about it.
» I have an Edison and want to 
put Android on it or Things on 
it.  What's the process?
» DAVE SMITH:  I would go to 
roughly the same spot on the 
developer site, Android/things. 
 There's a page for the Intel 
Edison that gives you a link to 
where to download the image on 
you        and how to actually 
flash that on to your board.
» Thank you, I really enjoyed 
the lecture.  Second of all I'd 
like to ask about the same      
time frames.  If you are a small
 start-up and you want to get 
into this, how long until you 
can like get one prototype 
through the whole production 
line?  If you want to display 
something at a client, is it 
like three months, a year?
» DAVE SMITH:  Sure, from an 
assembly perspective, usually 
standard lead time from an 
assembly vendor is two to three-
week time frame.  You submit 
your design and they can build 
you one or ten or a hundred or 
whatever you need to    to   .  
To get that back and you     
then you do final packaging or 
whatever  .
Vun     
One of the most variable delays 
in building a new product is 
safety testing.  Unfortunately 
that's a really hard one to pin 
down because depends a lot on 
what other components you use.  
That defines what tests you are 
have          have to run and 
things like that  .
In my experience basic safety 
testing could run you three to 
five months.  That's just if you
 go beyond that to where you're 
using all the components 
yourself and certifying a 
scratch design, that can be a 
year or more.  Generally three 
to five months is standard for a
 testing lab to actually get you
 queued up, go through the 
process.  The actual test 
probably only takes three weeks 
but they wake      make you wait
 a nice long time.
» WAYNE PIEKARSKI:  I'm sure 
it's how much money you pay.
» DAVE SMITH:  Possible.  I 
wouldn't know about that.
» Something you do serial or 
parallel?  Would you start 
everything at the same time?  
Sending it to be certify ied?
» DAVE SMITH:  Absolutely.  Once
 you start       sort of vary 
fiefd            verified that's
 the design you want, they don't
 need a physical object right 
away.  One of the first things 
in safety testing is looking at 
your schematics or other designs
 and they will ask you for 
information about all the parts 
you used because they need to 
verify those things to determine
 what the     to test and all 
that.  This is where you can 
essentially just provide them 
the precertify ied ser     
certificate for the SoM and say 
this is already good and going 
along with everything else  .
There's a lot of documentation 
up front maybe while you are 
finishing assemble ing 
prototypes and things like that 
that you can do in parallel.

 time.  We'll be going up to the
 IoT sandbox.  Thanks for coming
 and we'll see you later.

clawed function, it's      
                 clawed function
                       about 
cloud function, ice a big      
     ice     it's a big success.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Awesome.  Let's talk
 about collaboration.  How are 
the teams measure ing   e     sh
ing since joining Google?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think the teams sitting 
together was a good start.  That
 was a big one  .
We did a lot of collaboration 
around the digit to the phone 
authentication.  We announced 
that yesterday and people are 
already using the automated work
 flow to
 link their accounts to Firebase
 and do a seem      seamless 
migration am it's important to 
us because              
                  .  It's 
important to us.  It's the kind 
of tear      care we have been 
taking hen     to make the     
these things seamless.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think there's been a 
tremendous amount of 
collaboration even in things 
that aren't visible.  Many of 
the fabric folks helped with the
 cloud functions launch and 
helped with the lows ing stuff 
and             s      hosting 
stuff and vice versa.  Bringing 
in a new sets of eyes to help us
 polish products has been 
helpful.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Awesome, last   et's talk 
about some of the rough edges.  
There's always a few.  Let's 
name them and talk through  .
What are some of the rough edges
, say the highlights that you 
are?   , Rich?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure, I'm customer guided.  
We talk to a lot of customers 
including ones that use Firebase
 and fabric today.  They are 
leading the way in terms of how 
we are thinking about the 
integration.  They say listen, I
 already know, I have signed up 
for fabric and Firebase, I use 
the best of both in order to 
build my app, understands my 
customers, and grow my
 business.  They might have to 
do one activity in Firebase and 
then I have to open up fabric 
and understand the stability of 
app, retention of customers and 
et cetera.  I think we can do 
better and bring a unified 
dashboard experience.  That's a 
rough edge I'm excited about 
smoothing out.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Awesome.  Next question is 
for everybody  .
Let's talk about what's next.  A
 lot that woo     we can't talk 
about sfachs      as far as 
future features, but what the it
        is it that we're excited
 about and can share.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I can start.  I keep talking 
about cloud functions but it's 
very cool.  It lets you respond 
to efforts with code          
            to it event         
 events with code and things 
that would have required a 
back-end service, with a few 
lines of code you can get up and
 running in a few minutes  .
We have a few event sources, you
 can get from hosten  ing and 
database.  16 products 234 fire
    inn fires base           
         in Firebase and notice 
in Google that don't omit events
.  It's excited to work on that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Awesome, Rich.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm going to build on that, 
such a great answer.  That was 
one of the things we were most 
excited about coming into Google
 was cloud functions and the 
eminent launch when I   it did 
go out.  We have a lot of 
customer data locked up in 
answers.  Wouldn't it be great 
if we could that some of those 
events and link them up to cloud
 functions.  No problem, right,
 ?   , in terms of when you 
might see something like that, 
something that we were talking 
about internally.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I would actually on the data 
side, to me that's one
 of the lafrnlg         largest 
tuts      opportunities both 
from answers or    and
 Firebase or Google Analytics 
for Firebase, we have a huge of
    amount of data for 
developers and making that easy 
to use for big query.  We're 
going to give you useful 
information and charts good for 
everybody, but if you want to 
look at users' data or usage 
data and such to understand what
 are the users doing, put 
together predictive 
methodologies using   e    
            omds use           
models using machine learning, 
that's a valuable source of 
information for you to mine and 
work with in a bunch of 
different weighs  .
We actually                
        ways  .
We think that's something as a 
company we're good at and can 
provide a whole set of tools 
around that.  I would say 
whether it's feeding the events 
to do functions or giving you 
the tools to analyze data in 
lots of interesting ways or do 
machine learning on it, I think 
those will be exciting areas for
 us.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Awesome, okay.  Now it's time
 for specific developer 
questions that we have been 
getting on social and from the 
audience.  I'll have you guys 
get into the mic in a few minus,
        meant, but I'll         
     inutes, but I'll ask for 
some of these first  .
A question for you two guys.  
Did you all know each other 
before joining Google?  It feels
 like there would be some 
professional camaraderie there.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We actually had never met.  I
 had met the profilers but never
 met Rich.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm based in Boston so I 
don't get out here too terrible 
an A.      n amount.  First time
 was in Cambridge when you came 
out after the acquisition  .
We do have something in common, 
though.  When we were crash liyt
ic before it was acquired, we 
had a co- investor.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's how I met Jeff and 
Wayne.  I understand that you 
guys got a C trip out of the 
deal and we didn't.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's right.  Yeah.  Depends
 who is on your befrd       
board.  Now make      that we're
 together we can get a ski trip.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If Jason approves.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; West Coast skiing, yes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, all right.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now that the teams are 
together, are you guys starting 
to share culture from the two 
companies?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You know, now might be a good
 time.  I brought you a present.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Awesome.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Every year on June 27 is an 
important holiday in Firebase 
land and sincere         it is 
bring your pine apple to work 
day.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I wanted to help you be 
prepared this year.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Goodness.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's for you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you so much.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; (Applause).
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Your very own pipe      
pineapple.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What is the owner       
origin of that day?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; One day I want        I 
brought a pine apple to work.  
And JF said, what's up?  I said 
it's bring your pine apple to 
work day.  They      He says 
that's not a thing, a roll      
holiday.  I put     said yes, it
 is.  I put it on the calendar 
and forgot.  Next year we hired 
pres      employees and next 
year the employees brought pine 
apples.  I said what's up and 
they said well, it's on the 
calendar.  Now it's a thing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I heard you might be giving a
 gift, so I have something for 
you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Ooh.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Some little -- 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Very nice, very nice.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have to see this.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You can put it on?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Taking a photo,
 good.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;       .
You look great.  Excellent.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Perfect, yes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Fashion evolution right 
before your eyes.  Okay, let's 
get to some of these questions 
 .
First after, what will happen to
 answers?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Wow, what will happen to 
answers.  Great question  .
Answers, if you don't know, is 
the underpinning of what makes 
fabric fabric in terms of the 
real time understanding of how 
your app is doing, how     
powers everything from MAU and D
AU on the Fabric dashboard to 
things like velocity alerts and 
crash nks  .
It's an important part and 
something we hear from customers
 they love and value.  It's 
important for us to take that 
experience forward into a 
unified Fabric and            
fire bears and Fabric 
experience.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Cool.  I'm going to ask a few
 more questions and like to 
invite you all to start lining 
up to the microphones so you can
 ask your questions as well.  
They are very nice and ib    
informative with their answers 
 .
What about digits in China?  
What      Will it work?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Got it.  Let's see.  Digits 
is a phone number authentication
 product that we announced 
yesterday.  It's going to common
        become Firebase phone 
authentication.  We're moving 
back-end infrastructure from 
twitter where it is today to 
Google.  We expect this to be 
really good for customers.  
However, if you didn't know how 
SMS authentication works, you 
have to do deals with SMS 
providers, carrier by carrier, 
country by country.  As a result
, digits has worked up to this 
point.  Sort of not 
intentionally in China.  And 
going forward most likely it 
will not work, again sort of 
through circumstances not 
entirely in our control.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Talking about China, I want 
to know      note that we do 
have a lot of customers that 
have a lot of end users in China
.  And we have heard from you 
that it's      it's rel     
really important, hey, I need to
 understand how my app is 
performing in China.  Message 
received, we're working really 
hard to make sure that aspect of
 Fabric and Google Analytics for
 Firebase doesn't go hey   away.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Very good.  Audience 
questions, starting here.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hello, Michael.  Question to 
Andrew.  How do you feel about 
the mystery ious
 Firebase usage analytics.  
There's an article from home 
automation yesterday and we 
experience as well in our 
product, basically usage spikes 
in mice      tis the         
mysterious base      bay and we 
saw a                          
iss tear way   yougs way and we 
saw on one-to-one ways      
basis.  There's no origin and we
 had the problem a year ago.  
Apparently other companies as 
well.  Is there work in progress
 on that?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'll repeat the question here
.  I understand you're asking 
about the wlog post           
blog posted   published 
yesterday where there was a 
developer had   who had a much 
lower bill and a spike in the 
usage of the price of the bill. 
 I can speak to that  .
For some context, this customer 
had a number of Iot devices that
 were pulling the Firebase 
database.  We made a couple of 
changes that changed their bill.
  One of the changes that we 
made was we actually started 
enforcing quotas on our flame 
plan.  We have a fixed price $  
 $25 a month plan which up until
 recently actually gave you un
limited levels of usage.  Even 
though we listed certain amounts
 because we built     hadn't 
built the quota enforcement 
infrastructure.  We started 
applying those quotas and 
applying to people exceeding the
 limits to our page  .
That was one of the reasons  .
The other thing that happened at
 the same time is that  ere was 
a bug we introduced late last 
year that had miscounted the 
network usage for the database. 
 People that were doing very 
heavy SSL negotiation traffic 
but otherwise using small data 
usage could see large uses in 
the data usage.  The vast array 
of customers felt few changes 
but a few cases, the vast 
majority of the traffic was the 
handshake because they were 
pulling and usually no data do 
return, so the SSL handshake 
over and over again that was 
ringing up a lot of data usage 
 .
Week work           
We're working with the developer
 collect         directly.  If 
you look at the blog post they 
updated with some of that 
information.  If you're having 
similar things, I'm happy to 
talk with you outside afterwards
.  Generally I encourage folks 
seeing things like that      
this, we should talk it
 through.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A quick follow-up?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The status page would be very
 nice for you to have maybe?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I didn't hear that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Asking about the status page?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have a status page.  It 
should be linked on the site.  
If it's not, we'll check on that
.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you go to fire base.Google
.com and click on sub     
support.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Next question, can we boost 
the mics or monitor?  It's hard 
to hear them up here.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi.  You said you were point
       planning to merge the 
interfaces for Fabric and 
Firebase.  I was wondering maybe
 a way now that I'm not aware of
, but in the future if there's a
 way to merge the next of 
Firebase with the analytics.  I 
can see nor     for my users 
with two items in the cart, 
there's a specific crash a   in 
a more unified dashboard.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The question was about seeing
 crash analytics and analytics 
together.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You're talking about an 
audience that you can build in 
Google Analytics or Firebase and
 understand the stability.  
Absolutely, that's something 
we're excited about the 
possibility for that integration
 to happen.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Any type frame            
time frame?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We're working on that.  I 
think we're not going out with 
time frames right now, not 
because we're not working hard 
at it but we want to be 
thoughtful about how we bring 
these things together  .
People use both Firebase and 
Fabric to run their whole 
business so we want to be could 
go sglans                 could 
gony sglans          
     gnizant of that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you.  Back over here.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; High      Hi guys, loud 
enough?  Awesome  .
Fab     
Fabric has the suite of kits 
which is pretty comprehensive.  
Just wondering what is the 
future of
 kits in Google and are there 
still gib to go other      
                 still going to 
be other partners organizations 
providing kits and anything you 
can say about that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Great question.  We launched 
third-party kits      kit 
support directly integration the
 into Fabric about a year and a 
half ago and really        
really competed        exceeded 
our expectations.  I think 
coming in, I think there's a 
desire to do some kind of 
integration here but it's really
 early.  So I would edge      
encourage you, nothing about 
those integrations are changing 
today for Fabric and we're 
looking for ways to bring it 
forward.  But I don't have a 
comprehensive strategy to share 
with you today  .
Tupt      
If you want to talk more about 
that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; One of the things we like 
about the kit model is the idea 
we can have best of breed 
solutions for different parts 
that maybe we might not spend as
 much time on.  Certainly things
 like cloud function, we would 
imagine there's other areas 
where we might be able to allow 
third parties to provide plug 
and play solutions right into 
the system.  But we do
 want to merge it in thought 
fully.  I think some of the kits
 are more co-marketing things, 
saying hey, we're going to let 
everyone be aware of other 
products.  I think we would 
probably be more thoughtful 
around what are the areas where 
we could actually provide 
developers with something they 
wouldn't be able to otherwise 
have during integration.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you.  And over who are.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;              here.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hey, wondering if you guys 
are going to plan on merging 
Fabric data and alpha data 
#3r578s for           plasm for
        rograms to   
 for Google Play.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's something we're 
looking at.  We feel like we 
have two great solutions.  If 
you look at the amount of 
investment the May     play    
Play team has been doing, I 
think it makes sense to say the 
things should align and work 
together.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Beta was the second product 
we shimmed after          pped 
after crash Analytics.  We have 
seen a ton of investment on play
 and apple.  When we talk to 
beta customers they have changed
 on you        how they use it. 
 They are using more for 
internal customers.  People over
 in the sandbox now that work on
 this product.  I encourage you 
to give them your feedback on 
how you would like to see it 
evolve to sort of the        of 
being more hormone         
harmonized.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, we use internally, the 
ala pha Google May for external
                Play for 
external.  I want to graduate 
that smoothly out to people.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Highly aligned.  Absolutely. 
 Awesome.  Over here.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I was wondering now Fabric 
and crash Analytics are joining,
 is there any plans for merging 
crash analytics and Firebase 
crash reporting?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Great question.  We announced
 yesterday, right, that crash 
analytics is now the recommended
 crash reporter for Firebase and
 Fabric.  So if you're looking 
to decide which reporting   er 
to use, you should be using 
crash analytics  .
We talked about rough edges.  
That does require you to use two
 consoles today.  Our goal is to
 make that a simple unified 
experience.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, and is there any guides
 for migration?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I believe so, but come up and
 talk to me afterwards or go to 
the sandbox and we can walk you 
through it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you're an existing 
Firebase crab record        
reporting user and you're happy,
 sit tight.  We'll be providing 
materials to help you move over 
when the time is right.  For now
 there's nothing you need to do.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi, I actually have two 
questions.  So first question, 
you guys talked a lot about 
merging the dashboards of the 
two platforms together, which is
 great.  I have difficulty using
 the cloud platform dashboard 
and the Firebase dashboard and 
crash analytics dash board.  I 
was wondering in terms of design
, they are totally different.  
Like Fabric likes visually 
different from Firebase.  What 
are you guys thinking about how 
you're designing that for 
consistency so that customers 
can from both platforms from
      feel commercial with it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;                         
comfortable with it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You might imagine this is a 
very active discussion 
internally.  We had a design 
sprint bringing the designers 
from both teams together in New 
York City last week and it was 
very productive.  I was pretty 
inspired by the results.  It's 
way too early to share, but I do
 think a lot of the visual 
elements here are going to 
converge in a way that feels 
right for both Firebase and 
Fabric customers.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; As far as a very clear sort 
of merged experience, I think it
 will be both understanding   
able and bring the both elements
 of each.  I think as far as 
integration with the overall 
Google cloud dashboards, we are 
looking very solidly at where 
are the most common touch points
 between them that would make 
them as smooth and 
straightforward as possible.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And my second question,  is 
related to having big query 
support.  Do you have any idea 
around the time line?  I would 
love to be able to use big query
         Big Query to query some
 of the crash notice stuff.  A 
lot of the                     
        analytics stuff.  A lot 
of information we're getting is 
predefined and preset.  Having 
the gran      granularity to be 
able to control that do the     
   data would be awesome.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I didn't.  You're not alone

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, you're not a loan.  
Lots of                loan.  
Lots of people would like that. 
 The feel      team is committed
.  With full               
        excited about that.  
With full candor, we're looking 
at providing a continuity of 
service for the whole product 
and how many engineering 
research goes to that and how 
much goes to integration with 
Firebase console and how much 
into cool features bike      
like big query  .
It's a balance.  We have a 
portfolio approach.  I don't 
think anything to share about 
when 20    to expect but it's 
satisfying            something 
the team is excited about.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's one of the things we're 
looking at to where we can 
provide value.  You're 
generating data with our tools 
with your users and application,
 and how can we let you do great
 things with it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Great, thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Awesome.  I'm     I'm going 
to slip in a couple of questions
 here.  One I have been hearing 
a lot, will fast lane
         Fast Lane continue to 
be open source.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Great question.  Absolutely 
yes.  Fast lane    Lane was open
 source when we brought it into 
Fabric a year and a half ago.  
We have only grown the open 
source contribution.  We have 
contributors to fast lane that 
work here at Google and a 
significant community of 
contributors who work outside 
Google, so eve     definitecally
     ly committed to maintaining
 the open source aspect.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I want to add, Fabric        
Firebase in general is committed
 to open surs is         source 
as well.  This is an incremental
 thing.  It will to    take time
 to get everything out in the 
open.  We're moving to a 
direction of more open, not more
 closed.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's great.  Not too far 
distant is is this question.  
Will Fabric continue to support 
IOS?  Sgr     
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, absolutely.  We have a 
strong and loyal tribe of 
developers that love us on IOS 
and Android and we're going to 
continue to support them.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It is really, one of the 
things that was important to us 
when we were looking at Fabric 
was saying Firebase has been 
from the start cross platform, 
and it's really important to us 
that folks recognize that, and 
seeing the amount of positive 
fees dback and attention from IO
S developers for fabric        
Fabric is one of the great 
things about it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Back to questions over here.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Do we expect root      them 
to acquire root base services 
one day?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Great question.  No plans at 
the moment.  I don't know.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, we're definitely 
looking at what the best way to 
get the STKs working as broadly 
in the ecosystem as possible.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You announced all these nice 
tools yesterday for Firebase.  
Is there a plan to integrate 
crash data with those
 refining tools, providing some 
traces?  Not just stack trays 
      trace but memory state and
 network state when a user crash
       crashes.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You want to take this?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is definitely something 
we're looking at.  I don't think
 we have any particular plans 
we're prepared to share.  One of
 the big value propositions of 
Firebase is supposed to be the 
products work well with each 
other.  So when you you a    
       you you a thint indicate 
you get                       
       authenticate you get 
access to resource, you can 
bring things to big query, et 
cetera.  I think this is an 
obviously integration for not 
only crash analytics but a bunch
 of products we'd like to know 
how is your data business 
perform willing                
         base performing.  We're
 definitely looking at that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I would say one of the great 
things about these two teams 
coming together is sort of 
conversations like that 
happening between the teams.  
Hey, here's what we're doing and
 wouldn't it be cool if we could
 hook these things        two 
things up and tell a more 
comprehensive story about the 
performance of your app.  
Definitely something teams are 
talking about.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's important to note that 
the Firebase performance 
offering is sort of the 1.0 out 
the door.   , but we think 
there's a lot we can do with it 
across, giving good performance 
analysis across a wide range of 
things.  And we have people very
 passionate and know the space 
well.  We acquired a small 
company caused        called 
pulse.io focused on this over a 
year and a half ago or so, and 
those folks were very involved 
in building that.  So we do have
 people passionate about looking
 at performances  as a problem 
overall.  I think if you look at
 what we're working on with play
 team overat, you'll         ll,
 you can see you can get basic 
information on all these 
different issues that might be 
happening in we    production 
and go in and get more through 
Firebase.  My expectation is 
we're doll that more broadly 
across other parts of the 
company.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Me too.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If I may, Fabric has great 
products for mobile.  Any plan 
to do JavaScript error tracking 
and anything for web
?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don't think we have 
anything particular to share on 
that front right now.  In 
general the web platform and the
 mobile made-up platforms have 
different requirements.  The 
types of things you would get 
out of a crash report are quite 
different, the times of perform
               ypes of 
performance you might want to 
measure are quite different  .
Not that we haven't seen 
interest.  We had to start 
somewhere and focused on the 
area we thought was most 
critical.  But definite    
           .  But definitely 
discussing it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There are notice you can  
              things you can do 
with Fabric on the web today
Firebase on the web today.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes.  Full things like cloud 
messaging, posting, 
authentication.  We're looking 
at what else we should maybe 
bring over for sure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think performance is one of
 the ones a little trickier to 
determine.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I had a conversation with the
 developer last night who is 
very interested in getting 
support across all smart 
televisions all doing JavaScript
 based things but on different 
engines.  It can be very tricky.
  So we'd want to make sure if 
we were going to do something it
 would provide clear value and 
not just lead to the next 
question, sure, it works on this
 browser but what about this 
embedded view kind of thing.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks, guys.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; More questions from my list 
 .
This is one that we have gotten 
a little bit today, will you 
start charging, this is a Fabric
 question.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, so you had a really 
good story about how you're 
thinking about monetization and 
you answered that question.  Do 
you want to give a little over
view how Firebase is charging 
and then go into Fabric?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure.  Firebase has products 
across the spectrum, helping 
your build your ap    app to 
addressing quality issues to 
drawing your application.  Many 
of the products we offer are 
free and sort of intentionally 
free if they are in the app 
quality space, and if we want to
 help you with quality, or 
things that really tie into how 
your app is performing and 
growing because Google has 
interests in those areas.  And 
the area we charge for is the 
areas where we're hopping you 
build                   helping 
your build your ap,     app, 
store data, videos, images, 
charge you     ing for cloud 
functions  .
I think the way this affects 
Fabric going forward is that 
we'll do the same sort of thing.
  The phone number 
authentication support in Fabric
       fire base we will be 
charging for but the crash 
analytics offerings will 
continue to remain free.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; When you look      line the 
products upside by side in terms
 of what you are hiring them to 
do, a lot of the stuff coming in
 from Fabric has analog 
environments today that are free
.  Even the phone number,  auth 
is going to be free for about 90
 percent of existing customers 
going into that product.  So we 
try to only charge where we can 
in terms of volume, then again 
of course we hope you do use the
 products like cloud functions, 
like real time database we do 
charge for.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This also comes from also I 
think an interest that I have 
heard from many developers as we
 talked to people all around the
 world saying hey, we have had 
some developer platforms in the 
past that we kind of depended on
 that companies just gave up on 
or walked away from or whatever.
  And that's actually been 
pretty painful.  So it's 
important to us that from the 
beginning, Firebase is a 
sustainable business for Google.
  If you're doing huge amounts 
of compute and firing functions 
all the time, store ing vast 
quantities of images, massive 
database queries, we will bill 
that as a usage-based thing.  I 
think it will ends up being much
 less expensive than probably 
any other way but ends up up    
being something that makes sense
 for Google as a business if 
your company becomes the next 
snap chat, that's great for 
everybody involved  .
Then on things like app quality,
 obviously we care a lot about 
having the mobile ecosystem be 
very successful, have a very 
strong interest in that.  
Certainly when you want to start
 doing things like growing and 
doing advertising to get new 
customers and things like that 
as   , as a company we have a 
huge range of products around 
that  .
The things            
We want to say the things we do 
actually drive value to you guys
 and to Google as a business, 
and that should be visible to 
you so that you know five years 
from now, this will all be 
running and you'll be happy that
 you built your business on it.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think you answered my next 
question, but see if you have 
anything to add, which is will 
my stuff break at some date in 
the future.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you do not introduce bugs,
 which we all do, .  So our goal
 is to be a good partner for you
.  That's actually one of the 
reasons why we have put more and
 more focus on creating a clear,
 strong supported subset across,
 Google in the past had done 
many things, sometimes well and 
sometime not as well for 
developers.  So we said we have 
areas like Google cloud whereas 
a company we're behind it, and I
 would say Firebase, we're 
committing to you that this is 
something you can build aur     
your business is    on, it's 
going to work well together, it 
should be clear  .
As I used      just said, you 
should hopefully be able to say,
 oh, I see, if we do well, I can
 see how Google is happy to have
 us as a partner.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hopefully you have seen that 
with what we have done so far.  
Firebase came in as acquisition 
two and a half years ago.  Folks
 running apps before the 
acquisition, it all still runs, 
same STKs, so I think we have 
demonstrated an ability to do 
that and we're hope to go do 
that again forever.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I believe with digits we have
 been working hard to take 
digits customers as well.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's right.  A few more 
minutes.  Real quick.  If I 
could ask you all, what's your 
vision for the future?  What are
 you most excited about in 
mobile development over the next
 months to years
?  
Start with you, Andrew.  I   
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Looking around.  Yeah, big 
question.  I'm very excited 
about the kind of server list 
space you probably have heard 
about.  I think the bar for the 
sort of technical complexity 
running is getting lower and 
lower.  With things like cloud 
functions and client accessible 
resources that we're building 
and other folks are building, 
it's getting a lot easier just 
to build things.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Uh-huh.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm also excited about the 
proliferation of internet 
connected devices we have.  
Light bulbs with internet in 
them.  The types of things that 
you can do together with a 
mobile app and light bulb and 
the system that you can talk to 
and integrate ing those together
 I think is going to be a very 
exciting space as well  .
You guys want to add to that?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.  I started working in 
this space about knife years ago
                 five years ago 
with crash analytics and was 
struck by the fact, yeah, you're
 developers have no way to know.
  I was like boy, like the wild 
west in terms of like zero 
infrastructure capabilities  .
We've come a long way with 
things like Firebase and Fabric 
where we're doing a lot of heavy
 lifting so you guys can focus 
on what's value added about your
 app and not having to recreate 
all these things  .
I think we're at the point now 
where ear   I'm excited, hey, 
now that I have a stable app and
 I understand my customers, what
      what are the tools I need 
to really grow my business and 
how can things like machine 
learning help me understand what
 my customers are doing in my 
app and help me make a better 
app that either is more entice
 ing to customers or helps me 
engage or retain the customers I
 already have.  There are a lot 
of things we have in that space 
and a lot of things other people
 have in that space, and I think
 it's an exciting direction for 
mobile.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I think the overall 
machine learning piece and 
capabilities around that, to me,
 are how to    do we make it.  I
 feel we're doing a reasonable y
 good job taking away some of 
the lower level infrastructure 
like just run work          
grunt works forks       folks 
have had to do.  Bit by bit 
raising the bar.  If I look at 
the future, I would love, I 
actually had an interesting 
conversation with somebody from 
the press who is from Montreal, 
not sure but I think he was 
saying there's apparently some 
kind of meat that is like maybe 
a hot dog kind of thing in 
Montreal that everybody does.  I
 saw all this talk about machine
 learning and I'm not really a 
programmer but I thought I would
 make an app that would let you 
take a photo and recognize 
whether the thing was the real 
Montreal hot dog type thing  .
I was like wow, that's great 
that somebody feels that we're 
almost there.  Like I think 
we're still a little ways from 
there       that.  But the power
 of that idea that we can, I 
don't think it's that far.  And 
I think we can start to say if 
you have something that you see 
as a problem, even if you're not
 tremendously technical, you 
could actually go solve it.  And
 if you are really strong 
technically, you can do amazing 
things.  We can give you magic 
powers  .
I was at schzam for a few years 
and one of the things I loved, 
at that moment in time was 
making technology that was magic
.  Machine learning is that 
again.  I think for us what we 
can do is give you guys tools 
that allow you to incorporate 
that into your applications in 
meaningful ways and just keep 
adding layers of really useful 
and powerful infrastructure so 
you guys can go after whatever 
problems you see.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have an all talk on 
Firebase machine learning 
tomorrow morning.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Threw   ere you go.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Excellent note to end on.  
Thank you for being on the panel

questions  .

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; At this time, please find 
your seat. Our session will 
begin soon. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Welcome. So today we're going
 to talk about what is possible 
with Cloud functions for 
Firebase.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 
I'm Michael Bleigh. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm Thomas bouldin
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This has carried us through 
start-ups and corporate life. We
 thought we'd share them with 
you. The first part is the most 
fun. Come up with an idea that 
will make you rich and famous. 
You know, this is when you get 
to daydream about how you are 
going to change the world. The 
second part is coming back down 
to reality. It's going to take a
 lot of time and work. And you 
have two choices for how you 
want to proceed. The first part 
or first option is to focus on 
engineering. This can be a lot 
of fun to build something rock 
solid. You get to 
implement all the cool 
algorithms you read about in 
school. If you're doing the 
project for impact it doesn't 
tend to end so well. So 
alternatively, you can focus on 
the user and your market niche 
who. are your users? What do 
they want? How can you quickly 
and efficiently build something 
they're willing to pay for? If 
you can answer these questions, 
you are on your way to a 
successful business and a top 
post in hacker news. Focus on 
your market fit instead of 
engineering but you can't 
actually screw up that 
engineering. You don't want your
 product to collapse as soon as 
it starts becoming popular. 
Otherwise your best outlook may 
be forever fighting this 
mountain of technical debt. And 
this is why we love Firebase. We
 took a break from startup life 
to work with Firebase because we
 think developers should be able
 to enjoy their work, build a 
scalable product, and do it 
quickly enough that they can 
focus on 
what is really important. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MICHAEL BLEIGH: So before we 
dive in, I want to talk a little
 bit about the history of app 
development. For a really long 
time the dominant way to build 
software was based on request 
and response. I had a client 
that could be a desktop app, a 
mobile app, web browser. That 
made requests to a server and 
the server sent some kind of 
response back and that's how I 
built a connected application. 
Now, of course, it wasn't 
actually quite that simple 
because in reality, the server 
needed to get it's date why from
 somewhere else. In reality I 
had a client that requested the 
server, a server this sent a 
request to the database. The 
database responded to the server
 and the server responded to the
 client and that's how I built 
my application. And of course, 
if I have many clients, I'm 
making many, many requests. And 
every time I want to see has 
something changed, is there new 
data that I need to be aware of?
 That's a new request. So this 
model worked but it only worked 
because we did a lot of work to 
make it happen. The Firebase 
realtime database took a new 
approach. Rather than having a 
client talk to the server, the 
server talk to the database, the
 client talks directly to the 
database. Writing data and 
listening to changes. The 
database then updates every 
connected client when that 
change happens instantly. 
Instead of making a request and 
getting a response, now 
developers can set up handlers 
and just listen for the events 
they're interested in. Events 
provide built-in meaning. Rather
 than having to create my own 
representation of well, okay, a 
new record was added to this 
list so you probably want to 
update it somewhere, instead I 
can listen to the realtime 
database for an add-it event. It
 had me do more with less code 
and I don't have to run my own 
servers. That's why the Firebase
 realtime database is so great. 
At this point you may be 
wondering isn't this supposed to
 be a Cloud functions talk? So 
the realtime database is great 
as synchronizing data between 
clients that connect to it. What
 happens if I want to 
synchronize data outside the 
database or want events to 
trigger side effects like 
sending an email or push 
notification? Something that 
happens outside of the database 
world? Well, to make this work, 
 I'm right back to running 
server. I run a server listening
 to the database and 
communicates with -- it's still 
yes, sir ear to manage. You have
 to realtime database in the 
center but I have to do all the 
work of setting up the 
infrastructure to bridge the gap
 between my server, the third 
party API, Firebase and client 
application and this is where we
 get to Cloud functions. Cloud 
functions for Firebase bring the
 event model to your entire 
application. It binds your app, 
Firebase and the rest of the 
development world together. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So what are Cloud functions 
and how do they work with 
Firebase? No conference is 
complete without a few buzz 
words. Let's get them out of the
 way. Cloud functions is 
Google's new serverless 
environment. No servers. There 
is actually a server somewhere 
so what do we mean when 
we talk about serverless? Cloud 
functions are back in code. But 
they take the form of lots of 
backened pieces. You hear the 
term microservices because the 
program model breaks your back 
end into individually managed 
components. But in the old 
world, you had to set machines 
to run the backend. The idea of 
microservices sound 
intimidating. It is not with 
Cloud functions because your 
code is your infrastructure. As 
we'll see later, the Firebase 
command line tool can look at 
your code and create all of 
these microservices and manage 
them for you. Now, because you 
have broken up your backend into
 these small pieces Google can 
do some great heavy lifting for 
you automatically. A Cloud 
function will be able to scale 
up automatically under increased
 load. When that load dies down 
Cloud functions with scale down 
those instances to zero which 
means you pay no bill just for 
being available. With Cloud 
functions, you only pay for the 
time that your Cloud function is
 actually handling a request, 
not just for the time you want 
to be available to handle a 
request. 
Now, because the Internet speaks
 http and https we've designed 
Cloud functions to let you build
 powerful https ends points or 
the event model that Michael tal
ked about you can directly 
handle events in Firebase and 
Google Cloud platform with your 
Cloud functions. So this is the 
most simple Cloud function that 
we have. With just a few lines 
of code, we've written a fully 
functional auto scaling web 
backend. Let's break it down. 
First we'll check out the export
 world. Cloud functions are 
written in JavaScript for the 
Node.js environment. It is 
called a module and everything 
inside a module is private 
unless it's publicly exported by
 attaching it to the global 
exports options. Export of Cloud
 functions that Google can find 
and run it and the Firebase 
command line tool will name the 
world like it is in the code. To
 the fine -- we'll use the 
Firebase functions SDK to make 
it easier to build a cloud 
function. Here we say we're 
creating a Cloud function that 
should be accessible over https.
 Cloud functions are built on 
express JS, a very popular node 
web serving framework and in our
 product we let you have access 
to the raw request and response 
objects. So this will let you 
build very powerful and free 
form backends very easily. Since
 our demo is trivial we'll send 
a static response back every 
time. 
Back to that code of 
infrastructure idea. To deploy 
Cloud functions all we need to 
do is run the command Firebase 
deploy with the Firebase command
 line tools. The command line 
tool will notice we have 
functions in our projects, will 
load our code, analyze what has 
been exported, notice this 
hallow world function 
and pre-- it will match 
production with your code. Here 
is a more complicated example. 
Let's say we have a message 
board. We're going to add a 
feature to our messages boards 
that wherever a use ear creates 
or modifies a message we update 
the message's time stamp on the 
server. So the functions STK has
 a common pattern. First, we 
pick the service that we want to
 integrate with. Here is the 
Firebase realtime database. Next
 we pick which objects we want 
to observe. Now we've given a 
pattern for the references 
inside the database that we want
 to observe. And finally, we 
pick the events we want to 
observe. Here we've said we want
 to observe all write events to 
any reference that matches this 
pattern in the Firebase realtime
 database. Our function will be 
called when an event object 
which is very powerful. 
Event.data is just like a data 
snap sho*t with features 
exclusive to Cloud functions. 
For example, event data.ref 
would have given you a reference
 to the database that acts as 
the 
original user. So we'll update 
the database and return the 
operation back to Cloud 
functions so it knows to stay 
alive while there is work 
happening in the background. 
We've shown you two quick demos 
that integrate with https 
endpoints or the Firebase 
realtime database. We support so
 much more. You can have a Cloud
 function run to handle every 
message in a topic where Google 
Cloud pops up or you can have a 
function run on every creation 
or deletion of a user in 
Firebase Auth. You can integrate
 with Cloud storage for Firebase
 or have custom code run in 
response to a conversion event 
and Google analytics for 
Firebase. It is with Firebase 
hosting and we're always at work
 to bring you more providers of 
events. So you can use Cloud 
functions to connect two 
Firebase features. For example, 
you can send a push notification
 in response to any change in 
the Firebase realtime database. 
Or you can integrate Firebase 
with third party APIs. What if 
you wanted to send an email? 
Sign up for an email provider 
and call them inside your Cloud 
function and do cool stuff when 
you flip this around. If you 
connect an API to Firebase 
imagine if you're building a 
product and you maintain your 
documentation as mark-down and 
GitHub. You can have a Cloud 
function that listens to a 
GitHub push and compile the mark
 down and deploy it to your 
product page with Firebase 
hosting. Today we'll show of 
some Cloud function demos. 
I want you to think about how 
you use Cloud functions to build
 your product, to automate your 
workflow, and to grow your 
business. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MICHAEL BLEIGH: So we wanted 
to think about Cloud functions 
as if we were developers, you 
know, building a startup from 
scratch. Thomas and I decided 
we're going to have a Fire!sale 
app. It's a simple concept. An 
online store that sells one 
thing per day. Who needs 
shopping carts or category 
pages? We'll sell one thing and 
you either buy it or you don't. 
So rather than explain more I'll
 jump right in. Can we switch 
over to the laptop? 
So this is Fire!sale and as you 
can see today's deal is Google 
 gnome, it sits outside. Can 
tell you the weather and it has 
the cool hat. I'm immediately 
interested. I have to have this 
thing. So I'm actually on 
Thomas's computer so I'll sign 
in and that's using Firebase 
Auth to sign in using Google 
authentication and I scroll down
 to the bottom and there are 
only 40 left. I need to act now.
 I'll click the cart button and 
it pulls up a form. Since I'm a 
user I have the address filled 
in but I need to fill in my 
credit card. I will enter a real
 and legitimate credit card 
number and 
let's buy it. So took a couple 
of seconds and now I've placed 
my order. You can see it says 
we're processing your payment 
and in the background what we're
 doing is we have sent this to 
the payment processor who is now
 processing it and you can see 
it's updated and the payment has
 been received. So in just a 
couple of seconds I bought a 
product on Fire!sale but, of 
course, I haven't told you 
anything about how I built it. 
Can we switch back to the 
slides? 
So what went into making 
Fire!sale? First, as with 
everything, we tried to focus on
 the user. We thought about the 
ideal and experience we wanted 
Fire!sale to have and then 
worked backwards to figure out 
how we needed to build the app. 
For this app the most important 
thing was to remove friction 
everywhere we could. If I come 
to Fire!sale, there should be as
 little time as possible between
 seeing the deal for today, dec
iding I absolutely have to have 
it, and making that purchase. 
Every moment of friction, every 
roadblock between me and that 
purchase is a chance that I 
might decide hey, you know, 
maybe I don't actually need a 
smart gnome to sit outside my 
house. We don't want that. We 
designed our app experienced 
being fast, focus and free of 
distractions and led us to a few
 decisions right away. First, we
 built Fire!sale as a 
Progressive Web App. Web apps 
are the fastest way to get a 
person's eyeballs on the content
 you want them to see. No 
booting up and no friction and 
the app is instantly shareable 
via a link. 
Like Fire!sale web apps have a 
great choice. With the 
simplicity of our store this is 
a great fit for the Google 
Assistant. What if someone could
 shop Fire!sale by speaking to 
the Google assistant? Most 
importantly, because we're a a 
startup or because we're too 
Google engineers with deadlines 
on a talk and pretending to be a
 startup, we wanted to offload 
as much work as possible. We 
wanted to use Firebase and third
 party APIs everywhere we could 
so we're doing as little work as
 possible. 
So let's talk a little bit about
 building your app with Firebase
 and Cloud functions. When 
building an app with Cloud 
functions one thing I would 
encourage you to do is think 
small. Don't worry about the 
thousand foot view and how every
 piece fits with every other 
piece all the time. Firebase 
gives you a hub for your 
application with products like 
the realtime database. At any 
given time you should be 
figuring out how to connect a 
single new thing, whether it's a
 new type of user interface, 
third party integration or 
whatever else to that hub. You 
don't need to be thinking about 
oh, I have this massive 
application and it does all 
these things. Cloud functions 
lets you break those apart into 
smaller problems that you can 
solve one at a time. 
Is first thing we needed when we
 were building this app was the 
deal page that you see when you 
first come to Fire!sale. We 
needed that first load 
experience to be as fast as 
possible. So I built a Cloud 
function to render the page's 
HTML and used the integration we
 launched yesterday. I won't get
 into all the details here but 
there will be a presentation on 
this stage at 5:30 and check it 
out. Now I've painted my deal 
page. Everyone can see the deal,
 read about it, find out what it
 is. They also need to be able 
to buy it. So now we needed 
interactivity. But here I had a 
little bit more breathing room. 
No one is going to come to the 
page and within half a second 
decide they need to click to 
buy. They'll read things for a 
few seconds and decide do I want
 this or not? So for the 
interactive parts of the app I 
used the Firebase web SDK. I can
 remember who they are and I 
used the realtime database to 
sync the order status so it 
would instantly come to the web 
app. Now one of the most 
important pieces of this flow 
was the -- one of the most 
important pieces of this flow 
was placing the order itself. 
Now, Thomas and I tend to agree 
on most things so it was a 
little bit surprising when we 
started arguing about how this 
should be implemented. I wanted 
to write new orders directly 
into the realtime database but 
Thomas thought it might be a 
better 
idea to use to build it as a 
Jayson API. We realized there 
are good situations for each and
 we thought it 
was worth sharing. With the 
realtime database you are 
writing directly to your 
permanent data store. You don't 
have to worry about translating 
requests or responses from a 
certain format. You are just 
deciding what your data model is
 and you are writing that into 
the database. Additionally, 
Firebase's security rules can be
 used to access control at the 
data level so you don't need 
complex authorization systems 
that you build yourself. Instead
 just rely on Firebase rules to 
take care of that for you and 
all of this is accessible 
directly from the client. 
Finally the realtime database 
has great features for 
reliability so your data will be
 synced even if you have a 
spotty data connection while 
you're using it. Https have 
their own advantages as well. 
For one there is no data 
build-up. No stored requests 
when you make a request to an 
HTP function. For things that 
aren't going to permanent alter 
your data model you might prefer
 and HTP function and then you 
don't have to write to the 
database and clean it up when 
you're finished. In addition, 
with http functions you have 
full control over the API. It 
speaks in Jayson objects. You 
can speak in whatever language 
you want whether it's Json or 
HTML or generate an image on the
 fly and send that back as the 
response. Any of that is 
possible with an http function. 
Finally, http functions can be 
connected the Firebase hosting 
and expensive or high traffic 
operations can be cached. So 
after we talked through all that
 we decided since we're creating
 a new order in our system 
that's permanently affecting the
 data model we would go with a 
database trigger for this. I 
built a Cloud function that 
listened for new orders created 
in the realtime database and as 
soon as it happened it would 
instantly send out to the 
payment processor and say we 
have a new order. User needs to 
pay for it and then the payment 
processor would process that and
 send the data back to us that 
says okay, the order is paid. 
That's what you saw in the 
 demonstration right there. 
While I was busy building that. 
Thomas was doing interesting 
work of his own.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks, Michael. So Google 
Assistant is a great way to 
build an immersive experience 
that follows your users around 
and great match for Fire!sale 
because we targeted users who 
look cool gadgets. If you're 
never programmed for the Google 
Assistant before it has a unique
 field. The code doesn't run on 
the customer's device. First, 
you register a series of actions
 that your agent supports with 
the Google Assistant. The Google
 Assistant will invoke these 
actions on behalf of the user 
either if the user directly asks
 to speak to your agent or if 
the Google Assistant thinks your
 action can fulfill the user's 
request. Every agent needs a 
backend that the Google 
Assistant can call. We're 
talking about it today because 
that back end can be a Cloud 
function. So the Google 
Assistant is a very 
rich topic. If you want to get 
started visit assistant apps in 
GS check out the actions on 
Google SDK. You can program in 
an intent-based model that might
 feel familiar to some 
developers and expose an http 
endpoint that you can then host 
with 
a Cloud function. 
If you're building an assistant 
app from scratch you might make 
one monolithic Cloud function 
that servings your whole app. 
This could lead to a more rigid 
system than you actually want. 
So here is what happened when I 
first started hacking on the 
project. I like to create a 
class so I can test each method 
separately. And then I decide to
 create the handler for the main
 intent. Well okay, I want to 
get today's daily deal so first 
I'm going to get the string I.D.
 for today's deal. Time zone 
fiddling and things like that. 
I'll fetch it from the database 
and my actual model has a 
normalization and this is all 
some really awkward boilerplate 
before I get to the fun stuff. 
So I started writing this I 
thought haven't I seen this 
whole boilerplate before? Didn't
 Michael just give a demo about 
how he wrote this for the web 
app? It felt like I was 
reinventing the wheel. So I 
decided to look at the whole app
 together with an eye for how I 
could refactor and reuse some of
 this code. So this is my 
second pass. Sorry. The web app 
has two functions we should look
 at. The first is exports.web. 
An http function that 
integrates the Firebase hosting.
 HTML, I can't use that to serve
 my assistant API but I could 
probably reuse some of the code 
inside of it. After refactoring 
here is 
my second attempt. 
I refactored that deals code 
into its own interface for 
handling the deal model and I 
construct by bot class with 
another model. One line to get 
this and it is shared in both my
 code and Michael's code. In the
 JS I'll create a concrete 
instance of this model accessor.
 I'll pass it to my nice 
testable controllers. And then 
I'll bind them to different 
Cloud functions. If you want to 
see why I write my Cloud code 
this way, you can check out 
Cloud functions testability and 
open source tomorrow at 2:00 
p.m. on this stage. So we can 
think of Cloud functions as 
either exposing a front end or 
enforcing consistency in the 
back end. With our new design, 
both our assistant and web 
interface are a Cloud function 
that supports or builds a front 
end. We keep these small and use
 code wherever possible. Now, 
because we know we're using the 
same model, exports on order can
 be shared without zero side 
effects because this function is
 in the second category. It will
 automatically respond to the 
event that we created in order 
and then make sure a side effect
 happens. 
So let's see it in action and 
switch to the demo screen. 
So I am going to ask Fire!sale 
for today's deal. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure, here is the test 
version of Fire!sale.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Today we have a sale on 
Google gnome.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Tell me gnome. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's like having a tiny 
meteorologist at your beck and 
call. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How much does it cost?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The Google gnome costs $130.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; How 
many are left?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There are 37 Google gnomes 
left. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's a good thing I have one 
on order. We need to switch back
 to Michael so he can fulfill 
that order and build an add min 
panel. Can we switch back the 
slides? 
BLEIGH: We've built up the 
interfaces our users will be 
using when they interact with 
Fire!sale but we need to handle 
the back Office of our store. So
 we needed 
to build an ad min panel. 
Building tools for your team to 
use is very important. If I'm 
spending all my time fiddling 
with an ad min panel myself and 
Thomas will use I'm not focusing
 on the user. What if I didn't 
build one of those panels. Our 
payment processor had built a s
ophisticated product and order 
interface of its own. Instead of
 building an ad min interface I 
built three webhook functions 
using Cloud functions that sync 
it back to the realtime 
database. I built one that would
 sync any time a project in our 
payment processor changed. Then 
every time and order change and 
a third that would sync every 
time the daily deals and which 
days had which deals changed in 
the payment processor. And so I 
got to have my ad min interface 
without having to build it which
 I was really happy about. I 
saved a lot of work. So let's 
take a look at how that works. 
Can we switch over to the demo? 
So here you can see I still have
 the web app up on this side 
with the order I just placed and
 on this side I have my stripe 
interface for my payment 
processor which has the products
 that I'm offering. So today's 
deal was the Google gnome. I'll 
click through to that. So you 
can see that all of the data 
that was populating the initial 
page when I loaded it, all of 
that stuff is right here and if 
I made changes here, that would 
automatically make changes that 
updated the page when it was 
rendered. But what I'm talking 
about today is order 
fulfillment. So since Thomas and
 I are just pretending to have a
 startup, we have a bunch of 
pretend Google gnomes laying 
around the office and we will 
manage fulfillment because we 
haven't figured out a process to
 have a third party do that. I 
have a new order here that is 
paid and I'll click through to 
that. This is the order I just 
placed a little earlier. So now 
from stripe I'm going to say 
I've shipped this out so I've 
used the postal service and 
enter a fake tracking number. I 
like update here. That works. 
Put in the password, hang on. 
There we go. 
So I fulfilled the order but 
what happens 
now? Well, stripe luckily 
integrates 
well with webhooks so any second
 now -- all right. The demo gods
 are not necessarily on my side 
right now. 
Let me take a look at this. 
Maybe I fulfilled the wrong 
order, I'm not sure. Let's try 
this one as well just for -- to 
be sure. 
Tell you what, sometimes the 
demo gods are just not on your 
side. Anyway, what happened 
every other time I ever tried 
this is that the webhook on the 
left immediately updated with 
the order tracking information 
for my order and everything 
happened without me having to 
make any changes in the 
application side or with my 
application code. I'll try the 
third one. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think when we were 
preparing our demo we forgot to 
clean out the data from our last
 version.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MICHAEL BLEIGH: Let's try the
 third one. Oh, yay, there it 
goes. 
(Applause)
I gave up too early. Thank you 
whoever shouted out, you know, 
to keep me going. All right. So 
that is Fire!sale. Back to you, 
Thomas. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's a good thing it worked. 
I gave him cool guy in the next 
slide. Can we switch the 
slides? Okay. So Michael found 
some great shortcuts that do 
actually work when building the 
ad min panel. This leaves me 
with the ops work. So people 
know that ops personnel tend to 
handle emergencies at night. 
Less known for handling all the 
chores during the day. The talk 
I mentioned earlier will cover 
some of the monitoring and 
alerting tools you can use the 
Cloud functions. But like 
Michael you'll use Cloud 
functions to handle some 
automation so I can get out of 
my 
chores, too. 
Michael decided we should make 
sure that production reflected 
mass serve as soon as possible. 
I can take care of that, I said,
 with a Cloud function. But 
after I made that assertion 
I started to worry because you 
have web hooks, it should be 
responsive. A webhook will have 
metadata to commit. I'll have to
 download that tar ball and 
untar it. I'm going to need to 
download all my dependencies if 
we don't check those in. With 
need to compile the code and do 
a final deploy. It probably 
wouldn't be a good idea to do 
that in a standard http request.
 Then I had an idea. I don't 
actually have to do that. 
Instead, I want to have a way 
where I can have a quick 
endpoint that will respond to 
GitHub before time-outs which 
would kick off a process that 
could do all that heavy lifting 
in the background.  so to do 
this I split my Cloud function 
to two pieces and connected them
 with Google Cloud. My first 
Cloud function would receive 
push notifications from GitHub. 
It would then compare the 
information about that get push 
to decide whether or not the 
commit matched the filters for 
which branches should be 
deployed to which projects. The 
next function could then wake up
 in the background and run with 
a much larger time-out or much 
larger memory requirements. In 
fact, I now had so much extra 
time that for some extra pizzazz
 announced the stop of every 
deploy in our chatroom. That's 
not all. I can automate more of 
my workflow. I can create 
webhooks that will check whether
 I remember to do my chores and 
hook them up to a service so 
that I will have a safety net 
that periodically checks. It 
might remind me that it's 8:00 
p.m. and I haven't queued up 
tomorrow's daily deal. My op 
duties are automated and I can 
pretend to be a cool guy, too. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; MICHAEL BLEIGH: So at this 
point our app is in pretty good 
shape. We have a working app on 
two platforms. We can manage 
inventory and fulfillment and 
our development process is 
stable and automated. What's 
left to do? Well, we could 
connect user sign-ups to a 
business intelligence API like 
clear bit to let us turn your 
users email addresses to give us
 information. Once we do that 
what happens if the customer 
reaches out to customer support?
 Now we have all kinds of data 
about the user we can use to 
help them out faster or maybe I 
want to take all of the orders 
that are created within 
Fire!sale and put those into big
 query, the big data analysis 
tools. This would let 
us do rich querying or build 
great sales dash boards with 
data studio or instead we would 
rather focus on reengaging users
 when new deals come out. We 
could build a scheduler that 
will call a webhook when a new 
deal comes up and trigger push 
notifications or emails every 
time a new deal goes live. Of 
course, these are all just 
examples that I came up with off
 the top of my head. But the 
really powerful thing about 
Cloud functions is that you can 
hook just about anything up to 
just about anything else. Of 
course, this doesn't just work 
for Fire!sale, but for any app 
you're building or even apps 
you've already built. I would 
encourage you to dive into Cloud
 functions. Think small. Think 
about the little pieces you 
could fit together with Cloud 
functions to accomplish 
something big. We're really 
excited to see what you build. 
That's all we've got for you 
today. If you want to learn more
 about Cloud functions there are
 some awesome sessions coming 
up. I listed a few on the screen
 here and also if you want to 
talk to either of us, we'll both
 be heading over to the Firebase
 sandbox area now. Hit us up 
with all your questions about 
Firebase, life in general, I 
don't know, anyway, thank you 
very much. That's it. 
(Applause)

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: Welcome. I'm Parul
 Soi. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm 
Laurence Maroney. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: We're here to talk
 to you about pirate metrics and
 help oh framework to draw your 
audience and sustain it in the 
long run. Laurence and I wanted 
the start up at Google. After a 
lot of extensive market research
 we decided to do something that
 nobody t Google has ever done 
before. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: He built a 
chat app. I told yo
u they would laugh. It's called 
Really Friendly Chat. You've p
robably heard of friendly chat. 
Check it out if you haven't. 
It's a great way of learning 
Firebase. It touches on a lot of
 technologies in Firebase. We 
wanted to do more, right. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: We added 
translation so you can chat with
 people even if they don't speak
 the language. So Laurence, can 
you show us a great demo? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: Can we 
switch to the demo box? Here I 
am using really friendly 
chat. I'm chatting with my 
friend who has exceptional taste
 using an Android device. I'm 
chatting in English. What I'm 
saying in English she is seeing 
in Japanese. We're having this 
conversation and she says nice 
to meet you and I realize I 
might be impinging on her time. 
I'll say what time is it over 
there? And so I'll ask her that 
and send it to her and I've 
typed it in English and she will
 see it appearing on her Android
 screen in Japanese. I don't 
read a word of Japanese. If 
there are any Japanese readers 
here you can hold me 
accountable. It is translated 
and she will send something back
 to me like this. And then she 
says oh, it's dinnertime. I said
 okay, I better leave you alone 
yet and I'll get back to my 
demos and talking at I/O. This 
is really friendly chat. Let's 
build a startup together. In the
 startup we have this 
application and want to grow it.
 Let's change back to the 
slides, please. 
So Parul will be our growth 
hacker and teach us how to 
grow this application. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: With really 
friendly chat we turned to 
pirate metrics. Let's go to a 
typical user life cycle. Users 
are acquired in a lot of 
different ways, public 
relations, social media, ads. 
But once you acquire a user, 
your job is really half done. 
You might have just gotten them 
to the landing page of your 
website but what you really need
 to do is make them experience 
the unique selling proposition 
of your product. For a social 
media product it could be to 
follow friends, interests, for a
 game it could be to complete 
one level. You need to ensure 
the user realizes and 
experiences that one unique 
thing about your product. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: Once you've
 gotten your user and activated 
your user, you generally face an
 uphill battle to retain these 
users. How many times have you 
built an application and you've 
put it out there and done a 
marketing campaign, you've 
gotten a ton of installs but 
then after week one or week two 
your installs go down. How will 
you make sure they keep using 
your applications after the 
first few days? The goal for any
 healthy product is to keep your
 users coming back. If you're 
churning all of these users all 
the 
money you've spent acquire them 
has gotten wasted. Friends help 
friends discover great apps and 
great content. Your users can be
 your greatest and strongest 
advocates. No acquisition 
strategy is as powerful as one 
where your users are telling 
their friends and their family 
and people around them that your
 app is awesome. But in order to
 be able to get people to do 
this, you really need to reduce 
the friction. We'll talk about 
some of the technologies in 
Firebase that will help reduce 
this friction and stop the users
 from being able to share with 
their friends. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: Ultimately we all 
want to monetize our users. Each
 user is a denintive amount of 
money. You want to identify who 
is worth more than the other. 
Let's summarize a user life 
cycle. We have the following 
five stages. Acquisition, 
activation, retention, referral 
and revenue. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: This is 
called pirate metrics. The 
strategy our imaginary startup 
will use to launch this 
application. Speaking of 
launching things, anybody 
want a T-shirt? How about this 
side? Oh, right in his hands, 
how about that? Hopefully our 
launch of our application will 
be as successful. Pirate metrics
 it's about acquisition, 
activation, referral and revenue
 and if you put the first 
letters of all these together us
 get AARRR. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: The first 
is acquisition. We want to 
understand how to acquire users.
 We came up with three 
strategies. We bought ad space 
and web searches and optimized. 
We built a great website that 
people can use to discover our 
application and we also decided 
to work through partners to tell
 people about our application. 
Let's see how we dive into each 
of them. The first is 
advertising campaign. Let's say 
as a user you are searching and 
traveling to Japan. You probably
 see an advertisement and take 
them to the landing page and 
will tell them more about an 
application. Now because you 
have ended up on the website you
 might get an experience with 
images about Japan, traveling 
recommendations and the site can
 contain a dynamic link that has
 context to connect them to the 
-- if a user has the application
 it launches it directly. If 
they don't it will take them to 
the page that you can go and 
install the application and then
 end up right inside the app 
that you can chat with someone 
in 
Japanese. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: As Parul 
mentioned it is Dynamic Links. 
Anybody used that for Firebase? 
Cool. So Dynamic Links, what 
makes them special is they 
maintain context through an 
install session. Not just a link
 to the landing page of your app
 in the Play Store. If you have 
a link in our case with really 
friendly chat. If somebody 
visited the landing page for 
having pen pals in Japan there 
would be a context to link them 
for a pen pal in Japan. They get
 linked to one directly. In 
addition to this, because this 
is pirate metrics, we want to 
start thinking in terms of 
analytics. We're launching our 
app for first time and don't 
know how successful it will be 
or Dynamic Links or any of our 
strategies are going to be. 
Because we've used Firebase for 
this we can say we have all 
these analytics that we can put 
into it and see what strategies 
work and we can see what 
strategies don't and refine it 
accordingly. So here is an 
example of we're on our landing 
page in our site and we said 
here is another example of where
 we can do context of dynamic 
link. Instead of linking to a 
pen pal we could have a contact 
us link that would link somebody
 to a chatroom with our support 
staff or people who can answer 
questions about the application 
itself. And then that becomes a 
straj  -- strategy for how to 
grow the app by getting them to 
speak with us. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: You can tie it 
with an advertising account to 
make your acquisition strategy 
smarter. Say you're trying to 
get users who chat in Spanish. 
By this account you can import 
the event that the user sent a 
message in Spanish and you can 
track it in the analytics 
account to see if you're getting
 the right kind of users or not 
and create a custom audience add
 show ads to them. Amazing way 
to retarget users. Some users 
try to access your app and chat 
in a different language that is 
not supported earlier. Now you 
can build an audience and once 
you start supporting this 
language, you can target 
notifications to them and bring 
them back to your 
application. We've done all the 
work that will help people find 
our app and get them to install 
it. But to make an impact and 
ensure they stay engaged with 
the app Really Friendly Chat we 
want a great activation 
strategy. First of all, 
something has a user-based 
experience. A user needs to sign
 into the app, log into their 
account and then end up directly
 where they can chat with a pen 
pal. Now to make this seamless 
we have authentication. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: The idea 
behind Firebase authentication 
is to make it as easy as 
possible to sign up and into 
your app. Shall we throw out a 
T-shirt? Let's try a high 
pressure shot. Oh, nice catch. 
One handed. I hear the 49ers are
 looking for receivers. You 
should give them a call. I'm a 
Seahawks fan, sorry. Firebase 
Authentication, one of the 
biggest things we yu user drop 
off in apps if they have a 
hostile sign-up experience. 
We're strangers to you and if 
you're going the Play Store and 
installing our app and we're 
asking you for your name, 
address, reset email, phone 
number, all this kind of stuff 
that's something that could turn
 you off very easily. Firebase 
authentication has been designed
 with that in mind to allows 
identity from different 
providers, Facebook, GitHub, 
Twitter and Google and in the 
keynotes yesterday we've added 
phone op to that as well. 
Instead of giving emails you can
 sign in with your phone number.
 A neat thing that's in there to
 allow you to have a 
friction-free sign-up experience
 is anonymous authentication. 
You can go through the security 
rules but without providing a 
username and password. This is a
 nice thing to activate our 
users, once they start the 
application they have an initial
 experience that doesn't turn 
them off and one that delights 
them. Another one that we said 
hey, great way of activating 
users is initial delight. As we 
saw when I was demoing it 
earlier on we want to have a 
fast, fluid, seamless experience
 and something like this we were
 doing translation and it is a 
great strategy again like if the
 user's context, if what you 
bring them to do you activate it
 instantly and bring them to it 
as quickly as possible, a 
one-tap signin and I was 
connected with a pen pal. Trivia
 question, I'll give out free 
T-shirts who sees me first in 
the sandbox and tell me where 
she has come from. She is not 
entirely an imaginary friend. If
 I sign into the application and
 have an initial experience that
 delights me, that's giving me 
exactly what I want to do which 
is fast and fluid, they aren't 
fishing for context or looking 
for pen pals and they're in the 
application and using it right 
away doing something 
interesting. 
Now, part of this comes from 
Remote Config. I've spoken with 
a number of developers over 
time. I chatted with one 
developer that built a 
customized on boarding 
experience with Remote Config 
that I thought was interesting. 
They built a Cookbook 
application. If you were 
at the Firebase grill section 
you would have seen it. If I 
want to cook Chinese food I 
would have Chinese screens. 
Indian food I have Indian 
screens initially as soon as I 
sign in. They were actually 
almost able to double their 
growth overnight to use Remote 
Config and Firebase Auth to 
reduce friction in signing in. 
Shouldn't we do this ourselves, 
right? If we want to sign in we 
want to give them if they're c
hatting with somebody in 
Japanese we want to give them 
this pleasant welcoming screen. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: Let's take a look 
and see if we can launch users, 
he saw this really nice shade of
 pink. URENCE MORONEY: It's not 
really my thing. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: You were visiting 
Japan. Cherry blossoms, really 
nice. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: Not my 
thing. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: Let's see what we 
can do about it. We could, for 
example, give this really nice 
shade of pink to all the 
Japanese people who sign into 
our app and all boring guys like
 Laurence we have the same 
standard. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: T
hat's better, I think. 
Once we've gone beyond the 
background color part of the 
next experience was to have a 
responsive fast, fluid app. For 
that we use the Firebase 
Realtime Database. One of the 
neat things about that it works 
across platform but event-drive 
database instead of 
a query style database allows us
 to have instant responsive 
updates in the app and it works 
well in the circumstances of 
flakey networks. For example, 
with something like a chat app 
that's really important. Now, 
think about I'm chatting with my
 new best friend in Japan and 
they traveled through a tunnel 
and loses connectivity. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: Tunnels in Tokyo 
are well connected. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: Maybe I 
travel through a tunnel and lose
 connectivity. I don't want to 
lose my conversation. What will 
happen? If I built this using 
the realtime database to store 
my chats I will get with a 
little bit of code I can get a 
resync. Once I come out of the 
tunnel and now I'm reconnected 
to the web I can actually sync 
all my chats so all of that time
 that I was offline isn't wasted
 and I'm not alienating my new 
best friend by not chatting with
 her. Shall we look at the code 
and see what it takes to build 
it?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I can't see anything there. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: I didn't 
need to write any code 
whatsoever. Without a single 
line of code using the Firebase 
realtime data bails I was able 
to get this off line/online 
reconnection. Everybody is 
getting their cameras. I'll aim 
at them. 
Firebase Analytics targeting is 
far better than mine. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: Acquiring users 
and delighting them is key. But 
it is not enough to have them 
engage with your application for
 a long time. With the amount of
 competition there is between 
devices, apps, sites, I really 
feel that it will get lost in 
the mix and we need a really 
good retention strategy. A 
friend of mine, one of the apps 
in India decided to use target 
notification for reengagement. 
He saw a 200% increase in 
conversion rate and a 300% 
increase in open rates. 
Notifications are a great way 
when used properly can really 
help target the right kind of 
users and bring them back to 
your application. But let's face
 it, a lot of times we get the 
notifications and they annoy us.
 We can have our notifications 
can target the right kind of 
audience. For example certain 
users when haven't used our 
application in a while and have 
made purchases in the past. If 
you want to bring this audience 
back we can create it as a 
separate audience of all those 
users who made purchases in the 
past and then target a coupon to
 use it to buy something. This 
really helps us prevent the 
terrible issue 
of notification spam. Laurence, 
show us a great 
demo of how notefications would 
work? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: I want to 
show a basic example. Any 
Android studio users here? A few
 of you. You know if 
you use Android studio, you can 
populate it with an MT activity.
 I haven't written any code in 
this whatsoever. New MT activity
 application and then on the 
right-hand side I used the 
Firebase assistant to connect my
 app to fire base and add SDM to
 my app. Now I've run the app 
and the app is running here. The
 boring old application, pirate 
metrics notification and has 
hello world in the middle. This 
app is activated to receive 
realtime notifications. And just
 to prove this to you, I'll open
 the notification composer and 
pick the app. I have a number of
 coaches of the app in this 
project. I'll enter a message. 
Somebody give me the message I'm
 going to enter so you know it's
 real. What's that? I'm sorry, I
 can't hear on 
the stage. 
Yoho, matey, AARRR. 
Ask Parul about the parrot. We 
had a parrot and she lost it. 
I'll put that in and embarrassed
 you now. I'll click send 
message and ooh, I right clicked
 somewhere. I will click send 
message and click send and come 
over here to the emulateor it 
shows demo gods be with me. 
Okay, I'll launch a T-shirt 
while we're waiting. What should
 happen if it's behaving, but 
it's not. When devices are 
connected, notifications are 
generally received on connected 
devices about 98% of 
notifications are received in 
less than 500 mill seconds. I'm 
one of the 2% now. Anybody? I'll
 check in a moment. They'll get 
mad 
at me. 
I'll move on from the demo. If 
we switch back 
to the slides. 
That was the coding demo. I want
 to talk a little bit about 
App/Indexing next. We're talking
 about the strategies part of 
pirate metrics and the 
technologies we use and try to 
fit them 
into our growth stagey. Anybody 
here use App/Indexing? I think 
I'll make your day. If you have 
a site that contains content and
 you have an app that contains 
the same content, then all you 
have to do is to connect your 
site to your app using asset 
links in Android or universal 
links in iOS. When the Google 
spider crawls the website and 
people who have installed the 
app can render the content in 
the app rather than going to the
 site. If people have installed 
your app on your device they say
 I'm interested in this type of 
content in this app. If you're a
 sports fan and you want to see 
-- you install an application 
for your favorite sports team. 
If that application had built 
app indentioning 
 -- indexing links on the site 
and receives incoming links and 
renders them in 
activity or review users 
searching the web for details 
about that team are getting 
reengaged with your app 
automatically. A simple 
investment. At 3:30 we'll talk 
and demoing where Yahoo Japan 
built it into their app in a 
couple of weeks and achieved 
great growth and reengagement. 
We all install way too many apps
 on our devices and what happens
 when we start running out of 
space and move to a new device? 
Those are the apps if you aren't
 constantly engaged with them if
 people aren't going to your app
 as part of your daily workflow 
those are the apps that get 
uninstalled to make room and the
 apps that get forgotten when 
you transfer to a new device. We
 think App/Indexing is powerful 
to reengage your users to do 
that. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: Friends help 
friends discover great apps. 
There is nothing as important 
that can help your product grow 
as a word of mouth campaign. So 
for instance, if I saw a recipe 
of cookies and I wanted to share
 it with Laurence so he could 
bake me some. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: If you want
 me to make you cookies you're 
in big trouble. I have ended up 
in the hospital with my cooking,
 true story. In Parul said there
 was an app and there was an app
 for the recipe what's the 
workflow generally going to be? 
Go to my device, the Play Store,
 search for a recipe app. Have 
you ever done that? There are 
hundreds of them. Okay, Parul, 
which recipe app? The one with 
the orange icon or something 
like that and I would be okay, 
there are dozens of those. Then 
it would take me time to find 
the app and have to search for 
the Seabiscuit recipe. That's a 
lot of friction. How do we make 
it easier? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: You would have an 
easier with the applications out
 there. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: Even less 
from Google. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: If you can still 
make your user's life a lot 
easier. We have invites to do 
that. It provides you a separate
 -- that doesn't tell you which 
app you want to use but actually
 gives you a list of fun facts 
you can share your application 
with and it has context to put 
the top contacts in the most 
relevant contacts on the top of 
the list. Laurence, can you show
 us? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: Can we 
switch to the demo laptop, 
please? I'm back on my really 
friendly chat, chatting with my 
imaginary friend. She won't do 
App Invites because she doesn't 
have any friends. I'll do some 
App Invites. It's a drop-in 
widget that you can use 
within your apps. An easy API. 
It gives you the typical system 
dialogue you'll see when you 
want to share an application. 
When I launched it, it was a bit
 of a spinning wheel before it 
gave me the top six contacts. 
There is a lot of work being 
done by Google in machine 
learning and AI. When you are in
 a context of trying the share 
an application, instead of 
giving you an A to Z list it 
thinks about the context of what
 is going on right now and 
picking the top people on this 
list from people I'm regularly 
emailing with or maybe the time 
of week that I'm doing it or 
it's applications that I've 
already shared with them that 
they've installed or it's we 
have both have the same types of
 applications, that kind of 
thing. As a result, then it's 
giving me this dialogue and as 
you can see it's pick six people
 I'm most likely to interact 
with and really funny if we can 
switch back to the slides, so 
today is Thursday and Parul and 
I have rehearsed this talk on 
the last three Tuesdays and 
usually when I show this, there 
is one contact that showed up 
that didn't show up here. I wish
 he did. Typically on Tuesdays I
 chat with these guys. We have 
breakfast on Wednesday and 
Tuesday we chat where we go to 
breakfast or Wednesday and he 
shows up as one of my fast 
contacts because it's Thursday 
today. It's showing how the 
intelligent sorting is going on.
 We want to reduce friction in 
having friends share content 
with friends. One great way of 
doing that is how many contacts 
do you have in your address 
book? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: Probably 600. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: My surname 
begins with M. If we did it by 
basic sorting I would have to 
filter through 300 people. M is 
in the middle of the alphabet 
before she could share with me. 
Because she shares a lot of apps
 with me if she were to do this 
I would be at the top of the 
list. Friction free, make it 
easy to share. It comes 
magically when you use Firebase 
invites. How I did it in the 
really friendly chat, as an iOS 
developer I never got into 
Taylor Swift, sorry about that. 
Here is all that I have to do. 
An FIRInvites object and used it
 to create an invites dialogue. 
Then on the dialogue I set the 
delegate for it to be this 
particular view I'm in. What 
that will do is give me the 
call-back once the invites have 
been sent. This call back is 
invite finished with invitations
 and this this call back my code
 is a little dumb. It will show 
a dialogue that said I've sent 
10 invitations. If we think in 
terms of pirate metrics and 
growth hacking I can do s
omething interesting here where,
 for example, I could create a 
custom analytic and I could 
store that custom analytic so if
 I've now shared really friendly
 chat with 20 people I could 
have an analytic that I shared 
it with 20 people and build in a
 reward membership and we give 
an incentive from friends 
referring friends to great 
content and great apps. 
When it comes to before we 
release our app and when we test
 our app there are two phases. 
The first of thieves 
-- these is what do we do before
 and after we shipped it? I like
 to put it in terms of 
referrals. Bad testing and 
reviews on your app are 
referrals from strangers. How 
many times have you looked at an
 app in the Play Store and you 
look at the one-star reviews and
 say I'm not installing that 
app. That's a stranger has given
 you a bad referral. If it's a 
five-star review it encourages 
you to download the app, that's 
a good referral. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: We have to be able
 to handle crashes. We have 
crash lit I cans. Found in the 
line of code which led to 
the cache of your app. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: You're a 
good coder, too. You can do it 
in iOS and I'll do it in 
Android. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: Let's see about 
that. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: One thing I
 forgot to mention before we 
move on to performance 
monitoring. If you want to test 
your application and make sure 
it works before you ship, there 
is something called test lab for
 Android. A quick survey here, 
how many here have pixel XL? 
One, can I borrow it for six 
months? No, anybody want to loan
 me one for six months before I 
can ship this? They always say 
no. Okay. So the idea is if 
you're knowledge an application.
 I'm building this app and need 
to know what it looks like on a 
pixel XL and ship it before my 
application. This gentleman 
won't loan me his. What do I do?
 What if I can't buy a pixel XL 
in my country or if I want to 
ship my application to other 
countries where the phones that 
they are most common in that 
country I don't have in my 
country. That's what test lab 
for Android does, Google have 
put together a datacenter with 
virtual versions of all common 
devices and the obscure devices 
you may not be able to get your 
hands on. If you build your 
application and upload it to the
 datacenter. It can be tested 
and crash reports and traces of 
what is going on fed back to 
you. There are custom tests that
 you can design that are 
specific to your app and rob owe
 texts from Google testing the 
basic things, open, close, log 
in, log out. As a result I can 
test it all on the devices and I
 don't need to borrow that 
gentleman's pixel XL. There is 
performance monitoring. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; PARUL SOI: We have to ensure 
the app is behaving in an 
optimized manner after shipping 
the application. If it's eating 
too much network and bandwidth 
we can use app monitoring tool 
to make sure this data is being 
tracked and combined with crash 
litics in case it's leading to 
crashes we can optimize the 
future versions of the 
application and make sure that 
the issues are resolved. 
Finally, making money. Firebase 
makes it easier for you the 
track your revenue in one place.
 Do drop by at 8:30 tomorrow at 
this stage -- stage 5. You will 
also find out sitting at the 
back making notes it's a great 
session on analytics working 
together. Will you be able to 
show us a demo of dropping an 
ad?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: They're 
renaming that session to 
hangover cure. 8:30 in the 
morning after the party it will 
be good. Let's look at what it 
looks like to add in the code we
 have to Really Friendly Chat. 
You probably saw the banner ads 
in there. That's running on a 
test machine. The banner ads 
were showing basic stuff. If you
 think about when you want to 
put ads into your application 
the important thing is if you're
 putting ads and taking up some 
of your user's eyeball and 
attention span with ads make 
sure they're relevant. AdMob is 
easy to put an ad in an app that
 I'll show in a moment but the 
ads are relevant. If this was a 
real app I was showing and 
chatting with any friend about 
Japanese things I would probably
 getting advertisements for 
travel sites, hotels in Tokyo, 
all that kind of stuff and let's
 take a look at the code for 
that. I've been something iOS 
code. I'll switch back to my 
favorite Android. In Android if 
your layout file you will simply
 add a thing called an ad view. 
So you drop an ad view object to
 your layout file and give it an

ad unit I.D. which is -- when 
you have signed up for AdMob and
 creating your ads and ad 
campaigns you get the unit 
I.D.s. If you're a good Android 
programmer you put in the 
strings and I'm referring to 
that string and then within my 
view itself all I have to do to 
initialize the ad is this. We're
 familiar with creating a handle
 to control by putting fine view
 by I.D. to get it and I create 
a new ad request off an ad 
request builder and 
load the ad request into the ad 
vaou. I've written three lines 
of code and I have the power of 
Google advertising and the smart
 matching going on into the 
advertising to put into my app 
and help me monetize my app. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 
PARUL SOI: Another powerful 
element -- no line of code is 
required at all. For example, if
 we had a -- it will 
automatically -- without us 
doing anything at 
all. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: So we've 
designed Firebase. I'm still 
trying to get the demo to work. 
We've designed Firebase to give 
you a suite of technologies for 
growth. We put in an application
 and put it any Play Store and 
hope to get slashed on it or 
maybe we hope to go viral 
because a celebrity is using it 
and very, very few can achieve 
sustainable successful growth in
 that way. So the idea with 
Firebase and always we've 
designed it and the Firebase 
grow 
-- what are people using to 
systematically to grow their 
applications. Pirate metrics 
helps you to think about the 
five phases of launching an 
application and growing it with 
the public. So we want to -- we 
built Firebase in that way so 
you aren't buying a lottery 
ticket. If you build your 
application and pushing it into 
one of the stores. You can think
 about acquisition through the 
acquisition technologies, think 
about activation, similar for 
retention and similar for 
referral and something in there 
for revenue. We're really only 
getting started with this. As we
 continue to grow and evolve the
 Firebase platform we're 
continuing to grow and evolve 
all of these. All of these are 
bound together by analytics. 
That's something we're also 
continuing to grow and evolve. 
And if you are building and you 
are launching a new application 
what you can start thinking of 
is launching it using pirate 
metrics. You have everything 
before you have gained a single 
analytic to give you a strategy 
but once your application is out
 there and analytics start 
coming in usage patterns start 
coming in you can start refining
 your model and refining how you
 are acquiring people and start 
refining how you activate and 
retain them and all that type of
 stuff. A beautiful suite of 
technologies. Most are free to 
use when they work like my Cloud
 messaging did, I'm sorry. It's 
something that will help you get
 to that sustained growth 
without buying a lottery ticket.

have Dave McClure to provide 
this amazing framework to launch
 your app and sustain it in the 
long run. That's it from us, 
guys. Thanks for attending this 
session. You can find us at the 
sandbox if you have any 
questions:
(Applause)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: Slightly 
lower pressure this time so the 
folks don't get worried. Oh, 
intercepted. I actually have one
 more.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; JOSH GORDON: Hey, everyone. 
Thank you very much for coming. 
My name is Josh Gordon. I work 
in TensorFlow development 
relations and I'm excited to 
share with you thoughts on Deep 
Learning today. A bunch of 
resources you can use to learn 
much more about it. A pair of my
 favorite Open Source models and
 I'll show you cool things in 
how you can use a pre-trained 
image classification network to 
generate your own artwork. Which
 I find really interesting. 
So before we get started I just 
wanted the take a moment to 
reflect on this idea of 
reproducible research. We can do
 a lot of things today with Deep
 Learning that I think we take 
for granted. So in 2005, I spent
 about six months trying to do 
basic image classification. I 
was working in a medical lab and
 we had a slide containing some 
solution with some cells on it. 
My goal was to use a Neural 
Network to 
identify cells that were 
diseased and cells that were 
healthy. There are many machine 
learning libraries that I even 
use today. We were still writing
 a lot of our Neural Network 
code by hand and it took us six 
months to work well with this 
task. It was hard to experiment 
with different networks and 
optimizers. What is interesting,
 we had a lot of good engineers 
working 
with us and doing this type of 
image classification today looks
 very different. So today a 
strong Python developer with 
some basic background in 
TensorFlow and willingness to 
try Open Source models and read 
literature can do a much better 
job than I could have done in 
six months full-time in just a 
few days. And so there has 
really been a lot of value 
created. And the reason that we 
can do all these great things is
 a lot of researchers, academics
 and developers both from 
universities and Google and 
other large companies and small 
have been, I think, very 
generous in sharing their tools 
and their ideas and their code. 
So that the next generation of 
developers can iterate and 
refine on their ideas. We have a
 lot of value at our fingertips.
 Because I started my machine 
learning career in medicine I 
want to look at value that has 
been created by this research 
and Open Source models. Here are
 three applications of medical 
imaging from the last eight 
months or so and they rely on 
Open Source 
TensorFlow model called 
inception. You can train it on 
your own data. Here we are 
looking at work in diabetic 
retinopathy. It is an eye 
disease. If it's caught early it
 is treatable. If it's caught 
late it can lead to blindness. 
In this work we're using image 
recognition to identify patients
 in need of care. The next image
 here was a nature paper from 
Stanford University using 
TensorFlow in image 
classification on Android to 
detect skin cancer. The cool 
thing about this is I don't mind
 going to the doctor but I'm a 
lazy guy. If I had an Android 
app that I could scan my arm to 
find out if something was 
malignant not I would do 
advanced screening. In the lower
 left we have work using image 
classification in medical 
pathology. You have a 
pathologist and their job is to 
take a look at a slide and find 
cells that are cancerous. The 
problem is these slides can be 
enormous. 100,000 pixels by 100 
thousand pixels. Billions of  
pixels on this slide and looking
 for a small region that 
contains cancerous cells. 
Scanning these slides by hand 
can be very demanding. But, of 
course, if you have an image 
recognition model you can 
analyze every region on that 
image with a fine tooth comb and
 build tools to assist 
physicians. We can do fun things
 with art, music and sound but 
there is real humanitarian value
 that is becoming increasingly 
accessible. The reason I like 
this medical stuff, this is a 
field that is not computer 
science but because 
of a lot of reproducible work in
 Deep Learning there are many 
usages, even in artwork. I 
mentioned Deep Learning. I want 
to show you a cartoon diagram of
 a Deep Neural Network. This 
particular network is class 
filing this image as a cat or 
dog. I want to highlight one of 
the differences with Deep 
Learning and some of the work I 
was doing in 2005. 
The way I would have written an 
image classifier in 2005 I would
 have written a lot of Python 
code and what features do I want
 to feed into my classifier, 
lines, shapes, colors. I might 
have used open CD to use face 
detection. In Deep Learning we 
can give the classifier the raw 
pixels from the image and the 
network will find features on 
its own and visualize what it 
has learned. There is more than 
one layer. We have a stack of 
layers, a Deep Neural Network 
and that's where the term Deep 
Learning comes from. This is 
classifying the image as a cat 
or dog. 
There are many wonderful Deep 
Learning libraries. My favorite 
is TensorFlow from gao*fmgt as 
you know it's used both for 
research and production. It has 
everything you need to build 
products with hundreds of 
millions of users like Google 
Photos as well as do actual 
research like the work you saw 
in medical imaging and having 
the same code base for both of 
thieves is very valuable. I'll 
have to fly through this. I have
 a lot of content I want to 
share with you. I'll have to 
accelerate a little bit. So here
 are some of the papers -- these
 are blog posts but they all 
point to a paper I want to share
 with you today and show you how
 you can do practical and fun 
things with them and there is 
much, much, much more. Google 
research in the last couple 
years has been prolific in 
publishing papers and many of  
these are state-of-the-art and 
they publish everything you need
 to try this out on your own. 
I'll show you what that means. 
So one question that comes up, 
if you have a say 
state-of-the-art natural 
language parser. That has a lot 
of business value. One question 
that is asked me a lot. Why Open
 Source that? And why share it? 
One really important reason is 
it empowers others to continue 
your ideas. So I'm not doing 
research now but even as just a 
hacker I have many more projects
 than I will ever finish in my 
lifetime. You guys are all busy.
 Not enough hours in the day. By
 Open Sourceing your code you 
make it possible for the next 
generation to continue your line
 of thought. And then another 
huge benefit is that it reduces 
barriers to entry. So rather 
than having to design your own 
image classifier from scratch 
you can immediately go to the 
state-of-the-art in Open Source 
and get started on the problems 
that you care about. Briefly, 
here is what makes a good 
reproducible Open Source 
release. You want to share your 
code and all of the code. That 
means the code you need for 
inference, for training, as well
 as for evaluation. You can't 
have any hidden pieces, 
otherwise it is not 
reproducible. You want to share 
the dataset you used the train 
the model. There are lots of 
copyright issues but make it 
reproducible and helpful to 
include a toy dataset when you 
share a model. A small piece 
that makes it really easy for 
someone to test if their 
end-to-end pipeline is working 
properly. 
A pre-trained checkpoint is 
super valuable. It took a week 
the train on a machine with -- 
not everyone happens to have 
HEPU sitting around. By sharing 
a pre-trained check poirnt the 
model works out of the box to 
classify image and much faster 
to explore with. Docker, 
oftentimes you have a lot of 
dependencies in your 
environment. By sharing a docker
 container it makes it much 
faster for people the try your 
ideas. This talk is about Open 
Source models but you can 
develop with Deep Learning by 
writing code and I want to show 
you briefly what it looks like. 
The point I want to make is 
developing with Deep Learning 
does not have to be hard. With 
basic Python skills you can 
write Neural Networks in 15 
lines of code now. This is code 
from a library called Keras, I 
like it. It's very concise and 
supported in TensorFlow. The 
idea is in TensorFlow you get 
the best of both worlds. Here is
 almost the entire code to 
define a network very similar to
 that cartoon diagram we saw 
earlier. I'm adding a stack of 
layers and most of the work is 
going into making sure that the 
weights and sizes all line up. 
We have to pick up the pace of 
this. Here is a code to compile 
the model. In Deep Learning if 
you're learning it for the first
 time one thing to be aware of 
you'll run into a lot of new 
terminology. It can be quite 
scary. We're looking at 
something that says loss equals 
categorical cross entry. Oh, 
this is very different from a 
lot of stuff I've worked with in
 the past. Oftentimes when you 
look at these terms they are 
more simple than they sound. 
Loss in Deep Learning means 
error and just a number. The 
other is a fancy word for 
comparing distributions. One you
 know and should have predicted 
and the number that shows how 
different they were. 
I also -- there we go. I also 
wanted to let you know that 
TensorFlow comes with a nice 
visualization tool called 
TensorBoard. As you can see from
 this animation that has failed 
you can use TensorBoard to 
visualize the Neural Network you
 define and poke inside the 
layers. So the second way to get
 started with Deep Learning is 
to leverage Open Source, which 
is what I want to focus on 
today. The first model I want to
 talk about is inception. And 
how you can use it for image 
classification as well as Deep 
Dream and style transfer. Before
 we saw a cartoon network. Here 
is what inception looks like. It
 is larger and has many more 
layers and inside the layers 
there are moving parts. When you
 have talk about inception 
TensorFlow begins to shine. 
TensorBoard make it easy to 
spotter yors you have in your 
architecture. So first I want to
 talk about image 
classification. I'm from New 
York. Here is a picture I 
snapped last week looking north 
towards central park from the 
office. And when you are doing 
image classification the easiest
 way to get started is choose an
 API. I want to show you what 
this looks like. The Google 
Cloud Vision 
API. Dragon drop and restful. 
This is skyline. You can do it 
in Open Source. You can do this 
actually quite easily. So here 
is code for Keras running inside
 TensorFlow and the complete 
code on this slide. It is 
complete. This code will 
actually import inception, a 
network architecture we saw on 
the previous slide. Load the 
pre-trained weights and process 
an image. So this stuff is much,
 much more accessible than it 
often seems. Five lines of code 
is much better than what I could
 have done just a few years ago 
with a huge amount of effort. 
The funny thing about inception 
out of the box is if you 
classify this image you get 
nonsensical tags back. It's 
telling me it's possibly a 
doormat. The reason why that is 
-- it's not a problem. The 
reason why that is, the 
pre-trained model that comes 
with inception is from a dataset
 called ImageNet. It has a 
million different images from 
thousands of different 
categories. Most 
are pictures of dogs, cats, 
flowers, artwork. And so of 
course image classifiers only 
can recognize the things they've
 been trained on. So inception 
doesn't know any better when you
 get started. In fact, the blog 
post that announced the latest 
version is very proud that out 
of the box inception is 
sensitive enough to tell the 
difference between these two 
different species of dogs. One 
is a malamute and one is a 
husky. The sensitivity when you 
retain it it makes it good in 
the medical diagnosis domain. In
 fact, there is a good 
expression, don't trust, but 
verify. If you run inception on 
this image you get output that's
 more sensible. It will identify
 it correctly as a dog. 
Probably you don't care about 
recognizing dogs. How can you 
take inception and retrain it to
 recognize images that you care 
about? The good news is, there 
is this concept in machine 
learning called transfer 
learning that I want to briefly 
introduce and show you how 
accessible it is. The idea in 
transfer learning is simple. If 
you've learned a Neural Network 
to recognize dogs and now you 
want to recognize cities, do you
 need to start from scratch? 
While you're learning to 
recognize dogs, the network has 
probably identify useful 
features and images that might 
be applicable to other things. 
Instead of throwing awhich the 
network and retraining from 
scratch do surgery on network. 
You can chop off the very last 
layer of weights and create o
utput nodes just for the classes
 you care about. Instead of 
relearning the entire network 
which might take a week and a 
million images you can relearn 
just the very last layer and you
 can do that in 30 seconds and 
you might only need 100 images. 
With a very small amount of 
data, you can actually create 
your own image classifier. I 
wanted the let you know we have 
a codelab for this. We published
a second version it is called T
ensorFlow for poets. It will run
 scripts that do surgery on the 
network. The only thing you need
 to train a high accuracy custom
 classifier is to collect 
directory of images you care a
bout. This is a app I built at 
the metropolitan museum of art 
and point to paintings and 
sculptures and it will tell me 
what it is. It will walk you 
through and install it to an 
Android. 
Some developers felt it was too 
easy. TensorFlow for poets is an
 easy codelab. Not going into 
the details of how it works. We 
have TensorFlow tutorials if 
you're interested. Something 
interesting about TensorFlow for
 poets. A lot of machine using i
n practice is not thinking 
carefully how who to define m
odels and using lots of math. A 
lot of machine learning is like 
development in general. If 
you're building an app like this
 one at the museum you have to 
think carefully about how is 
this app going to be used in 
production? So if a user picks 
it up and point it at a painting
 or sculpture, what if it's 
dark, what if there is someone 
in the background and 
instruction? A lot of thinking 
in machine learning is how to 
collect training data to cover 
these different cases. If you do
 it properly you'll have an app 
that works very well in 
practice. For Android developers
 here I want to let you know we 
have three Android samples for 
Senator flow. The one on the 
left is style transfer that I'll
 show in a second. It's 
beautiful. The one in the middle
 is an image classifier which 
runs inception and the one on 
the right is an object detector 
to identify the location of 
things and images. 
So one really, really 
fascinating thing about Deep 
Learning that I just want to 
give you a preview of is when 
you learn an image classifier, 
in addition to being able to 
classify images, that classifier
 actually has gained some 
knowledge about images in 
general and you can use that 
knowledge surprisingly to 
generate art. I'm running behind
 so I'll skip that and we'll go 
straight into deep dreaming. 
Question, how many people have 
heard of or tried Deep Dream. 
Half. How many people know 
why it's important? Much fewer. 
So to me the point of Deep Dream
 is not that we can generate 
beautiful psychedelic artwork. 
That's really wonderful but it's
 not why Deep Dream is 
fascinating to me. The reason 
that I find Deep Dream 
interesting is it really begins 
to investigate the question why 
is it that deep Neural Networks 
are so good at recognizing 
images? And there are things we 
know about Deep Learning in 
general why they're so 
effective. GPUs and Cloud we can
 train larger networks on data. 
Another reason is there 
have been many algorithms 
improvements like batch norm. 
The reason in my view that 
they're so good at recognizing 
images is they automatically 
learn features. So I mentioned 
with that cartoon diagram at the
 start that the network will 
find useful features from images
 automatically and in addition 
to finding useful features, 
networks actually learn a 
hierarchy of those features. So 
in most image recognition 
networks you are using something
 called convolution. I wanted to
 give you a preview of what that
 looks like. So when I say 
convolution, what I mean is 
using a filter. On the left we 
have a gray scale picture of 
Manhattan. In the center a 3 by 
3 filter. On the right we have 
another image that shows very 
roughly the edges of where the 
buildings are. This filter is a 
little edge detector that I 
wrote. Very scrappy. If you 
write Python code to slide the 
filter along the image and 
compute the product of what's 
beneath it. It will produce the 
image that roughy shows the 
edges. This filter is hand 
engineered but in convolutional 
neuronetworks we learn a 
hierarchy of these things. I've 
added a line of Keras to learn 
32 of these filters and each of 
these filters is going to be 
learned as a function of the raw
 input image. As a function. 
Pixels. But if you have a stack 
of these filters, what you are 
doing is you have the first 
layer is finding features of the
 raw image. The second layer of 
filters is learning features of 
features. And the third layer is
 learning features of features 
of features. So the filters that
 you learn become increasingly 
abstract and you get this for 
free by virtue of training and 
image classifier you get the 
learned hierarchy of filters. 
You can repeat this. I've 
started from random noise an 
optimized the noise to excite 
filters at different layers of 
the network. The really 
interesting thing and good 
science to be done in 
understanding this rigorously is
 that the lowest layer of 
filters generally learns to 
detect edges and colors. The 
next layer is learning textures.
 Those are features of edges and
 colors. As you move higher up 
the network you learn things 
like patterns. If you go way 
high up the network, that's when
 you get psychedelic stuff. Deep
 Dream doesn't have to be used 
to create drippy artwork. I used
 Deep Dream to turn this image 
into something like a fireworks 
display. To do this you can 
select which filter you want to 
optimize for. If you look at the
 Deep Dream notebook at the link
 on the top you see a lot of 
code. The interesting thing 90% 
of that code is fine-tuning to 
make sure the images that are 
produced are really beautiful. 
This is the core of the Deep 
Dream algorithm and it's really 
concise. The basic idea in 
TensorFlow we'll pick some 
filter from some layer of the 
network and we're going to 
define a loss function. The loss
 is just a number. And here the 
loss is going to tell us on 
average how excited is this 
filter by some image. So if we 
classify any random image, the 
filter will get some activation.
 In Deep Dream what we can do is
 say TensorFlow, tell me the 
gradient of this loss to respect
 to my image. You ask 
TensorFlow, how should I modify 
it to increasingly excite some 
filter in the network? You can 
literally modify the image 
according to the gradient and 
here I can add it directly to 
the image and repeat so your 
image will progressively excite 
the filter and that's where Deep
 Dream comes from. 
Here is another picture I took 
from the reservoir in New York 
and we're looking south from 
90th street. And I ran Deep 
Dream on top of it using a 
filter at a very high level of 
the network and this particular 
filter actually I ran it on a 
whole layer of the network. The 
second to the last layer. If you
 run Deep Dream on an entire 
layer what you're saying is 
TensorFlow progressively modify 
the image to excite all the 
filters. So you're basically 
super saturating it with things 
it knows how to recognize. 
That's why you see if you use 
inception, that's why you see 
dogs and cats and snakes 
everywhere. But if you took 
inception and you retrained it 
say on artwork and then you ran 
Deep Dream on top of that, you 
would no longer have these dogs.
 Instead you might modify an 
image to contain elements like 
Monet and Picasso. I think it's 
cool and good science. I didn't 
want to show you this but the 
notebook contains code to 
produce your own animated 
dreams. But it was borderline 
not safe for work, not in a 
strange sense. It was too 
psychedelic and seizure 
inducing. So there is another 
absolutely beautiful thing you 
can do with pre-trained image 
networks and this is called 
style transfer and for people 
new to it I can't recommend this
 strongly enough. It is my 
favorite way to produce really 
beautiful artwork. So what I 
want to show you is something 
from a project called Magenta. 
There will be a talk on Magenta 
tomorrow by one of the project 
leads. It is a wonderful project
 and investigates how to use 
Deep Learning to do art and 
music. In style transfer, you 
begin with a painting. Here is 
one from the museum of modern 
art in New York. And then you 
take a photograph. So here is 
one of the golden gate bridge. 
The style transfer is to produce
 a new piece of artwork that 
combines the style of the 
painting with the content of the
 photograph. And by style I mean
 things like edges and shapes 
and colors and by content I mean
 things that are sim a antic. 
Here I see a bridge. If you 
tried to do this by hand in 
photo shop or whatever to 
produce a new painting the 
result would not be very good 
unless you are much better at 
photo shop than I am. Using 
style transfer you can generate 
images like this. You can 
produce images like this almost 
for free as an artifact of 
training an image classifier. 
And in Deep Dream what we were 
doing is finding an image that 
excites some filter of the 
network. In style transfer we n
eed to caption the notion of 
content and style and here is a 
high level diagram of how that 
works. We also get this for 
free. If you take say the 
painting on the top and you use 
some existing image classifier 
and classify the painting, what 
you can do is look at the 
activations of the lower half of
 the layers roughly. Earlier we 
said we saw the first layer 
detebted edges, shapes and 
colors and texture in the first 
three. When you classify the 
image by looking at the 
activations in the layers in s
ome sense you can capture what 
it means to have style. And then
 if you classify the photograph 
and you look at the activations 
toward the top of the network, 
you have some sort of sense of 
what it means to have content. 
And then if you combine 
those, you can actually come up 
with a number that you can 
optimize in TensorFlow and how 
you can start with random noise 
and progressively optimize it to
 minimize a loss that combines 
content and style. So at a high 
level that's how it works. I 
think the science behind it is 
mind blowing. This is a good 
example in Deep Learning of 
something that never in 100 
years would I have thought that 
ever I could write a Python 
program to produce images like 
that stylized bridge. It never 
would have happened. It turns 
out this is something we get for
 free. 
You'll 
see in Douglas's talk that I 
highly recommend you can do it 
in realtime now. They have a 
collection of paintings saying I
 want to apply starry nights to 
this dog. 
All right. So that's inception. 
Language is also obviously 
really important. People that 
work in robotics or video or 
images or games have the best 
demos so their work is usually 
more well-known but all -- I 
want to show you a couple models
 from the syntax net family. 
Parseysaurus. It is the most 
natural language processor 
completely Open Source in 
TensorFlow. So here is how we 
can work with text. Imagine you 
just have a simple sentence I 
love NYC. One thing you can do 
if you go the API route is use 
something like the Cloud 
national language API to analyze
 the sentence. Dragon drop, a 
web demo that's fun and restful 
if 
you write code. 
So here we're seeing the cloud 
API telling us love is a verb 
and 
looking at a dependency. NYC is 
the direct 
object of the sentence. Here is 
a docker code. This will contain
 the Parsey Saurus model and a 
code for 40 different languages.
 Using this, you can actually do
 some really interesting things.
 So parsey Mcfarce face was the 
-- it has been 
superseded by Parsey Saurus. 
Parsey Mcfarce face -- Saurus 
operates on characters. This a 
quote from a book called the 
meaning of meaning. And if you 
look at it the sentence is 
nonsensical. What's funny is for
 some reason our brain knows a 
lot about this sentence. So for 
instance, I could ask you some 
questions about it. So what do 
you think the part of speech is 
for distims? Is distims a noun? 
Is distims a verb? It's a verb. 
And it is funny we know that 
because it's not a word. And the
 really interesting thing is you
 can actually use Parsey Saurus 
to tell us that as well. If you 
fire up the docker container 
you'll find a Python, you 
can feed Parsey Saurus that 
sentence that contain 
information about the parse and 
iterate over it. Find the 
word and Parsey Saurus will tell
 you it's distims. Who or what 
is doing the disTiming? And is 
it the doshes 
or the GOSTAK. It can tell you 
that as well. If you iterate 
over the tokens you'll find out 
the subject of the sentence, the
 goe stack. If you just print 
out the raw from the tokens you 
get a lot of information and 
only some is on this slide. It 
can give you fine grain stuff. 
It can tell us that distims is 
the pretense and the GOSTAK is 
singular and the doshes are 
plural. 
And then the natural language 
API has the beautiful dependency
 trees but you can produce that 
as well. 
The notebook contains code using
 something to produce graphics 
like this. Doshes is the object 
of the sentence. So there is a 
lot of value 
in Open Source. The cool thing 
about Parsey Saurus is 
multi-lingual support is really 
important. I'm really impressed 
by the syntax net team and 
Magenta and inception team. They
 have a link where you can 
download pre-trained models for 
more than 40 languages. Loading 
these languages is a little bit 
-- a few more parameters but it 
is one or two lines of code and 
switch the model to German just 
like that and here are the 
languages I saw out of the box. 
This is actually really cool. If
 you're building any kind of 
application that works with text
 and is doing something machine 
learning you can think about 
multi-lingual support from the 
start. There is two really good 
use cases for this. The first is
 an easy way to get started. If 
you have an existing system 
doing some sort of text 
classification, expand detection
 or whatever and using 
dependency tags use Parsey 
Saurus to get a boost in your 
accuracy and use it as a 
foundation for a new system. Any
 time you are training a model 
in Deep Learning you'll need 
lots of data and I think by 
using these features as 
additional input you can reduce 
the amount of data that you need
 because you won't have to learn
 notions like part of speech and
 dependency tags from scratch. 
Instead, you get them for free. 
There is a really awesome term 
that I found on Magenta's blog 
called release +. This is text I
 stole from their 
article talking about something 
called NSynth, a program that 
can generate sounds. It was a 
beautiful passage. When they 
shared the code for it. They 
called out sure they're sharing 
 the code but also a docker 
container. The team has done a 
wonderful job. If you want to 
try out their work in style 
transfer you can do it out of 
the box and it works well. It 
sounds simple but something hard
 to achieve in practice. I can't
 tell you how much time I spent 
playing with opens source and 
tensor learning and so hard to 
replicate results. I think some 
of the work that I've showed you
 today is good examples of work 
that sets the bar on how to 
share ideas. 
I've accelerated too much in my 
rush to get through all this 
could be tent but anyway, a 
blessing and a curse of learning
 Deep Learning today is there 
are a huge number of educational
 resources. There is actually an
 entire medium blog post where 
somebody went through something 
like 30 different machine 
learning courses and looked at 
all are reviews. Here are a 
couple I would recommend. 
Stanford has a great course, 
student initiated and impressive
 on TensorFlow. 
It has an intime dating title 
but it will walk you through the
 basics of writing the programs.
 The course notes from -- it has
 introduction to convolutional 
neuronetworks but it will work 
you through in Python what is a 
classifier and how do you write 
one from scratch and take you 
from something like neighbors 
all the way up to convolutional 
network. Natural language 
processing Stanford has a course
 in doing natural language 
processing with 
 TensorFlow. If you want to get 
intuition for how they work 
under the hood and why they're 
good at recognizing images. 
There is a blog that is 
outstanding and I highly 
recommend it from Chris Olah. 
One of my favorite things about 
I/O is looking at the crowds. I 
am seeing folks I haven't seen 
for a year. I like this 
conference a lot. I'm happy to 
chat afterwards. Thank you very 
much, guys. I hope this was 
helpful.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Welcome to this talk where 
we'll be talking about some of 
the growth technologies in 
Firebase and advice how to use 
them. Instead of showing this 
partner did this, we'll show 
what they did and then 
we'll try to be hands-on in 
showing you how they did it so 
we can learn from partners of 
Google who have been very 
successful with the grow 
technologies I'm Laurence 
Moroney. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALEX GEBOFF: I'm Alex Geboff.

one of those things, something 
that everybody wants but 
sometimes very few of us no 
really how to do it in a s
ystematic way. Often when we 
want to build an application 
we'll put it into the Play Store
 or app store and hope for the 
best. We might have a marketing 
campaign to draw people to it. 
We might buy AdWords to draw 
people do it but we've seen the 
curves, we do 
a campaign and they're here and 
here and the following week 
they're gone. If we want a good 
sustained growth we need a 
strategy to do so. Growth isn't 
a lottery ticket. Something like
 slash dot because your lottery 
ticket so that when your app 
gets slashed you can have great 
growth but we want to think 
about how do you do that sustain
 growth and talk about some of 
Google partners 
that did that. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALEX GEBOFF: We'll go beyond 
the theory and talk about a 
couple of companies that have 
implemented these growth 
technologies with real world 
examples and we'll show you a 
little coding demo of how you 
can do it yourself in your app. 
So we'll start with Yahoo Japan 
who have the largest auction 
site in Japan in their market. 
And they also have used 
App/Indexing 
and public content indexing to 
drive growth and reengagement 
for their Android app and 
Skyscanner who have 
differentiated themselves in a 
crowded app market and last but 
not least we'll talk about 
Cookbook, a recipe app using 
Remote Config to provide 
tailored experiences to their 
audience. Let's get started with
 Yahoo Japan. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: Any 
Firebase developers here? A few,
 nice catch. 
I have a few Firebase T-shirts. 
I want to 
talk about Yahoo Japan. They 
built this thing called Yahoo 
YAHOUKA!. It has 10 million web 
users and growing all the time. 
They were looking for 
a strategy increase retention 
and users and usage of their app
 to grow it. They looked at app 
index and personal 
Personal Content Indexing. It 
went live in 
May. They integrated it in three
 weeks and they were able to 
implement some of it in one 
hour, that's all it took to 
implement Personal Content 
Indexing. In Alex was on the 
team it would have been half an 
hour. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALEX GEBOFF: Not likely. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: To talk a 
little about it. If you are 
aren't familiar with 
App/Indexing. If you have 
content on the web and content 
on a website and you have the 
same content in an app that you 
can link the two of these 
together. In Android you link 
them with with an 
acid links file and iOS file. If
 users have installed your app 
on your device they sent a 
signal that says I want to 
consume this type of content in 
this app. Google with our search
 engine as it is crawling the 
web searching for that type of 
content. 
If it sees the -- they'll say 
hey, this user really wants to 
engage with this type of content
 and app. When this user as part
 of theirdale routine use the 
search device multiple times a 
day. Instead of being taken to a
 website with blue links, they 
say they like to consume this 
type of content in this app and 
they can get that type of rich 
experience. Let's look. If we 
were building an app, Alex, how 
would we integrate App/Indexing.

content indexed in Google search
 result you need to do two 
things. Set up deep links that 
match to your website and create
 a site app association to 
verify ownership of both your 
website and your app. Ultimately
 what that does is creates -- 
signals that you own your app 
and your app should be the one 
handling all of these links. So 
when a user clicks on your link 
in Google search results they go
 directly to content in your 
app, the app chooser is the 
other name. So to implement this
 in Android you use Android app 
links and we'll go through how 
to do that in Android studio. We
 have the app links assistant 
that guides you through every 
step of setting up deep links 
and adding logic to handle the 
incoming URL and the digital 
asset links file that verifies 
ownership of your site and app. 
First you would actually map 
URLs from your site to 
activities in your Android app. 
You go ahead and clip that open 
your mapping editor and it opens
 this fun thing and you add the 
URL and you can set a path 
specifically, a path pattern or 
path prefix that we have here. 
We want everything that's recipe
 app.com to go to our recipe 
activity. Then you hit okay. 
Once -- and then this adds the 
following code to your Android 
manifest file. As you can see 
it's 
essentially routing every recipe
 app.com recipe URL. When they 
get to your activity you need to
 pull up and show the right 
recipe. You write logic to 
handle the intent. Select the 
right activity and it adds 
boilerplate code to your recipe 
activity to customize to fit 
your needs. Once you've done all
 that you open this little links
 file generator and enter 
information about your site and 
app. Doesn't have to be a recipe
 app but it should be. And 
generate the digital asset links
 file. Save the file and upload 
it to your site and skip that 
dialogue and then test it on the
 Android studio emulateor or use
 tools to test it from our 
documentation. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: Another 
part of the technology is 
Personal Content Indexing. 
Anybody want to index personal 
content here? Let me try. 
Whoops. I have think I need to 
turn up the pressure. The last 
time you used this in a session 
I hit one of the lights. I have 
to be really careful. Another 
part of this is the Personal 
Content Indexing technology. 
When you have App/Indexing 
whether the Google search engine
 is finding the content, then 
the content that you generate 
that's personal to you that 
you want to keep on the device 
but be able to search on the 
device. A really great use for 
this one is what Yahoo did with 
their auction site. I visit a 
lot of auction sites. I love 
visiting E-bay, I have a strange
 taste in rugby jerseys. If 
you're searching for something 
like that all the parameters you
 need to do. In 
my case Welsh rugby Jersey. A 
new one, not a used one. The 
tweaks I have to do to find the 
one I want. I have to do the 
same thing every day. The idea 
behind this one in this case the
 person has been searching for 
antiques and they may be 
searching because an text tend 
to be larger they may be 
searching for one in an area 
pick it up locally. Searching 
for a particular style and 
price, all of that kind of thing
 and the search can be saved as 
a favorite. Once it's saved as a
 favorite in the future when 
they're searching on their 
device, when they search for 
something like antiques you'll 
see on the right-hand side of 
the Google search app you can 
find in app content. Content 
that stays on the device that's 
never sent to Google to search 
the application itself is 
indexing it on the device. Those
 predefined searches will help 
them find this in-app content to
 reengage and go directly into 
that app. That's the neat thing 
about this. It's growth through 
reengagement. A lot of ways you 
use your users, you are yet 
another app on your device 
amongst the 300 other apps they 
have. If this is part of a daily
 workflow searching, then it's 
something that you can actually 
have your app become part of 
their daily workflow and once 
it's part of the daily workflow 
they remember it when they're 
upgrading their phone next year,
 that's one of the apps that 
comes along. When they use their
 phone on the daily basis it's 
one of the apps they're 
discovering. Alex will show us 
how they're able to code that in
 as short a time as they did. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALEX GEBOFF: So largely once 
you've indexed all of your 
content those links will start 
showing up in Google search 
results. Personal context has 
the links that show up in the 
Android. It is Android only but 
you do create these fabulous 
indexable objects in your app 
and you can create custom 
indexable objects, for an 
auction app you want a saved 
auction and whatever the URL is 
and you only need to set the 
name and set the URL and all the
 extra parameters you can decide
 for yourself based on whatever 
you need for your index blog. 
Then we can show you how that 
will look on our demo device 
when you are searching for it. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: We can 
switch to the 
demo machine, please. Nice 
catch. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALEX GEBOFF: So you can see 
we have the recipe app up. And 
if I go to 
Google and 
I 
search for PAROGEPOUTIN. This is
 amazing and if I click that it 
pulls up the recipe and I can 
change my note and say 
seriously? So good. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: I think 
they're serving it tonight. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALEX GEBOFF: Update that and 
then theoretically my note will 
show up in apps. Seriously so 
good. You don't have to wait for
 Google to find it. Switch back 
to the slide. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: Let's look 
at another partner. We saw how 
Yahoo Japan could use the 
App/Indexing to build a greater 
user experience. This is 
Skyscanner. They are a travel 
search site. When we do travel 
search we're looking for 
flights, boats, hotels, cars, 
things to do. There are a lot 
of these applications and 
receivess out there. Skyscanner 
wanted to distinguish 
themselves. They thought they 
had a great offering, great 
prices that you could find and 
they end up 50 million plus 
monthly users. How would they 
distinguish themselves? One way 
they did we believe you're 
finding the best bargains with 
us and we'll help you help your 
friends find those same 
bargains. Friends help friends 
discovering great apps and 
contents. They did so using App 
Invites. Part of Firebase. Has 
anybody used them and familiar 
with it? Cool. App Invites is a 
built-in thing that uses the 
system UI for app sharing. The 
most important part of this, two
 really important parts. Number 
one is it reduces friction of 
sharing by having an 
intelligently sorted contact 
list. I like to joke that my 
name, surname begins with M. How
 many friends do you have? 
5,000? Tens of thousands. 
Someone like Alex who has lots 
of friends if she would share 
with me I'm halfway down the 
list because my name begins with
 M. But the idea behind App 
Invites and 
the  dynamic and intelligence 
sorting if it's the day of week 
see usually converses with 
somebody. An app type she shares
 with somebody. If I've 
installed the same types of 
apps. Maybe she is sharing a 
game and I've a lot of games she
 shared with me in the past I'll
 bubble to the top. Reducing 
friction when you build this in 
your app are making it easier f
or your users to share this app 
with their friends. That's the 
first part of it. 
The second part it's built on 
Dynamic Links. That's actually 
really cool because what they 
actually do. Ist is not just a 
link to your app in the Play 
Store or app store it contains t
hings about the app. Alex was 
talking about how much she loves
 her recipe. If she were to 
share an app containing the 
recipe with me and I don't have 
this app installed, once I've 
installed this app I'll be taken
 directly to her recipe instead 
of having to fish for it myself 
and I end up again with greatly 
reduced friction and if we think
 if you reduce the friction that
 it takes for friends to share 
content and apps with their 
friends, you will have a lot of 
success. This is what Skyscanner
 had done. They built the 
sharing into their app. Let's 
look at how the App Invites w
ould actually work. If we could 
switch to the demo box. If y
ou're at my pirate metrics talk 
earlier you would have seen this
 app, really friendly chat. 
We've implemented App Invites on
 it. If I click invite you see 
it spinning for a minute and 
these six people appear and it 
is basically these six people 
are the ones probably most 
likely to accept my app invite 
right now. You can see the top 
two left ones are Rebecca, my 
wife, and as a result she g
enerally answers my emails 
hopefully and so it's 
intelligently sorted it like 
that so we're able to get these.
 Let's look at the code taken to
 build this. If we can switch 
back 
to the slides. 
Here is the code. I built this 
in objective C, I'm not a Taylor
 Swift fan, sorry about that. 
Told you they would laugh. 
GEBOFF: Breaks my heart. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: All I have 
to do is there is an FIR invites
 object. If I use it to create a
 dialogue 
and set the delegate for the 
dialogue to be myself I get the 
system UI. It looks and feels 
like drive, looks and feels like
 Gmail and all those other ones.
 I also get a callback if I set 
the delegate to myself and I can
 do interesting things in the 
callback. I've done something 
not interesting and I'm showing 
a dialogue that says you've 
shared this app with 15 users or
 whatever the number of users 
are. Think about the things you 
could do here if you're using a
nalytics. You could have a 
custom analytic that says 
Laurence shared with 15 people 
successfully. Let's set up a 
custom analytic for them and 
when you use something like 
Remote Config that I will show 
you earlier on you can have 
rewards driven to the person. 
Friends help friends discover 
great content and great apps. H
ere is a mechanism that you can 
reward them for doing that to 
achieve that kind of explosive 
growth. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALEX GEBOFF: So as Laurence 
mentioned this technology built 
on top of Dynamic Links that you
 can use on their own. Dynamic 
Links are URLs that you can use 
across platforms to create these
 custom experiences and generate
 them programmatically in your 
app on create them in the 
Firebase console. They preserve 
it so users get right to the c
ontent they're supposed to land 
in even though they've had to 
install the app first. You can 
integrate this also with Google 
analytics for Firebase and get 
all the awesome insights and 
build better dynamics links and 
user experiences for your users.
 As I said earlier, you can 
generate these within your app 
using the iOS or API. My husband
 and I love to travel and if I 
found a great deal on 
Skyscanner, I could go ahead and
 click the link from within the 
app, send him the flight deal 
and say hey, check this out and 
he will go right to the flight 
deal even if he has to install 
the app first. I can also as 
Laurence was saying earlier, if 
I have this recipe or whatever 
recipe that I want to blog about
 and want to link users directly
 to that recipe in my recipe app
 -- can I say recipe one more 
time? I could just go ahead and 
include a dynamic link in my 
blog post and send users to that
 recipe in my recipe app. We'll 
show you how to crow ate a 
dynamic 
link in the Firebase console. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: While 
they're switching to the demo 
device. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALEX GEBOFF: As you can see 
we've created a dynamic link and
 we'll create a new one here and
 add this -- let's make 
it the good old POUTINE and 
there is a 
potato salad that's good. 
PIEROGI, if I spell it right. 
Open this in your iOS app and 
select it from the list or open 
it if you create it for your 
Android app, it will show up 
here and set a bunch of custom 
parameters here for what 
behavior you want if users don't
 have the app installed or on an
 iPad or if you want to add any 
sort of parameters to it. We'll 
just go ahead and click next and
 you create a dynamic link and 
then it shows up here. Copy the 
URL and put it in the social 
media or blog post. If you want 
to generate links 
programmatically from within 
your app you need this fabulous 
URL that you can copy. If we 
could switch back to the slides.
 Once you've added your Dynamic 
Links either generating them 
programmatically -- there we go.
 Either generating them 
programmatically tr within your 
app or from the Firebase counsel
 you need to receive links in 
your app. I am a Taylor Swift 
fan. This is an example. If you 
receive the URL here and then 
you can extract whatever data 
and parameters and handle that 
link showing the deep link 
content or providing a tailored 
on boardsing experience. We have
 a lot of documentation on our 
doc site. Definitely check that 
out. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: You are 
tailoring their experience with 
swift. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALEX GEBOFF: You got it. In 
sticking with our --
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: It took my 
hours to prepare that joke. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALEX GEBOFF: He was working 
on that for days. 
Here we have Cookbook. A real 
recipe app and they use Remote 
Config and Firebase. With Remote
 Config they created a custom 
welcome and onboarding 
experience for their global 
audience. With smart lock and 
Firebase they reduced sign in 
ins. You can add configuration 
information for your app to the 
Cloud so you can create service 
variables and modify them in the
 Firebase console and modify the
 app without having to redeploy 
it. You can modify the 
experience for segments of your 
users and deploy those updates 
without having to launch an 
update to your app based on the 
analytics. So in cookbooks they 
created these regional welcome 
screens. If you were in Italy 
you would see that Italian 
screen and a shot of Venice. In 
India you would see the Taj 
Mahal. And if you were in the 
United States you would see this
 random bridge somewhere on the 
west coast. What bridge is that 
do you think? What bridge is 
that do you think? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: I think 
it's the Brooklyn bridge. Is 
that the Brooklyn bridge? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALEX GEBOFF: On the best 
coast. So now Laurence will show
 us how to do cool stuff in 
Remote Config. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; LAURENCE MORONEY: I know it's
 the golden gate bridge. I'm 
teasing. If we can switch to the
 laptop again please. I want to 
show an example of an app that 
just shows an example of how 
Cookbook did what they did. 
Using Remote Config you can 
customize somebody's on boarding
 experience and tailor their 
experience. I'll build an app 
which will be like a travel 
concierge if you're traveling to
 different countries. Say I'm in
 China and you launch it, it 
will give me a nice greeting. It
 is very welcoming and very 
Chinese kind of thing. Now what 
happens if I then go to Japan? 
Wouldn't it be neat if I could 
have a 
Japanese onboarding experience. 
If I go to the home screen and I
 go to settings and then in 
settings if I go to general, 
language and region. I was in 
China, I'm now going the get on 
a plane and travel quickly to 
Japan and then continue setting 
any region. Give that a moment. 
All right and now if I go back 
to my home screen, my region is 
set and I launch my application 
and I'm in Japan and suddenly 
the same application has 
changed. The background color is
 pink. It's more of a 
traditional Japanese look and 
feel and instead of saying 
something in Japanese. Very 
simple thing. If you're building
 this for 50 countries or 100 
countries or 200 countries and 
shipping this functionality in 
your app. If this country then 
that. If this country, that 
text. You are maybe having to do
 a lot of things, a lot of the 
processing has to be done at 
startup which would be slowing 
the app from starting up. We 
said what would this look like 
if we do it in Remote Config. 
The neat thing about that is you
 can drive the content off 
analytics so in this case there 
is an analytic for the country 
the user is in. When I set my 
device country to Japan, that 
analytic was being fired and the
 Remote Config was triggered off
 that one. If we can back the 
slides I can show you what that 
would look like. 
Actually first I'll show you the
 code. The code is a case of for
 this application you can see 
there were three dynamic 
elements. The first was the 
image. The second dynamic 
element was the welcome text 
message that changed between 
Japanese and Chinese and then 
the third one the background 
color. 
So here this is just -- NS 
string. So here it's like I'm s
etting up an NS string for the 
URL string and calling itself 
Remote Config and I'm saying get
 the welcome image URL out of 
Remote Config and set the value.
 The URL of the character. 
Loading her image and rendering 
it. The same thing for the w
elcome text message and the page
 color. 
I'm not doing if/when. I'm 
rendering the page for the 
different countries. Remote 
Config, because this is a demo I
 only had two countries. I had 
the Japanese thing for Japan and
 the Chinese one for everybody 
else. Here you would see in 
Remote Config I've set the 
audience user in Japan to be an 
audience of everybody who are in
 Japan N. this case if the user 
in Japan analytic was set 
they're getting the Japan 
message. For everybody else I 
was giving the default value. If
 you have 200 countries that 
you're managing instead of 
writing the code to do that you 
would set this configmation in 
Remote Config and the code you 
maintain is like the top of this
 slide and what would happen was
 that the URL drove the 
character, the text drove the 
text that she was actually 
rendering. So we've seen with a 
little bit of code and a little 
bit of walk around how these 
growth 
technologies have been used by 
real people. For me personally I
 do a lot of auction stuff. A 
lot of the friction of doing an 
auction has been taken away by 
the fact I can save my 
preferences using Personal 
Content Indexing. We saw how 
they were to do that and 
App/Indexing in Android. Then 
for Skyscanner we saw how they 
were able to get their growth 
and grow to where they are using
 App Invites and Dynamic Links 
and Alex showed us really 
nicely, I think, how we were 
able to use the Firebase console
 to generate a dynamic link and 
share it in social media or 
generate them within an 
application. Finally, Cookbook 
who doubled their growth by 
having a simple sign-up and sign
 in and Remote Config for 
onboarding we saw how simple the
 code was to do that. I did it 
in objective C or Android. 
That's it. Those are the three 
partners that we've worked with 
and the partners who have been 
able to achieve growth and we 
hope by showing in a hands-on 
way how they were able to do it 
there is something that 
everybody can learn. Thank you 
very much and hope you enjoy the
 rest of I/O. 
(Applause)

     Well         When come  
       Well    Welcome.  Thank 
you for joining.  Our sesh      
session will be joining         
starting soon.  

     Hell         Hello every 
      everyone.  We're really km
 cited to you have here today.  
I'm Nola      Nolan and the 
product manage        manager 
for identifier            
Firebase. I'm Al    Ali     Ali 
Abdelhadi.  I'm 
identifier            Firebase 
product mon     monitoring.     
were      we're going to talk to
 you about our new tool per     
perform         performance 
monitoring.     So our story 
today starts with Jame.        
   Jane.  Jane is the E. moeb
      mobile com     commerce 
for E start up.  They have spent
 the last six months building 
aur     their an    Android app.
  Now they're finally get     
getting to launch     jien
              Jane knows it is 
important to re    release a 
high qual      quality app if 
she wants happy customer.  We 
did a re    recent au nal       
 analysis of Google        
Google Play store re    reviews 
and we saw five      50% of all 
one star re    reviews mention 
it was bill literally and     
          lit                 
stability and bugs.  The data 
speaks for it    itself F. you 
have          you have a slow 
and crashy app the     your 
oorses        use     users will
 notice.          
saens               Since Jane 
is folk      focus       focused
 on building high qual      
quality 's she is using 
identifier            Firebase. 
 It is going to let her test her
 app on a vau     variety of de-
     devices before launch but 
she     she knows no au    
amounts of testing will cache 
      catch       catchall the 
issues, so it's important she 
mon it toferg her app in pro    
 production after lawn      
launch.    Were         We're 
going to did     do a quick 
review of test      testing and 
crash tools and then Ali is 
going to do a deep dive on 
perform         performance mon 
it        monitoring, which is 
why were      we're all here    
  Now, since perform         
performance is a con     
conflateed term, I want to point
 out that when we say perform
         performance mon it
        monitoring, were 
   we're not talking about 
business per     perform        
 performance tools.  Identifier
          Firebase does have 
business per     perform        
 performance mon it [TORLG], 
                  monitoring, 
like goog      Google an lit
        analytics for identifie
r            Firebase that will 
give you in    insights into 
your revenue, con   conversion 
met     metrics and use     user
 ak    acquisition channels, but
 today were      we're going to 
focus on mon it        
monitoring the code per     
perform         performance and 
speed of your app     
application.        So, let's
     let's take a look at how 
Jane is going to use Firebase to
 en    ensure high qual      
quality app.          Now, the 
first thing Jane needs to do is 
test her app before she puts it 
in the hands of her users of.  B
ut so far Jane has     hasn't 
       has     hasn't had any 
time to write any test scripts 
and she is        she's only 
test owed a few hand sets that 
they have in development.  T
hat's where identifier 
           Firebase test lab 
saves the day.          So, 
Firebase test klab is a 
device        de-               
lab is a de-     device lab 
running on goog      Google 
Cloud that has fist      
physical and virtual de-     
device        devices and Jane 
can choose from a com 
bau         combination of de-
     device        devices OS 
versions and even up to 172 
different language          
languages to test her app with.d
, were    we're continuous
            continuously adding 
new de-     device        
devices,    that are pop     
popular from around the world to
 the test lab.  In fact, today 
you can even get de-vel        
develop         developer 
present         preview O 
running on a pikz      pixel de
-     device in our test klab
      lab.  So,        .  So, 
you're probably thinking that, 
you know, all ak    access to 
all these de-     device        
devices is great, but if you 
don't have any test Scripps
         scripts and Jane 
does      doesn't, then what she
     is she going to do about it
.  That is why we build Robo.  
And, it will au    attempt to 
find crashers and lay     layout
 issues without writing a single
 line of code.      sim     
simply up loads her APK and see 
    select the tikz el         
pikz      pixel an    Android 
de-vel        developer 
present              preview O 
and then Robo is going       
going to go through in 
crawl       crawler application.
  It is     Will record a 
individual            video of 
everything that it does, capture
 screen shots, cap   captures 
the device log, and even stack 
traces for any crash       
crashes it might find.  And, 
this let her san     
sanity        sanity check her 
app     application on a real 
de-     device that she 
does      doesn't have without 
writing any code at all.        
Now, Robo all     also powers 
the present         pre-launch 
report at the play level con    
 console.  Which is avail       
available at no cost to all de-
vl  vel        develop         
developers use     using the 
alpha Beta channels          
channels.    
           Yesterday we launch 
       launched a new feech nur 
identifier            Firebase 
test lab that let's you see 
per     performance matrix for 
all of your test runs.  Wheth
     Whether you're using Robo
      Roboo  or your      your 
own test scripts         scripts
 you can get in    insights into
 CPU, mem   memory, net   
network, and frames per second. 
    .  And, the real      really
 great thing about this feech 
      feature is that the met 
    metric time      timelines 
are synced with the 
individual            video.  
That means if you see a CP    
CPU spike or a drop in frame 
rate, you can click at that 
point in the time      timeline,
 it will seek to         sync to
 that for     portion of the 
individual            video so 
you can kind of dying       
diagnose and see what is 
happening.   it's important to 
note that identifier            
Firebase test lab gives you 
performance in    insights 
before you launch and per     
perform         performance mon 
it        monitoring that we're 
going to talk about for the bulk
 of our discussion today gives 
you in    insights after you 
lawn      launch.      in pro 
    production.          So, 
Jane knows that no au    amount 
of test      testing that she 
does is going to find all of her
 I shall         issues and she 
real      really needs to keeps
       keep a pulse on her app 
in pro duck          production,
 and she's particular           
 particularly interested in find
      finding crash       
crashes and, you   you know, see
   severe issues, so she is
        she's       she is going
 to use crash reporting.        
So, last year at I/O we au    
announced identifier            
Firebase crash report        
reporting and de-vel        
developers love      loved how 
easy it was to get au    alerts 
into new and re    
regress         regressed issues
 and not only that, but stack 
trace       traces to help them 
identify the problem.  Now, when
 we built this product,   , we 
really wanted to help de-     
develop         developers not 
only identify the crash, but all
     also re    reproduce the 
crash.     .  So, we in Tau
        integrated with Google 
an lit        analytics for 
identifier            Firebase, 
so you can see exactly what your
 use     user was doing prior to
 the crash.     .  So, you get 
an    Annie       an event log 
from anything          
everything in    in your an    
analytics prior to the crash to 
see how you can actually rep 
plau          replicate this 
locally.      this year 
were      we're really and     
excite        excited with some 
even big     bigger news.  So,  
      .  So, identifier
                 .  So, Firebase
 has join      joined forces 
with fabric, and were      we're
 working really hard to bring 
the best of both plat      
platforms together.  Were    
We're really excite        
excited about crash lytics from 
fab     fabric because         
because it's the leading crash 
report        reporting tool on 
the     the market used by over 
500     500,000 de-     
developers and we're going to be
 bringing it to the identifier  
          Firebase communicate 
it                community.  
That means you're going to get 
the entire crash lyty ics right 
from the Firebase con     
console.  If your      you're 
thinking about a new tool,   , 
we recommend crash lyticsF. you 
use identifier brash      
            Firebase crash 
report        reporting we will 
up    upgrade that and seem     
 seamlessly time that when we're
 red     ready.   wants       
wants to use the late      
latest and greatest and use 
crash lytics and in    install 
the fab     fabric STK.  Fine 
   Finally Jane wants to 
understand what parts of our    
 her app are slow and why.  T
hese are often the hardest 
problems to diagnose, and even 
hard      harder in pro duck
          production.  So,  
      .  So, she is      she is 
going to use identifier 
           Firebase per     
performance mon 

          All right.  So,  
      .  So, let's get to the 
fun part.  In this demo, we're 
going to see how Jane use     
uses Firebase per
     performance mon 
it                             
Firebase Performance Monitoring 
to pro     progress          
progressively enhance her app 
over the course of a month.     
.  And,         .  In some cases
 Jane is going to use out of the
 box cape bim lit tees      
        bill           
capabilities, like net     
network in    insights and app 
start up    uptime, and in 
others we'll see how she use    
 uses cuss      custom in strew 
men              instrumentation
 to find a solution.     .  And,
         .  And, with that, take
 it au    away Al    Ali..  All 
right.     .  So, we'll     
we'll give it back to Jane in a 
second, but before we do, that 
it is problem         probably a
 good idea to men     mention 
why we build 
identifier            Firebase 
per     perform mons mon     
monitoring.  Quite sim     
simply, the problem we're solvin
g here is the word has a short 
attention span.  We already 
notice                already 
know from from the web the long 
area page lobe      load takes 
the more like      likely for 
use toers bounce.  With mobile 
were      we're seeing this just
 as much, if not     not even 
more a mat     matter of fact, 6
 on   0% of five star review we 
see on play make a men     
mention of speed, de-   divine 
     de-   design or use bill 
lit              usability so we
 know perform         
performance is crit      
critical for app suck           
The other rees      reason we 
were and     excited to build 
perform         performance mon
     monitoring is it turns out 
to be an interest          
interesting problem from a tech
      technical per     
perspective, and one that is 
more chal      challenge 
          challenging than doing
 the same on the web.  With the 
web we have page loads and page 
loads tend to map quite well to 
user ak    action, so any time 
you get a per     performance 
met     metric you kind of have 
a good way of mapping it to what
 the user was doing on your web 
    website.  Mobile, on the 
other hand, is a bit of a black 
box.  So, even if you have 
per     performance met     
metrics, it is     it is a 
difficult job to understand what
 was happening at the time you 
took that met     metric.     , 
that is a challenge for 
ourselves to not only build 
something that gives you a lot 
of data but a lot of date that 
you is    that is context
         contextual.  The result
 was identifier            
Firebase per     perform        
 performance mon 
Firebase Performance Monitoring.
  We were oop are         super 
and     excited to au    
announce it yes     yesterday in
 the keynote, it is avail       
available to efrn in date      
data and au sports I   iOS and 
an    Android.  We want      
wanted to au com        
accomplish a cull of           a
 couple of things.  First of all
 we want           wanted to 
make it a   super sim     simple
 to in    install.  If you are 
on Android you pick      pick up
 the plug in and off you go.  
   .  Even if you do just that, 
you get a   a lot       a lot of
 value out of a box data like 
net     network and app start 
and we'll       we'll see an 
example of that.          But if
 you want to in strew          
instrument things that are 
specific to your I'm plau
          implementation,   , we
 also give you the KPIs that au
    allow       allow you to do 
just that.  And, that is the SDK
.  The other part of perform 
        performance mon it 
[TORLG] is a beaut       
beautiful console that we built 
to au    allow       allow you 
to dig into the I shall         
issues and understand per     
performance met     metrics from
 the point of view of your users
       user     So, going back 
to Jane and the app that she 
builds.     .  And, this really 
Gwen      general         
generalizes to any kind of app 
out     out there.  We think 
that per     perform man I shall
         issues that can impact 
you as de-vel        developer 
fall under one of two buck      
buckets.        The first one 
has to do with your app code 
perform         performance.  
So,        .  So, this is things
 like what kind of de-     
delays your use     users see as
 they enter       interact with 
the app or how much frame drops 
they see in the animations and 
so on.     .    And to mon     
monitor that we build a fooch
       future called trace      
 traces.  The other cat     
category of issues is about net 
    network active
 it           activity between 
your app and the back ends that 
it use     uses, 
whether       whether it is your
 own back end or back ends of 
third part      party as the 
case you have          you have 
in your app.      that, we mon
     monitor net     network 
request         requests     So,
 let's get started with traces 
first.    The ease      easiest 
way to define a trace is it's a 
perform         performance 
report between two points in    
in your app.  So, maeth     
imagine you have a report but
     button and a sfop but     
button in           but         
 stop but     button and in    
in between these two points you 
pick up met     metrics.  So, 
these two points can be anything
 in    in your app.  Anything 
that you care about and anything
 that is worth mon it        
monitoring.  So, it could be 
something like the time between 
the user taps on one of the 
shoes unfill        until they 
see the full product de-     
details page.  It could be as 
fine grain       grained to a 
date      data      database 
fetch to put     put it on the 
screen or kite be as long as a 
full check       checkout flow, 
right.  It could be    be 
between the time the use     
user taps on the check       
checkout icon un    until they 
fully pur     purchase the 
items.  It is real      really 
up to you.  All you need to do 
is cee     create a trace name 
or a trace object, give it a 
name, start it and stop it.  
And, that name you give it 
becomes your con     context.  
    when you're looking at met 
    metrics, you understand what
 was happening in the app at 
that time.      terms of met    
 metrics, by default you got the
 trace der     dur     duration.
     .  So, how much time took 
place between the start and the 
stop.     .  So,        .  So, y
 sen     essentially we can use 
it as a timer but it is ak    
actually more than that because 
you can attach custom met     
metrics use     using our count
       counter API which you see
 an example of here.     , here 
think of any example of count 
able events that are Rel law 
        relevant to your 
perform         performance, how
 many times you call the local 
disk, how many times you call if
 GPS, how many times you drop 
the Graham        frame, how 
many times you made a net       
a network call, and so on on   .
  Any   Any one of these events 
you can give it a name, count it
, in craw       increment it, 
and we'll       we'll tell      
tal     tally up thosey  events 
and re    report them as cuss
      custom metrics au    
attach        attached to your 
trace   is gives you idea on how
 to in strew          instrument
 your      your own trace in 
count          encounters and 
even if you don't do this and 
in    install the STK you get a 
few out of the box traces.  The 
most important one is app start.
  This is between the time the 
app code starts loading and the 
app is re    response          
responsive to the use     user  
   And we also have a trace that
 mon it        monitoring the 
foreground sesh      session, so
 any time the app is au    
available to the user and we do 
the same for the back grund as 
well.  And, that is traces.     
.    Nice and sim     simple.   
 All right.     .  So,        . 
 So, net   network is even more 
sim     simple because you don't
 need to write any codes.  It 
all comes out of the box.  mon
   Monitor HTP and HTPS re    
request         requests, that 
is your app makes, between the 
time they are sent between the 
app until the re    response is 
full      fully re    received. 
 And, when we do,    that, we 
report a mun     bunch of 
met     metrics, including 
response time, including the re
[K*ES]          requests and 
re    response size and success 
rates.  What success here means 
any request that comes back with
 an HTP code that is not a 
four      400 or five      500. 
       And then, for any of 
these met     metrics, net   n
etwork or traces, you have the 
au    ability to slice and 
          slice and dice the    
 date      data by the app ver 
    version, which de-     
device the user was using, which
 kun     country they 
are          they were in and so
 on, and this is real      
really helpful toy  eliminate 
val     valuables and 
under       understand the 
con     contribute            
contributing fact      factors 
for some of these I shall
         issues.     . and     
explain this would be to get 
back to Jane and talk about how 
she used per     performance mon
     monitoring over the course 
of four weeks to get rid of a   
a lot of per     perform        
 performance issues and fix them
 very, very quickly.       we're
 going to do this by mon it 
       monitoring what she does 
on her I   I/O     iOS app.     
.  So, far, the only thing that 
Jane has done is in    installed
 a perform         performance 
mon it        monitoring STK and
 use     used the out of the box
 cape bill lit               
capabilities.  So, she did not 
write any      So, on  on the 
first 
week Jane gives up for the first
 maeth       major re    
release.     .  So,        .  
So, so far she has been build
       building a bun     bunch 
of and peer          
experimental releasees and this 
is the week she re    release
         released ver     
version 1.0 and the e com     
commerce app she works on 
operates in the U.S. and can au 
       Canada.  And we're off to
 a rocky start.     a bun     
bunch of two star reviews and 
the come      complaint that we 
get from you seems to be about 
app start.  Take    Taking 
too     too long.  Some people 
are get     getting frus      
frustrate           frustrated 
and are given       giving up on
 the a, the first thing she does
 is jump      jump into the 
identifier            Firebase 
con     console.  Switch to the 
console, please.  [P-R] fekt
          Per   Perfect.  And, 
she checks out the brand new 
per     perform         
performance section in Firebase.
     .  And, the first thing she
     she sees is dash      
dashboard tab.  So this here 
gives you high level date      
data from both traces and 
network ago greated for the 
                gau gate Ford 
the app.  She hasn't written any
 code so all the date      data 
you see here is out of the box. 
           let's take a look and
 see what we see.        The 
first       First Card here 
gives does most frequent 
race      races.  So, in this 
case the out of the box one     
ones, app in for     foreground 
and back      background and app
 start.  App start has a Mead 
de-     an late      latency or 
dur     duration for more than 
three seconds.  So, that does 
seem to be a bit high.  We'll 
get back to this.  Let's keep 
going. one here shows me the net
     network suck      success 
rate.  We all     always want 
this to be a hundred percent so 
   but when we start seeing 
four      400s and 500s, that 
lines goes down.  I can hover 
over some of these points to see
 what the success rate for an 
individual            individual
 day was like.          Next 
card here is net     network 
late      latency by kun     
country.  Since we only have 
data from the U.    U.S. and can
     Canada, we see that on the 
map.  If I hover over
 it U.S. is about one second, 
can au      Canada is even less 
     less than that, so we're 
good on this one.  Everything is
 one norm      normal range 
      ranges.     e next one 
here is a card that gives me the
 break       breakdown of net 
    network volume base      
based on MIME type.  You can see
 that the blue here is 
represented by images, which 
makes       makes sense.  It is 
    It is an e com     commerce 
app and there       there is a  
 a lot of I'm ma        images 
here.  It makes       makes 
sense that the ma    majority is
 vol     volume I'm ma        
images     The last card here 
shows me a   a couple pair      
Paris                a 
comparison of app start time 
version over version.  Now, this
 is interest          
interesting here because I see 
that V1.0 which is the latest re
    release Jane just put out 
has a much      much higher app 
start duration than the 
pref      previous one     ones.
  So, by the way, what you see 
here is the dark dots      dot 
is the Mead de-          median 
and the then          then the 
light       lighter blue line au
    around it is the range of 
percent         percentiles from
 fifth to 90    95th, and I ak 
shum      ak    actually hover 
over it and see what it looks 
like.  Po          .  So,  -- 
sorry.                     .  
Sorry.    can see that my 
nine      95th percent         
percentile here is about seven 
seconds, have is very, he  very 
high.       Now, this is use    
 useful information, and so far 
this is a strong 
independent             
indication that something went 
wrong in this ver     version, 
built how do I know that there
       there is no other con 
trib          
contribute            
contributing fact      factors? 
 If I actual        actually 
clue on view app start dur     
duration, I get a   a break 
        a breakdown of this 
met     metric by different 
slice       slices, by different
 die men         dimensions.  
So, I see how app start dur     
duration come      compares 
ver     version over version in
    in different die     de-    
 devices, countries and so on.  
This au    allows me to 
under       understand if there 
         if there is anything 
that stands out     Au       
Again, you see the Mead de- 
         median and the percent 
        percentiles au    around
 it.     .  So, I already know 
that V1.0 is much      much 
higher for app start duration.  
    look at de-     device here,
 I can see that the i   iPhone 6
 is a bit hire, but this is and 
    expected.  It is an old     
older de-     device, a little 
bit slower.    let me keep going
 here.  kun   Countries come
      compare         
comparable.  OS is kind of 
come      comparable.  So, is 
care      carrier     At this 
point, Jane knows       knows 
that the top fix the app start 
issue she has to do something 
with V1.0.     .  So, that is 
enough information.           . 
 If we jump      jump back into 
the codes, get the slide, p
lease.  Thank you.  She takes a 
look and real      realizes that
 there is a block       blocking
 call here      here to load a 
bunch of cache I   items.  There
 is no good reason for this to 
be made as a blocking call so 
she switch        switches this 
to an a sync raw          
synchronous dis     dispatch and
 this      that takes care of 
the I shall         issue.  
Cool?  All right.    she patches
 up the fix, release       
releases ver     version 1.1, 
and this is the end of her first
 week.  Now, the second week is 
a prit      pretty interest  
        interesting one.        
  This is the week we and     
expand our operations to in    
India.  Which means new use     
users and new behave        
behavior.  The first thing Jane 
does is jumps back into the con 
    consul        con     
console and she takes a look to 
see how things are.     .  So,  
      .  So, first thing she 
looks at is app start, seems 
like the Mead de-          
median is a bit down.  That is a
 good sign.  If I scroll down 
here I can see that 1.1 has a 
much lower or shorter app start 
than 1.0.     .  So,        .  
So, it Lou, likes we fix     
fixed this I shall         
issue.  This is great news.     
     The bad news is that 
new     now that we have some 
date      data from in de-
        India, it seems like 
net     network late ten 
         latency is very high.  
If I hover over it I see a 7.2 
second Mead      median late 
     latency.  So,        .  So,
 this is definite          
definitely high.     .     how 
do I investigate this?  I'm
   I'm going to go au    ahead 
and click on the net     network
 re    request tab.  When I do 
that, I see a bun     bunch of u
rl pat     patterns, right.  I 
see a call to an lit        
analytics service, I see a bunch
 of back end service         
services for fetching I'm     
images for the product, fetching
 product details, add   adding 
something to the cart and so on.
     . by the way, any time you 
see one [THEFS]         of these
 as ter        asterisks that 
     it means there       there 
is a die     dynamic past 
segment in the ur wlrction.  Wh
at we do                      l.
  What we do is collapse these 
in noo*p the same pattern so 
when you see a met     metric 
you see it on the back dash     
-end funk      function Al
             functionality as 
oppose        opposed to look  
    looking at a bunch of urla s
     For each one [THEFS] 
        of these urls you get a 
response time, suck    success 
rate and how many requests we 
have collect         collected. 
 If you look close       closely
 here, you see that there       
there is a   a couple of warning
 Icons.  One of them is 
come      complaining about late
 ten          latency here.  It 
says that we wreck       
recommend to keep our re    
response time under two seconds,
 and the other one says that my 
suck      success rate is be    
below nine      90%, and this is
 problem mat             
problematic.      fact, I can s
ee that my success rate here is 
87% for the checkout service.  
Now, this is unand   expect 
         unexpected, so I need 
to investigate a little bit more
.  So, I'm going to go au    
ahead and click on the ur lrk, 
and I get a         bun     
bunch of met     metrics.  We 
get the response time, size, the
 suck      success rates.  If I 
click on view more, not only do 
I get a   a break         a 
breakdown of the dye men     
mentions like we saw for the 
trace for the app star trace, 
but I all     also get a card 
here that gives me a   a 
breakdown of four      400 air 
    errors and five      500 air
     errors.     .  So, this way
 I can understand what 
cause       caused the fail     
 failure.     , I can see out of
 my prox      
approximate             
approximately 12% fail      
failures, a very tiny bit is 
four      400 air     errors.  
The ma    majority of the air
     errors are 500s, including 
five      500, 503, 502 and so 
on, and the vast majority of 
those is five      500s.    also
 screw       scroll through 
the     the dye men             
the dimensions to    to see if
    if there is anything that 
stands out.  So, far it seems 
like my suck      success rate 
is prit      pretty evenly dist
rib    trib         distributed.
  You have           .  Uh-huh. 
 But if I look at country, I can
 see that all these failures are
 coming from in    India.  The 
suck      success rate is swre
er        zero.  Okay.  So, this
 gives me a   a lot of 
information.  There is five     
 500 air     errors that I need 
to fix and they're happening 
only in India.      the way, I 
can switch to the over time ver 
    version of this date      
data.  I see the same met     
metrics only by time slice      
 slices, so I see how they 
change        changeover the 
last 30 days.  And,         .  
And, I can see that my five     
 500 errors in blue here spike 
au    around the same time Jane 
re    released her operations to
 in    India.     .  So, that 
con     confirms the theory that
 I had, right.     , if I click 
back to net     network and look
 at the other warning that 
comes       come      complains 
that my late ten          
latency is too low or too high, 
I think that this has also 
something to do with my use     
users from in de-        India, 
because I didn't see this before
.  But the way I can con     
confirm this is by filth       
filtering by the kun     
country.     .  So,        .  
So, here any of the        of 
the dye minute shens that we 
collect you're ak    actually 
able to filter by them.     .  
So, I'm going to go au    ahead 
and choose kun     country, in 
de-      India, and now I see 
the same date      data, only 
filth       filtered by in de- 
       Indian use     users and 
I can see that the image service
 is way, way hire      higher.  
It is about 20 seconds on Mead 
de-          median.  That
       .  That is object        
obviously something we need to 
fix.This is a   a lot of 
information.  We have a couple 
of problems we need to fix here 
so we will switchback to the 
codes.     .  And, Jane takes a 
look at the five      500 aef
     server air     error N. 
this case she real      
realized          realize 
        realizes that she miss
      mishandled the Indian low
     locale tion.  H n*i    indi
 was miss      misspelled, so 
this is an    an easy fix.  This
 is good.  She goes au    ahead 
and fixes that.      for the 
slow re    response time, she 
real      realizes that the way 
she's get     getting I'm     
images for those products is us
ing her own service and the 
ak    actual serve       server 
sits in the U.S.      U.S.  Now,
 this was fine for north 
American use     users, but 
foreign de-an use     users this
 is not going to cut it.     .  
So, what she does is in    
instead use identifier 
           Firebase host 
              Firebase Hosting 
which gives UCN and takes care 
of esh     E cashing for you.  
She goes au    ahead and puts 
the as    assets on the CDM, s
witches the url called the 
identifier            Firebase 
         Firebase Hosting 
service, and that takes care of 
that I shall         issue, and 
she pack      packages up all 
these fix     fixes, re  
releases ver     version 1.2, 
and that is         that's the 
end of week 3.        Now, week 
4 -- sorry.  That was the end of
 week 2.        Now, week 3 
were      we're seeing things s
tart       starting to get bet 
    better.  So, seeing four 
star re    reviews, but there is
 one I shall         issue here.
  There is this in    Indian use
     user, his name is Nitin, 
and he seems to be a bit upset 
that he use     used 50 percent 
or 50 mega      megabytes of his
 data plan on this app.  Keep in
 minds date      data is and    
 expensive in in de-        
India, so there       there is 
something that we can fix about 
this.          So, Jane gets c
on     concerned about this, s
witches back to the con     
console to see if there         
 if there is anything that can 
help her with that, and she real
      realizes that we have this
 card here that gives you a 
breakdown of your net     
network volume by MIME type.  We
 already         already know 
that the break       breakdown 
tells us that the vast ma    
majority or at least the 
majority of our date      data 
is the I'm     images.  And, 
this pat     pattern has     
hasn't change        changed in 
the last few days even     .  I
t's even more, ak  actually.  
    So, at this point she real 
     realize         realizes 
that she has a problem.  All 
these I'm     images she fetches
 in the app, she never stored 
them locally.  She doesn't cache
 them.  This    This is a 
problem for e com     commerce 
apps.  Maim edge that you're a  
 a use       a user in one of 
these apps and want to compare a
 bunch of products your      
you're likely to switch        
switchback and                
switch back and forth from 
the same pages and fetch the 
same I'm     images.  
There     There is no good 
rees      reason to go back to 
CDN to fetch it every time.  So,
 she real      realizes that she
 needs to add that logic.     
let's switch        switchback 
to the codes.  Now the first 
thing that she needs to fig     
figure out is the cache size, 
right.  We will build a cache on
 a local de-     device.  And,  
       .  And, she is      she 
starts by doing something like. 
 This she hard codes the cache 
size to 20 mega      megabytes. 
 Now, this is okay, but there
       there is a problem with 
this.  What if you real      
realize a   a couple days late 
     later that this is not the 
open      optimal cache size and
 it should be 25 mega      
megabytes in    instead.  Now we
 have to redo the same thing, 
you have             you have to
 release a new app ver     
version, wait for people to pick
      pick up the latest app v
ersion.  It is iny  efficient.  
        Instead what she does is
 she use     uses remote con    
 config, which allows you to 
set     set up        set up a 
per ram it            parameter 
in the con     console, you can 
set the val     value for it,   
, ed it it and you can just 
publish it and it gets pick     
 picked up by your app.  So, 
this is a much, much bet     
better way to do it.     .  So, 
she switches to the con     
console, and now were      we're
 use     using remote con     
config in    instead.  We're 
going to add a new per ram it 
           parameter, give eight
 name cache size, and give it a 
value of swreer        zero to 
start with, so as if we don't 
have any cacheing.  We will add 
the per Ma'am it ter.          
         ram it            
parameter and publish the 
changes.      per ram         
parameter is set.  Switching 
back to the code au    again.  
In starred          Instead of 
the hard code      coding, Jane 
change        changes the code 
that [SO*P] that she reads the 
val     value from re    remote 
config.  And that takes care of 
the cache size.  We  We can 
tbeek that there.       
                tweak that there
.     she adds the lodge       
logic to do the cache       
cashing on the de-     device 
and that takes care of the I'm 
plau men              
implementation of the feature it
    itself, but how do I know 
that this is runningy fish      
 efficiently?  I need to mon it 
       monitor this., what Jane 
does is cee     create a custom 
trace in this case.  So,        
.  So, she cee     creates a new
 trace, gives it a maim ith     
I'm     image fetch, she stops 
it before this logic, stops it 
after, then within the cacheing 
lodge       logic it    itself, 
she does a   a couple of things.
  She creates one count       
counter, calls it cache hits and
 this gets in craw         
incremented any time we find the
 I'm     image we're look      
looking for on the local de-    
 device and then she cee     
creates another count       
counter and calls it cache 
miss      Mrs. And this gets in
    incremented any time we 
don't find the I'm     image we 
want on the local device and we 
have      have to go get it from
 the CDM.  Okay?     this takes 
care of the mon     monitoring, 
and this is all the code that 
she needs real      really to 
mon it        monitor this.  So,
        .  So, she goes au    
ahead, pack    packages up the 
late      latest code and ships 
ver     version 1.3     Now, 
week 4 we want to check on 
things, so Jane goes au    ahead
 and jump      jumps back to the
 con     console.  Great.  We 
can see that in de-        India
 is not slow any     anymore, so
 this is fixed.  But since we 
just add     added the brand 
      brand new trace we will go
 au    ahead and click on the 
trace       traces tab.  So, 
here I see the ones that come 
out of the box but I all     
also see the I'm     image 
fetched one which is brand new 
in strew          instrument 
that is traced that Jane add    
 added.     .  So, I will click 
on this, and I get that the 
ratio men     met     metric 
which I always get, but I also 
get the counter here met     
metric        metric.  So, cache
 hits and miss      Mrs. Are 
there, and as we would and     
expect, there     there is no 
cache hits because the cache 
size is zero.     . to re    
remote config and nowed   edits 
the     this val     value.  
Makes it 20 Meg     mega      
megabytes in    instead.  Up  
Updates it.  Public 
     Publishes the changes.     
.  And, she let's a few hours go
 by so that this change is pop 
fow     pow gate towed the 
phones and we have an update on 
per     performance.  And, then 
when she switch        switches 
back, this swreer        zero 
here for cache hits when she re
    refresh         refreshes 
the next time is not a 
swreer        zero any     
anymore.  Were    We're 
start       starting to see c
ache hits.  In fact, if I switch
 to over      over time, I can 
see that my cache hits are going
 up, my cache miss      Mrs. Are
 going down.  So,        .  So, 
this is the direction we want to
 take.      just like that, she 
starts tweak       tweaking the 
val     value of the cache size 
to find the open Tau          
optimal use for     for most of 
her use     users without having
 to ever re    release a new app
 ver     version.     .
    Switchback to the slides, p
lease.     ., people start 
notice        noticing this and 
they notice that the per     
perform         performance is 
getting much bet     better, and
 they start send      sending 
amaze       amazing re    
reviews and Jane is so happy.  
Look at the smile.       Okay.  
   .  So,        .  So, hopeful 
      hopefully by now you get 
an idea of why it's important to
 use perform         performance
 mon it        monitoring and 
the kind of things that you do 
witness.  And, I think one of 
the key add van         
advantage           advantages 
to having something like this is
 that it makes you aware of your
 blind spots.  The kind of 
issues that you have in    in 
your app that you wouldn't 
necessary           necessarily 
and     expect.     .this is 
something that we see with our 
part      partners all the time.
  I'll give you an example.  
This one is base      based out 
of chien       China.  WPS 
office is a pop     popular 
office        Office Pro duckive
 it tee app in aesh      Asia 
and they use identifier 
           Firebase pro form 
man's            form man's mon 
it        monitoring and use    
 using the net     network mon 
it        monitoring feech      
 feature use     realize        
 realizing that      that one of
 they're banners take 2.4 
seconds to load.  They open Tau 
         optimize this by 20% 
and they see an in    increase 
in their click through raesh 
      ratios by 3 to      three 
to five times.  Think about this
 kind of I'm     impact.  All 
they had to do was in    
installed the SDK and they dot 
    got this much in    increase
 in CTRs.      give you another 
example.  Kastko is a check app 
in in doe neesh              
Indonesia, they use perform
         performance mon 
it        monitoring and they 
real      realize the big     
biggest opening is the chat 
window, 1.5 sengd in de-     
devices.  They optimize         
 optimized that then because of 
that they have a much bet     
better use     user and         
So, this au    allows you to do 
things like this, but it also 
opens up the possible          
possible bill               
possibilities for things that 
weren't possible          
possible for     before.    is 
one of my faef      favorite 
exam      examples.  A 
individual            video app 
base      based in turk      
turkey.  Even though they 
haven't been use     using 
perform         performance mon 
it        monitoring for a   a 
long        a long time, they 
already have cuss      custom
        customized treat       
treatments for their use     
users base      based on the 
com     combination of de-     
device and OS level.  This is a 
kind of thing that would have 
been kif cult in the past 
because         but because of 
the deep insights you get in the
 con     console, you can do 
this kind of thing.      there
       there is many other 
examples.  We have been ak    
actually work      working with 
our part      partners from au 
   around the globe, big apps 
and small apps to make sure what
 we have here is use     useful 
and something that is going to 
add val     value to your every 
      every day development.  
        And that is it.     .  
So,        .  So, recapping 
here.  We talk about app qual 
lit          quality today.  We 
talk about why it is so 
important and why we deep      
deeply care      care about it 
in identifier            
Firebase.    talked about the 
test stage of things and how you
 can use test for Android so 
that you can squash these bugs 
before you get out into pro     
production.  We all     also 
talk      talked about how you 
can use crash report        
reporting in pro duck          
production and keep an eye on it
 was bill             stability.
  We shared some and     
exciting news about us joining 
force       forces with crash L
ytics.  Finally we took a deep 
dive on perform         
performance mon it        
monitoring and saw how Jane use 
    used to it turn au         
turnaround other       her app 
and go from two star rating to 
five star rate      ratings.  
   Again, perform       
performance mon     monitoring 
is avail       available as of 
yes ter         yesterday.  
Please check it     Before I let
 you guys go, I have to request,

     .Hello everybody.  
Well    Welcome to your 
present         pre-end of the 
day talk.  It's like 5:30 and 
you have another talk to go to 
after this, but how about we 
just take a second to give a   a
 round of au    applause for 
every       everyone who shows 
up for a   a 5:
30P.   P.M. spauk       talk.  
It is pretty good. 
      Applause. am a fa*ut      
 father two of real      really 
small children, so doing 
anything past 5:30 is tip     
typically craze       crazy, so 
I real      really appreciate 
           appreciate that your 
     you're all rear      here 
     here.          My name is 
David       David East.  I'm a 
front in gau        engineer on 
the Firebase team and by the 
look of the talk, you probably 
thought e  , oh, hey, look 
another web per     performance 
talk where I can learn about 
shipping less code and top     
open Tau          optimizing my 
I'm     images.  Now, while 
those things are all very 
important to do, that is       
that's not what I'm     I'm here
 to talk about today.           
I'm here      here to talk more 
about the behind the 
seebs           the scenes of 
web per     performance.  You 
see, I'm   I'm kind of web 
dech      de-     developer that
 likes to take my files and put 
them on a serve       server and
 not think about much after 
that.  That doesn't mean I don't
 care about per     performance.
  I work really hard to make 
sure all my server code and     
execute as quick       quickly 
as possible and want to make 
sure that my files are real     
 really small so they get tr
ans       transmit          
transmitted really quickly, but 
what I real      really want is 
this f*s but     button.  All I 
have to do is go boop did     
and then all my files go on 
      go on to some au    
awesome per     perform         
performance infrasure           
infrastructure and I don't have 
to think anymore.          And 
that is identifier            
Firebase host               
Firebase Hosting.  Fair base 
hosting is your fast button.  
Identifier ba*is       
            .  Firebase
           .  Firebase Hosting 
gives       gives you the tools 
to max     maximize your page 
load perform         performance
.  So,        .  So, today 
let's       let's talk about sim
 plau          simplifying our 
hosting in    infrastruck 
            infrastructure.     
    So, one of the things that 
identifier            Firebase 
does for you, just like right 
out     out of the box is HTTPS.
  It is 2017, HTTP is is prit  
    pretty much the Stan      
standard now.  If you     you go
 to go to HGD GP to HTTPS, there
     there is two steps to that.
  You first have to go out     
out and get a search and then go
 out and install it.  It is not 
very difficult, but it is 
nothing               it is not 
something I want to do every 
time I de-     deploy a website.
       What I want to do is 
deploy a web     website and 
then have it have HTTPS and not 
think about it.  That is exact
       exactly what identifier  
          Firebase          
Firebase Hosting does for you.  
After you de-     deploy a site 
over and over au    again to 
hosting you start to take this 
for granted, which is cool, 
because that is what we 
want      want you to do.       
   But problem         probably 
the coolest thing Firebase host 
              Firebase Hosting 
does for you out of the box is 
our con     content deliver
         delivery network.     .
  So,        .  So, who here has
 seen or use     used a url like
 this one before?  It's our good
 friend Roboto.     .  So, 
       .  So, this link right 
      right here is from the 
goog      Google font CDM.  And,
         .  And, we tend to not 
think of these as web     
websites.  We tend to think of 
these as files, place hold      
holders for files on a serve 
      server.     .  And, that 
makes       makes sense, because
 this is con     content and 
it's delivered over a   a net 
      a network.          But if
 your      you're not famine 
       familiar with CDNs, you 
might think that net     network
 stands for the in    Internet. 
    .  And, it's not.  It is 
actual        actually a 
different kind of network.     .
  So, this is how the Google 
fonts -- this is what goog      
Google fonts would be if it was 
ont a CDN, or at    at least I 
think it would be.  Wrath 
    Rather than just one -- 
rather than a bunch of serve
       servers we would have one
 or two hoif      serve       
servers and then have some 
device out in    in Europe 
saying hey            saying, 
hey, I need Roboto, and it sends
 a request that goes over the 
at    Atlantic ocean to this 
server.  The serve       server 
goes hey, I have Rob     Roboto,
 let me send that back to you 
after       as fa*rs as I can 
over                     fast as
 I can over the at lant         
atlantic ocean to Europe.      
user says hey, I need Roboto as 
well and maybe they're down the 
street [TRU].  They sent      
send a re    request that goes 
down across the at lan tith 
            Atlantic oh    ocean
 down to the server.  Does 
   Didn't I just send it to some
      someone in    in Europe?  
It doesn't matter.  I will send 
it back as fa*rs as I can.    
problem with this set     set up
 is a   a lot       a lot of 
late ten          latency.  Late
 ten        Latency is how long 
does it take to sends one pack 
     package of information from
 the source to a December au 
nation.     . your      you're 
trying to send one packet from 
san Mark      Fran      Francis 
            San Francisco to New
 York that is about 40 mill law 
         milliseconds.  You 
might be thinking four      40 
mill law          milliseconds 
for a round         a round trip
 doesn't sound too 
    too bad for me.  This is 
lit     litter really your      
your best case saw naer         
 scenario.  This is your      
you're the only person on the 
in    Internet get     send     
 sending packets, you'll get 
this.         San Francis 
               San Francisco to 
LA though is a   a lot better.  
It is 6 mill law          
milliseconds.  Au  Again, this 
isn't real      realistic.  It 
is going -- you're going to have
 a   a lot more late      
latency than this, but 6 mill 
law          milliseconds 
come      compared to homeowner 
          40 mill wlau seconds 
is a huge different           
difference and I would rather 
pay of mill law          
milliseconds for a round        
 a round trip than I would for 
40.        So, the CDN flips the
y  equation.  It says, rather 
than trying to send files as 
fast as we can across the world,
 why don't we just send files as
 fast as we can au    across the
 street.     .in this case we 
have a   a use you are inure 
      in Europe saying, hey, I 
need Roboto, so it sends a re   
 request but it    it you did nt
 go all the way au    across the
 at lan             Atlantic 
ocean, just goes to a 
serve       server in    inure 
      in Europe.  So, a CDN is a
   a network of serve       
servers, and we call these 
serve       servers edge      
edges.         So, what if we 
put more than just fonts or J 
queer       query in a CDN?  
What if we put our in    entire 
web     website in a CDN?  And 
that is identifier            
Firebase date      data coasti
ng.  But Firebase date      data
 coast       coasting you can 
de-     deploy stat      static 
files and will      we'll       
we'll put them no    on a CDN.  
By stat      static, HJML, Java 
crypt       script, and I'm     
images.     et's     let's see 
how this works.     .  So, we 
have a   a user, and   and let's
 say there       they're in 
toek      Tokyo.  This use     
user says all right, I'm   I'm 
going to make a request for an 
as    asset on your website.  I 
don't       I don't know why 
that line is there, but okay.  i
t's going to first stop -- 
let's       let's go back.  It's
 going to first stop not at your
 -- it is going to first stop at
 the local edge, and then this 
edge is going to say, I have 
     I've never seen this 
request before.  Let's call out 
to the identifier            
Firebase host               
Firebase Hosting origin.       
Now, the orth      origin is 
like the HQ of identifier 
           Firebase host 
              Firebase Hosting. 
 It knows where all the edges 
are, it knows where all your 
files are, so it goes it's okay,
 I got this, I know where the 
file is.     .  So, it sends it 
right back to the edge, and then
 the edge, it cache       
cashes        cache       catch 
      catches it and sends it 
back to de-     device.      
let's       let's say another us
e     user in toek      Tokyo
       toek key          Tokyo 
makes a request.  The edge goes 
wait, I got this, I'm going to 
send it right back to the 
device.  So, rather than going 
all the way au    across the 
ocean, all we do is just go 
right au    across the 
street        street.     .  
And, it's amaze       amazing 
the net     network reflect that
 this has, because every single 
user in this area only has to go
 to a local edge server.  They 
get a low late ten          
latency response.          So, 
if you pull up the Chrome dev 
           Chrome Dev Tools and 
this is just a identifier 
           Firebase host 
              Firebase Hosting 
website.  Does    Doesn't matter
 what website because were      
we're going to inspect an 
individual file.  So, were    
we're going to click on the was 
    waterfall of a dock      
document.  And, that's problem
         probably prit      
pretty tien      tiny.     .  
So,        .  So, we can make it
 a little bye     big     
bigger.  We see all these great 
request         requests and 
re    response met     metrics 
about this one file.     .  And,
 we  we can see that it took 
about 7 mill      milliseconds 
to cue, it stalled and knee 
negotiation                  
negotiate           negotiated 
for about       about a 
millisecond and a half, our 
request was sent in a quarter of
 a mill law          
millisecond, that is fast, but 
almost 300 mill      
milliseconds was spent wait     
 waiting.     .  And,         . 
 And, this is known as time to f
irst bite.     , time to first 
byte is kind of one of those 
black box met     metrics, so 
there       there is a   a lot 
of things that can in 
flew         influence it, but 
when it comes to stat      
static hosting, stiem to first
              time to first byte
 is a large fact      factor of 
it is how far you are away from 
the serve       server.  So, if 
you are f- f*urt       further 
au            f*urt          
[-P] are          further au    
away it will take longer for the
 file to get you to.  So,  
      .  So, three     300 mill 
law          milliseconds is 
okay for time to first byte, but
 this re    response, it's not 
come      coming from an edge, 
it's come      coming from 
Firebase host               
Firebase Hosting 's orth      
origin.  And, this is not the 
response that most use     users
 are going to get.  It's near
      nearly all     always 
going to be coming from the edge
.     , we know      know that 
we sent a request.     .  So, 
       .  So, this is    should 
now live in the edge cache.  
   .  So, when I do a hard 
refresh in Chrome, this is now 
my time to first byte.  Instead 
of almost three       300 mill 
law          milliseconds, it is
 five mill law tekdz      
          milliseconds.     .  
And, just as an FYI, it takes 7
   786 mill law          
milliseconds for the        
              mill law          
    86 mill      milliseconds 
for the human eye to blink.  
That is prit      pretty fast   
  What about if your con     
content changes and you go and 
you want to de-loi a          
deploy a new ver     version of 
your web     website or update a
 file?  So, how do we sync      
synchronize to all of these edge
 serve       servers that are  
   our con     content has 
change        changed?     it's 
all baked into deployment.     .
  So, de-   deployment on 
identifier            Firebase 
         Firebase Hosting is 
prit      pretty ease      easy.
  You in    install a CLI.     .
  So, you in    install CLI from
 npm and write Firebase deploy 
in your direct        directory,
 retake your files, upload them 
to the serve       server, and 
then when we de-     deploy them
,   , we all     also take it 
into all the files you de-     
deployed into one au Tom        
Atomic de-     deployment.  And,
 this is kind of like a commit. 
    . the origin says, all right
, we have this new ver     
version, and it tells the cache
       cashes get rid of 
everything you have, purge 
everything, because there       
there is a new version of your 
website red     ready to view.  
   .  So, the next time your 
user goes out to your web     
website, there     they're not 
going to see the old stuff, the
re     they're going the see 
your new version.      amazing 
thing about this is when you 
have these au Tom        Atomic 
de-     deployments if you want 
a roll back, you can view your 
entire deployment history in the
 identifier            Firebase 
console and then just click a   
abut      a button and almost 
instant         instantly role 
     roll back to that version. 
       So, one of the more 
interesting developments in web 
per     performance is with HTTP
/2.  If your      you're not 
famine        familiar, HTTP/2 
is the new Stan      standard of
 HTTP, and that's problem
         probably not that 
helpful.     .  So, to see why 
or see why HTTP/2 is the new 
standard, let's     let's take a
 look at HTTP/1 was          
Right          Right here you 
can see that there       were
      we're making about 30 
requests or so and what you can 
see is this was     waterfall is
 fair      fairly staggered.  
   .  And, that's because when 
we make a re    request with HTT
P we    we can only open up one 
neck      connection per as    
asset.  So,        .  So, we get
 one connection, download one 
asset.     .  So, the browser is
 smart and it says, all right, I
'm going to give you six 
connections so you can do six 
things at a time.  So,        . 
 So, that's why we see kind of 
like some files [STAG]       , 
[STAG]        , stagger, some 
files, [STAG]      stagger.  W
hat I real      really want to 
do is take this and I want to, l
ike, put it together.  I want it
 to be in one line.  I don't 
want to wait to load everything.
          So,   , we use     
used to do this thing called 
doe     domain [SHARD]         s
harding.  The rees      reason 
why is we have six neck      
connections, but there       
they're per doe     domain.  So,
 someone thought hey, what if I 
just have more doe     domains, 
that way I can have more re    
request         requests and    
 in pair      parallel.     the 
thing about doe     domain shar
dins is let's       let's say 
you have four doe     domains, 
and if you have six neck      
connections each, that's like if
 you take the 4, the 2 -- my 
phone.     .  So, 24, 24TCP neck
      connections.  So,        .
  So, with that each TCP 
neck      connection is going to
 in    incur it's      its own 
late ten          latency and 
this is just going to drain your
 user 's batter        battery. 
    .  So, HTTP/2 fix     fixes 
this problem.  With HTTP2 /2 we 
get one neck      connection 
that we can send [ULT] many 
           put     mult      
multiple as    assets on.  Now 
wrath       rather than seeing 
[STAG]        staggered was     
water       waterfall it is now 
in one nice line.      you are 
one     wondering, yes   yes, 
this is 17 different ver     
versions of J queer       query,
 and yes, I need all of them.  
        (Laughter) )o, one of 
the great things about HTTP/2 is
 not just pipe lining.  It also 
gives you tools for per     
performance.    like, if you 
think your web     website is at
 like a 10, well there       
there have            there are 
some things we    we can do to 
crank it up and get it to an 11.
          When you request the 
web     website, you don't 
request all of the as    assets,
 you re    request just the 
documents.     .  And, then the 
dock      document, it has 
receive         references to 
your as    assets.     .  And, 
the browser parse       parses 
it and goes through this dis    
 discover          discovery 
phase and then it niche 8's re
    request         requests
                    nichey
        initiates request
         requests for these as 
   assets.             developer
 of this page.  We need no    
know what as    assets are 
need      needed Y. do we have 
to wake      wait for this round
 tribal              round-trip.
  Why don't we take these files 
and send them down with the or
th      original response?      
    It is a feech       feature 
called HTTP/2 search        serv
e       server push.     .  So, 
a server push we can use link 
headers, and say when you send 
this dock      document, let's 
send all these other assets,    
    Identifier               
Firebase        Firebase 
Hosting,   , we give think 
hire      identifier            
Firebase dot Json file.  You   
If you need to do any redirects,
 any rewrites, or in this case 
set some head      headers.     
.  So, I can say at the source 
of my home route, I want to 
[SPES]        specify these 
headers.     .  So,        .  
So, I'm   I'm going to say give 
me a linked        link header 
and I want to send back -- I 
want to push my main CSS.     . 
 So, now with this file pushed, 
our net     network time      
timeline looks a little 
different.  The niche       
initiate ter for our dock      
document is not -- naesh eight 
tore for our             
             niche       
initiate tore for our documents 
is push/other.  If we click on 
the water       waterfall tab we
 get a whole new set of met     
metrics.  We'll     We'll zoom 
in on.    can see there       
there is nothing about time to 
first byte or net     network.  
It is all about reading the push
.  And, that is       that's 
because why     by the time the 
browse        browser realizes 
it needs this asset, it has 
already been down      
downloaded over the net     
network.  And what this does for
 us is saves us one less round
       round-trip for this asset
.     ., before you start 
thinking that is         that's 
great, I'm   I'm going to push 
everything on my website.  That 
is probably not going to work
         to work out the way you
 want.  Pushing too many things 
is called over push.  And, it 
has some problems.  The first is
 band with.  When you           
           bandwidth.  When you 
push an as    asset you don't 
know what is going on in the 
browse        browser 's cache. 
 The browse        browser has 
some great cacheing cyst      
system.  It keeps us from make 
     making request         
requests from eye     items 
we've recent        recently 
down      download eed.       
            downloaded.  With HT
 2 push we say we are going to 
ig    ignore and that and send 
it every time society a waste of
 band      bandwidth.           
 there is problem         a 
problem with pry or        
priority.  If you go into the 
per     perform man sec     
section of Chrome and hovering 
overall your assets, they will 
give      give you the labels, 
high, high    highest and low.  
Because the browse ser great at 
knowing what the pry     
priority of your assets are, and
 when you push something, you 
tell the browse        browser, 
no, I know what I'm     I'm do
ing, my as    assets are soop 
     super high priority and you
 take these first.     .  And, 
the problem with that is not 
every as    asset is high 
pry     priority.  Like, I'm   
images.  If you push an I'm     
image, which the browser sees as
 a low priority, you're 
problem         probably going 
to make your website slower.  
        So, H2 push is kind of 
like this new world where 
every       everyone is still 
fig     figuring things out.  
There     There is no sol     
solid rules or, like, laws I can
 give you, but there       there
 are two guide       guidelines.
        So, if you're going to 
push something, make sure that 
it's a critic        critical r
en     rendering asset.     .  
So, that's your jauf      
Java      JavaScript that does 
rendering or any CSS.     .  
And,         .  And, if you are 
going to push, make sure that 
you use a service worker to 
cache these as    assets.  
Because that way it's going to 
prevent any future un    
unneed        unneeded pushes in
 the future.        And, any of 
this sounds famine        
familiar to you, it is balm     
 because the palm      Palmer 
team has a whole system on top 
of this called purpose         
purple, and not so coin
cident            
coincidentally, there is 
actually a identifier           
 Firebase          Firebase 
Hosting in purpose pull     
         purpose         purple 
code lab that you should totally
 check       checkout.     So, 
at this point I was showing you 
the CDN.  I've talk      talked 
to you about H   HTT2 and HTT 
serve       server push.  This 
   These are the tools that 
Firebase gives you out of the 
box with just a little bit of 
con     con     config        
configure           
configuration.  But everything 
I've talk      talked to you 
about today is all through the 
lens of stat      static 
hosting.  But sometimes our con 
    content freak       
frequently changes.     .  And, 
then all     also, we might want
 to make your      your own API 
on our doe     domain.  Or, we 
want to get meta tags for face 
     Facebook and twit      
Twitter.     .  And, in that 
case you probably want die     
dynamic host      hosting.     .
die nam       dynamic host      
hosting,   , we can deploy snot
      not just stat      static 
as    assets but server code 
that helps us Gwener        
generate new content per 
request.  This is really pour
      powerful because if our 
date      data is consta
nt          constantly changing 
we can keep our con     content 
change        changing with that
 date      data.   , there 
    there are things you can do 
for die nam         dynamic con
     content with identifier
            Firebase.  There
        .  There is Cloud funk 
     functions.  And, if your
      you're not familiar with 
Cloud funk      functions, it 
au    allows you to run server 
code in re    response to 
identifier            Firebasey 
 events.     .  And, one of them
 is an HTTPS funk      function 
and it says here, take a re    
request, you can has not        
 handle it, and send a response.
   , if you look at this, this 
kind of looks like a dynamic 
host      hosting pro     
provider, dut   but there is 
some problems with it.  The 
first is, this is the url it 
gives you.  Now, like this is a 
tote      totally fine url if 
this is -- if your      you're 
build       building a web hook,
 but it's probably not the url 
you want on your business card. 
    .  And, also, ak    , 
actual        , actually go back
.  ak  All   Also if you look at
 that url it says us-sen   
central 1.  What that means is 
this url -- that this serve
       server is in the sen     
central of the United States.  
   . means is that when we send 
a re    request,   , we can do 
something die     dynamic and 
send that re    response to 
where we were         we were 
back before.  We don't have a C
DN before.  We are send      
sending Roboto to people all 
over the world au    again and 
that is not what we want.  We 
want the best of both worlds.  
We want to be able to die nam
         dynamically Gwen      
generate Don     con     content
 but also want that low 
rate      late      latency r
esponse through CDN.            
yesterday we au    announced 
that now Cloud functions and 
identifier            Firebase 
host               Firebase 
Hosting give you the best of 
these worlds.     .  So, if 
Cloud funk      functions and 
identifier            Firebase 
Hosting you can die     
dynamically create con     
content and then you can store 
that con     content in a CDN.
      what's great is that you 
don't have to use this url, you 
can use a   a de-     default 
Firebase app sub domain, or bet 
    better yet, map your      
your own url.          And the 
most au    amaze       amazing 
part about this future is that 
you get con     control over the
 CDN cache.  You get to tell it 
how long you want to cache your 
die     dynamic con     content.
     .  And, we  we can do that 
through a cache control header. 
    .  So, a cache con     
control header has three parts. 
 The first part is this public
        public part.  And, what 
public        public says is 
that this file is cache able.  
We can cache it on a CDN.       
   The second part is how long 
it will live in the b
rowse        browser cache.     
.  And, this last part, this is 
how we set the CDN.  We can tell
 it that for 600 seconds we want
 it -- we said      set six     
600 seconds before it and     
expires.  This is the     known 
as the time to live or TTL.     
     So, let's     let's see how
 this works.  We got a   a user 
again if toek key          Tokyo
.  The user makes a re    
request to the edge.  The edge 
says, I have never seen this re 
   request before, let's call 
out to identifier            
Firebase          Firebase 
Hosting 's origin.  Origin goes,
 oh, I wreck       recognize 
this.  This matches a Cloud 
function.     .  So, it kicks 
out the Cloud funk      
functions, which runs your 
server code and Gwener        
generates your die     dynamic 
con     content and then seconds
         sends it back to 
identifier            Firebase 
Hosting origin, which then sends
 it back to the edge which now 
cache       cashes this con     
content and then sends it back 
to use     user.     , another 
use     user in the same area 
makes the same request.  Now the
 edge cache goes, wait, I I have
 this and sends it back.     .  
So, we set a TTL of six     600 
seconds.     .  And, four    400
 seconds had gone by, so we had
     hadn't expired from the 
cache.  But now nine      900 
seconds has gone by, so we send 
a re    request, and then the CD
N goes this is and     expired, 
so let's kick out to Firebase
          Firebase Hosting 's 
origin and let's kick out to 
Cloud funk      functions and 
send it all the way back, cache 
it, and then back to the use    
 user.     .  So, that's die 
nam         dynamic con     
content that is being cache 
      cashed back in    in your 
CDN edge.          So, the way 
you set this up with identifier 
           Firebase          
Firebase Hosting is with your 
identifier            Firebase. 
          Firebase.Json file.  
You can testify         
[SPES]        specify it as a re
    rewrite.  You can say 
whenever you see this source or 
route of questions, let's map it
 to this Cloud funk      
function of questions.     .  
And, then we can write our ak   
 actual Cloud funk      function
.  Now, Cloud funk      
functions is ran on no JS, so 
I'm going to be reuse       
reusing ES next on tax but you 
can use whatever flavor of 
jauf      Java      JavaScript 
you like     I'm        I'm 
going to I'm     import from the
 Java base funk      functions 
and then import from Firebase 
admin because I'm     I'm going 
to be read      reading from a 
database, and then now I'm going
 to name my funk      function. 
 I'm going to say export let 
questions.  If your      you're 
use     using common JS you 
would say and     exports dot 
questions, and then now I'll 
tcee eight my               c
ee     create my Cloud function.
      I'll do is go out to my 
date      database and get a 
list of questions.  From here 
I'm going to set the cache con
     control head      header.  
So,        .  So, 600 seconds in
 the CDN cache, and then now I'm
 going to send back a re    
response as HTML with how many I
   items are in my list.     .  
And, then now all I have to do 
is a Firebase de-     deploy.  
And, that means that my stat
      static as    assets will 
go on to identifier            
Firebase hosting and then my 
dynamic serve       server code 
goes on         goes on to Cloud
 funk      functions.          
And that is         that's just 
one route.  How   How do I 
handle mult      multiple routes
?  How   How do I get a more die
 nam         dynamic back end?  
Well, we can write our funk     
 function.  We can say let's I'm
 fort          import from 
Firebase funk      functions 
again from add     admin, but 
now were      we're going to 
import from and     express.  If
 your      you're not familiar 
with and     express, open 
source node framework and it is 
really easy to work with.      
first thing were      we're 
going to do is cee     create an
 and     express app because 
this will au    allow us to au
    attach mult      multiple 
routes.     .  So,        .  So,
 say app.get and say whenever a 
use       a user does a get 
request at high      my home 
route I can has not         
handle the response and send 
this re    request.     .  And, 
now going to attach another 
route.  Going to au    attach my
 questions route that I made 
earlier.  And, then I can just 
get the date      data, set the 
cache con     control head      
header, and then send the 
response.              Lastly, I
 have to name my funk      
function.  So, and   export let.
  I'm going to name it FN.  
Create my Cloud funk      
function, and then now I take my
 and     express app and I just 
pass it through as the per 
ram         parameter.     . 
identifier            Firebase.j
son I need to make a rewhy I.  B
ut   Button                  re 
   rewrite.  In  Instead of 
mapping it to one path I'm     
I'm going to use a star star 
glob which says match all maths 
and then                paths 
and then call the function FN.  
   . what this does is it gives 
us a huge -- a whole host of new
 perform         performance 
improve         improvements.   
  .  So, now we can die     
dynamically ren     render html 
and then we can de-     defer 
all of our jauf      Java      
JavaScript.  So,        .  So, 
we can still get a fast first 
paint but then we can all     
also get our die     dynamic be

 behavior and our app needs.  If
 you are use     using any frame
       frameworks, you can take 
add van         advantage of 
serve       server side ren     
rendering.    frameworks like 
ang you         angular oon     
universal and react, they have 
these first-        first-class 
tools for doing server side ren
     rendering.  So, you can 
take your same kli     client 
side code, pass it through these
 tools and Gwener        
generate out html and then just 
send that down to the browser 
and then the frame       
framework takes over at    after
 that.        Now what is amaze 
      amazing is that were      
we're not asking you to be stat
      static or die nam         
dynamic.  You can be both stat 
     static and die nam         
dynamic.  Because this future is
 more like a slider.  You can be
 --    a lot more stat      
static.  You can set a very high
 T.T.L. or de-     deploy only 
static files.  But if you want 
to be more die nam         
dynamic you just set a lower TTL
 and that way your con     
content will re    regenerate 
faster.          So, die   
dynamic hosting is just another 
tool in the Firebase          
Firebase Hosting tool set     
set.  It's just another tool we 
have to build fast websites on 
an    an easy infrastruck 
            infrastructure.     
     So, if you want to learn 
more, pleasing to the dock

hosting.  There     There is all
     also au    Anna      an 
amazing Cloud function at 9   
9:30 in the morning wreck

ears                Wonderful.  
Thank you all for joining us 
today.  I want to start off by 
giving a little bit of back     
 background on design sprints.  
We started de-     design 
sprints a while back when some 
goog      Googlers got together 
and they want      wanted to and
     experiment with ways to in
    increase klab      
collaboration and in    
innovation for their teams.     
.  And, they did this by take
      taking meth      methods 
from de-     design thinking, 
use   Usury search, business 
strat       
strategies            strategy, 
au  among others, and put     
putting them into different 
orders base      based on their 
chal      challenge and deliver 
        deliverables that they 
were look      looking for and 
they test      tested this and 
proto typed it over      over 
time to come up with a core set 
of meth      methods that really
 yield       yielded the pest 
results for their teams.     .  
And,       In 2000 thinker  
                  In 2013, the 
sprint mass      master au    
academy was founded to train 
goog      Googlers in fau sill  
        facilitating de-     
design sprints using this core 
meth      methodology.  We found
 it to be real      really, real
 Lou e effect        effective, 
so were                    
effect                 really
      reallyy  effective and 
have au    adopt       adopted 
as a   a way of work      
working au    across goog      
Google.          People use the 
term sprint in    in different 
ways in the industry.  I'm   I'm
 sure you guys have all use     
heard it used in different ways.
  At Google we de-     define a 
design sprint as a tool for 
answering a critic        
critical business question.   
  .  And, we do this in five 
phase       phases.  There     
They're under       understand, 
sketch, de-   decide, val law 
      validate and proto       
prototype.     .  And,         .
  And, these phases have been 
order       ordered together to 
support diverge         
divergent and con     converge 
         convergent thinking.  
And, this au    allows us to 
Gwener        generate a broad 
range of solutions for -- 
solutions to our business chal
      challenge and au    allows
 us to proet       proto       
prototype the solutions that we 
think will be most valuable for 
your use     users and test them
 with users.  And, we do this in
 less      less than five days. 
    .  So,        .  So, this is
 real      really fast and in   
 intensive prau      process.  
        Very and     excite 
       excited to get started 
here, and I want      wanted to 
dive in by talk      talking 
about the different types of 
sprints that people are running.
  So,        .  So, tell us 
about the different types of 
sprints you're running for your 
product area and how your      
you're struck        structuring
 your chal      challenge and 
deliverables.     ATNA DESAI: So
 I run a vau     variety of 
sprints and today I talk to    
want to talk about       about a
 couple.  Some are the near term
 sprints that real      really 
folk      focus on product feech
            features, and those 
are very much so for lawn      
launching a product immediate  
         immediately, and then l
onger term sprints that folk 
     focus on vision        
visioning.      short       
short term sprints,   , we Gwen
      generally folk      focus 
on things like, you   you know, 
if you are at a straw teeth 
            strategic cross road
.  For exam p el foor 
goog                     example
 for Google and     express the 
time was de-     decide        
deciding how to expand the 
business national          
nationally, and we were         
we were looking at ways to get 
more use     user      Usury 
ten     tension and folk      
focus in on re    retail cat 
Gore          categories and 
vert I can            verticals 
which we had     hadn't in the 
past.  So,        .  So, in 
looking at the end     kind of 
Mark      market        
marketplace,   , we want      
wanted to place our bets in the 
right vert I can            
vertical, whether it be home 
furn      furnishings, groesh 
     grocery, or even au pair 
        apparel.  So,        .  
So, at that point,   , we had 
run a vau     variety of 
business mod     models and 
real      really mod     modeled
 out the solution from that 
per     perspective.  What we 
needed to com plea          
complement that decision make 
     making prau 
decision-making process was a 
de-     design sprint, and at 
that point when we were      
were at that junk      juncture 
and that in nrek         
inflection point in the business
 was a love      lovely time to 
get every       everyone in the 
room and real      really kind 
of folk      focus in on the 
open      options that we could 
take.     .  And,         .  
And, what that actually look
      looked like in terms of 
deliver         deliverables was
 mocks, proto     prototypes, 
and we were able to kind of line
 those up and decide more 
conscious           consciously 
and thought         thoughtfully
 where we want      wanted to p
lace our bets, and then out     
outline a road map that would 
allow us to get there within a 
year.  So,        .  So, we had 
some con     constraints, but we
 work      worked within those 
and were able to I'd de-eight in
 a very folk      focus it ter 
       iterative manner before 
we de-     decided to real      
really commit to a strat Tau
           strategy.      
follow        follow up on that.
     .  So, I run a number of d
ifferent types of sprints.  
These range from vision sprints,
 so vision about, you   you 
know, where we see a product 
area, perhaps, all   also I 
think what's        what's very 
com     common is product 
features.  We often run sprints 
to get to new product feech 
      features, but also we run 
sprints to define new poll law 
             new policy and all
     also new prau      process 
        processes.  We've even 
done sprints to come      come 
out with different prince       
 principles, and all     also 
look at those, like, moon shoot 
ideas.  And,   you talk      
talked about sprint chal      
challenge and how we struck
        structured that, so a 
sprint chal      challenge is 
really this statement you draw 
up at the be    beginning when 
your      you're planning the 
sprint, and the chal      
challenge really has the dis    
 distinct de-     defined as    
aspects         as    aspect to 
it.  You need to    to know what
 it is you're doing, and that is
 a part that I just talk      
talked about t vision         , 
the vision or the process 
        processor poll law
          policy, sprint that 
your      you're planning 
towards, and then you design 
kind of who is the audience.  
Who are you doing this for or 
who is the par notice           
 participants for and the scope 
of that.  How far out your      
you're thinking.  How long 
you're going to take that.      
talk      talked about 
structuring.  I think 
communicate             
communicating it is real      
really important across the team
 of people your      you're work
      working with.    And then 
you get different deliver 
        deliverables au    
assign        assigned to those 
different types of sprints.   
  .  So,        .  So, you   you
 know, product feech       
features object        obviously
 that's real      really com    
 common, as I said, and there 
      there is a   a lot of 
proto typing, different tools 
use     used for proet       
proto typing and that's a very 
standard way, but we also do 
some fun things with vision s
prints where we've done role 
plays, cee   creating 
individual            videos.  
What else?  So, poll law 
       policy will be, you   you
 know, sort of the first step of
 make      making that text for 
that      the poll      policy. 
 Process might be a   a diagram.
  How you kind of set     set 
up, say, a prau      process for
 checking on privacy or checking
 on secure it           
security.     .  And, main 
shared ideas come      come down
 to role play      plays and 
individual            videos 
again.     Josh    Josh Lovejoy.
     :  It is interest          
interesting going off that point
 of deliver         deliverable 
and scopes.          The thing 
au    across all the sprints I 
found is it is just as important
 to de-     define what is out 
of scope.     .  So, knowing the
 things that are going to be 
sort of route            out of 
reach.  There     There is a 
couple of important one     
pieces.      is helping to de- 
    define those out of scope 
points gives you a bit of I will
        license to sort of re   
 refine the con     
conversation, to folk      focus
 the con     conversation.  
People can go all over the place
 over the course of three or 
four or five-day de-     design 
sprint, and you want to capture 
those idea and have them live 
some      somewhere but all     
also know this that there       
they're going all     always 
lien towards the action nullable
 and tangible not the     to the
 real world not a pie in the    
  I work      worked on a de- 
    design sprint to try to fig 
    figure out the out of box 
    boxing and     experience 
for a hard      hardware 
product, and you can maeth      
 imagine with a hard      
hardware product you can go any 
number of direct        
directions.  You can be like 
from how it gets manufactured to
 how the pack      package 
        packaging ends up at 
your door      doorstep to the 
deliver         delivery mek 
nis         mechanism to the 
opening the box it    itself, 
all the way to the hundred 
tcoo*et         tc*es 
              hundredth use.  We
 wanted to folk      focus into 
the first-time use and opening 
the box and seeing what is 
inside, and in doing that it 
actually gave a lot more con if 
I          confidence from stake
 hold            stakeholders to
 know that were      we're ak   
 actually building towards 
something test able and vaer 
     verifiable.  We weren't 
going to try to trau      
traverse this guy     giant 
land      landscape and cover it
 all, which would have been 
impossible            impossible
 in four      four days.   Thank
 you.  Yeah, that is very 
interest          interesting 
exam      example.        What 
would you say is the most 
important thing to do in 
present         preparing for a 
sprint?   Do I take this one 
again?  So, sprint prep      
preparation.     .  So, fau sill
 law            facilitators are
 have      have a role all the 
way through the prau      
process right from be the       
 the beginning, right past the 
end of the sprint and then make
      making sure that deliver 
[RABS], you   you know, come 
deliverables come to fruition   
  In the planning process, that 
is kind of a   a lot of the time
 a different spribt        
sprint fau sill          
facilitate            
facilitator.  During that time 
there       they're set     
setting up the chal      
challenge like I talked about 
already, and a large part of 
that you,             that, 
though, is make      making sure
 a large       the right people 
are going to be into the room 
and build       building towards
 that first page in the sprint 
that I could talked about      
        talk                   
that Kai talked about is the 
under       understand phase.  I
mportant part of the nd    
under       understand page     
 phase is delivering light      
 lightning talks.  During that 
time I'm     I'm sure many of 
you have been in    engaged in 
de-     design thinking and you
     use post      post 
it         post-it notes to 
write out your how might with, 
which is real      really 
opening up opportunities.  So, 
it's the light       lightning 
talks that really Gwener        
generate all those ideas.     if
 you haven't done real      
really, real    really good 
planning on your light       
lightning talks and who should 
be in the room and who should be
 talk      talking to those, so 
it might be, you   you know, b
usiness development, or it could
 be somebody from league        
legal, or sales       
salespeople who have got great 
delivering and     experience 
with clients.  Set      .  
Setting up that real      
really, really well to make sure
 you got all that what I call 
food for thought to Gwener 
       generate many, many 
opportunities is a really key 
part of the planning phase.     
, I think I can build on that, 
because it's, you   you know, in
 terms of the most important 
thing, I think it is dev     
definite          definitely 
planning.  Planning and then 
more planning.  And, I want to 
I'm fau         emphasize the 
fact that there       there are 
un    unknowns during a sprint. 
    .  So, you have to even plan
 for those.     . that looks 
like is the au    again       
agenda.  How you want to pays
      pace the ak    active it 
          activities, who do you
 want in the room.  And, I would
 say that after the 
planning it's really about p   
the people.     .  And, in terms
 of which dis     disciplines 
you want in the room, which 
person        personal lit
              personalities, b
ecause as is    a sprint master 
or fau sill          
facilitator, you're is he      y
 sen      essentially the Mead 
de-          mediate         
mediator to make sure that the 
best ideas are Gwener        
generated with this group.     .
  So,        .  So, it's kind of
 this ak    active fau 
sill          facilitation that 
will happen, and you need to 
plan for it from the          
from the get-go.     .  So, 
       .  So, it's seed      
seeding the de-     design sp
rint early on with the right 
people and the right plan to 
make sure that you en    ensure 
a plat      platform where 
people can really dream and that
 people feel very open Tau miss 
              optimistic with 
each other and save      
save      save s        safe 
on    to build on each other 's 
active        activities.  That 
was touched on in the how might 
we which you can read about in 
our design print web     
website.  It is really the 
con     concept of open Tau miss
               optimism, right, 
in a post        a post-it note,
 which is while you're list     
 listening to some      someone,
 it is active list      
listening.  And, when that 
person is talking, you your     
 yourself are start       
starting to co-cee        
co-create with them by writing 
down the possible bill 
              possibilities and 
then doing a share out at the 
end.  So, just    it's a really 
lovely sake      sacred space 
for people to dream big.      
    also think it is really 
important to set and peck 
         expectations so 
everyone          everyone knows
 what too and     expect on the 
week of the sprint, as 
well       as well as to au    
align every       everyone on 
the deliver         deliverables
 that will come      come out of
 the sprint, what the fau sill
          fidelity of those 
deliverables will look like, and
 then how are you going to 
follow        follow up on the 
sprint?  What is the planning 
ask the re    resource          
resources           resource 
                 and the re    
resources for after the splint 
so everyone under       
understands and have      has 
the same and peck          
expectation ns   s for the 
sprint It sounds like there is a
   a lot of work that goes into 
this and you have to start 
planning prit      pretty far in
 advance.    a particularly good
 time to sprint or a time when 
you absolutely don't want to 
sprint?     eah.  There     
There is a couple of real      
really good mow     moments in 
the product life psych [WHEL] it
 is really good to run a sprint.
     , one of them is when the 
product is really in it's      
its early stages, and it's just 
like a kernel of an idea.  You 
don't know what it looks like, 
no one is    has truly formed it
 really well in their brains, so
 that is a great time to bring a
 lot       a lot of people co*s 
funk      functional            
functionally and get a lot of 
and     experts in the room and 
kind of spend a few days 
hash      hashing it out and 
come      coming out with a good
 product strat Tau           
strategy, a good, like, vision. 
 Make    Maybe a couple of hi
gh      hypotheses that you want
 to test out.  That is a great 
time to jump      jump on a 
sprint.     . is actual        
actually later on when your 
product is ak    actually 
launched and you have date      
data and some of it is work     
 working real      really well
      well, and then maybe parts
 of it are not.     .  So, for 
exam      example, it is a 
shopping site and the check 
      checkout flow is not work 
     working well      well, y
ou're lose      losing use     
users.  How do we fix this one 
and     experience and this one 
journey, and that is ak    
actually real      really nice. 
 That is the goal con     
contained problem to solve with 
a   the group of people.  You 
can and     expect to have a 
real      really nice solution 
by the end of four or five days 
and you can ak    actual        
actually think klat [RAL]       
rally.  As a group you can think
 of four or five different 
solutions and then die     
diverge and con     converge on 
   on to the
 one     ones that make the most
 sense.     .  So, it's really 
speeds up the prau      process,
    in    instead of doing this 
reg     regular water       
waterfall mod     model where 
you design something, test it 
out, and go back to the drawing 
board.  You do it in pair      
parallel and and     explore a 
bunch of open      options and 
at the end of the week you have 
a real      really good 
solution.          When not to 
sprint ak    actually is really 
interest          interesting.  
   .  So, don't sprint when you 
don't have time,   .  So,  
      .  So, like, you   you 
know, if you see     seen the 
eyes      iceberg exam      
example, like what you see on 
the day of the sprint is 
actual        actually just the 
tip of the eyes      iceberg 
        iceberg, right.  All the
 planning that happens to make a
 sprint a suck      success, 
which is the majority of the 
eyes      iceberg, you can't 
see.  So, it takes a while to 
plan this thing and set it up 
for success, and if you don't 
have      have the time to do 
it, if some      someone says I 
want to sprint next      next 
week, say no, it's not going to 
happen. then also don't do it 
when your team does      doesn't
 have time.  You're in the final
 stage       stages of launch, e
veryone 's head is down trying 
to get something out the door.  
That       .  That is smut      
absolutely the wrong time to try
 to run a sprint, because no one
 is in the right mind      
mind-set to go back to the 
drawing board.  You get a   a 
lot       a lot of resist       
 resistance.    sure you get 
across-funk    functional team 
to -- you can do a sprint with 
designers, but what is the point
, because a   a lot       a lot 
of it is about get     getting 
cross funk      functional con 
sen         consensus and buy 
in.  You want people to co-cee
   create and feel like they 
have owner       ownership in 
the design, and if you can't do 
that you lose something really 
val     valuable from the sprint
 process.         And then last 
     lastly, like I don't 
        I don't know if you guys
 have expense         and serns
           experience           
 experienced this, sometimes you
 have a stake       stakeholder 
who has a solution in their 
brain ask they are like I want 
to run a sprint because I want 
to val law         validate that
 what I have in mind is true, a
nd that is         that's 
also not a good time to run a 
sprint, because sprints are very
 bought        bottom up and you
 have to au    allow the space 
for people to come up with their
 own ideas, and sometimes there 
      they're going to come     
 complete          completely 
defy your and peck          
expectation             
expectations, and that's okay.  
And, if your stake       
stakeholders are not all right 
with that, then you shouldn't 
run a sprint.  
    think the best time to run a
 sprint, and this has come from 
the per     perspective of 
work      working at Google 
which is a very large 
organization with multiple 
organization              
organizations in it is real     
 really when we start an tyul 
        annual planning.  Okay, 
our process is quite rig     
rigger        rigorous and it 
is       it is a good time to 
start at the be    beginning of 
the year or I would even stay
      say at the end of last 
year, the pref      previous 
year, so that you can really get
 run     runway on these ideas. 
 And, then, kind of retien them 
quar      quarter by quarter.  
      So, what this au    allows
 is it au    allows that kind of
 cross poll      pollination of 
ideas very early on in the 
planning stage of the business 
[STRALT] Tau              
strategy          [STRALT] Tau 
             strategy.     .  
So, it is key to get there early
.      other point to make about
 the best time is that it's 
really when the right people are
 in the room and are craving au
    align       alignment.  If  
If there is no shared vision, 
for exam      example for a 
product, and people are just 
kinds       kinds of sum pleeng 
and miss in                    
    stump       stumbling and 
miss in turn              
misinterpret              
misinterpreting the goals, those
 things are good sim     
symptoms to pay au        pay 
attention to in any organiz
ation, and to real      really 
then address it with this 
one     wonder        wonderful 
meth      methodology that can 
stem anywhere from a couple 
hours of get     getting 
together and gaining that au    
alignment or several days.     .
  So, this investment
 and this cuss      custom 
mi           customization can 
happen        happen and that's 
what is really lovely about the 
sprint meth      method that we 
have.  And, the wrong time is 
when you really don't have      
have the right people in the 
room, because it's [ULT]       
ultimately going to lead to a 
product idea that isn't full
      fully flushed out or does 
     doesn't have the right 
stake hold            
stakeholder investment up    up 
front.      So, that kind of up
    up front, you   you know, 
investment is so val     
valuable down the road when your
      you're lawn      launching
 product, and it real      
really saves teams so much time 
in the end.     Josh love 
        Josh Lovejoy:  You bring
 up the point about when teams 
are sort of stuck in the product
 life psych     I have
           I've seen sprints 
un    unstick teams so many 
times because
 the test I like to run is if 
some      someone writes a doc 
about       about a future or a 
product and then the email 
thread that spauns out of that 
doc is long      longer than the
 doc itself, it is problem 
        probably a pretty good 
time to get some people in a 
room and talk     Your         
You're freak       frequently 
dealing with this could go 
gnaw               cognitive dis
oh nans of take      taking a 
bunch of people off line and put
     putting them in a room and 
having them just talk to each 
other for mult      multiple 
days, that's like a ton of 
investment, and were      we're 
going to lose all sorts       
sorts of pro     productive 
it               productivity.  
The secret is ak    actually you
 gain months of pro duck
          productive            
productivity.  If you get people
 from different dis     
disciplines who have different 
per spekt           perspectives
 and different back      
backgrounds who can come      
come together in    in a   a 
line, you save so many different
 psych       cycles, churn and 
back and          back and 
forth.     . re    recent       
 recently had a situation where 
a product that I was involved 
with had some research fund tion
 come                findings 
come      come back that were 
surprise          surprising and
 at odds with our core 
believe         belief cyst     
 systems and we rallied together
 a die     diverse set of folks 
for, like, three hours and came
      came up with just 
presented the re    research, ta
lk    talked through a bun     
bunch of sort of com     common 
themes we were seeing, and by 
the end of that sesh      
session we had product ten     
tenants that now have taken us 
to a      to a point where      
 where were            where 
we're ready to lawn      launch.
     .  And,         .  And, 
that's just crazy amounts ofy 
fish       efficiency gain      
gained.     .ou all mentioned au
    a   across funk      
function          functional 
team and get     getting the 
right people there in the room. 
     you talk about the most 
suck      successful com     
composition of roles for a 
sprint        sprint?  Sounds 
like that is really important.  
    Yes.  I think it was touch 
      touched on early       
earlier, is it    I call it kind
 of the trifek Tau.  You need 
your product manage        
manager, you need your eng 
part      partner and your Ux X 
person in the room.  That said, 
it is de-pen        dependent on
 if chal      challenge.  Often
        .  Oftentimes if were
      we're solving for health 
       health care business 
chal      challenge, I want a 
fist      physician, and if I 
can't get a fist      physician 
in the room, I certain         
certainly want an in    enter 
      interview with a sub      
 subject mat     matter expert. 
   So, these     there are these
 ways in which we    we can 
August        augment the core 
work      working team with 
stake hold            
stakeholder enter       
interviews, sub     subject mat
     matter and per         
expertise, and it really goes 
a   a long        a long way 
because your      you'rey 
sen      essentially cee     
creating this real micro cast 
     chasm of what we call a 
sprint team which isy ven      
eventually prak      practicing 
what it means to be a growth org
, a con     constantly learning 
and evolving organization.  And,
 we do these in these little 
sprint pods, buty sen      
essential           essentially 
it can be au    applied to the 
entire company.  Our tech      
technology is moving fast, were 
   we're all kind of, you   you 
know, moving a mill      million
 miles an hour in terms of
 what were      we're going to 
produce and put out in the 
park      market, so it's really
 our response bill              
 responsibility to get that trif
ek Tau       fekt Tau and the 
right people in the room because
 the odd Yen         audiences 
and global odd     audiences we 
re    relate to with our end 
use     user is so die     
diverse that it is real      
really the own     onus is on 
each of us to make sure that the
 seeds planted and the DNA of 
this, you know, idea that willy 
ven      eventual          
eventually become a product 
living in someone 's life is a 
reflect         reflection of 
society at large.     .  So, you
 want those kinds of cull      
culture         cultural gnaw 
aun says, you want the     the 
dye         the diverse per 
spekt           perspectives, 
and I can't, you   you know, I'm
 fau       emphasize this 
enough        enough, it's so 
important to have that filth
       filter when you start a 
de-     design sprint, because 
it real      really shapes the 
end deliver         deliverable.
  I've seen teams where that 
kind of time      team sinner
        synergy has led to true 
in    innovation, and I think au
 then         authentic team 
spear       spirit, which 
real      really mat     
matters.  We want people 
returning to these sprints, and 
to do them as there       
they're active kind of product 
development prak      practice. 
    .  So,        .  So, it's 
really important that we make 
their time worth       
worthwhile and that they feel 
that they get a lot from it.   
   I'll just add that I have 
       I've had and     
experience bring       bringing 
in    in different sorts of 
people in different roles at 
goog      Google into different 
sprints, so some suck      
success stories I can remember 
were running a sprint for games,
 around games and apps for games
 where I brought in business 
development and they had such a 
different per spekt           
perspective than we heard 
before.     ,   , we hadn't 
involved before.  That    I've 
run sprints on private see and 
secure it           security.  
We dev     definitely brought in
 legal.  We brought in poll 
law          policy.  We all    
 also at that time brought in 
and tern          external ak 
dem        academics into our 
sprint team.     .  So,        .
  So, sometimes thinking even 
wider than the people in    in 
your company where you can do 
that is really important.       
  And, like I said before, teams
 that have the client per spekt
           perspective, you   
you know, often are a   a lot 
better than reading, you   you 
know, dev   definitely bringing 
in news and research, but also 
sales, de-vel      developer re
    relations, different roles 
like that that have such a good 
connection to the end users.  
   Great.     .  So, have any of
 you guys had any experience 
that you considered to be maybe 
a little bit of a failure or 
went off the rails and what     
 what did you do to    to save 
them?
   I've add few.  So,        .  
So, I ran a sprint re    
recent        recently.  I work 
in a group that makes products 
for emerge        emerging 
Mark      markets and I was work
      working with a team that 
real      really wanted to be in
 this one particular            
particular emerging market, and 
I planned the sprint 
perfect         perfectly and 
everything was going really well
 and there       there were a 
bun     bunch of real      real
ly great light       lightning 
talks base      based on strong 
fown      foundation            
foundational re    research and 
what we found ought       out 
was none of that research was 
ak    actually presenting a 
strong user need or a   a user 
problem.     .  And,         .  
And, so, what end     ended up 
happening was over the course of
 that sprint, everyone had a   a
 lot       a lot of great ideas,
 but no one really knew what a 
good idea was, because they 
didn't        didn't know what 
they were solving for.      I've
 been very guilt       guilty of
 this.  Before the sprint runs I
 just like, hey, throw your 
light       lightning talks into
 the slide derk      deck.  As 
long as the lightning talks are 
done, I'm happening           
happy.  And I rare      rarely a
ctually go through them and sin 
that you              
synthesize to understand the 
lightning and the in    inputs 
make      make sense.  So,  
      .  So, my learning was, if
 your inputs aren't great, your 
it    out     outputs aren't 
going to be great.  So,        .
  So, you have        you have 
to make sure that you use your 
in    inputs in a      in a way 
to guide the team to come to 
real      really good solutions.
     .e other situation I've 
face      faced is person       
 personal lit              
personalities.  Sometimes you 
will have a really loud, strong 
voice in the room.  We've all 
been in sprints where 
there       there has been a 
super seen      senior executive
 or someone soop      super 
senior who is very opinionate 
           opinionated and ever
yone else kind of feels kind of 
scared to oppose them or come up
 with their own ideas.  And, th
is is very, like skills as a 
sprint mass      master come 
into play.  You have to kind 
of point to other people and ask
 them to speak.     .  You have 
to keep re    reminding people 
that sprints are very demo      
democrat          democratic.  
And, if one thing is not work
      working for you, because 
sometimes someone will vote for 
an idea and everyone else will 
vote for that same idea, you 
should try to do the note and 
vote meth      method where 
people can write down their 
votes on a piece of paper 
without any     anyone else 
seeing and then you tally them 
up after.         I've also had 
-- as long as there is one 
person in the sprint who is 
convince          convinced that
 their idea is the right one and
 every       everyone else is 
wrong.     .  And,         .  
And, for that, like what I found
 real      really        is 
really suck      successful is 
you just give them the stage.  
If you don't let them speak, it 
is going to keep bub     
bubbling up for days.     .  So,
 just give them the stage, let 
them speak, again remind every
       everyone that this is a 
doe mock craw see, and then you 
    you know after they have 
          they've had their say,
 if still no one au    agrees, 
then it's real      really like,
 there     there is nothing else
 they can do, right.  So, that 
is                   .  So, that
 has been really effect        
effective for me.I like to say 
there       there are no failed 
sprints because you all     
always learn something from a 
sprint.  That being said, there 
is all     always a chance for 
your sprint to go in a different
 direct        direction than 
you plan      planned.  
Sometimes that can be a good 
thing, and sometimes it's really
 important to bring the sprint 
team back to the orth      
original sprint chal      
challenge.       
Occasion        Occasionally 
I've had teams that get really 
and     excite        excited 
and graph fate            
gravitate towards solutions that
 are cool or shiny but don't 
real      really add     address
 the use     user problem in the
 best way, so that is when 
having a present         
pre-define      defined sprint 
chal      challenge is really 
important and having your 
suck      success meth      
metrics and your design prince 
       principles de-     
defined so that you can re    
refer back to them and make sure
 that your      you're really 
add     address         
addressing the problem that you 
set out to add     address
     Another challenge I face is
 keeping everyone in    engaged 
for the full sprint        
sprint.  It's a big chunk of 
time.  I was in one sprint where
 we had a key par no
tice            participant, s
ome    someone who is really 
important to the sprint, leave 
after only two     two hours 
after he dis     discovered that
 we were pretty sear      
serious about our laptops down 
poll law          policy.  He 
said he could only par notice 
           participate in the 
sprint did he could be on his 
laptop the whole time.  So,     
   .  So, we actual        
actually decide        decided 
to do day     daily check ins 
with him, half hour check ins at
 the end of each day to get his 
feedback and make sure that he
    he knew where the sprint was
 going, but that would not enter
       interrupt the flow of all
 the other sprint terse with 
that disstrak          
distraction.     Josh    Josh 
Lovejoy.     :  Yeah, I had one 
early on when I was sort of 
learning the ropes of de-     
design and sprint fau sill law 
             facilitation where 
I bit off way more than I could 
Chu a little bit     
             chew un    
unknowingly.  I signed up to fau
 sill law              
facilitate a sprinlt to re
de-       redesign hiring at 
goog      Google.  soop    Super
, super easy, and it was like 20
 people from all over the 
company with, like, very 
different parts of the company 
represent           represented.
  It was like the second sprint 
I had fau sill law              
facilitated.     , and it kind 
of had all of the things.  It 
had all of the ear marks that I 
should have -- I now know should
 be on the look out for of, like
, a lot of sort of bag     
baggage between different parts 
of the organization, a a lot of 
people with very specific ideas 
to the points that both of you 
have made.        Also when I 
start       started involved in 
the be        get     getting 
involved in the project there 
      there were swreer        
zero UX people so I sought 
December          desperate 
          desperately to find a 
couple of people that could 
bring some de-     design 
thinking to the process.   , 
then we start       started, and
 then things were terrible, and 
it was like time was slipping, 
there     there were so many 
come      competing ideas, there
       .  There     There was 
some      someone person who 
just couldn't get over their own
 ideas and kept bring       
bringing it back to them      
themselves.  Just with the sheer
 size of that group it is almost
 I'm     impossible            
impossible to track down and pay
 au        pay attention to 
every       everyone oops      
's thoughts.  So I had these mow
     moments where like, okay, 
break time, and then I would go 
almost sort of cry in a corner 
and then      so au    around 
the mid-      middle of the 
second days      day I was like 
I'm prit      pretty sure I 
have        I've failed the 
company and everyone is going to
 hate me.  So, I kind of did the
 only thing I thought Kai do 
which was just trust the 
planning that I put into      
into it and I came back and I 
was more -- I was a little bit 
more firm with time, and I 
called time, and I folk      
focused people au    around the 
object        objectives.  I 
also paid a   a lot more 
attention to some of those uns
poke         unspoken signature 
          signals of dem     
democrat          democratic 
thieg       thinking.  To direct
 au    attention to the ways 
that people were au    aligning 
even as this one person was sort
 of disrupt         disrupting 
and derailing.     .  And, in 
some in Stan         instances I
 needed to even kind of take 
that person au    aside and have
 some hard con     conversations
 and I was just like, listen, 
this is oo*et       either going
 to work or it's      its not
         it's not.  
Some            .  Somehow near 
the end of that day we sort of 
found it and there was enough 
vice bill           visibility 
into people 's shared vision of 
what was going to be built that 
we ended up with a pretty amaze
       amazing         amazingly
 suck      successful process 
that right now is going       
being and     experiment 
           experimented with 
across the company, which is 
pretty cool.   Well, sounds like
 you real      really have to 
and     expect the unexpect
          unexpected as a sprint
 master and be ready to pivot 
and trust the prau      process 
is what I hear you guys saying. 
      Out        Outside of the
 standard product development 
process, what are other use 
cases that you've au    applied 
the sprint meth      methodology
 to?
   So, I have      I've done 
quite a few sprints for 
non-profits.  I know Burgan has,
 too.  I've been very patient 
        passionate            
passionately working with 
non-profits for several years, 
and I use     used to do US X 
workshops with them ask after I 
learn       learned the sprint 
meth      methodology I 
start       started doing 
sprints.  That has been very 
effect        effective because 
non-profits have interesting 
chal lane           challenges. 
 Unfort      Unfortunately, they
 don't often have a   a lot of 
budget for US re    resources
           re    X re    
resources so things like de-    
 design thinking and stuff like 
that, they just don't have the 
luck      luxury to 
actual        actually have     
 have the right people to help 
them think through that, but 
having said that, they're actual
        actually super and     
excite        excited to work 
with de-     designers
.  They face some of the same 
organization              
organizational Cal     chal     
 challenges that we haste       
face like getting stake hold 
           stakeholder by    buy
 in, changing things that they 
have           they've done the 
same way that have tried and 
trust       trusted for many, 
many years.  A A lot of times 
they stuck using leg     legacy 
systems that they want to    to 
breakout of.   , it been ak    
actually really great work      
working with them to get, like, 
a con sen         consensus to 
change product direction.     . 
said that, I think if your      
you're running a sprint with a 
non-      non-profit I think it 
is really, real    really 
important to staff them, but   
   with even more such      UX 
design        designers as par 
notice            participants 
than other       otherwise N. my
 km experience, there is not a  
 a lot of nol     knowledge 
about user journeys or sketching
s or flows.  Some of that term
      terminology we kind of 
take for granted now.  There 
    There isn't a   a lot of 
and     experience with that, so
 we need more of a helping hand.
      time I've had more UXers 
on the team, if you split the 
team into groups, each group 
should have a UXer, it's worked 
ou    out really, really well.  
        The other kind of sprint
 I re    recent        recently 
ran, I don't know if any     
anyone has read Jake Napp 's 
Mead de-          media article 
about a brand sprint.  The 
product I'm     I'm work      
working on at Google is ready 
for a re    rebranding.  So I 
spent three hours with key stake
 hold            stakeholders 
just defining the person        
personal lit              
personality of our product, our 
vision for 20 years, who we are,
 what our val     values are.  
And, that was just super great 
for just getting every       
everyone au    aligned.  Get   
Getting all these ab    ab    
abstract know      notions of 
what our brand is into something
 that was really con     
concrete.  So,        .  So, 
when we ak    actually start 
de-     deploying that brand in,
 like, as a low     logo or in 
mark it         marketing,   , 
we have something to point to 
and keep our     ourselves on 
hadest and make                 
honest and make sure were      
we're not off brand.  That was 
something real      really grade
 a number of sprints with 
non-profits as well.  Several 
for Google.organize        org, 
which is goog      Google als
     als fill lan throp 
               philanthropic 
[ARP].  I think one           
          arm.  One of the key 
different           differences 
that I have        I've had with
 non-profit is having use     
users in the sprint.  In one the
 non-      non-profit con     
concern in    international was 
use     using stat tell 
          sat tell          
satellite data to give and show 
Pastor        pastoral list     
 lists in sub saw hair        
Saharan of a                  
sub-Saharan Africa cur     
current veth      vegetation so 
they could under       
understand where good grazing 
land was.  This was becoming a 
problem due to climate change a
nd their graze       grazing 
lands were changing.     .  So, 
       .  So, the program that 
they had was huge      hugely 
suck      successful with a 50% 
reduck        reduction and     
in heard mow          more tal 
lit                   mortality 
and 80 percent adopt       
adoption by local pop     
populations, however         , 
however, the deliver         
delivery cyst      system was 
real      really iny  
effect           ineffective.  T
hey were rint go out maps, paep
    paper maps, and then hand 
delivering those to the local 
pop     population       
challenge was to pro     provide
 these maps on a smart phone.  
So,        .  So, we had goog 
     Google UXers,   , we had PC
I staff, a mapping specialist, 
  , we had local de-vel        
developers, and then we had a 
number of use     users in the 
sprint with us.  And, having the
 users in the sprint was cilt
      critical.  They were able 
to work with the de-vel        
developers to really let -- help
 the de-vel        develop 
        developers understand 
the use     user needs from the 
very out     outset of the 
project.  The UXers were able to
 under       understand the tech
      technology chal      
challenges and opportunity 
            opportunities, and 
just having the use     users as
 co-de-        co-design      
designers in the process was 
real      really important so 
that they own     owned the 
solution and ak    active       
 actively work wed the team to 
de-vel        develop the 
solution.   So it sounds like 
this is a real      really val 
    valuable meth      
methodology that can be au    
applied to a lot       a lot of 
different things.          We 
want      wanted to save a few 
minutes here for questions from 
the odd     audience          
audience, so were      we're 
going to move to questions here.
     .  And, we have mics 
set     set up.      anyone 
would like to come      come up 
ask     and ask a question, our 
panel would be happy to answer 
them.  Or if not, I I have more.
          There          There 
is a micro       microphone 
right up    up front here.      
Audience:  
Hi.  Just are     with re    
regards to re    resources.  
   .  So, you   you know, I I 
deal saw naer          scenario 
you've got your team.  There
     They're going to put aside 
five days.  They're not going 
      going to go any     
anywhere.  In small companies, 
like this never happens, because
 these guys have 17,000 things 
to do and things keep on popping
 up.know you men     mentioned 
the saw naer          scenario 
of the one person, so he left 
and then you     he would do a 
check       checkpoint every 
      every day, but how do you 
kind of organize things to 
happen?  I mean we try to do it,
 but we all     always have chal
 lane           challenges with 
this, so people are off on 
different days because they 
have      have the day-to-
         day-to-day job.   
         Josh Lovejoy:  One of 
the strat Tau           
strategies that my team has take
      taken in dealing with 
stuff like this is to try to spl
it up the phase       phases of 
the sprint into accept        
separate days or to try to run 
certain parts of the ander      
 exercise in pair      parallel.
  It takes a bit more 
communication and is    kind of 
like fau sill          
facilitation in off line sways, 
but there was           there 
                 ways.  There 
was an example where we ran a 
sprint to build a key     kiosk
       kiosk work flow where it 
could go to a spif      specific
 low     location and in    
interact with a product we were 
deal      de-vel        
developing, go through the in   
 environment and then be return 
       returned with something, 
and so work      working in the 
machine in    Intel       
intelligence base you don't all
     always have      have the 
models tote      totally red    
 ready       ready to go and you
 need to do a little bit of fake
      faking and smokes and 
mere      mirrors.  So,        .
  So, what we do is we would set
 something up where the -- our 
use     users, our test sub 
      subjects would go out 
up    up front and do some of 
this stuff.  We get their 
con     content,   , we would 
then go and do a little bit of 
sort of whiz      wizard of 
          Wizard of Oz behind 
the curt      curtain, and then 
come      come back and all of 
us get back together.     .  So,
 we could do this sort of val 
law         validation and 
proet       proto typing in a 
not tote      totally perfectly 
Lynn      linear process.     . 
you can take      find ways to 
take that full five phase and 
figure out where you can stage 
it such that you can cull      
come      come back at open 
for          opportune moments 
or even do more work in the mid-
      middle it can be real     
 really effect        effective.
     . an and     extreme open 
paw          opposite au    
approach in the current work 
that I'm     I'm dg on search 
and au    assist, and we real
      realized that people are 
and     extremely busy, and we 
said just, you   you know, i
nstead of five days, set aside 
one day.     .  And, 
were            .  And, we're 
going to do this really intense 
        intensively.     .  And,
 it's work      worked.     , 
only because after that one day,
 there     there is a very clear
 plan about what the core team 
will do au    according to their
 xed     schedules and when 
there will be a kind in.  And, 
that kind of gives own     
ownership to the team in a 
different way, but there       
there is this lovely kind of 
collaboration mow     moment at 
the be    very beginning.       
   So, we all     also play with
 it.  People are very busy and 
people think different          
 differently.  So,        .  So,
 it gives them that in    
intense con ven     sen         
concentration individual 
           individually, but 
then it kind of have that group 
dynamic as well.      think when
 you start with those short 
      shorter sprints and then 
prove the suck      success of a
 sprint then you can work-up 
        work up to the long     
 longer once with the bigger 
chal      challenges.      
  Audience.     :  Thanks.   A
udience.     :  Hi.  I was 
wondering how you select good 
enter       interview 
canned        candidates when 
your -- the problem you are 
solving may not be known when 
you start off the sprint?  We 
had several enter       
interview canned        
candidates who turn      turned 
out to be less than I   I deal 
       I   eye     ideal because
 our niche       initial au    
assumptions about the proto
       prototype turned out to 
be in    incorrect.     .     
talking about light       
lightning talks or for --  Josh 
     Josh Lovejoy:  The val law
         validation phase.
question was how much          
how do you pick the right people
 for your user stud      
studies?      Odd     Audience. 
    :  Yes.Okay.  So,  -- and 
your      you're saying your 
proet       Odd     Audience.   
  :  Well    Well, what we 
niche       initially maim ened 
          maeth       imagined 
we would be build       building
 tushed out to be in    
incorrect.  We end     ended up 
building another proto       
prototype.     osh love 
        Josh Lovejoy:  There 
    There is a little bit of 
that use     
using that as a force       
forcing funk      function as 
much as possible          
possible.  As a   a way to look 
at the re    require         
requirements that need to go 
into the proet       proto      
 prototype it    itself, that is
       that's one hack.  It is a
 real      really tough       
tough situation to contend with 
when you sort of are build      
 building around one particular 
           particular kind of 
use     user goal and maybe you 
end up going a little bit side  
    You all     also can change 
the format of the re    research
 meth      methodology to be a 
bit more of kind of a could go 
gnaw               cognitive 
walk      walk-through and sort 
of a high level con     concept 
eval      evaluation rather than
 something that is more folk 
     focus       focused around 
use bill lit              
usability.     We'll     We'll 
go on       go on to the next 
question.Odd   Audience:  I have
 two.  One, what do you see as a
 health        healthy cadence 
for a team doing design sprints,
 and who     two, how does 
Google train sprint mass      
masters and fau sill law 
             facilitators?      
a            There       Those 
are great questions.  Weave 
    We've problem         
probably got different and     
experiences across the pan     
panel for the first one, and it 
really really difs across Google
 as well.  So,        .  So, we 
have some teams at Google that 
are not yet brought into      
into it just like the first 
person was asking, you know, how
 do you [SPUT] au    aside t
hat            au           put 
au    aside that time and there 
is a   a lot of push      
pushback to spend time doing 
sprints.  We do all the tech 
     techniques that we talk 
     talked about, and we 
all     also, like, look retro 
      retrospect            
retrospective               
retrospectively.  Just like 
what      what was said before, 
you can save months of 
development time.     .  So, if 
you can build up that evidence, 
  , we all     also take 
evidence from group to group.  
But, yeah.     .  So, I don't 
know.  Anything else?  
 I think you're right.  It 
depends on your team and how 
mature they are with sprints.
