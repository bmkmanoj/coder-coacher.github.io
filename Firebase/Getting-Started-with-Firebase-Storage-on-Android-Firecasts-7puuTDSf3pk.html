cast
I'm Doug Stevenson and this time I'm
going to show you how to use firebase
storage to upload an image file from an
app and get a web URL you can use to
download it
firebase storage is a robust secure and
scalable solution for storing files
associated with your app in order to get
started with it you'll need to get the
firebase SDK integrated into your app if
you haven't done that yet go check out
this other video first where I'll walk
you through the creation of a new
project and remember that the latest
version of the firebase SDK is at the
time of this recording is nine point six
point one okay I already have an app set
up here so I'm going to use that to work
with firebase storage let's see what
that app looks like the app draws a
firebase logo on a light blue background
then when I type the text into this edit
text widget it overlays that text over
the image kind of like a meme and
there's an upload button here which
doesn't seem to do anything at the
moment so what we're going to do here is
make this button upload the image on
screen to firebase storage before we get
started you should know that firebase
storage is meant to work with firebase
authentication typically you only want
people logged into your app to upload
files this prevents random people from
dumping things into your project storage
bucket but to make this video short and
sweet I'm going to skip the
authentication step and get straight to
the uploads to do that I'm going to have
to change the default security role so
that writing to my project storage
bucket doesn't require authentication in
the firebase console for my project I'm
going to select storage on the left this
shows me my initially empty storage
bucket I'll switch to the rules tab
which shows me the default rules for new
projects these rules restrict reading
and writing to only authenticated users
you don't have to understand rules right
now but I'll show you how to disable
them so you can experiment with reading
and writing without having to use
authentication but before I do that you
need to know this what I'm about to tell
you isn't safe for your app all the time
this is for development only and when
you're done experimenting with storage
you want to enable the security rules
again and eventually use firebase
authentication to make sure only
authenticated users can write to your
storage bucket okay
to the console so the quickest way to
disable the security roles is to simply
change the read and write condition for
the entire bucket to true also comment
out the remainder of the line to remind
me what was there before
after I push the publish button here
I'll be able to test writing to my
bucket without authentication now in
Android studio the first thing I'll need
to do is add the firebase Storage
compile dependency to my apps build
Gradle the latest version right now is
nine point six point one this gives us
access to the firebase storage client
API ok let's take a look at the source
code for this apps activity there's
already code in oncreate that finds and
initializes the views and my activities
view hierarchy also I've already got a
click handler for the upload button in
that handler I'm using androids API s to
get a bitmap of the view containing the
image to upload then I'm compressing
that image bitmap to PNG format and
finally I've got the raw pixels of the
image in a byte array so what I'd like
to do here is also upload that image to
firebase storage so I'll show you how to
do that the first thing to add is a
reference to the firebase storage
singleton instance I'll store that at a
private member variable me the top of
the class next I need to figure out the
full path name of the image file to
store in my project storage bucket I'm
going to store these images in a
directory called fire memes and the name
of the file will be unique by using a
random UUID and as is typical for files
in PNG format I'll add the file
extension PNG after I have a path name
I'll get a storage reference to that
path using the storage API this storage
reference object is my main hook into
dealing with this image on firebase
storage I'll use it to upload the image
to my project storage bucket at the path
I've given I'll do one other thing as
well I'll attach a piece of custom
metadata to the image by using this
builder provided by the SDK I'll call
this field text and it will contain the
text that's overlaid on the logo with
these two objects in hand I can kick off
an upload simply by calling the put
bytes method on the storage reference
and pass it the byte array to upload and
the
metadata to go with it this method
returns an object called an upload task
which lets you monitor the status of the
transfer at this point we actually don't
have to read any more code the firebase
storage SDK will handle the upload just
fine
however we probably want to let the user
of the app know when the upload is
complete so we'll use the upload task
object for that and display a progress
spinner to indicate that the upload is
in progress let's take a look at that
this app already has a progress bar
widget styled to look like a spinner
that's initially hidden below the upload
button as you can see here so in my
upload button click handler I'll add a
line of code to make that visible when
the upload starts I'll also disable the
upload button to prevent the user from
uploading again right away to know when
the upload finishes I'll need to
register a success listener with the
upload task I'll have Android studio
generate most of that for me
notice that I'm passing the activity
instance as the first argument this
scopes the listener to the activity
instance so the listener won't remain
attached if the activity stops before
the upload is complete this is important
to prevent leaking of your activity
object to learn more about the tasks API
that you'll use with firebase you can
check out the documentation here and
there's also a more detailed blog series
that starts here now when the upload
task does complete the unsuccess
callback will execute and get passed a
task snapshot object that describes the
results in the success callback I'll
hide the progress bar and enable the
upload button again one final thing I'll
do here is get the download URL from the
task snapshot and show that in a hidden
text view which I'll make visible the
download URL is an HTTP type URL that
can be used to download the image and
we'll see that work in a little bit ok
let's give this app a run and see how it
goes I'll type in my text then click the
upload button and we get some feedback
that the upload is happening then when
it's done I see the full download URL
that anyone can use to view the image if
I click it here in the emulator it'll
launch a web browser app and that will
download and
the image now if I go back to the
firebase console and refresh the storage
page you can now see the fire memes
directory and inside that is the image I
just uploaded on the right we can see
some information about the file because
the file ended in PNG its content type
was assumed and in the other metadata
section we see the custom metadata
containing the text I typed in the file
location section it will show me the
exact same download URL
I clicked in the app if for some reason
I don't want this file to have a public
download URL I can revoke the token
associated with the link with the revoke
button this will stop that URL from ever
working again I can also add a whole new
download URL by clicking create new
download URL alright those are the
basics for using firebase storage to
upload a file and make use of its
download URL to access its contents
there's a whole lot more to learn about
firebase storage so read through the
documentation right here be sure to
learn about uploading data from an input
stream downloading files the leading
files managing ongoing uploads and
downloads and how to handle errors from
any of those tasks oh and don't forget
to learn more about security and
validation rules to protect your storage
in particular as an Android developer
you should pay special attention to
handling activity lifecycle changes
during an upload or download the SDK
gives you a way to reattach to an
ongoing upload and download tasks so you
you I can pick up where it left off if
your activity is interrupted for any
reason and that's all we have time for
in this fire cast why don't you give
firebase storage a try let me know how
it works for you you can use the
comments below or you can message me
directly at coding Doug on Twitter see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
