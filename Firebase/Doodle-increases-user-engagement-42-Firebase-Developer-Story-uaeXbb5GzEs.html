to collaborate and socialize and we do
that by making scheduling really
effortless and fast just kind of
limiting with food you only need to
think about possible dates we create a
link and the pull out of that and your
friends answer and the one date that
will get the most votes will be the date
your meeting or event will happen that's
it we decided to make a redesign some
time ago because we felt that we could
make doodle even easier than it was
before during the redesign we we first
focus on app stability because no one
would want to use a buggy app with the
nice user interface so we hadn't really
ambitious goal we wanted to bring the
crash free user race it's close to
hundred percent as possible tragedy has
saved us read a lot of time by just
surfacing crashes and helping us to
pinpoint with the root cause it also
helps us to prioritize you see how many
users are affected and then can just fix
the crash with the most users in yet
after the app stability we focused on
the actual implementation of the
redesign the firebase remote config give
us the confidence in our changes the
team had a lot of great ideas about how
onboarding flow can be improved but the
problem was we didn't know which one is
the right one we built for different
onboarding flows and we want to see
which one would work better in the
remote config interface during the test
you can see all the statistic about how
the test is going and how the different
variations are showing itself for
example with one of the creation flows
over 42 percent more poles were created
this indicates a measure increase in our
most important user engagement metric
since the redesign our numbers are way
higher our daily active users are up by
15 percent and also our retention list
is way higher than before we're really
excited about crashlytics being
integrated in in the firebase toolset
also with the outlook that we are
working on new and
writing apps it makes it really much
much easier for our developers to have
all of the data and all of the tools in
one place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
