queering function and used oh my god hi
everyone welcome to the third lesson in
the firebase database for sequel
developer's series and in this lesson
i'm going to teach you all about the
basics of querying in the real time
database but before I begin I'm going to
be upfront with you if you're coming
from a sequel database you're going to
notice a drop off in querying
functionality in know sequel databases
like the firebase database so when
you're building an application that's
backed by a sequel database to get data
from the database to the view you're
going to write a query that joins data
from all these different tables puts it
into a subset of data and then puts that
right back to the view now when you're
building an application that's backed by
a no sequel database you tend to
structure your data after your views so
all you have to do is simply go read the
data and it has all of the needed parts
already available organized in the
database you take that and you put it
right back into the view so even if
there isn't you know as much powerful as
querying and no sequel databases you
tend to not need it because you can just
structure your data properly but still
it's really important to know how to
query so let's dive into the laptop and
learn the basics of querying in the real
time database so in sequel the basics of
querying involves two steps first you
select columns from your table and then
second you restrict using the where
clause in the firebase database the
basics of querying also follows two
steps first you create a reference to
the parent key and then second you use
an ordering function and then optionally
you can also use a query function for
more advanced restricting this example
query retrieves the first ten events the
ordering function is ordered by key and
the querying function is limit to first
and there are actually four different
ordering functions that you can use the
first is ordered by key using order by
key allows you to query based upon the
child keys which are always string based
and you've seen in the previous videos
that these child keys are similar to
primary keys in sequel databases and you
would use order by key if you're doing
any limiting or if you're doing some
basic paging the second is order by
child and this is usually what you want
this is very similar to using a where
clause by saying order by child you can
specify a child property like name or
age and then you can query based upon
those values so you can actually say
something like order by child name and
then dot equal to whatever name you're
looking for then there's order by value
where all the children are ordered by
you know their values and this works
really well if you're dealing with
numeric values and you need them to be
ordered by their numeric value and
lastly there is order by priority and
I'm not going to get into this because
this is sort of the old way of doing
things so anything that you can achieve
with order by priority you should really
be doing with order by child now once
you've picked your ordering function
you're able to use one of the more
advanced query functions to further
restrict your data and the query
functions you can use are start at and
that's equal to limit to first and limit
to last start and end at is how you
create a range query you can start at a
value or a key and then move until you
hit this ending value equal to is like
your where clause you can order by a
child of name then say dot equal to and
you know it's the name you're looking
for limit to first and limit to last
is how you do limiting so limit to first
would be like saying select these top 10
rows and limit the last to be like
saying select these bottom 10 or
whatever number you need rows the great
thing about these querying functions is
that you can use them all in combination
with one another this sequel query right
here will return the first event whose
name is firebase Meetup
so let's take a look at how you would do
this with the firebase database first we
get the database object and then we're
going to create a reference to the
parent key which is events and it's at
this point that we can begin our query
so to begin our query we're going to
order by child and specify the name
property then make sure that we're using
the equal to query
in function and say the name is equal to
firebase Meetup and then lastly we will
say limit to first and specify one so we
get the first event that comes back so
basically getting the events reference
is like your Select statement and then
ordering by child and saying equal to is
like your where statement and then the
limit is like your a limit to first
method so that's the basics of querying

with all of our content and make sure
you stay tuned to the next lesson where
we're going to take a look at eight
different sequel queries and then
convert them one by one to firebase
queries so that's all and I will see you
in the next
