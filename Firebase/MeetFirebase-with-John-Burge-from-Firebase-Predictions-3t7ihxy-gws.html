Doug Stephenson I'm a developer advocate
with the firebase team thank you for
tuning in to meet firebase and we've
come off pretty fresh from the firebase
summit in Amsterdam a lot of great
product announcements there and I'm
super excited to have one person who
worked very hard on one of the new
releases his name is Jon Burge Jon
thanks for joining me on the show yeah
thank you so what was your big
announcement from the firebase summit so
our announcement was for a product
called firebase predictions which is a
tool that allows developers to kind of
understand what users are doing in their
apps so that they can kind of custom
tailor the experience in their app for
those users for instance if users about
to turn out of your app you might want
to treat them a little bit differently
maybe entice them to stay give them a
special offer or something like that
okay something that you could
necessarily do to everybody but you
might want to do to you know just the
people that are gonna leave so you can
try to keep them around a little bit so
you have a way to target these users who
you think who the product thinks is are
about to leave the app so you could use
firebase cloud messaging or something
like that to send a notification yeah
one of the yeah one of the great things
about firebase is that you know we're
just a small part of it there's a lot of
other tools firebase remote config and
firebase notifications kind of being the
two most important for this but you can
take our predictions that we make and
firebase predictions and then target
people with remote config to tailor the
use of your of your app in a particular
way I see okay so it's deeply integrated
with the other kind of firebase kind of
tools which is which is what's really so
great about firebase so with remote
config you can change the look and feel
and behavior of your app to suit these
special segments yeah I mean you could
you could change your app arbitrarily
you know if you have a game or you
killed zombies for instance you could
make zombies ten times harder to kill
for some set of population if you wanted
to yeah users might not like that they
might particular actually had a talk at
the firebase somewhat about how to use
remote config in your games and you can
sort of like tweak some of the physics
in some cases right and that can have
interesting results right we have to
definitely practice on development not
on your users unless you and unless
you're really risky well sure yeah but
I'll ask you a little bit more about
predictions in a bit
at first I think there's one thing you
love to talk about maybe even more than
work yeah it's that there's lots of
things I like to talk about more than
work I think um but I think one of the
things that's kind of kept my interest
like my entire life is I've always
really been an avid gamer and it kind of
doesn't matter what kind of games you're
talking about it could be board games
computer games sports I played
volleyball I still play volleyball
pretty regularly so I there's just
something about solving the puzzles that
exist inside of games that I find very
appealing so I've been a gamer my entire
life you grew up playing games right oh
absolutely yeah when I was a little kid
you know uh and I'd be sick at school
and then I'd go to my grandparents house
my grandparents had one of those old
Ataris with the little plastic kind of
joysticks and I would just love playing
on on that that Atari and I would play
games all the time when I was over there
and I waited to ride Atari 2600 that's
that's this controller everyone knows
I'm a retro gamer because I have the
shirt that's how you know that I am
interested I can still feel that
joystick there's a particular way that
last weeks yeah good times
another hobby of yours that I know is
painting so I'm curious how you got into
that so painting I got into really
recently actually um maybe about a year
ago or so we had an off site so you know
teams here at Google would like to go on
off sites together as like team-building
events and you know they're a lot of fun
this was up to Lake Tahoe and there was
a host of activities that you could do
maybe ten different activities and one
of them was painting and I'd never
really painted before but I said yeah
I'll give this a try we went and painted
and I painted some mountains in a little
lake and I I had kind of lucked into
getting the shading right on one of the
mountains and it and it kind of popped
it kind of looked like it was in 3d like
it was it was really it was a luck
you think you say it was luck it was a
lot well it was luck because I because I
the instructor that was telling us how
to paint everything he wasn't telling us
to do this I just you know I'd seen kind
of the Bob Ross videos before and other
videos of people painting and and I was
a little bored so I kind of mixed I'd
blue and I mixed a little wide into it
and I made a little light area and I had
black and I mixed into the blue to make
a dark area and it worked and I didn't
know what I was doing but but
it looked kind of real to me really kind
of blew me away and then months went by
after that we actually have that picture
yeah if you want to show us that yes
this was this is your first one right
yeah this was my first kind of painting
that I did you can see that it's not
like it's gonna be you know like a
Picasso quality anytime soon but it was
this actual mountain here on this side
where I kind of had like the edge of the
mountain kind of curved and it just
looked it looked real look better than
the other mountains that I had done and
I mean my bridge I mean my little my
little thing here it looks horrible of
course the perspectives all wrong and my
clouds look like these floating cotton
balls but this this painting was enough
to kind of say hey wow this is something
that I could do and if I practiced I
could I could actually get better at it
so you got hooked yeah and you have we
have like others recently so this is
like an acrylic one that I did and I was
just following along with Bob Ross I
really I'm he's the guy who does all the
happy stuff he's the one happy little
tree the guy is amazing but the
technique that he came up with and I and
I think his predecessors came up with
really allows you in a short amount of
time to create a painting that's
actually pretty reasonable this was me
before I realized he used oil paints I
thought he used acrylics like all
beginners tend to this was an acrylic
painting that I did and you can see that
it's gotten a little bit better from my
last one but I think we have yeah why
don't we just go to this one right here
this right here is what I consider one
of my best it's one of my most recent
and you can see here I'll hold up hold
up my original one at the same time and
you can see that the difference and my
abilities yeah so it's really it's
really pretty exciting to go from
something like this in a relatively
short amount of time to something like
this I really like this gang this one up
like that's good yeah yeah and one
interesting thing is I don't know how
well it shows in the cameras but the the
grass and stuff here is kind of blue it
was supposed to be silver but I don't
really know how to mix colors very well
and as I was painting the grass that was
supposed to be kind of like covered in
snow a little bit it came out blue and I
ended up really liking it and it felt
like I was like painting an alien like a
fantasy landscape yeah yeah exactly and
this is one more this is your most
recent one this was actually the one
that I just showed my most recent this
was this was my second most recent one
and some people say that this one is
their favorite of the ones that I've
done the setting is actually really
quite nice in this women it's got a good
balance to it you know I'm a computer
scientist and a software engineer and
you don't have background in machine
learning and a lot of things that you do
as an engineer and a researcher are
following these rules to create
something painting has a really strong
similarity to that
some people of course they're gonna have
natural gift for this but painting this
is just rule so you know oil paints you
just follow a set of rules to have a
desired outcome and I wish I would have
appreciated this more when I was younger
I'd be much further along in my ability
to paint but yeah super excited about
painting I try to paint something every
week if I can and there's more
connections between art and computer
science well art and program that goes
into games right you think that there's
art in games yeah absolutely consider
games to be an art form you know back
when when I played games as a teenager
and even younger I think I got my first
computer and when I was around ten that
was just a ridiculous
Timex eclair thing with a memory
keyboard but back then it wasn't cool to
play games right all of the cool kids
weren't playing they wasn't
this isn't something that you did so you
got a whole bunch of girlfriends that's
cool popular it was right underneath
maybe you know like speech in debate
team and chess club or something like
that right in the middle yeah yeah but I
love games back then and it was clear
that you know there's a lot of artistic
work that goes into these games a lot of
you know music and and clearly I mean
people draw on you know there's a lot of
art in the games themselves but I think
the overall layout of the game itself is
is an art form I think that's more
apparent to people nowadays but it
certainly wasn't 20 to 30 years ago yeah
your interest in art does have something
to do with your interest in engineering
and you've done some things personally
on that crossover maybe not making games
but making other things yeah I have an
eight-year-old daughter and when she was
born so this was a while ago eight years
ago I had some paternity to leave so I
found this really cool guy who had done
this project of using genetic algorithms
to try to learn the placement of
translucent polygons to look like famous
paintings like the Mona Lisa or just
pictures of Barack Obama or Star Trek
characters that's what I like to do it
too but you can imagine
you like put like a purple triangle
right here and like a little red square
on top of it and maybe a circle over
here and if they're all kind of
transparent and you tweak around the
colors you know with about 40 or 50
polygons you can make a pretty good
representation of some image like the
Mona Lisa so I spent weeks on my
paternity leave kind of developing this
genetic algorithm that would tune these
so it would kind of estimate the photo
but not perfectly you know it would have
like this kind of artistic touch to it
because it's limited in what you can do
right but that was fascinating i'm i'm
deeply interested in all of these
efforts that exists about trying to use
both machine learning and just software
engineering in general to generate art
Google's done you know what tensorflow
has done an amazing amount of work in
this this area generating all these cool
fractal images and and they're doing it
with music too ml is doing pretty much
everything which leads me to my next
question with firebase predictions I'm
kind of curious to know how it works I
know there's ml back there but I'm
wondering if you could tell me a little
bit about how it knows when a user's
about to cheran or leave the app yeah
yeah good question so when a user is
engaged with an app you know they're
playing on their phone pressing all
these little buttons you know not
surprisingly a whole bunch of little
discrete events get triggered and those
events get sent ultimately to the Google
to our Google servers and then what my
team does is it takes this kind of
constant stream of events and we could
just trillions of events just a
tremendous number of them well we
organized all of these events
chronologically for an individual user
and then so now for each user inside the
app we kind of have like this history of
what what events that they triggered we
then take all of these events we take a
user and that becomes a data point for
us to learn a machine learning model so
we create these really large neural
networks with tensorflow
and these neural networks take all of
the features which are really just
elements in the time series and then
associate those features with whether or
not this user in the next kind of seven
days is going to churn or spend money or
kind of trigger any event in in the
developers app like a developer can make
a prediction with our tool that will say
tell me if this user is likely to finish
your tutorial or tell me if this user is
likely to engage in a multiplayer app I
mean it's a really flexible tool and
experiments where you're sort of like
your hypothesis and figuring out if like
that that's going to satisfy that's
going to be satisfied by whatever the
users doing in your app yeah absolutely
and I mean it's amazing to me in a sense
that we can really just throw all of
this data at this enormous neural
network and the power of like tensor
flow so tensor flow is the the
underlying machinery here at Google for
learning these really large complicated
but normal networks and it just blows me
away that we can throw our data at it
and then it can learn these
relationships between like like you know
there's some obvious relationships like
if you haven't logged into the game in
the last four or five days there's a
really good chance that you're not gonna
come back right it's not it's not
guaranteed and maybe in some games it's
more guaranteed than others since our
flow figures all of this kind of stuff
out it's really an amazing platform in
it it's it's you know the phrase
standing on the shoulder of giants that
certainly happens here at Google I think
a lot of people Google end up leveraging
just this immense power that we have
here that if we weren't here at Google
we really just couldn't do these these
same kinds we're offering this at no
cost right yes so that seems pretty
amazing to me like there's like we have
all this computing power and you get to
basically use it for free and that seems
kind of like amazing to me yeah and from
the outside world you know I think you
know there's this kind of perception
that it all just kind of works I I'm in
the deep nitty-gritty of it all so it's
like we'll get like a little alerts that
trigger and little parts of our pipeline
don't finish on time and so we're
scrambling around and make everything
everything work but it sounds like
engineering here it's engineering and
yeah this is so I've been here at Google
for a while I've been here for about ten
years now this this product the firebase
predictions product is it's certainly
the most visible thing that I've done to
the outside world I was on the ads team
for a long time and so I would tweak
around algorithms and how ads are placed
and no one would ever notice the
difference right no we'd have some of
our metrics on the back end go up by
like 2% or 1/2 a percent which of course
means a lot of money depending on kind
of the improvement that was made but but
this is the first time I've really
shipped this like this kind of want is
this product that they're just just
highly visible unto itself and and
that's both really exciting it's also
pretty scary well I'm so happy that
predictions found we did with firebase
yeah
I've been working on this for so long
yeah I'm sure everyone who's watching at
home also will see some benefits as well
so hope so go out there use firebase
predictions let us know if it's working
for you we definitely thrive on
community feedback so be sure to let us
know how it's going and hope you get a
lot out of it yeah thanks so much John
thanks for being on the show you're very
welcome and thank you for tuning in to
meet firebase so if you want to see more
great video content like this be sure to
