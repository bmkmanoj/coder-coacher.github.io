thank you for coming thank you for
staying we're here to talk about
firebase well we're all here to talk
about firebase but more specifically
Johnny and I are here to talk to you
about firebase on iOS because at
firebase we take cross-platform
development very seriously and we know
that as a mobile library it can't be
useful to you unless it's available on
all the platforms you're developing for
and foremost you native mobile
developers that means Android and iOS
fun fact if I give this talk in Spanish
it kind of looks like I'm just excited
about operating systems in general so
that's my one internationalisation joke
for for the day and so that's why out of
all the features that are available on
firebase these are the ones that are
available on iOS and you can see that
it's nearly all of them now
unfortunately we can't drill into all
these features in 30 minutes we just
don't have enough time for that so we're
going to focus on the three that I
probably see the most questions about on
Stack Overflow firebase Cloud messaging
firebase dynamic links and then how you
can Johnny will cover how you can make
using the firebase database easier and
more more cool to work with using a new
open source library that we've been
working on called firebase UI but with
that we're going to start with our first
topic which is firebase Cloud messaging
so the ideal with firebase Cloud
messaging or FCM as I will probably call
it throughout the presentation as you
can use it to communicate both with
Android devices and also route
notifications through a P&amp;amp;S to talk to
iOS devices which leads to one important
question which is why would you want to
do this that's a good question partly
because there's only one pakode path
right you no longer have to worry about
kind of keeping track of what types of
devices your users have and if you're
trying to talk to you know your iOS
devices send through this code path and
otherwise send through this type of
notification you really just don't have
to worry about that you can just kind of
send one type of notification through
fcm and you're done which is nice it
lets you take advantage of features like
topics these are essentially ad hoc
groups that your clients can subscribe
to so you can send messages just to
those devices that are interested in
these particular subjects again you can
do this without your needing you keep
track of all this stuff on a database
that you have to maintain somewhere we
take care of that work for you it also
means you can send notifications
through the fire based notifications
panel which is a nice way for the
non-technical members of your team to
send messages through through FCM but
also lets you hook into some other neat
features of firebase notifications like
being able to send messages to audiences
which are these groups that you define
using firebase analytics you can also
identify desired conversion events so
you can basically see how effective
these notifications are in driving the
conversions that you want to see out of
them would you get in sort of these nice
little reports like this you can see
other notifications you spent how many
were opened how many led to a conversion
event which hopefully lets you tweak
your notifications to to create some
better outcomes of course you don't need
to use the button notifications you I to
talk to fcm your server can also talk
directly to fcm if you want to the
choice is completely up to you so with
that in mind let's go over how FCM talks
to a P&amp;amp;S and to your iOS device because
that's the key to understanding some
issues that you might run into as you
probably know two things are needed for
any service to communicate with apns the
Apple push notification service first
you need a certificate to talk to the
APNs server and I know these days
there's also an off-key but I'm not
going to get into that because their
certificate is what FCM uses you also
need to identify the device you're
talking to using something that's
generally known as the APNs device token
it's essentially kind of a unique ID of
that device for your app this is
something that's typically requested
from a P&amp;amp;S buyer device and then sent
down to your server so one of the first
things you're going to do when you set
up firebase Cloud messaging is upload
your a P&amp;amp;S cert to firebase Cloud
messaging which then allows it to talk
to a P&amp;amp;S and then when your app starts
up it's going to request a device token
from a P&amp;amp;S like normal it will then send
that down to firebase Cloud messaging
and it will ask for a firebase Cloud
messaging device token in exchange which
it will get back at this point you're
basically ready to make a request to
send off a notification through FCM
through a P&amp;amp;S and basically you're going
to need two things to do this on your
server first will be the API key which
allows your server to talk to to fcm and
you'll get this from the firebase
console and then assuming you want to
talk to individual devices you're also
going to need that device token which
you're going to somehow get from your
client
so these two pieces of information are
then packaged off into a notification
that gets sent off to firebase Cloud
messaging firebase Cloud messaging says
okay I see what device this is because I
see the fcm token but hey it looks like
this device also has an ApS token maybe
it's an iOS device and so it means it
basically knows at this point it needs
to route these messages through apns and
so what firebase will do is it will
create a brand-new apns notification
using the certificate and the APNs token
that it has an its side this
notification then goes through apns
which then finally notifies our iOS
device and we're happy yay so I know
this is a lot to process but basically
two things you should need to know first
is that most of this is invisible to you
as the developer it kind of happens
behind the scenes and you generally
don't need to worry about it unless I
guess something goes wrong but the other
point that I want you to take away is
that by the time we get to this part
here in the process this basically just
looks like a regular old apns
notification right as far as your device
is concerned this is like any other
notification it's received from from
Apple so let's stop and think about the
work that our device had to do during
that process first we had to ask apns
for device token we then had to send
that token off to firebase Cloud
messaging and then we had to receive
back and store our own firebase Cloud
messaging device token now lucky for you
you don't really need to do any extra
work to take care of this you basically
just call register for remote
notifications like you would normally
basically we take care of this work by
employing some methods whistling to take
care of a lot of this work for you so in
an hour swizzled you know application
did register for remote notifications
with device token method starting
transcriber person we receive our apns
token send that off to fcm in exchange
for the fcm device token and by the way
I've been lying to you a little bit this
is actually known as an instance ID
token and if you look in our
documentation or in like the Xcode you
know output you'll see it reference that
way but you can basically think of it as
an fcm device token because because
that's basically what it is one
important note by the way is we don't
Swizzle the any kind of method where we
ask the user for any kind of
notification permissions right like
that's the work that you as an app
developer are going to want to do at a
very specific point in your app when
you're years who has indicated yes I
will click accept when you bring up that
permissions box so we don't do this
automatically you still have to do this
as an app developer so let's talk
debugging as you can see there are a lot
of systems that talk to each other right
your server or firebase notifications
talks to fcm which then talks to a P&amp;amp;S
which then talks to your device and
really on the device you've got iOS
talking to your app and these are a lot
of places where things can go wrong and
generally speaking if any part of this
change is broken it manifests itself as
economist serious i sent him a
notification and then nothing happened
to my device kind of error which are
sort of the most frustrating to be to
debug so when this happens I see a whole
bunch of people nodding yeah the best
thing to do is basically start breaking
this down piece by piece kind of work
backwards in the chain so you know start
by focusing on this part here where your
app you know maybe just hasn't quite
gotten permission from iOS to display
notifications so the best way to figure
out what's going on here is reimplement
those Swizzle methods you didn't have to
implement so it's not necessary to
implement them but for debugging
purposes I like to put this in so I can
do some printf debugging so for instance
in did register for remote notifications
go ahead and print out a readable
version of your device token partly
because you'll need this in a later step
but you can also make sure this looks
like a device token and isn't nil or
something you can also make sure that
your app is actually prepared to show
you know alerts or sounds at this point
on this might be a good place to double
check and make sure that yes I really
have permission to display a
notification and in your you know app
application did fail to register method
you know go ahead and print out that
error because that might give you a
pretty good clue so mostly errors that
you'll catch at this point are the kind
of I'm really embarrassed that I got
this error sort of variety so it's
things like forgetting to call register
for remote notifications not calling
request authorization if you're
expecting a visible notification not
testing on a real device or forgetting
to enable notifications in your
entitlements in your Xcode project I
know sort of very obvious simple errors
but without adding all those sort of
error messages into your console it can
be easy to overlook one or two
these I may have done this at some point
but assuming all that's okay then focus
on this next part here which is having
apns talk to your app now just because
you're using firebase Cloud messaging
doesn't mean you can't also talk
directly to a P&amp;amp;S you can still do that
that's fine all you need is a
certificate and the APNs device token
which you already have so there's a few
ways to kind of test out this portion i
know there's you know some third-party
tools out there personally though i'm a
fan of just making a curl call directly
from the laptop it's sort of the the
cleanest easiest way and now that apns
supports HTTP too it's a little easier
to make this call and i think more
importantly get something useful back in
the response so for this to work since
HTTP two is kind of new you're going to
want a version of curl that's 743 or
later and make sure it has support for
HTTP to it doesn't by default but you
can you can google it there's there's
ways to install it update it the other
thing you're going to need to do is
convert your p12 key into a PM file and
again this is don't memorize this just
just google it and you'll get this and
then finally you'll need to grab your
device token the target device you want
to talk to which you can do if you
implemented that that did register for
remote notifications method that I was
talking about earlier so once you have
all that information you can make a curl
call like this start with sort of a very
simple hello world and within this call
you're going to include a certificate
this is the thing you had to generate
earlier that lets you talk to the
service you're going to want the device
token as the end point and then you're
probably going to want to add the bundle
ID as the APNs topic here by the way
completely different than firebase Cloud
messaging topics sorry that that term
got overloaded but if all has gone well
you should see the notification show up
on your on your test device and if all
has gone well on the terminal side you
will get nothing back if you do get a
response back that will probably be a
good indication as to what the error
message actually or what the problem
actually is so bad device token is what
it sounds like that apns device token
probably isn't right and do you remember
at this step you're using apns device
tokens not FCM ones device token not for
topic actually might be a good sign that
you have the wrong certificate so double
check your you know you've got the right
certificate you're using it for the
right environment debug versus
production
but if you're still getting back no
error message but nothing is showing up
on the device do make doubly extra sure
that you have permission to display
notification with sound and banners
check that both in your code and in your
settings also if your app is running in
the foreground make sure you've written
some code to actually display that
notification because again this doesn't
happen by default on iOS although in iOS
10 they made this a whole lot easier if
you call completion handler dot alert in
your user notification center will
present with completion handler method
that basically tells iOS hey you know
what I know your app is in the
foreground but go ahead and display this
alert anyway and iOS will do that for
you and that's really nice certainly
helps for testing and development but
now if all this is working then you can
move on to the next step which is
testing the fcm portion and again this
is actually something that can best be
accomplished with the curl call you're
basically going to need two things
you're going to need the server key
which you can find in the firebase
console and the bit labeled server key
and then getting the device token the
FCM device token requires calling the
token method on the instance ID
singleton and so this is basically what
you need to do to get your FCM device
token I think this prints out nicely
this token does change on occasion in
particular I think it changes when you
go from like debug to production so just
keep in mind that you're going to want
to not only sort of get this every time
but also listen for when it changes
there are sort of NS notifications that
that will fire off when this changes so
you can listen for it there now once you
have both of these pieces of information
well then it can make a similar curl
call to fcm right you've got like your
server key here and this giant crazy
string is the fcm device token if all
goes well you'll get back at response
like this this doesn't mean by the way
the whole message worked only that we
talked to fcm okay if you get back
something that doesn't look like this
again you'll probably get a pretty
useful error message that tells you
what's going wrong on the other hand if
you don't get back any error message but
you're still not seeing a notification
the biggest thing to check here is that
you've labeled priority high in your FCM
notification Android and iOS have
different ways of interpreting this
priority value so as a result on apns
the default value is 10
which is basically the equivalent of
high which means hey please send this
and display this message right away the
default value in firebase Cloud
messaging is medium which it turns out
on Android devices is still kind of high
it means go ahead and show this message
unless my android devices in doze mode
in which case you know wait a little bit
but on iOS you know medium equates to
like a P&amp;amp;S of 5 which is sort of like
and maybe you'll see the notification
maybe you won't so if you want to make
sure your FCM message shows up on iOS
devices I do recommend explicitly
setting this to high not going with the
default other common mistakes might be
using apns terminology in your FCM post
there are sort of equivalents here so
make sure you know you're doing content
underscore available true and not
content available one things like that
can can trip you up definitely Oh saw a
couple people lying take screenshot or
take pictures of that go ahead all right
I'll you know I'm going to put this up
in a video or something at some point
later in case in case you miss it and
then finally make sure that you've
actually uploaded a certificate to the
firebase console because without it fcm
can't talk to a penis and then there's
this part here talking from
notifications to Cloud messaging I'll be
honest there's not a lot to worry about
here if you're able to communicate to
fcm through a curl call the firebase
notifications panel should probably be
working if it's not the best thing to do
is check like status firebase google com
look at this cloud messaging row that
will tell you if there's anything that
happens to be wrong with either
notifications or Cloud messaging alright
that was an awful lot about Cloud
messaging let's move on to another topic
let's talk about dynamic links so we
talked about this briefly in the in the
last presentation but the idea is
dynamic links are mobile deep links that
work the way you want them to so with
one single link we can take the user to
your Android or iOS app if you know the
user has it installed and they're on the
appropriate device if the user does not
have your app installed we can take them
directly to the app store or the Play
Store or I suppose to to a web page that
choice is up to you but i think the real
magic of dynamic links is that if your
if your user does not have the app
installed and we have to take them to
the app store first that link data
doesn't get lost when your user opens up
your app again for the first time the
dynamic link library can still fit
that original link context for you so
you know what link originally brought
your user into your app and you can sort
of display that sort of in a more
appropriate welcome screen than just
sort of like some generic high sign in
kind of screen and that's really good to
sort of driving a good first time
experience so how does this work so for
simplicity and because I'm running short
on time let's focus on the iOS side of
things on iOS 9 or later so for the this
left branch here if your app is
installed and we want to take your user
directly to the app we use Universal
links in case you don't know what
Universal links are they're basically a
way of telling iOS hey instead of
opening a link on my website go ahead
and pass that URL on to my appt my app
will know how to handle it and we'll
send the user to the right place and you
do this by placing a little file on your
website this apple app site Association
file that basically tells iOS that's
going to be opening up your app instead
of the website well with firebase
dynamic links it basically works the
same the idea is that instead of your
website implementing universal links
firebase creates its own little mini
website that has the same domain as
these dynamic links that you create for
your app then we create our own little
apple app site Association file that
points into your app your app can then
take a look at that incoming link and
show the right information to the user
so it's completely up to you whether or
not your own website has support for
universal links it's fine if you do but
it's also fine if you don't it doesn't
matter I mean heck you barely even need
a website and you know univer dynamic
links will still work so it's does mean
on the client you need to add support
for universal links and some developers
see this in the documentation and they
think oh no I haven't set up my website
for universal links and so don't worry
like all this will still work whether or
not your website is set up for universal
links so what happens if your app is not
installed well for that we first bounced
through a browser this is how we do some
work to remember that link data for
later essentially we kind of do some
some light fingerprinting here then we
do a Java JavaScript redirect to take
you into the App Store and then when the
user first opens up the app the firebase
library will make a network call to see
if it looks as though the user had
clicked on a dynamic link previously now
one thing to keep in mind about this
process is that it is not foolproof we
will usually not be completely confident
that the dynamic link that the user
clicked on actually belongs to this
user and so you're going to need to know
this by examining this match confidence
parameter if it's set to week it means
we think this is the dynamic length the
user clicked on but we're not completely
sure so it's your responsibility to look
at this parameter and make sure you
don't show any kind of personal
information to the user if that happens
to be the case a quick note about the
data payload in dynamic links I'm not
going to go into you know full
everything that makes up a full dynamic
link we have docs for that but I didn't
want to highlight the actual data
payload that your app receives in this
case which is that link parameter you'll
notice that it looks like a URL and you
might wonder you know why is this have
to be a URL it couldn't be like a JSON
object or something and the answer is no
and the reason why is that this link
parameter essentially performs double
duty it's not only the data payload that
your app reads in to display the right
object or the right view but it's also
the URL that we might take your user to
if they are viewing this dynamic link on
a platform that doesn't support it like
for instance a desktop web web browser
plus I think the idea is that if you've
already gone ahead and implemented
universal links on iOS then you've
already had to basically create all this
content or the start of this logic to
convert the content URL into the
appropriate content in your app and so
maybe you can kind of piggyback on that
too also interpret this dynamic link
parameter so there's a few use cases for
dynamic links where I think you can kind
of take advantage of them one really
good one is getting people from your
mobile website directly into your app
instead of sort of a generic hey why do
you install our app kind of header you
know if you have that powered by dynamic
links then you can take people directly
into your app with the same content they
were looking at on your website and
that's that's really nice again sort of
much better than sort of a generic
welcome page as Lawrence pointed out
it's also really good for you to do
users sharing right if you want to share
a recipe from one user to another you
can do that with dynamic links you to
basically have your client generate a
dynamic link based on the content you're
showing if you you know if this link
looks kind of ugly to share we have a
rest api that will shorten it for you
and then basically sort of share it
however you want like you can bring up a
share sheet or embed the link in an
email directly however you do that's up
to you and finally we'll talk about one
last case that I probably get the most
questions about which is sharing dynamic
links from a social post see in general
sharing from a social media site like
Facebook works pretty well when people
are looking at the site directly within
a browser like mobile safari or chrome
this all works great the problem comes
when people try and view a post from
within directly within the facebook app
while the universal link path works okay
if the if the recipient already has the
app installed the facebook app tends to
disable JavaScript redirects that take
the user outside of the app and to the
App Store for instance and so this part
of the flow ends up broken and instead
the user ends up at the URL that was
defined in your link parameter and so
the teams looking at ways we can make
this process better on but in the
meantime a simple workaround that i like
is well in that URL that's described in
link parameter just go ahead and create
a plain old normal you know link to the
app store this is an at you know because
this is a normal link not a JavaScript
redirect this will work fine you will
lose some of that original link context
which is some of the firebase dynamic
link magic but on the other hand you've
gotten users to install your app and and
that's pretty good too so I probably
been talking for way too long I am now
going to have Johnny come up and talk
about some cool things you can do with
the firebase UI library thank you
hi my name is Johnny and I'm an engineer
on the firebase database and today I'll
be talking about firebase UI so earlier
today we announced version 1 dot 0 of
firebase UI and we'll be looking how to
use some of these features on iOS but
we'll also be looking behind the scenes
and some of the tricks that firebase UI
actually uses to do what it does so a
quick show of hands who heard of
firebase UI before the announcement
today wow that's a lot of hands who has
actually used firebase UI still a lot of
hands so if you haven't used firebase UI
I do recommend checking it out so what
did it what is it there's a couple of UI
UX patterns in firebase when you're
developing apps with firebase that show
up all the time and you don't really
want to repeat yourself and you don't
want to write the code over and over
again and that is where firebase UI
comes in and takes these common patterns
and grabs them in simple library calls
it is available available for both iOS
and Android it's open source you can see
the link to the iOS version on the slide
here and community contributions are
always accepted and appreciate it so one
thing we added recently was the
integration with firebase storage so if
you know web browser firebase storage is
very easy to use because you can get
back at URL and you just put that URL in
in your app and the browser will do
everything for you it will download it
it will do caching on a mobile device
that's not quite true you have to do
that manually and that's kind of work
that you don't necessarily want to do so
this this great open source library
called SD web image and we didn't want
to reinvent the wheel so we integrated
far based storage with SD web image so
where you could previously pass in URL
and the SD web image library would
actually go ahead and download the image
and do the caching for you you can now
pass in a storage referee
it's and the firebase UI library will do
everything for you when using the
firebase database oftentimes you have
something like your collection and you
want to display this collection of this
list of things to use and a great way to
display that is well showing a list and
one way to do this on iOS is using a
uitableview firebase UI does also
support uicollectionview but we'll be
looking on how you can use the UI
tableview to display firebase database
data so what steps are necessary to
display a list of things it's actually
three simple steps the first thing you
need is a firebase query and this can be
any reference this can be any query you
can add limits you can start at we don't
care where it is in the firebase what we
do care is how the data looks like and a
general rule is if you're using push IDs
to add items to this collection then
your data is good to go so now we have
this query next thing we have to do is
create a data source so if you've been
using your table view you know you have
to populate it using a data source and
this is where firebase UI comes in so
you pass in the query so it knows where
to get the data from you pass in the
table view so it knows where to put the
data and where to yeah load the UI and
then you pass in a populate cell call
back so firebase UI does not write the
UI for you unfortunately at least you
still have to do it Matt yourself but it
does make it easy for you so for every
item in that collection will call this
populate cell call back and you can use
the same patterns that you are used to
from iOS so you can use reuse identifies
and you can DQ cell for that good
performance and then we'll give you the
snapshot and you can use the snapshot to
populate that cell so once you did that
the final thing you want to do is hook
up the datasource to your table view and
voila you're done so let's take a look
of what happens behind the scenes when
you do that so the firebase
view data source will set up the
listeners it will do all the grunt work
for you it will make sure to listen for
child added events child moved events
and all of the other events and as you
can see here in this image will actually
also do animations for you so firebase
database is really good for real-time
data and if you have real-time data you
also want to sort of show the data as it
changes and animation is a great way to
show that so you'll get animations out
of the box for free if you're using
firebase UI now if you've been using UI
tableview you know well it's indexed row
based and nowhere in firebase do i get
an index it's all key based so how does
firebase UI do this under the hood it
actually maps this collection to an
array so in this example we have a
couple of keys and I just noticed that
the letter D is missing in here and so
let's assume that well let's add it to
the data and we want the the table view
to actually update that and how do we
know where to put this on iOS there is
the special function that you might not
be aware of so usually when you listen
to events you give it a vent type and
then you pass in a block and we'll give
you a snapshot but there's also this
function where you can pass in a special
kind of block that gives you the data
snapshot plus a string and this string
tells you where this event is relative
in the snapshot will tell you what is
the previous sibling in this collection
and you will know where to add it so
let's look through an example so we have
this array with our keys and we want to
add the letter D and firebase will tell
us that the previous child is C so all
we have to do is scan through the array
and luckily I place the block at the
right place and we know now that the new
index is 3 and so we can add it to the
array and now we know how to translate
fire
ace keys to indexes in the table view so
firebase UI when you initially load the
data it will animate everything and
sometimes we get the question well what
if I don't want to animate the initial
loading but I instead want to display a
spinner and just show the data all at
once when it's loaded and there's two
facts about the firebase database that
you might not be aware of that allows
you to do this the first one is the type
of event actually does not change
performance it doesn't matter whether
you add a child added or child removed
or even a value event the work that
happens in the background is exactly the
same so how does it help you level helps
you in combination with the second fact
that value event will fire after all of
the other events have fired so we take
the example of showing a loader when you
attach the child added listener will
fire all of the child added events and
we know from the first fact that we can
also add value listener at no additional
cost so we'll add that too and when it
fires we know we've gotten all of the
child added events and we now have a
complete data so if it's a full first
call back for a value event we can
remember that we can hide the loader we
can take our current state and display
to the user now there's one important
fact that I'd like to call out and that
is always clean up after yourself so
obviously if you're listening to fire
based queries there's some resource
costs associated with this will spin up
a connection if there hasn't been a
connection yet we'll use some memory and
if data is changing it will also
continue to use bandwidth so we don't
have a strong opinion of where you
should set up your listener we do
however recommend that you balance it
with a non lesson at the appropriate
place so for example if you set up the
listen and view did load you need to
make sure that you also unless in in the
dialogue and if you do respond to did
receive memory warning calls and unload
the view there also make sure is your
unless and there
all else in the next viewdidload you'll
have to you'll set up a duplicate
listener same if you set up your
listening the view will appear you want
to unless an interview will disappear
and then one last thing is beware of
retain cycles so firebase uses blocks
and blocks are very easy to work with
but if you reference self in a block
that can cause a retain cycle and so d
alec might not ever be called and you'll
never unlistenable make sure to weak
reference it so that was firebase UI are
there any react negative developers here
there's a couple so unfortunately
obviously firebase UI is for iOS and if
you using react native then you can't
use that however the firebase web client
libraries are supported for react native
the feature set is just slightly
different than for the mobile native
clients so there's a third-party
community effort called fire stack the
link is on the slide here that actually
wraps the native mobile libraries that
you can use in react native that's all
for me back to do you Todd alright
okay so I know that was an awful lot of
information at once luckily for you you
don't have to memorize any of it we've
got some lovely documentation that you
can visit we also have a youtube channel
full of very good-looking performers so
you should subscribe to that if you
haven't yet and we'll be hanging out
afterwards both in the ask firebase area
and the after party later this evening
so feel free to you know talk to us if
you have any other follow-up questions
without we've got zero on the countdown
so we are out of time thank you very
much for listening and now at this point
Abe and Damien are going to come up and
talk about some cool gaming and unity
things with firebase so I'm excited yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
