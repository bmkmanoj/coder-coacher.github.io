between what people say they're going to
do and what they actually do and that
holds true with your app as well sure
you can always run a survey or a user
study but the best way to find out what
people are doing within your app is to
measure their behavior with something
like firebase analytics so let's see how
to get started using firebase analytics
in your iOS app in this episode of fire
casts so firebase analytics is a system
that's primarily built around events as
people use your app it fires off a whole
bunch of events that get tracked
coalesced and reported to you in the
firebase analytics dashboard now this
here is my very simple app I've got a
button a switch and a slider and our
user research team is dying to know what
control are people using most often well
we can find out by measuring those
events within firebase analytics so
first off we need to install firebase
and I've already done that by creating a
project in the firebase console
attaching my iOS app to the project
adding a constants file to my Xcode
project and then installing firebase
core using cocoapods
if you don't know what I'm talking about
see this video first and then come back
now if you've done all that then you
already have firebase analytics up and
running it's included in the firebase
slash core library in fact if you were
to go to the firebase console and go to
the analytics panel you would start to
see some reports about your app things
like overall usage user engagement
revenue and retention that said if you
want to get back demographic data in
analytics you should also make sure you
link in the add support framework which
you would do in your Xcode projects
build phases link binary with library
section but please note you should only
be doing this if your app is serving
advertisements through a product like
Google AdMob otherwise you should skip
that part now there are a few events
like sessions start in an app purchase
that analytics is able to track
automatically for you but for most
others you're going to need to log them
yourselves now an event consists of a
name which is simply a string and then
an optional list of parameters these
parameters are represented as a
dictionary where you have strings for
the keys and then either strings or
numbers for the values for instance if
you had an achievement unlocked event
you might want to include the
achievement that was actually unlocked
as one of those parameters now some
common events have already been defined
by firebase and
lytx for you you can see a partial list
of them here things like level up
tutorial begin Add to Cart and so on now
if you have the option I highly
recommend you use one of these
predefined events instead of creating a
custom one since firebase understands
the context around these predefined
events a little better for example if
you were to use firebases built-in
LevelUp event it would automatically
give you a histogram of all the new
levels that people have reached within
your game that's something you wouldn't
get automatically if you created your
own custom level up event now it just so
happens that firebase analytics doesn't
have predefined events for adjusted
slider or press though release the
Kraken button go figure
but that means we're going to have to
submit these as custom events so we can
start doing that now submitting these
events is pretty simple let's jump into
my view controller here and first we'll
import firebase next from within my
button press handler I'm going to call
for analytics dot log event with name
note that this is a class method I don't
need to bring up a shared instance or
anything like I would with most other
firebase libraries so for this first
parameter here I'll type in the name of
the event now if I were using a
predefined event I would be entering a
constant here instead of typing in a
string they all begin with Kfir event as
you can see but there isn't any kind of
predefined button press event here so
I'm going to type in a string instead
let's be real original and call it press
underscore button now this event doesn't
really need any parameter so I'm going
to leave this parameter list set to nil
then I can do the same for these other
two we'll add an analytics event for
flip underscore switch and then another
for adjust slider oh by the way when
you're dealing with a slider make sure
you send these on touch up events if you
send these on value changed events which
is the default in Xcode you'll be
sending down dozens of analytics events
every time somebody adjusts the slider
and that's probably going to mess up
your report oh and you know what just
for fun I'll send along a parameter with
this one I will give it a name of new
underscore value and then we'll use the
value of our slider so how can I tell
this worked well for starters I can view
this activity within my app by turning
on debugging in the console now in
firebase analytics if you want to see
debug logging you have to do it through
an argument that gets passed into your
app note that the console prints out
these helpful directions on how to do
so I'll go into product schemes edit
schemes and for my run event I'll hit
the plus sign here add a dash that's
that's very important and copy and paste
this for analytics debug enabled
argument in oh by the way this flag gets
persisted to disk so if you ever want to
turn off this debugging you can either
change this flag to no for analytics
debug enabled or you can disable the
flag and then delete and reinstall your
app so now we can run it and I can see
that as I messing with these interface
elements firebase analytics is telling
me that it's logging these events this
is great but it's important to note that
these events have not been sent down to
firebase analytics and here's the deal
in order to be respectful of your users
battery firebase analytics will only
send down analytics data either if
you've got data that's been sitting
around for more than an hour or if your
app goes into the background so you need
to watch out here if you try out your
app a few times the next code and just
click stop
firebase analytics won't have a chance
to send down any of your data and you'll
be pulling out your hair wondering why
you're not seeing any of this in the
console so when you're done testing out
your app and you want to make sure your
analytics data gets sent hit command
shift H to simulate pressing the home
button that'll send your app to the
background see all that in my console
that's the data actually getting
reported now if I want to see these
reports in firebase analytics itself I
have to do one of two things either a I
need to wait a few hours for this data
to get collated and condensed into a
report or B I need to link my firebase
project to bigquery which lets me
analyze and run queries against my
analytics data as soon as it gets
reported now linking to bigquery is
awesome and something I definitely
recommend looking into but that's
probably also a topic for a separate
video so for now I'm just going to wait
a few hours
huh oh hi oh we're back okay so let's
check out that event data so I'm going
to bring up the firebase console here
and select my project now we'll select
analytics and if you have multiple apps
connected to your project make sure you
select the right one from the drop down
here and here are my events by default
it's set to the last 30 days which does
not include today so I'm going to switch
it to today to get our most recent batch
of data well it looks like from the
numbers here our users prefer clicking
buttons to flipping switches that's
funny that's not what they told me in my
user survey good thing I measured
everything in analytics huh but let's
drill down into one of these events and
get a little more detail here's how many
times my event was triggered in the past
it's probably not super interesting at
the moment since I only have a few days
worth of material but over time this
graph will definitely look more graphi
you can see that there are some other
stats that will also start to get filled
out in real app things like the number
of users who encountered this event and
where they came from now if I had hooked
up the add support framework I could
also view some demographic information
about my users here but for privacy
reasons analytics won't show you this
demographic information until your app
has a critical mass of users so during
development this will look pretty empty
finally note that if I wanted to see
some kind of summary of that custom new
value parameter that I sent down with
that adjust slider event I'd need to
analyze the raw data in bigquery again
this is a great topic for a future video
and I will get to it soon promise
so we've tackled the first major API
call a firebase analytics sending an
event in our next video we're going to
tackle the second major method adding
custom user properties so stay tuned in
the meantime feel free to check out our
documentation here and hey don't miss

our YouTube channel
right down there see it click it and
I'll see you soon on a future episode of
fire casts
