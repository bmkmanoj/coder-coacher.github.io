firebase I'm a deep askance I'm a
developer programs engineer on the
firebase team and in this very special
episode of ask firebase we're going to
dive in to the questions about app ship
3000 these are all questions that you
ask at Google i/o this year and we're
going to answer them let's get into it
first question today is one I got in a
bunch of different forms at Google i/o
2017 app ship 3000 is ridiculous how did
you come up with this idea where did it
come from and why did you decide to
build it so I'll tell you when they sit
in the office and my coworker puff you
might know miss me he showed up and he
said we need to build a game for Google
i/o I said all right it's got to be fun
it's got to be energetic you got to have
a teamwork aspect and most importantly
it has to teach you about how awesome
firebase and Google cloud can be so I
went home I came back with some sketches
and we built that into a blip mm all
right the next question our next
question is one about technology people
notice that we used both firebase and
Google cloud inside of apps 3000 and
they wanted to know why we were using
both and the answer is simply that they
both worked well for different things in
our case the rocket ship game the
leaderboard and the web companion app
were all pure firebase these were cloud
messaging
real-time database storage all of these
firebase features but we also needed
something on the backend to do this
heavy lifting you might have seen we
generate these flight maps that show
exactly where your rocket went as you
played the game this is something that
didn't quite make sense to build on
firebase so we used a complex data
pipeline in Google cloud to do this if
you want to learn more about how we use
the power of Google cloud in App Store
3000 then you can check out this amazing
talk about data pipelines with firebase
and Google cloud that we've linked below
next up this next question is all about
the Companions web app we made if you
haven't played the game you might not
know that the companion app is how you
sign into the game lets you check the
leaderboard and once you get
notifications in your games are complete
now I personally didn't work that much
on this part of the app however I know
someone who did he's my buddy nipkow
and he normally sits in Zurich but I
think about pull some strings I might be
able to get him here for this give me
one second to get him on the phone hey
hey Nick oh yeah yeah I know it's for I
am but ask firebase needs
we need help right now can you get here
yeah all right fantastic I'll see you
soon
I'm here right what's up oh thank you
man thank you I'll hand over to you all
right guys I'm Nicolas I'm based in
Zurich and people usually call me in
this code so you're going to use the
companion web app when you want to sign
in to the arcade first you're going to
sign in with your Google account on the
companion web app and we're going to
generate a sign-in code for you for this
we use cloud functions to trigger on a
new account creation using that code you
sign into there Kade to launch the
rocket once the game is done we're going
to save your score on the real time
database and display this on the
leaderboard after a few minutes we're
going to use our Google cloud pipeline
to generate as ed mentioned a flight
path image and we're going to send you a
reengagement notification to let you
view that image on the web app alright
guys that's how we use firebase on the
companion web app right there cow sure
they'd
all right the final question of the day
can I play app ship 3000 and the answer
is yes you can play it but not right now
sadly app ship 3000 is an open source
yet and it's not available on mobile
that means if you want to play you're
going to have to come to one of our
events in person apps if it's currently
traveling the world getting to different
events that people like you can sit down
and have a blast playing it if you want
to find out where app ship is you can
follow me on twitter follow firebase on
twitter and we're going to keep you up
to date on every where it's going and I
can't wait for you to play it that's all
for this episode of ask firebase now if
you want to see the game in action we've
linked a video below for that if you
want to learn more about how we built up
ship 3000 there's a link to my blog post
along with that data pipelines talk I
mentioned as always if you have any
other questions about firebase about app
chip 3000 you can send them out using
that hashtag ask firebase and we will
get to them in a future episode but
that's all for now folks thanks for
