36 apps on their device and doesn't use
3/4 of them most of the time and of
those about one-third of them have only
ever been used once
well what if that's your app you've done
the research you've written the code
you've performed the testing you
perfected the design you've gotten the
installs and then nothing so how do you
prevent this app indexing helps you re
engage with your users through tight
integration with Google search as well
as appearing in search results it
surfaces your app through autocomplete
and now on tap all you have to do is get
your app in the index and when users
search for the content that's already in
your app they'll be able to see your app
directly in the search results and be
able to launch it right from there it's
as easy as that but how does it work if
your app and site have similar content
you associate them with each other then
your app can receive incoming links from
search on Android these are achieved
using standard Android app links and on
iOS using standard iOS Universal links
when a user searches for your content
they can then find your app if you have
the app installed it will allow you to
link directly to it when the app
launches it sees the address of the
index content and decides which screen
to load to show it it's really as easy
as that you can also use the app
indexing SDK to submit content to the
search engine based on how people use
your app content when people use your
app your search position can be improved
without findex Singh you get into the
index putting your app into Google
search and allowing you to re-engage
your users
