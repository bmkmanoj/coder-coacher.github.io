second day of Google i/o hopefully
you've met a lot of really great people
learn about the coolest new technology
and seen some great product launches but
there's one launch that you haven't seen
and I am so confident in this launch
that on stage at Google i/o I'm
announcing that I'm leaving Google to
start a startup to build this app and in
short this idea it's so revolutionary
I want you all of you to share your
story with your friends with your family
with everyone on the Internet
you deserve to share your story nobody
has done this before absolutely nobody
so I'm confident that we'll be the first
to market I'm so confident in fact that
I have already called all of my VC
friends and we have meeting scheduled an
hour from now but I think I was a little
too confident we actually don't have
anything yet
so I have this great idea but in order
to get funding I need to show that it's
a viable concept I need an Android app
an iOS app and a web app to actually
prove it that we can get users so I have
a bunch of really smart people at Google
and they all told me build an app that
looks like this so have an application
your web app your mobile app that talks
to some database server and that
database server proxies all those app
requests out to the storage systems
databases and ap is that servers going
to have all of my authentication logic
all of my business logic it will control
who can read and write the stories and
where those stories get sent but that
sounds like just a ton of work and I
scheduled meetings for like 45 minutes
from now so I can't build this alone
I've asked a couple of my friends to
come out and help Jenny Frank and Kat
can you guys help me
love it we all have a friend like that
right who comes up with this great app
idea and then sort of gives you 30
minutes to build it because how hard is
it to build a net especially here live
on stage so it's a tricky tricky
situation we have to build three
applications and we have what did he say
30 minutes so let's not do this
architecture what we're going to be
doing today is we're going to be using
firebase to build these applications and
that means that the application code
talks directly to our powerful managed
back-end services this means that
firebase takes care of all the things
like scalability and security so that we
can focus on building the features that
our users love it takes a bit of time to
set everything up so while the team is
prepping on their laptops I'm actually
going to talk a bit about how we're
using firebase and building this
application so remember we're building a
story sharing app so we're taking a
picture on our phone or selecting a
picture on a laptop and then we're
sharing it with the other users of the
app first thing we need to do there is
we need to allow the users to sign in
and we're using firebase authentication
for that second thing is that we need a
place where we can store and share the
photos so for that we're going to be
using cloud storage and finally we need
a way to store and synchronize metadata
between the users and that's the
firebase database we're going to go
through each of these features in turn
I'm going to explain how we use it in
the app and then we're going to switch
over to the code and see how it works in
practice so you're going to be
experiencing firsthand how easy it is to
build an app with firebase
first up firebase authentication
it's our secure server list sign-in
solution so we've taken all the
complexity of storing email addresses
and passwords server-side all closed and
we've wrapped them in a single
cross-platform client-side API
that means that your users can sign in
with Google Facebook Twitter github or
email password and if you've watched any
of the sessions so far about firebase
you know that we now also support phone
number authentication and that's great
because that means that even if your
users don't have an account they can
just sign in from their phone get a
verification text message and continue
using the application to speed things up
a bit today we're going to be using
firebase UI which is our open source
library for authentication so it handles
all of the complex flows that you might
kind of like is this a new user or
returning user do they want to sign in
with Facebook or Google and for example
password reset email verification
account linking actually it handles a
lot it's an open source library built by
the identity experts at Google and it
includes years of experience and best
practices for sign-in flows okay I think
that's pretty much what we need to know
can we switch to the split screen to do
some coding okay
so to speed things up we're going to be
building all three applications at the
same time so at let's see top left you
see Mike screen and Mike is building the
iOS version of our fire storage app at
the bottom left you see cat screen and
cat is working on the web version let's
the top right you see Jenny's screen but
hold on Jenny that doesn't look like
Java code that I'm used to now did you
switch over to Courtland yes last night
yes that's the last night
she's going to be great because it's
going to be so much less code that you
need to write for this okay so they've
all already built the basic framework
for the application so they've added the
layouts that they need to share the
stories and edit the inputs where the
user can select or take a picture and
the button where they can send it so if
we now run the app we can access the
devices camera or the local file browser
and we can take or select the picture
but if we hit Send nothing happens
that's because we're not using firebase
yet so in the bottom right you see the
firebase console this is where you
manage all of your firebase project
we've already created a project that
would serve as the backend for this
application now all these applications
whether it's iOS web or androids are
talking against the same back-end
services so they share the same list of
users the same file storage and the same
database that is great because that
means that they're sharing all their
state we've taken the configuration data
of this project and added it to each of
the platforms so now the apps can find
their back-end services on the Google
servers we've also already added the SDK
to each of the apps so we've done a pod
install a Gradle dependency and we added
the script included so with that I think
we're ready to start coding first thing
first thing we need to do is we take the
features that we're using about firebase
and import them from the SDK into our
code we do this in one go for all three
features that we're using of storage and
database you can see that the code looks
exactly the same for every feature so we
have a first feature consistency with
firebase that's great because it allows
you to start using new features quickly
but if you actually glanced from screen
to screen you see that it is really also
very similar between platforms and that
is great because it means that you learn
firebase on one platform then when you
switch to another platform you take what
you've learned and use it on the new
platform also I think we're now wiring
up firebase authentication so let's get
to that one first thing we need to do
there is that we need to configure
firebase UI for the providers that we
want to use so today we're only using
Google and sign-in because we only have
a few minutes left we also in the
firebase console enabled this provider
next we're going to wait until the user
clicks the sign-in button and when they
do we start the sign-in flow
now this is a very short amount of code
but it triggers all the complex flows
that you can imagine so if the user
finds in on an iOS device tomorrow but
on an Android device the day after they
still have the same stories and when
they want to sign in with Facebook today
but with Google tomorrow
it handles account linking for you all
that which behind this simple code what
we need to do is listen for when the
authentication state changes and when it
does it's either one of two things
either the authentication succeeded or
the user did not sign in if the user
signed in we hide to the sign-in buttons
show the sign out button we enable any
other UI elements that require an
authenticated user that's really all we
need to do so if we now run the
application we have sign in working
let's see who gets there first
I think sket is already signing in you
can see that we get pop-ups we get to
pick our account if we have multiple
Google accounts we get an account picker
all of that is handled for us with the
minimal codes that you just saw but just
signing in on an app is not very
interesting so let's switch back to
slides and see how we're going to be
using cloud storage
if you've ever used Google Cloud storage
before you know that it's our petabyte
scale storage solution
firebase provides a cross-platform
client-side SDK on top of cloud storage
that allows you to upload files securely
directly from your device we provide the
security model on top of this so that
you can ensure only authorized users
have access to those files from their
devices but whenever you upload a new
file through firebase you'll also get a
download URL this is an urn guessable
URL that provides read-only access to
that same file that is great for our
fire stories app today because we can
use that to share the image between all
our users I actually think there's
nothing more we need to know about cloud
storage so let's switch back to the code
and see how we make this work we're back
in the code remember we already imported
the feature before so what we now do is
and we have a local file that the user
took with the camera or selected from
the file browser first thing we need to
do is we need to figure out where we're
going to store that file in cloud
storage and it's going to consist of two
pieces so the first piece is the user's
UID so this is the identification of the
authenticated user and by putting this
in the path we actually make sure that
the files from the various users end up
in different locations that is great
because that means that we can use
firebase as server-side security rules
to ensure that only the authorized user
has access to their files so that it
Mike uploads a new story only he can
change the picture the second part of
the path is really just a unique
filename because since we're writing to
the same cloud storage location we want
to make sure that we don't override
panels we uploaded previously okay next
step is that we start uploading the
local file to that storage location so
we take the storage reference that we
just created we tell firebase to put the
file to that location
this is all we need to do to start the
upload in the background now think of
all the things we did not have to do
here we did not spin up any threads
there were no a sync adapters no
backgrounds has no Grand Central
Dispatch all we did was tell firebase to
start uploading the panel and it went to
work all we have to do is wait for the
upload to complete and then it does one
of two things can have happened I did
you upload succeeded or it failed if it
failed to take the error message that we
get from firebase we show it to the user
let the upload succeeded we take the
download URL of the part that was just
uploaded and we display that on the
local screen that is all we need so if
we now run this app will be able to
upload files to cloud storage iceycat is
already selecting an image hmm we don't
really see a lot yes if in the console
we switch to the storage tab the
firebase console on the bottom run that
can you switch in the console
can we go back to the split-screen thank
you so we have files here now these
files were just uploaded but not a
really impressive way of uploading a
file but it is a very cute dog in there
okay
so clearly we can now upload files to
the cloud not really what we wanted yet
nothing we can go to our pcs with so
we're going to be using the third part
of this feature to actually share the
information between our users let's you
expect to the presentation the firebase
database is our oldest feature and it's
still one of our most popular back-end
services we have hundreds of thousands
of applications that rely on our
database every day the firebase database
is a cloud hosted no sequel database
it's really just a Jason tree and if
you've ever modeled your day time with
Jason you know that it's very flexible
so this is the data model that we're
using today at the top level you see
that we have a node called stories and
under that we have a child node for each
individual story then for each of those
stories we keep the download your realm
remember that's the unguessable but
publicly readable URL we keep the title
that the user entered for that story we
also keep the user ID of the user who
created the story and just like before
with storage having the UID in the
database allows us to secure access to
the story with firebase as server-side
security rules so that is great because
it means that when Kat enters the story
only she can change the title of that
story we call our database a real-time
database we do that because of the way
you read your data from it so with most
databases you do something like select
star from stories then you get the list
of stories back and you display it on
the screen with firebase you attach or a
listener or an observer to the stories
node and from that moment on firebase
will tell you whenever something changes
under the store
his nose so when Jen uploads a new story
captain Mike get informed of death
instantly and when then Jen responds to
that story Mike gets the update
straightaway this is real-time
synchronization and it's really really
easy in fact let's not take my word for
it
let's switch back to the code and add
the final feature to the app okay so
let's see we already imported the
database so we're going to go back to
where we upload it to file and we edit
it to the local screen so first going to
remove that code we're not going to
display the story anymore because we are
going to instead write in metadata of
the story to the database so to do that
we create a reference to the stories
node in the database since we point to
that same node in each of the apps
they're going to be writing to the same
location in the same database that makes
data sharing release but since they're
writing to the same location we also
need to make sure we have a unique ID
for the story that we're creating so
we're calling push or child by author ID
for that with that we're ready to write
the metadata so we take the reference
that we just created and we write the
values of our story to it so we write
the download URL that everyone can
display we write the text that the user
entered rewrite their UID
so that we can secure access to the
story and finally we also write the path
in cloud storage because I think that
might come in handy at some point but
I'm not sure where yet just have a
feeling now we can run the app again and
if we do we pick the story it will write
that data to the database if you look at
the bottom right you see that we've
opened the database panel in the
firebase console and now we're going to
wait for the stories to pour in
I see that Mike is already selecting an
image cactus is working you can see that
the database lights up as the new
stories come in that is great but
there's one problem left who smile
you're on camera there's one problem
left it doesn't show on the local
screens anymore so that's the final step
we need to take in our code we're almost
done here folks so we're going to attach
a listener to the same notes that we had
before to the story's node and we're
going to ask firebase for the last ten
stories now from that moment on whenever
a new story is added firebase will fire
the child edit event and with that event
we get a snapshot of the story so we
take the value out of the snapshot
that's the value that we just wrote
right and we display it on the local
screen again by calling display story
that's it it handles most situations
we're going to do one extra one because
I've been telling about changing the
story securely so much that I want to
make sure that works too so in addition
to handling child edit we're also going
to listen for changes to the stories
which works with a child changed event
so now whenever somebody changes the
story we get a snapshot of the updated
story we take the value and the key of
that story and we update the display on
the local screen I think we're ready to
run
and now you can see that if we run the
ad stories that we just created actually
are already showing on each local screen
so that challenge edit event that we
were talking about fires immediately for
any existing children but now as they're
taking more pictures and writing more
stories those stories show up on all
screens within milliseconds this is how
you build a multi-user story sharing
application with firebase in fact not
sure I didn't read the full spec of the
requirements but I think we're pretty
much done here Mike and it took what
like 15 minutes I think we have like 40
minutes left to actually go go play in
the ball pit what was it I hope they
like it
what's what's wrong Jen what's wrong
wait a second Frank I'm just getting a
call is that our VC Oh RBC says that
there's already a bunch of apps that you
basically this thing no way wait that
you want what oh my gosh Frank we need
to pivot like now a good thing we have
like 20 minutes left so it turns out to
go back to the slide Boop it turns out
that there are a lot of apps out there
already to do real-time communication
the do chat and pictures and text and
stuff and it turns out that so a few
years ago and people are interested in
new stuff now specifically people are
tired of reading text and looking at
their pictures instead they want to look
at their pictures and look at other tiny
pictures next to their big pictures so
we need to a modify our app today but
it's okay
pivots are hard but we've been thinking
ahead our skunkworks engineering team
has already thought of this and already
developed a really cool emoji vacation
algorithm that'll take us to the next
round of funding but like any big
engineering change we have a few
challenges that we're facing
you know we're pivoting for example we
have somehow burned through a lot of our
engineering resources already I think I
might have something to do with the
bouncy castle in the break room anyway
we don't have time to
for all three platforms anymore we have
to take our original notification
algorithm and write it once so you don't
have to port it to all the different
platforms another problem we have is our
motivation algorithm is super great and
targets really well but it consumes a
lot of resources and although mobile
devices are faster than ever before
their battery life has been kind of flat
over the last years and like we need to
make sure that we save our users
batteries so they can be taking tiny
pictures of their big pictures all day
and finally security so we have our
proprietary motive occasional geurim but
as you build out an application you end
up with secrets that are part of your
app whether they be API keys or other
stuff like that and if you put them into
your app and deploy it into the world
some of your beloved but possibly
nefarious users are going to find that
information and might do bad things with
it and we don't want our motivation
algorithm to leak out because that would
ruin us but it's even more ok because
the same skunkworks engineering team
that developed the emotive vacation
algorithm has also come up with the
solution to the problem it turns out
cloud functions are the solution to the
problem
so cloud functions allow us to take our
already written JavaScript and motivic
ation algorithm on louie developed on
ojs and port it over and the deploy to
the cloud where it solves all of our
problems first of all we only have to
write it once and then we can hook it up
to all of our apps because cloud
functions integrate wonderfully with the
rest of the firebase SDK and it also
allows us to run on Google servers in
the cloud which is it turns out or
plugged into mains electricity and since
its deploy to the cloud we don't have to
worry about people extracting
information from our deployed apps so we
have a solution we have a plan and we
have some JavaScript the first thing to
do to appease the VCS is of course to
update the architecture slide since this
is how they think this is where we left
off before we have our application on
one side
that this is all the different
applications all the platforms
they're using the firebase SDK to
communicate with the database and
storage this is how stuff gets
synchronized between them so we're going
to ship the apps up a little bit and
we're going to plop call functions right
here called functions when integrating a
firebase kind of act like another client
it's like a super client sits there all
the time and can always watch for
changes that happen make all those heavy
lifting operations and then push them
back to firebase to the database into
storage
where the clients will automatically get
notified it's just like as if another
client is the update so I could talk
about this all day but why don't I just
show you with some code sound good
switch back to the code so here we are
and we have down in the lower corner cat
is our JavaScript whiz and she has been
the one who develop this emotive
vacation algorithm so she will take the
helm today and as you can see she
started out with a few imports like our
motivation algorithm but she's ready to
get coding so the first thing you're
going to do is you're going to write out
a function header this is where you
actually wire it up to the firebase
database here you can see that it is has
a temp to firebase and it is listening
for writes on that location because
we're integrating with the already
existing app this list this is the same
location where our stories appear today
it's going to behave just like an app so
we're going to have a snapshot handy so
the next thing we're going to do is
we're going to unpack the title with
boring old text from the snapshot then
we're going to do the magic we're going
to take that title and we're going to
pass it off to our emotive occation
algorithm which will take the title in
and a wonderful stream of emoji will
come out finally we're going to take
that a Mota fide title we're going to
snatch it back in to the database in a
new field of in the each story that gets
updated but we have to do one more thing
before we can deploy it the behavior for
triggering on functions
a little bit different than on the
clients it will actually trigger for
each right instead of on the slightly
more specific child added event so we're
going to add a short circuit up to the
top to make sure that we don't actually
accidentally Rhea modify something
that's already been processed and with
that we're ready to deploy so we're
going to go on deploy that code up to
the cloud and here's the really cool
part our applications were already aware
of this field when they display the
stories so we don't have to deploy the
apps you don't have to recompile the
Android app we can just run it and all
the new titles they get added are
automatically going to get a modified
and people can be super happy looking at
all those little tiny pictures and
that's great because because we're saved
now right we have a load in our app and
we can buy that Kombucha on tap hold on
wait what
my friend dog is calling and my friend
dog says we've been mislabelling dogs
people are really bad at identifying
dogs and call them cheap and oh my god
and what's that
you're afraid people will upload bad
photo who would do bad things on the
Internet
I know cat photos yeah you can see the
temptation yeah all right well it looks
like we have some more work cut out for
us so let's go back to the slides
because I've got an idea
we'll be able to use machine learning we
will be able to fix this problem and I
bet we'll be able to get the B C's on
board if we can say we're using machine
learning how can we use it well
we'll still have people upload their
photos same as before but instead of
making them type in the title we'll just
figure out what's in the image and
perform our vegetation on that and while
we're there you know
people seem to really enjoy not having
to read in fact I'm not really sure my
friend dog can read at all in fact I'm
not sure my friend dog can type so
getting rid of the title is probably a
great move we can also get rid of the
complicated images
just get rid of those and keep the super
simple beautiful emoji so our apple
looks something like this just a giant
stream of emoji it'll be fantastic but
we spend all of our time engineering on
the emotive vacation algorithm and we
haven't spent any time on machine
learning well good thing we're at Google
i/o and cloud has some api's that can
help us with this so let's just put a
cloud on it every fire-based project is
also a cloud project that means we can
use the same project to access the cloud
API in the cloud SDKs in this case let's
make use of the vision API which will
allow us to look at an image determine
what's in that and based on that we'll
be able to go ahead and perform our
multiplication algorithm and spit out a
stream of emotion so where's the spit in
our architecture diagram here for gem
left us off we have cloud functions now
which acts as a special client that can
listen to firebase now we just need a
little bit of room to fit in one more
new icon so we'll just shift everything
over and see em we have room for cloud
vision API will create a new cloud
function which runs in a secure
environment so we can put in our project
information so we can talk directly to
the cloud vision API do that intense
computation and write it using the cloud
function back to the database so let's
code one last time the first thing we're
going to want to do here is actually
hook up to the vision API and once again
you'll want to be focusing here in the
bottom left we're using here our
firebase project's credentials the same
ID and we're going to make use of the
Cloud SDK as well as the Cloud Storage
SDK as well so now that we've hooked up
our API we're going to go ahead and
define a new function it's listening to
the same place in the database because
we want to pick up those same images
we're still listening on rights so we
can fire off multiple functions from the
same place but instead of grabbing the
title which we no longer have we're
going to want to grab the image using
the file path that Frank's so kindly
snuck in for us earlier once we have the
file path we'll be able to use the
storage SDK to grab a reference to that
file
and with this new reference we'll be
able to go ahead and have set to the
vision API to detect labels and find out
what is in our image once we have the
label the response from the vision API
we want to filter out for just the label
and then we can modify those labels once
we have our emoji the last thing we need
to do is write it back to our database
here instead of writing to the same
location we're going to write to a new
location emojis this allows us to
differentiate between who can write and
view stories versus who can look at the
emoji and honestly everyone deserves
emoji so we're going to open this up to
the world so we'll deploy our new
function and any new images will now get
emoji five and labeled automatically
will update the client so that they now
listen to the emojis field instead of
the story's field
and we'll start getting a stream of
emoji a nice definitely comprehensible
stream of emoji so what do you think
Mike you think we're going to be able to
get that funding we need
I don't know cat I say let's let our
first couple users take a crack at it
and see what they think in the meantime
we'll do a quick recap because it's back
to slides please at the beginning of the
talk I presented this problem how do we
build an app in under an hour that we
can present to our investors and Frank
came on stage and showed us the easiest
way to do that to use firebase Google's
mobile platform to build your
application for Android iOS and the web
he used firebase authentication to
securely sign-in our users cloud storage
to upload and share those files and the
real-time database to synchronize file
metadata across all of our clients
firebase lets you build your app
incredibly quickly without having to
worry about managing servers or
infrastructure writing your own
authentication or authorization code or
dealing with database synchronization
then Jen and Kat showed us how to extend
our apps functionality using cloud
functions and the cloud vision API these
features supercharged our application
and let us protect our proprietary
emotive ocation algorithms which even
though all of you have seen they're
still secrets trust me and enhance those
algorithms using the power of machine
learning and unfortunately since you all
don't work with cat Jenny and Frank we
provided a number of other tools in
firebase to provide that level of
support when you have to go and build
your application and pitch to your
investors firebase offers high quality
developer documentation in a number of
languages developer tools integrated
with Android studio and your other
favorite IDs and high-quality free
technical support if you're interested
in diving deeper into any of these
concepts with fire
case there are a number of other talks
available today and tomorrow over on
stage seven in the main area and all of
us and our team members will be
available in sandbox H if you have any
additional question so let's check in on
those users again and give them a call
hey what did you think of the app hmm
sorry so you don't think a stream of
emoji is a particularly useful app uh
hey that's not great news team
what are you doing cat I'm coding okay
can you speed that up we have five
minutes before our members are calling
you're done how did you finish so fast
I'm really quick okay well let's see
what cat did so we need to prove to our
investors that this app has traction so
I need everyone in the audience to go to
mosaic dot IO mosaic with a J because
that makes sense and start playing
around with the app can we switch back
to screen number one please take a look
at what cat whipped up in that 30
seconds that was really impressive cat
yeah you know it can we get screen one
please or everyone go to mo che io sign
in with your Google account and what's
happening is you take a photo we use our
proprietary and motivic ation algorithm
to generate the stream of emojis and
then I was talking to some of our
investors earlier and they told me that
mobile social viral gaming is really
popular for some reason so I guess
that's what Kat did she created a social
game where you build thank you all by
the way for helping fill this in a
larger emoji because that's what the
world needs
so hopefully this goes well and we'll be
able to get a giant ball pit full of
gummi bears at our startup thank you all
very much and enjoy the rest of i/o</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
