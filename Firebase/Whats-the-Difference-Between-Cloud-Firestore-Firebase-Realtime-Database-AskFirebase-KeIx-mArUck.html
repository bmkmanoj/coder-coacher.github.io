show where we answer all of your
firebase questions I'm Jenn person and
today I'm joined by Todd Kerpelman hi
we're here for a very special cloud
firestore version of ask firebase all
your questions today are all about cloud
firestore and hopefully we have some
answers well Tyler on Twitter he asks
our auto-generated keys in cloud fire
store based on timestamp like it is in
the real time database and if not how
can I create document data ordered by
document key all right so I hear you
know the answer to this I do not know
the answer to this I've learned this
actually when we were doing our latest
0/2 app talk at the firebase developer
summit because we took the existing app
that we had for translation and we
changed it to use cloud fire store and
that's when it occurred to us that no it
does not actually use auto-generated
keys using a timestamp the way that the
real time database does do you know why
not why don't my fun fact
so apparently there's one of the kind of
strange but true limits to cloud fire
store is that there's a limit to how
many rights you can perform within a
collection on fields that have
sequential are very close to sequential
value which is kind of a weird obscure
limit that you'll probably never run
into but we have to worry about it when
we're generating like massive
collections that might have a time stamp
or a time stamp based auto-generated
document key and it's you know 500
rights per second which again for a
small or medium sized app is probably
fine but you know we want to make sure a
cloud firestore can scale to like
millions upon millions of users so we
decide to go with sort of a more opaque
document ID not one that's time-based
yeah good news is of course you can
still query document data by create a
date using a timestamp which is actually
what we ended up doing in our app so we
added a timestamp and then we ordered by
that so we'll go ahead and link to that
as well so you explicitly did you do it
on the client orgy do it with a cloud
function we did it on the client all
right but I mean yeah we could have done
both yeah either one we're either do
whatever works for for your app just do
remember there is that like 500 rights
per second when you have fields with
sequential values limit
but again like for a chat app or
anything like that you should be funny
cool cool
so this next question comes from a whole
lot of you can I do text searching or
like queries with Claude firestorm have
you run into this I have seen this
question I guess the answer is not
natively and this is because in general
cloud fire stores built with a
philosophy that basically every query
has to be fast like it's basically
impossible to build a slow query in
cloud fire store and we sort of did that
intentionally because we don't want you
in a situation where like you suddenly
have to re architect your entire
database structure because you know
you've hit a million users and things
are getting slow now this does mean that
every query you run in cloud fire store
has to be supported by an index and it
turns out sort of doing like a full-text
search with an index is kind of either
really tricky or impossible depending on
how you're trying to do it because you
know you can't really index for like
every character that's in a text string
so there are sort of some solutions that
involve third party libraries like algo
Lea or elasticsearch and basically what
you're gonna do is you're gonna supply
your text to them and then you can run
your text on these services or run your
search on these services and they'll
give you back a list of documents that
you could then query on cloud firestore
directly so would that be a good use
case maybe to use cloud functions for
firebase to maybe do that search and
then why yes that would be yes
actually a perfect example for using
cloud functions like yeah anytime you
notice the document gets updated you'll
probably want to do the work to make
sure that gets copied over to algo Lea
or elasticsearch or whatever third party
solution you're using and if you check
our documentation there's a solution
section that actually describes all this
in full detail so you don't have to
figure it out all in your own you can
just kind of copy and paste what we did
sweet yeah okay the next question also
comes from a lot of you which is why did
you make a new database instead of just
fixing the old real-time date of this
didn't think the old one is broken it's
just they just work differently I don't
think it would have been possible for
the team to have sort of added all the
features they did kind of the new data
structure the querying capabilities the
sort of you know shallow queries and
sort of all the scalability on the
existing infrastructure or you know if
they had somehow managed to like cram a
document database into the current
real-time database it would have been
sort of a giant non backwards compatible
kind of mess that would have broken all
your code anyway and probably ended up
being worse product so uh you know I
think in this case creating a separate
database was really the smart move and
you know all of you who are using the
real-time database continue to use that
everything just keeps working just fine
of course if you can't think of a way we
could have done it that would have
elegantly served the needs to new and
existing customers let us know cos you
know maybe we'll offer you an
engineering position because that sounds
like hard work absolutely yeah sort of
along those same lines I've seen a lot
of people asking you know what is the
difference between the two databases and
I think you sort of anticipated already
that people were going to be asking
about this I did cuz there was a blog
post will link to it somewhere though
cuz you know every time you use view the
blog I get more like hits and I don't
know that makes me look cooler we're
listening so when you come to us with
questions or suggestions that's really
how we end up making our products better
and I think cloud firestore is really a
result of listening to what people had
to say about the real time database yeah
I'd agree if you've been trying this
stuff and you have any other feedback or
something like you know you can either
let us know in the comments below or if
you see me on the street just grab me
and be like hey I got another cloud
firestore request and I'll be like ok
but let go of me first and then you can
tell me all about it that's when you
know you really made it when you're
walking down the street and somebody
asks you a question about firebase yeah
I have not gotten to that point yet but
but if I do I guess I'll know it I've
made it up so you know what to do then
when you have your questions make sure
you post them on social media or Stack
Overflow with the hashtag ask firebase
and maybe you'll see them on a future
episode we're still doing this thing we
did like that hash tag I don't know I'm
really trying to like let that go all
right you know that's okay maybe that
was kind of a season 1 thing we're on to
season 2 yeah we're on to season 2 now
yeah all right thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you on a future
episode of ask firebase
all right it's gone it's done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
