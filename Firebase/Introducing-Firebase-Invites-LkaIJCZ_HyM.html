nobody's there to hear it does it make a
sound more importantly if your app gets
published to the world and nobody's
there to download it was all that work
for nothing
these aren't just philosophical
questions discovery is a major issue for
everybody it doesn't matter if you're a
two person shop or a big corporation and
while there are many avenues for
potential customers to discover your app
one of the most common is through
recommendations from friends and family
developers know this which is why you
see referral codes like this in a lot of
apps it's a good way of enticing users
to share the app with their friends but
while these kinds of referral codes can
be effective they're also kind of a pain
to use is your user really going to take
the time and effort to copy and paste a
referral code into an email send it off
to their friends hope those friends then
find and install the app dig up whatever
code redemption screen they need to
redeem this offer and copy and paste
this code back into your app well maybe
but maybe not
and while you could build your own UI to
help this process along with you know
all those spare engineering cycles
you've just got lying around this is
also where firebase invites can help
firebase invites makes it easy for your
users to share all aspects of your app
be it a referral code or an interesting
piece of content across both Android and
iOS it looks something like this let's
say that your app has a referral code
that you'd like your users to share with
their friends and you decide to use
firebase invites to make it happen when
your user clicks that share button
they'll see a dialog listing all their
friends and colleagues with some smart
recommendations at the top they choose
which friends to share with click send
and these invitations are sent along
with a personal message over SMS or
email depending on the contact their
friends receive a customized richly
formatted invitation either one you've
designed yourself or one you've let
firebase invites build automatically
from your app store listing all this
recipient needs to do is click on the
call to action button and firebase
invites will take them directly to the
app if they already have it or the
appropriate App Store for their device
if they don't once they're done
installing your app firebase invites can
then send the referral code to your app
through a deep link and you can send
your new customer the discount that they
so richly deserve and yes this really
does work even
if that friend had to install the app
first traditionally deep links tend to
get lost during app installs but invites
uses fire based dynamic links which are
able to survive the app store
installation process as an added bonus
many developers have found that not only
are these kind of invites more
successful at driving installs but that
users who join through this kind of
personalized onboarding flow are more
likely to come back to your app in the
future and firebase invites isn't just
for referral codes you can use it to
share any content you want from your app
have a recipe app firebase invites can
make sure that killer lemon meringue pie
recipe gets the visibility that it
deserves
and because invites is a fire based
product it works with firebase analytics
to let you know when a user has opened
or installed an app through an invite so
be sure to check out the documentation
and give firebase invites a try we can't
wait to see what you build</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
