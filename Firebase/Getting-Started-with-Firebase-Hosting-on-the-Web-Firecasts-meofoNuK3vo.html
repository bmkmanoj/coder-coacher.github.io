I'm going to get you up and running with
firebase hosting barbets hosting is
production-grade static hosting for
developers and with firebase hosting you
can deploy web apps to a global content
delivery network in a single command and
also every deployed app is automatically
provisioned an SSL certificate today I'm
going to show you just how easy it is to
deploy your web app with firebase
hosting so let's get go so I want to
deploy out this app to firebase hosting
and if this app looks familiar to you
it's because it's the app that we
created in the fire based storage
QuickStart and if you want to see that
then you can just click this little
annotation right here so to get this app
deployed I'm going to open up the
terminal and the first thing I need to
do is to install the firebase tools and
I can do that through NPM with NPM
install - G firebase - tools so take me
through a little bit of an install and
then once it's done I'm ready to
initialize my app for firebase hosting
so to tell firebase hosting everything
it needs to know to deploy my app I'm
going to write a command called firebase
init and what you'll notice is outside
of this spectacular emoji art is that it
asks you two questions and the two
questions are what's features do you
want to set up for the folder that
you're currently in in the features we
can configure our database and that
would be for the database rules and then
hosting for our site in our case we know
that we want to setup for hosting so I'm
going to select that option and the
first thing that it asks you to do is it
wants to associate your firebase project
with your app so you have your project
in the console right here and this has
you know the side nav of all the cool
firebase features and then you also have
your web app that you know uses these
features and so we're going to associate
this project right here with this web
app and the name of my project is called
web QuickStart so I'm going to scroll
down and select it now this next
question is specific for users that are
using the real time database it's going
to ask what file
should be used for the database security
rules if you're not familiar with the
database security rules you essentially
have this database that has all this
data and you want to secure it so you
know who can access what parts of your
database but in this case I'm not really
using the real time database so I'm just
going to create the default file now
this next question is pretty important
it's going to ask us what we want to use
as our public directory and the public
directory is usually the directory that
contains your index.html file which you
know is the entry point of our
application and in my case I usually
stick all of that into a folder called
public so the next question is for
single page app users so if you're
building an app with angular ember
polymer or any JavaScript framework
where you're setting everything up as a
single page app then you usually have to
deal with the hash bang in your url
routes
well firebase hosting gives you a
feature to be able to rewrite all these
URLs so you can actually use just
regular server routing so if you are
doing that then you want to use this
option but in my case I'm just using a
single index that HTML app that's going
to ask me if some files exists like 4 4
and index that HTML so I'm just going to
not overwrite those and it's going to do
all of its initialization work and we
can see down here that initialization is
complete so with initialization complete
I can finally go out and deploy my app
and to do that it's just one simple
command firebase deploy
and just like that our website is out
there on the web so you can see we can
access our website through this URL
right here or we can use the CLI to open
it so to open the website through the
CLI I'm going to type firebase open and
it's going to give us a couple of
options and I'm going to scroll down to
hosting deployed sites and just like
that you see that we have our website
hosted right out onto the web so now
that I have this deployed what I want to
do is I want to make a change and I'm
not going to wanted to play this change
to production I'm going to want to
display it to a staging or a QA site or
something like that
so I'm going to go back into my app and
I'm going to make this change and it's
pretty significant and now that the
change has been made I want to set up a
staging environment and to do that I can
use this command called firebase use
dash dash ad and what this command is
going to do it's going to say well you
have all these other firebase projects
would you like to use one of them to set
up a different deployment to another
domain and in this case I do and I want
to select web quick start staging then
it's going to ask what alias I want to
use for this project and it's my staging
site so I'm going to call it staging and
now it's created this alias and just to
show you what's happening behind the
scenes I'm going to cat out this fire
base RC file or as I like to call it
firebase ursy and this file is just a
JSON object with our different
environments and using the CLI I can
switch back and forth by using firebase
use in its alias name so use default
will get us back to our production and
then use staging will throw us back to
our staging environment and since we are
using our staging environment I can now
deploy my changes to staging so let's
type firebase deploy and then now I'll
do another firebase open and then go to
I supplied website and just like that I
have my huge change onto my staging
website and that's all it takes it a
ploy a web app to firebase hosting and
if you want to learn more check out the
link to the official documentation so
now my question for you is what kind of
web apps are you two pulling like do you
use a framework like angular or polymer
what are your tools of choice so that's
all for today I will see you all in the
comments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
