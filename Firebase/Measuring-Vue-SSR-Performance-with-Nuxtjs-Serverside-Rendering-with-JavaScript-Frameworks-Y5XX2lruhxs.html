okay I was almost about to just like
literally go into the guts of it and I'm
like oh wait no I have to greet you
hello everyone welcome back to the
server-side rendering with JavaScript
framework series today we're gonna take
the app we made in the last video which
was with Knux in UJS on firebase hosting
and we're going to profile it with the
chrome dev tools and webpagetest we're
gonna take a look at how fast it loads
and when the app becomes interactive so
let's dive down to the laptop and get
started so here I'm the app in chrome
and I'm going to open up the dev tools
to inspect the performance so in the
network panel I want to throttle to a
fast 3G connection and then make sure
the cache is disabled so now I'm going
to click on performance and then hit
this little refresh button which will
start the profiling
know when that finishes we have this
nice little film strip of screenshots
and the network waterfall below and I'm
going to highlight everything up until
about 15 hundred milliseconds so we can
actually now go and inspect what
happened onload so you can see that our
HTML took about nine milliseconds to
return which is really really fast
however we have all these assets after
that so we have a JavaScript CSS and
everything and if we take a look we can
see that the longest asset was almost a
second in loading and if we go down to
the main thread we can see that we have
this evaluate script block and that's
saying that at this point the main
thread of the browser was just crushing
through all this script it's only after
this script that we consider this
application to be interactive so this is
just a throttled connection on my laptop
so rather than just do sort of this you
know little tests I'd rather do a real
test on a real device so to do that I'm
going to go out to web page test so
inter in my URL and I'm going to go down
to Advanced Settings we're going to
change it to a slow 3G and I'm going to
then make sure
the browser is set to moto G for Chrome
so it's on a mobile device now I'm gonna
start the test and when it's done you
can see that the load time came back at
1.7 seconds which is pretty good and if
you look at the first byte the first
byte came in just under a second we
didn't start rendering to 1.3 seconds
and it was an interactive in around 2
seconds so to see more details I'm gonna
go and click on the filmstrip view I'm
gonna scroll back to the beginning of
the film strip and you can see that
right about 670 milliseconds is when the
HTML finished but we couldn't render
until the CSS finished which happened
which took 215 milliseconds after the
HTML was finished so actually we could
have done this a little faster maybe if
we inline to the CSS but you can see
right here that after the 215
milliseconds are up there's this big
purple block at the bottom and that
right there is the browser laying out
the sites and then once that's done we
have our site rendered in at about 1.4
seconds now we saw that the interactive
happened in around 2 seconds but our
filmstrip stops at about 1.4 seconds so
we can't really see what's going on with
the JavaScript execution so when this
happens I actually go back to the main
page and in the main page I now go to
this timeline button and this tie line
is effectively the chrome dev tools for
this run so what I can do here is I can
take a look at the network request so
you can see that it took you know about
660 milliseconds to get the HTML back
and then we have all of our JavaScript
assets and our CSS and that took about
760 milliseconds for the heaviest one to
come back and you can see down here that
we have the evaluate script block and it
finishes right before two seconds and we
know that after this it's all quiets
there's nothing else on the main thread
so right around two seconds is when this
app becomes interactive so you can see
that evaluating when the JavaScript
actually exit
is really important in determining when
the app becomes interactive so while we
do get our HTML first and we get that
really fast first meaningful paint we
have to look to see when that JavaScript
finishes because that's when the user
can actually interact with the
application but that's all for today if
you like this video make sure to LIKE
and subscribe and I will see you all
next time
see you soon Steve last video is which
was which was with everyone welcome to
the performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
