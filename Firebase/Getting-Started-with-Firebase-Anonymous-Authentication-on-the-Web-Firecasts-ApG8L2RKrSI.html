today's episode of fire cast I'm going
to be covering anonymous authentication
and just as a reminder this is just one
episode an entire playlist on firebase
in the web so you should subscribe to
that to get notified every time we drop
a new video but today we're going to
learn anonymous authentication which is
personally my favorite form of
authentication because you can actually
log in a user without getting any
information for them no email password
they don't have to do any oh oh ah you
know redirect you can just click a
button and log them in and then once
they're ready to become a real user you
can just merge them into a real account
so let's see how we get started so just
like always when we're working with
firebase authentication we're going to
be working in this fire based off
namespace so for anonymous
authentication it's pretty simple we
call the method auth dot sign in
anonymously and what you might notice
here is that there aren't any parameters
to this function and that's because
there is nothing required from the user
so with email and password we have to
provide an email and a password but for
all sign-in anonymously there's no
parameters at all and while social login
also doesn't require any parameters it
does require the user to go to the
social sign-in screen and then back to
your app whereas this all happens inside
the context of your app so what good is
anonymous authentication for well like
you probably know already it is great
for just getting guest users into your
app and once they decide they want to
stick around you can link them to an
identified account like with an email
and password or with a social provider
like Google so to log out we can just do
what we usually do which is all that
sign out so off sign in anonymously will
return to us a promise and the nature of
a promises is it allows us to
asynchronously resolve the users data
but a promise only fires off one time so
if we want to monitor authentication
state in real time we need to use the
method auth on/off state changed and
this takes in a
call back and this call back fires off
every single time there is a change in
our authentication states
you know hence on off state changed so
if no one is logged in this user
parameter will be null but if someone is
logged in it will be populated with the
current user so let's go and do a little
demo app to see how all three of these
methods work together so right here I
have my demo app to the left and I have
my code editor to the right so what I
have right here is a login button which
you can see right here in the dom and an
unseen log out button which is right
here in the dom and it has this class of
hide which keeps it hidden so what I
want to do is I want to add a click
listener to log in and then be able to
log the user in which will trigger the
visibility of the logout button so I
want to go into my app j/s which is
sourced right here inside of Appius I
have my firebase project configured
which you can get all this information
in the firebase console so now that it's
set up I want to get the elements from
the Dom so I'm just going to get BTN
login and BTN log outs so now I want to
add the click listener to this login
button so click event listener BTN login
add event listener click and then do the
callback function and inside of this
callback function this is where I'm
going to call auth dot sign in
anonymously so refresh the page and pulp
the console and now I'm going to click
login and honestly and oh we have an
error so this error says the given
sign-in provider is disabled for this
firebase project enable it in the
firebase console well that's pretty easy
so here in the firebase console I'm in
my project inside the auth tab and I
want to go over here and click sign-in
method so click that and you can see we
have email and password enabled but I'm
also going to go and enable anonymous
and with that enabled I can refresh and
click the button one more time and
nothing happens which makes sense
because all we're doing is calling
sign-in anonymously we're not actually
getting at user data back so to get that
user data I'm going to add the
authentication state listener so
firebase dot off thought on off state
changed which we know takes in a
function that returns a firebase user so
let's log that user to the console and
let's refresh the page and just like
that our user is logged in to the
console because we had click this button
earlier and I'm going to open up this
user and there are two properties which
are very interesting the first is is
anonymous so this actually provides you
a property to determine whether your
user is an anonymous user and in this
case it's obviously true and the second
is the UID so this is the unique
identifier for this firebase user so
this is what you use in security rules
so a lot of times people will ask why do
I even need an anonymous user I can just
save their data to the real-time
database and then once they want to be
an authenticated user I can just create
that account for them so while you can
do that it's not necessarily secure
because anyone can go and modify that
data but if you authenticated them
anonymously you can then protect their
data even if they don't have an
identified account yet
so now that we are getting the user to
the console let's display the logout
button so now I'll check if the firebase
user exists we're logged in so let's
remove the class of hide from the logout
button else let's take the logout button
and add the class of hide because the
user doesn't exist therefore we're
logged out so I'm going to refresh the
page and we can see the logout button so
let's go and click it and nothing
happens because there isn't an event
wired up to the logout button so right
here I'm going to add a click event
listener for log outs and just clarify
that this one's for login
and I'm going to say BTN log out at
eventlistener
click then provide the callback function
so inside of here when I log out all I
have to do is call fire based off dot
sign outs so I'm going to go and refresh
this page I'm going to click log out and
we're logged out login and now we can
log out and really I could just do this
all day and just like that we have
implemented anonymous authentication
into our app so that's everything you
need to know to get started with
anonymous authentication and if you want
to learn more make sure you check out
the docs which the link is in the
description and also if you like this
video make sure to LIKE and subscribe so
you can stay up to date with all the
content that we post here on the
firebase Channel and before I go I have
a question for you what are you going to
use anonymous authentication for so just
let us know in the comments so that's
all for today I will see you all later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
