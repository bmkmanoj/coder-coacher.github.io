we get to meet the Googlers that make
fire Bay Packer my name is Doug
Stephenson and on the show with me is
the co-founder of firebase James Bamford
okay hey Doug great to have you on the
show great to be here
the first thing I want to know from you
is I asked everyone this where are you
from so I was born and raised just west
of London England and then I moved to
Minnesota when I was in high school
sois around the u.s. for a while been in
San Francisco now for about eight years
you were the second Brit we've had on
the show I'm always surprised at how
diverse our employees are they're from
everywhere around the world
there's like an unusually high number of
Brit to work on firebase and develop a
product group at Google is there a
reason for that I have no I mean I think
that's a big London office so can we
kind of all like migrate for the Sun
yeah I did as well I grew up in Ohio
living here I do not deal with the snow
and I'm very happy about that
yeah it's kind of nice you're a
co-founder which means there's another
person involved here so Andrew Lee is
the other co-founder who we saw dancing
with Lauren long in the last episode how
did you meet him Andrew and I actually
met in high school in Minnesota so he
United three years of high school
together I think the first time we met
was in French class and we there was a
project where we work together you had
to like create a fictitious French
business and market it and so like
everyone else was creating like
brochures and flyers and we ended up
like building a website for it so that
was that was our first time meeting and
working together and I guess that was 17
years ago now wow that sounds like a lot
of fun what else did you work on with
him before firebase we actually had four
different startups together or I guess
three before firebase really this being
the fourth we initially started out in
the summer of 2008 right when Apple like
gave you the ability to build apps for
the iPhone we started out building
fingerprint sensor for the iPhone so you
could make a credit card transaction
then it will come to your phone for
approval oh really
hardware is difficult so that one failed
then we built social networks because
they were like all the rage at the time
sure that went somewhat well got a lot
of users made absolutely no money the
third one was chat software it was like
facebook chat
for any website that did really really
well but our largest customers started
doing very very strange things with it
and we sort of scratched our heads and
they wanted all this customization and
features and functionality that you know
we just couldn't provide so we kind of
stripped away the interface for the chat
system and made the architecture
accessible via an API and that was what
became the firebase real time database
so you kind of pivoted from being a chat
provider to more of just the sort of a
generalized system exactly those so data
synchronization we which is you know the
direction we were going turns out you
can sort of melt model any application
state change through data sync that's
how we how we landed and there's not I'm
not happy to go more into it if you'd
like or but but yeah that's that's kind
of the the bare bones of how we got
started okay yeah that's an interesting
origin story it seems like with startups
you kind of have to fail a lot and kind
of figure out what's going on and then
it's not until later that you figure out
what you actually want to do sometimes
exactly I know like it's actually funny
because when we move from the social
network to the chat system like we we
basically wanted our users to be able to
interact with him social network and
there was no good like chat like system
help there and like real-time on the web
was like a complete mess WebSockets
weren't a thing yet and so we decided
hey there's a bigger market over here
and so after doing that you know from
social network to chat we went from chat
to firebase I was actually at a number
of startups as well and I came to Google
from a start-up we have like you which
one was that
so with Paul style we were going in
application performance monitoring our
startup was pretty small so we only had
five people and we came from like all
over the Bay Area as part of that we
never really had a chance to build up a
company culture like we were all just
heads down trying to make this startup
work as you know it's very challenging
yep and I noticed that firebase has a
distinct company culture that survived
even as it was folded into Google so
Google has it's sort of established
culture and firebase has something
different tell me what makes the
firebase culture extra special so we've
sort of just we had a set of nine values
when we were an independent company and
we've distilled those down to just three
now but we still try and live and
breathe those three so I think the first
is this is your happy place initially
founded a startup because I had a series
of jobs where my colleagues were just
looking at clock waiting to go home and
I decided I had to do that for 40 years
that would that would be not good for my
psyche and just felt like a waste of
time so we started this with the the
belief that happy employees are more
productive they feel a better sense of
purpose they enriched the days of their
co-workers so that was kind of a big
focus for us and so we tried to make it
fairly meritocratic we tried to give
everyone input we tried to like sand
down rough corners and edges we asked
you know almost everyone to take on the
the founder mentality and this is your
happy place was a big focus and I think
like a lot of things came out of that I
think culture is ultimately defined as
how people like treat each other like in
the absence of some like you know formal
process or you know somebody like
forcing them behavior a particular way
like a code of conduct it's not exactly
exactly but it's sort of like self
distributing I think you have these
unwritten rules and then you have these
very explicit things for example we have
these silly holidays that come up so we
have bring a pineapple to work day that
was you know firing your pineapple to
work day what does that mean so my
co-founder Andrew brought pineapple into
work one day and it was just like him
and I like - two of us working on I
think that the chat startup who it was
and I was like why do you have a
pineapple he turned to me and he says is
bring your pineapple to work day see
it's on the calendar and you quickly put
it on the calendar and so the next year
comes around and we you know have
employees now and one of them just like
shows up with a pineapple and we were
like why do you have a pineapple and he
was like I don't know is on the calendar
and so you know it's been like six years
now that we've been doing this and it
sort of escalated and escalated and now
you know we have like sliced pineapple
and you know apples called pine and
people in pineapple costumes and like
every June 27th we have bring a
pineapple to work day and I think it it
represents the silly fun like this is
your happy place
spirit that we we try and embody oh
that's that's amazing I've never had an
experience like that where a company
just invent a holiday and everyone sort
of a takes it seriously but invests in
it then it becomes a fun thing and then
just to finish that point off there's a
bunch of other of these similar days is
kind of a tradition where you can now
throw something on the calendar
it'll just appear so there's like
Snuggie day and Snuggie day people wear
snug yes I would get very hot doing
personally that's amazing I love that
that people have the ability to sort of
create and invest in their own company
culture I think that's I think that's
fantastic I think one of the other
really unique things and you and I are
very fortunate is the the type of
audience that we serve we get to
interact with one on one and you're
you're sort of giving we we are you know
providing a bunch of Lego bricks and
like we have no idea what people are
going to make with these Lego bricks and
it like blows my mind every time
something comes up like the World Health
Organization a couple years back from me
Ebola outbreak happened they they built
all of their outbreak tracking software
with firebase oh really
and it stuff like that to just you know
you look at and and it really brings a
lot of satisfaction and pride to the
things we build and it makes you want to
keep coming to work mm-hmm yeah and you
mentioned the way we interact with
developers is kind of a sort of a key
value in firebase and so sometimes I
hear people around the office talk about
the firebase voice tell me what is that
yeah so developers I think are fairly
different than typical consumers because
they are investing so deeply in your
products and the product has sort of
such a myriad of things you can do with
it and edge cases like you're not going
to get it right all the time number one
and number two they depend so heavily on
it so many people bet their startups a
little bit their careers on it and so
you you really want to build trust and
so all of our communications seek to
build trust that's kind of like the
North Star or the end goal and in order
to do that we have sort of a number of
different ways like first of all is you
try and add as much value as you can so
sort of minimizing buzzwords like great
or awesome and giving tangible value
sort of answering a question quite you
know forthrightly to is is being very
humble and being very helpful so because
there are such a number of edge cases
and because our audiences you know maybe
often from multi-million with the
product and you know the person at all
- I think you always we always strive to
be you know quite humble and take a very
helpful approach as opposed to saying
hey this is what you should be doing you
know really listening first and then
responding sounds like that's worked out
pretty well so far because developers as
far as I understand are you know loving
especially fire based real-time database
with firebase platform in general and it
sounds like that goes a long way towards
developing that sense of trust and
relationship with developers I think
you're also we know when you're building
a community you you want a lot of
bottoms up
which I think drives very very nicely
with Google's culture here but when
you're building a developer community
you don't want to drive the agenda as
much as you want you know the people
using your platform to you know
influence your roadmap or you know have
meetups or you know share best practices
you know if we were just doing
everything it wouldn't be a very good
community and we you know we wouldn't be
a very good platform so we you know we
really try and be an equal among among
our developers yeah it's been amazing to
see what they build around firebase
especially in the community as well as
in their own abs I think that's a great
way of stimulating interest in the
product now you mentioned before just a
little while ago the firebase platform
was expanded one year ago at Google i/o
2016 and the original offering also just
had a five year anniversary
how exciting are these things for you
yeah I'm thrilled it blows me away that
like five years later we've had you know
such uptake and Google is putting so
much resources behind firebase and
expanding it from the three products to
the 15 as we talked about earlier you
see the things people are building with
that you see you know we've had 1
million projects created since last May
Google i/o and I just feel very happy
yeah and I know an developers out there
are also feeling very grateful that they
can have a back-end now that they don't
have to manage I mean I feel that a lot
as well but why first got into Android
development one of the things that I
dreaded was trying to figure out how I
was going to come up with a back-end
from I have right I want to focus on the
app not the backend and now those tools
are finally coming to fruition so I feel
like I'm in the receiving category of
that as well yeah well I'm excited to
see what happens also at
no this year I know you won't tell us
anything about that on this show at
least but we can look forward to great
things at i/o this year right yes so i/o
is back at the shoreline amphitheater
for the second year in a row which is
really exciting
firebase will be in the main keynote and
we also have a good chunk of breakout
sessions so definitely you either tune
in to the live stream or if you're
coming in person stop by our sandbox
area and say hello to all of us
definitely stop by and say hi I'll be
there most of the day every day because
I love talking with developers you'll be
speaking right you have a session I do
so yeah I will be giving an overview of
including some of our new launches and
I'm just a general overview of the
platform as well all right well I can't
wait to see what that's all about
now I will do with you the same as I do
with all of my other guests I will put
you on the spot with a little game this
game is very straight forward but also
very difficult firebase platform
launched at i/o with 15 different
features we released a new feature
recently at cloud NEX named them all as
fast as you can and we'll put a timer up
on the screen to see how long this takes
oh my gosh yep are you ready ago so we
had the original three we had the
real-time database then we built
firebase authentication then we built
firebase hosting then we added the other
back end as a service product so we
added five a storage we added or we
brought in five s Cloud messaging choose
the GCM lsdm we added five those
functions at cloud next a couple months
ago we have the app quality products we
have fashioned porting we have test lab
which is something a purify acquisition
and then we have the growth products
dynamic links we have app invites we
have app indexing we have notifications
we had Adwords and AdMob and then
underneath it all we have 5x analytics
that's 15 there's one left
I think I miss one of the back end one
it's in the gril pillar is oh gosh
dynamic links notifications indexing
invites AdWords AdMob remote contact
well config there you go that's 16 a
good job I'll have five you for that one
thank you for that I feel terrible now
there's one of my own products well like
I said it's a very difficult game
everybody
out yeah they're not second-class
citizens there they're very important to
us they'll love you this show beat
firebase and set its own milestone so
this is our 10th episode awesome and
we're going to take a break here as we
get ready for Google i/o because it's a
ton of work so we're gonna take a break
in filming will come back after Google
i/o with people who have worked on some
of the new features I think that are
going to be announced if you're not able
