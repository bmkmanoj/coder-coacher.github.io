is Sam Ramsay and I lead product
management for developer products at
Google it's an absolute pleasure to be
here with you to share our journey with
firebase from when we started to what
we've done since and our vision for the
future of building and growing great
applications most importantly I can't
wait to connect with each of you to
learn from what you're doing today the
amazing new businesses that you're
building let me pause we cannot build
anything meaningful without community a
technology without a community has no
value so it's from you that we learned
what we need to build next making our
software serve you better
I'm also excited to be here in Amsterdam
because I have a personal connection
with the Netherlands I lived here for
several years in the 1980s unidade Honda
in Den Haag or Nathan Denis in toxic
Nathan Dean nation and toxic it -
Holland and I'll apologize I'll do the
rest of my talk in English because my
Netherlands is he'll most quickly I must
admit I also love syrup waffles and I'm
looking forward to filling up on them
while I'm here because you really can't
get them at any quality in the u.s. one
of the great parts of my experience in
the Netherlands is that this country is
built on tolerance and inclusion
welcoming people from around the world
regardless of race gender or religion a
great pillar of Dutch community I think
that's an amazing basis for a developer
community as well we work better with
best with that same approach tolerance
and inclusion embracing our diversity
it's important to make everyone feel
comfortable and included now this is for
many good reasons none of us is as smart
as all of us the other thing that I've
noticed is often we have the most to
learn from the quietest person in the
room so if we make space for people to
share we will work best we'll discover
new things and we'll build what we need
to together now I started programming
when I was nine years old
it's my passion and as my family will
tell you I'm not really good at
anything else but recently I learned a
new native mobile framework and I tied
it into firebase once I had the basic
app up I started using the firebase off
firebase analytics and it was just
amazing how infrastructure just got out
of my way
it was so seamless to be able to get
distributed authentication understand
the errors that my application was
producing no worries about
infrastructure and I have to tell you it
really beats f5 run on my Windows
desktop in the 90s or my ZX Spectrum in
the 80s the cloud definitely beats a
tape drive of course I might be a little
older than some of you anybody remember
the outboard tape drives the expect
Ramiz all right I've got some spectrum
users in the crowd so at Google we build
products at global scale and to serve
our global scale communities we're
actually active in developer communities
in over 130 countries your feedback and
your input our top priority to us makes
us better and it helps us make better
tools for everyone
now as Frank mentioned since our
developer community is global we are
live streaming and recording and
publishing to YouTube because
unfortunately we can't fit the entire
firebase community in this room one of
these days we'll figure out that
technology and we'll ship it but it's
not yet so thanks to everyone who's
tuning in to join us wherever you are
I've mentioned and you'll find today
that we love meeting our fellow
developers and as we're inspired by your
feedback we hope to continue to learn
from you you'll find many firebase team
members here they're excited to meet you
they're excited to hear your stories and
answer your questions we all sell
product managers and engineers who will
be looking for your input to improve our
roadmap so please don't spare us your
gifts all the fire bases should be easy
to spot they're the ones wearing the
bright yellow t-shirts now arguably
maybe we should have done orange out of
respect for Iran yet but we're yellow so
look for the yellow t-shirts now within
Europe we have connected with 185
thousand developers just this year
through local events and programs and
we're honored to have 200 Google
developer experts sharing their
knowledge across the continent we're
continuing to contribute to the
developer community through programs
like women techmakers and Google
developer groups anybody go to the women
tech make
event last night alright anybody in the
women techmakers community alright let's
give him big hand
all right so last month we held the
Google developer days in Krakow is a 1
it was the first of its kind event there
are many more coming we had a chance to
celebrate our community with thousands
of developers and we were able to make
meaningful introductions to Google
experts and to our engineering teams who
build Google's developer products such
as Android which is now running on more
than 2 billion devices and has over 2
million developers targeting the
platform Google cloud platform where
we're bringing together a variety of
products that make the work needed to
maintain and scale a back-end
infrastructure seamless and tensorflow
which is our open source initiative to
democratize machine learning and make it
free and available to all it's the
number one machine learning library on
github it's used in enterprises startups
and academic environments alike invite
you to join us it's just one of Google's
machine learning initiatives and of
course there's firebase Google's mobile
development program now the firebase
mission is to help developers build
better apps and grow successful
businesses so we've expanded firebase
from a set of back-end services focused
on data to a platform for building and
growing apps we've made these products
work better together so that you can
focus on what matters most building a
great user experience so from the
glimmer of an idea to the world's
largest apps firebase helps developers
solve problems across the apps lifecycle
and across platforms now your success is
the only metric that matters to date
over a million developers have used
firebase we're humbled by how many of
you have trusted us with your
applications and we're proud of how far
firebase has come and we are committed
to the success of developers here to
tell you more about that is the lead
product manager for firebase Francis MA
thanks Sam
I remember hosting our first firebase
dev summit in Berlin last year it's so
nice to see many familiar faces but also
welcome many new developers to firebase
since day one our mission is to help
developers build better apps and grow
more successful businesses by providing
tools to help you across the lifecycle
of your app from helping you build
easier and faster with back-end services
like firebase off and cloud storage
helping you better understand and
improve your app with tools like
performance monitoring and analytics as
well as helping you grow and engage more
users with remote config and cloud
messaging
whether you're building something new or
extending an existing app we're here to
help you so that you can channel more of
your energy into creating value and
great experiences for your users
now as Sam mentioned since i/o 2016
we've expanded the firebase platform and
we've done so by building on a lot of
our own internal tools and learnings at
Google as well we've also integrated it
with other products like Google cloud
platform and AdWords to ensure that we
can grow with your needs to the largest
scale of apps and firebase SDKs are
available on iOS Android and where
applicable also on the web and earlier
this year we've added support for C++
and unity for game developers and since
we've open-sourced many of our target
platforms you can now more easily follow
along with what we're up to as well as
even contribute to firebase now in
response to feedback from many of you
our teams have been working hard to
continue to deepen and expand the
platform one of the areas that we know
is top of mind for many of you
especially here in Europe is data
privacy and that's why we're working
hard across the firebase team to prepare
for the new European general data
protection regulation also known as gdpr
and we're committed to helping you
succeed under it we're also offering a
new data processing agreement for Google
Analytics for firebase
product which we get the most DPA
requests for and we're committed to
offering such agreements through the
remainder of the fire based products by
the time gdpr
takes effect we're also happy to share
that nearly all of the fire based
products are now ISO 27001 and Sauk one
two and three compliance so that you can
have confidence that you're building on
infrastructure with world-class data
protection and security now in addition
to improving data privacy we've also
been working hard to make many new
updates across the platform and I'd like
to share a few of these with you in more
detail first let's start with updates on
our back-end services where we help you
build faster and easier earlier this
year we had a big updates by welcoming
the fabric team to Google since 2011
with the launch of crashlytics the
fabric team has been on a similar
mission as ours helping developers
succeed and now our two teams are
working together to integrate both
platforms and bringing you the best of
both in a thoughtful way one of the
first steps we've taken was bringing the
next evolution of fabrics digits into
fire based off and enable phone numbers
sign-in with phone number sign-in your
users just need to enter their phone
number do a one-time authorization and
they're in no need to remember passwords
with firebase auth you can also
integrate traditional email and password
login as well as popular third party
providers like Facebook Twitter Google
and github and best of all we also
provide a headless API that means you
can fully customize your own UI to fit
the look and feel of your own app so in
addition to helping you managing the
complexity and security of off we are
also focused on helping you manage your
own compute infrastructure so you don't
have to worry about running your own
servers and we've taken a step towards
this earlier this year with the launch
of cloud fire functions for firebase in
public beta cloud functions gives you an
easy way to deploy JavaScript code to
the cloud an executor based on an HTTP
request or trigger it based on events
that are integrated across
other parts of firebase for example you
can write your own functions to extend
firebase off and hook that up with Cloud
messaging to send the push notification
when new users sign up in your app or
another one that I like is to use cloud
functions with cloud storage to do some
server-side processing whenever a user
uploads an image now before cloud
functions you would have had to create
your own server to deploy this code but
now all you need to think about is your
own code another setup that I like why
is to integrate cloud functions with
hosting now firebase hosting by itself
enables simple static web hosting but
with the power of functions you can now
also do server-side processing and build
a full dynamic web app completely
serverless and this has been proven to
be very popular among web developers
because you can also bring your own
custom domain and we'd automatically
provision an SSL certificate for you as
well as surf that behind a global CDN so
your users get a fast and secure
download we're super excited about cloud
functions and hosting as it enables true
server list development so we just
talked about how we help you with
managing auth and compute we've also
taken a big leap in helping you manage
your data earlier this month with the
release of cloud fire store for farthest
cloud fire store is an auto managed no
sequel document database and it combines
the best of the firebase is real-time
database with powerful Google Cloud
infrastructure it simplifies storing
querying and syncing of your data at
global scale let's dive in to see how
this works first it simplifies storing
and syncing with data with a new
document collections model that makes it
very intuitive for you to structure your
data it also provides efficient querying
capabilities that scales with your
result set so that means if you're
fetching ten results from ten a
collection of ten documents or fetching
10 results from a collection of 10
million documents or even 10 billion
documents all of those great
take the same time to run second with
our rich client SDK firestore also helps
you synchronize the data across app
clients in near real-time also we offer
state-of-the-art offline connectivity
including on the web so that means users
can continue to access and even update
the data when they're disconnected from
the network and as soon as they
reconnect we'd automatically sync it
back to the cloud and across other
devices it's also integrate across other
parts of the firebase platform for
example it's integrated with firebase
off so that you can connect your client
directly to fire store without another
server you can also specify
authorization rules to ensure that your
clients can only access the data that
it's supposed to it's also integrated
with cloud functions so that you can add
your own servers high processing to your
data again without any servers and
lastly firestore is an auto scaling
solution that manages the infrastructure
for you that means you don't have to
worry about node counts machine sizes
Ram allocation cluster management
networking none of that it just scales
effortlessly us your app gross so we
just talked through some of the updates
on our back-end services on how it helps
you build more easily and faster we've
also made numerous updates on ways that
firebase can help you better understand
your app and improve it to talk more
about that I like to invite a longtime
product leader of the fabric team
Kristin Johnson
thanks Francis so now that your app is
live in the App Store and people are
using it the next step is understanding
how is your app doing is it performing
the way users expect is it gaining
traction in the market like you had
hoped for today I'm going to talk to you
about how fire based tools can help you
understand your apps health as well as
an exciting new product announcement and
the improvements we've made to the
firebase console user experience let's
get right into it
so as app users ourselves we know what
it feels like to have a bad experience
with an app you're about to get to the
next level of a game and it crashes
you're trying to buy concert tickets but
the app is moving so slowly that you're
in unable to get them by the time you
get to the end of the checkout flow this
poor experience especially if it's your
first time using the app can cause you
to abandon the app altogether and we all
have lots of other apps we could be
using there's two million other apps in
the App Store vying for our users
attention that's why it's important to
stay on top of stability issues and this
isn't just anecdotal there's data to
back it up 50% of 1 star app reviews in
the App Store state things like poor
performance crashes and bugs in their
reviews that's why I do this year we
introduced firebase performance
monitoring to really round out our app
quality tools it helps you find and fix
issues that slow down your app and
degrade your user experience you get
valuable performance metrics out of the
box like Network request latency and
apps start time you also can use our
api's to instrument custom metrics to
understand the performance of users
flows that you really care about like
purchase flows you can also filter that
data based on parameters like OS app
version or country so you can really
pinpoint the issues and fix them as
quickly as possible we've seen a ton of
traction since we launched in May we
have thousands of developers using
firebase performance monitoring across
200 million Athens
and everyday we process 30 billion
performance events now performance is
only one aspect of app quality
eliminating crashes is a single most
important way to improve your user
experience
that's why six years ago we built
crashlytics fabrics best-in-class
product that helps you track prioritize
and fix stability issues that are Road
your apps quality it synthesizes an
avalanche of crashes into a manageable
list of issues it tells you how many
users were impacted so that you know
where to focus your time to have the
biggest impact by trusting crashlytics
to stay on top of your apps stability
you can spend less time triaging and
debugging issues and more doing more
time doing the things that you love like
building new app features since fabric
joining Google we've been working hard
to bring the best of our two platforms
together into one console today we're
announcing a big step in that journey
we're integrating crashlytics into
firebase and making it available as a
public beta for new and existing
firebase users
what's also exciting about having
crashlytics as part of firebase is that
we can integrate with other firebase
tools the first step in this journey is
that we're going to be having
crashlytics connect to cloud functions
that you've heard about from Francis so
if you would like to learn more about
what we're doing with crush lytx and how
to use it in firebase please attend a
session this afternoon on building high
quality apps so another way that we've
been collaborating is that we're taking
the lessons from building the fabric
dashboard and the firebase console to
improve the user experience in firebase
let's take a look at what we've been up
to I'm gonna invite Francis back on
stage just so we can give you a demo so
now you can see here we're in bingo
blast one of our demo apps the first
thing that you're going to notice is
some changes to the left-hand navigation
we've clustered our tools based on the
your apps lifecycle we have developed
stability analytics and grow we know
that lots of users use multiple tools so
we want to make it as simple as possible
to be able to move between them now
let's take a look at our project over at
for you this is really the front door of
firebase so within here you can see how
each of your app within your project is
doing we've heard from you that you care
the most about adoption metrics and
stability metrics so we made them front
and center you can see how your apps are
doing across your project at a glance so
here we can see with bingo blast on iOS
that we're getting tons of traction
let's go and take a look at why so this
will bring you straight into the Google
Analytics for firebase dashboard which
has also been redesigned around that
your apps top goals you can see here the
questions that you ask yourself every
day about your business and are my users
engaged are they retained am i making
money you can see that all here we've
also added three new cards the first one
is in blue this is the real-time card
where you can see how many people are
using your app right now and also we
added in a stability card so we've taken
all the crash reporting data and
google analytics so that you can get a
comprehensive view of how your app is
doing so here you can see the crash free
user percentage which is how many users
have not experienced an app in air crash
the percentage we also can scroll down
and we have a new card called latest
release and we know that when you
release a new version of your app it's a
pretty anxious time right you want to
make sure that it's stable and you want
to make sure that customers or users are
adopting it so let's click it and see
how we're doing so when the latest
release report here as well we have a
real-time card so you can see how many
people are using that new release right
now you can also see in the main chart
how many people are have adopted your
app and at what rate right we can see
that there's a huge slope here and so
people adopt it fairly quickly but we're
settling right around 80 percent we can
also scroll down and take a look at our
crash free users we can see for our
latest release that were around ninety
eight and a half percent crash free
users which is pretty good we don't have
any major stability issues or need to
roll this version back that's great so
this helps you feel really secure that
your latest release is meeting the needs
of your of your users so let's go back
to the presentation so to share one more
thing about Google Analytics and what
that is is that we have a great
integration with bigquery we commit to
connect so that you can take your data
from Google Analytics and combine it
with other analytics data and create
awesome customized dashboards and data
studio it's a super powerful now we're
very excited to bring these changes to
the firebase console we believe that
bringing our to the best of our two
platforms together we can create a
product that's better than the sum of
its parts these updates of the console
including crash licks and firebase are
rolling out to users beginning today but
if you're super excited and want to get
your hands on it you can use this link
to opt-in so apps are using firebase to
mate to understand the health of their
out and make key business decisions
doodle an app that helps you find the
best date and time to meet people
redesign their app earlier the
sure they used crashlytics to improve
the app stability and remote config to
test out different onboarding flows
let's take a look at their results to
schedule a meeting with doodle you only
needs to think about possible dates we
create a link and the poll out of that
and your friends answer and the one date
that will get the most votes will be the
date your meeting or event will happen
that's it during the redesign we we
first focus on AB stability because no
one would want to use a buggy app but
the nice user interface freshly saved us
read a lot of time by just surfacing
crashes and helping us to pinpoint with
the root cause after the app stability
we focused on the actual implementation
of the redesign the firebase remote
config give us the confidence in our
changes we built for different
onboarding flows and we want to see
which one would work better in the
remote config interface during the test
you can see all the statistics about how
the test is going for example with one
of the creation flows over 42% more
polls were created this indicates a
measure increase in our most important
user engagement metric since the
redesign our numbers are way higher our
daily active viewers are up by 15% and
also our retention list is way higher
than before we're really excited about
crashlytics being integrated in in the
firebase toolset also with the outlook
that we are working on new and exciting
apps it makes it really much much easier
for our developers to have all of the
data and all of the tools in one place
we'd love to thank doodle for partnering
with us and I'm going to invite Frances
back on stage to talk a little bit about
how firebase can help you grow and
engage users
thanks Kristen so we're gonna switch
gears and talk about how firebase helps
you and grow more users let's jump right
in first was started with firebase cloud
messaging or fcm which provides you an
easy way to send user notifications
either programmatically or through the
firebase console now we know that
notifications can be an effective way of
rien gauging your users but much like
sending out an invite to a birthday
party is much better when it's targeted
and that's why early on we have
integrated fcm with analytics so then
you can send notifications based on
targeted audiences or user properties
for example you can target your
notifications by users that are taking a
specific action in your app or by custom
value that you have associated with the
user or targeted by your app version and
device locale and today we're releasing
an updated restful api to make it easier
for you to send notifications across
platforms programmatically now you can
do send multiple notifications across
different platforms in a single API call
another great tool for driving
reengagement and retention is remotes
can fake remote convey as the name
describes allows you to change your
app's configuration remotely and at
runtime so you can do things like tune
your user experience or change the
button of a label the remote config
itself is based on a key value map so
it's very simple yet flexible here's an
example of its setup where I have two
buttons one in red and one in blue and
now the text of the blue one says ok and
I get with remote config I can easily
change that to a yes without you having
to redeploy a new version of your app a
much like fcm we've integrated remote
can fake with analytics so that you can
target your config and tailor that user
experience to different user segments
whether it's by analytics audiences user
properties app versions and more now up
until now we know that many of you use
remote config to do things like run
different
in your app to test different versions
to see which one performs better etc
heard from you that you want an easier
and even more powerful way of doing this
because it requires a lot of manual work
today
you have to go in set up your custom
audiences define your user segments and
in afterwards you have to go look at
your analytics data and try to compare
that to see which variant performs
better so to help you with that today
we're excited to announce first class
a/b testing support in firebase so AV
testing is built on the infrastructure
and years of learning of Google optimize
and we've now integrated that right into
the firebase console workflow so it
makes it very easy for you to set up a
be testing the flow is very simple first
you set up multiple variances you can
assign your population size for each of
those variants and a remote config so
here in this example I can say 5% of my
users see the red button another 5% of
my users see the blue button and the
rest of them see the default view you
can also use a be testing with push
notifications through FCM so that you
can test different messages to see how
they perform and for each of these
experiments you can specify a goal a
success criteria and a B testing will
automatically run your experiments in
parallel to see which one performs the
best for example you might be sending
out multiple notifications to optimize
for users to make purchases in your app
or say you're pushing out a config
change to see which one drives the most
user retention once you've defined the
goal a B testing will automatically run
the experiments and let you know when a
clear winner is found a B testing makes
remote can fake and fcm much more
powerful giving you the insights to
further fine-tune your app and we have a
dedicated session today at 2:15 p.m.
right here to talk more about a be
testing with firebase so AV testing is a
vital tool to help you make smarter
decisions
for rolling out features or testing out
different user experiences but what if
what if you can do a little bit more
actually what if you can do a lot more
by taking the power of Google's machine
learning what if you can target users
not based on what they've done but what
we expect them to do next what if you
can predict the users behavior and to
help you exactly that today we're
excited to release firebase predictions
fire-based predictions is our first step
in taking the power of Google's machine
learning into firebase and we're
applying the machine learning on your
analytics data to create dynamic user
groups based on predictions of actions
that they're likely to take predictions
is also integrated with analytics with
remote config with FCM and yes also with
a be testing so that you can take
targeted actions based on the user
predictions for example you can send the
push notifications to users who are most
likely to make purchases in your app or
say push out a remote config to create
an offer for users who are likely to
leave your app and once enabled
predictions will automatically create
for predictions for you out-of-the-box
whether users are likely to turn or not
whether users are likely to spend or not
and since predictions is integrated with
analytics you can also create your own
custom predictions based on any analytic
conversion events so for example if
you're building a game and passing level
three it's the critical milestone for
your players you can set up a
predictions on how likely users are
going to make it to level three or say
you have an e-commerce app how likely
are the user is going to add an item in
their shopping baskets
we've built predictions by working
closely with several partners over the
past couple of months one of them is
half brick which some of you may
recognize for popular games like fruit
ninja jetpack Joyride and danda Man and
by using predictions and remote config
they've created a setup where they offer
a virtual gift to their players that are
predicted to leave their game so instead
of waiting for their player to leave the
game and try to get them to come back
they're proactively reaching out to the
users to retain them when based on the
predictions of users are about to leave
their game and as a result they were
able to see a 20% increase in the
seven-day user retention rate
predictions is available today in public
beta and we can't wait to see what you
do with it
you can also hear more about predictions
right after lunch right here we have a
dedicated session called actionable
insights with firebase predictions so
I'm very excited to share these updates
on behalf of the firebase team and we
can't wait to hear your feedback you can
find members of our team wearing the
yellow t-shirts hanging around the event
