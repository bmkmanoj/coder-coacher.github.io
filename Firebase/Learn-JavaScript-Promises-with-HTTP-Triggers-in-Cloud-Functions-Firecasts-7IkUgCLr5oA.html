cast about cloud functions for firebase
my name is Doug Stevenson and today's
topic is programming with JavaScript
promises in an HTTP trigger in cloud
functions if you're going to write code
for cloud functions you definitely need
to know about how promises work because
nearly all the functions you write will
use them and if you don't do it
correctly your code may fail in
mysterious ways so let's get acquainted
with JavaScript promises shall we a
promise represents some asynchronous
work that should eventually complete if
you're an Android developer this is very
similar to the task object that you use
sometimes when dealing with the firebase
Android SDKs when the work tracked by a
promise is still executing the promise
is in a pending state then if the work
completes successfully the promise is
said to be fulfilled or if there's an
error the promise becomes rejected these
are the only three states that a promise
can be in pending fulfilled or rejected
and once the promise becomes fulfilled
or rejected it can never change state
again many JavaScript API is you're
going to use will return a promise when
you call a function to perform some work
in particular the firebase admin SDK
will return a promise when you ask it to
do things such as read or write from a
database interact with files in cloud
storage send a notification with cloud
messaging or update an authenticated
user profile any API that returns a
promise will do so immediately before
the work is complete this is very
important to remember because you need
to use this promise to figure out when
the work is done
only when all the work is done is safe
to terminate your function and it's
crucial not to let your function
terminate while work is still going on
so how exactly do you terminate a cloud
function correctly well there's two
rules to know first for HTTP type
triggers they're terminated after they
send a response to the client using the
response object that it received if you
followed my last video you saw that with
a hello world function second for all
other types of triggers called
background triggers you need to return a
promise that's fulfilled only after the
work that was started in the function is
fully complete if there's no work to
wait on you can just return null but you
can't leave any promises dangling in
your function without proper handling
otherwise your pending work may not
complete the way you expect when you
return a promise from a background
functional
this it tells cloud functions to wait
until the promise becomes fulfilled or
rejected before moving on and cleaning
up that function if you've returned any
other type of value cloud functions will
ignore it and terminate the function
immediately all right enough talk let's
look at some code today I'll show you an
HTTP function
here's that HelloWorld function from the
last video it's written in typescript
which is very similar to JavaScript but
it's not very useful so let's change
that say I want to make this function
return the contents of a document in my
fire store database to the client kind
of like a simple web api in the firebase
console for my project you can see I
have a collection of documents called
cities weather where each document
tracks the current weather conditions
over time in a city I'm going to Boston
soon so I want to make an HTTP API
endpoint that anyone can call that
returns the weather in Boston
easy enough with cloud functions back to
vs code the first thing I'll do here is
rename the function then I'll import the
firebase admin SDK if you remember that
module was already installed in my
project when I created it the admin SDK
needs to be initialized before use so
I'll do that then I'll use it in my
function to get the document I want I
know the path of it already so this is
easy
notice that vs code is automatically
giving me some information about the get
method and I see it returns a promise
that contains a document snapshot type
object with the data I'm looking for so
what I need to do here is use that
promise to get a snapshot of the Boston
weather document promises have a method
called
then that lets your code continue after
the promise is fulfilled with the
results of the work that just finished
it takes a callback function that's
invoked with those results as its only
argument we can see here that vias code
is confirming that the callback passed
to then will give me a document snapshot
object as the argument to the function
alright inside this callback function
I'll take the snapshot and convert it to
a JavaScript object and with that I'll
send its JSON representation to the
client the response object knows how to
convert the object to JSON for me lastly
this call to send the response
terminates the function now I want to
test this code I just wrote in my last
video you saw that I used the firebase
CLI to
- cloud functions to test it but that's
not always the easiest thing to do most
of the time it's easier to test your
code on your computer before you deploy
it this can be a whole lot faster than
deploying the function every time you
make a change to it so instead of
deploying I'll run it locally on my
computer with the firebase CLI for HTTP
type functions I can emulate them like
this before I can emulate the HTTP
function I need to compile that type
script into JavaScript
I'll do that at the command line first
I'll change to my project functions
folder here I'll run TS lint on my code
to check for possible errors with npm
run script lint and what do you know
there's a problem it's saying there's an
error where I'm not handling promises
correctly it's giving me the line number
so I'll go there to look back in vs code
what I'm remembering now is that I
should be thinking about what happens if
this promise might be rejected with an
error since the promise can be rejected
when there's an error it's important to
think about whether or not you need to
handle the error cases anytime you're
working with a promise I think that's
important here so I'll use the catch
function on the promise to trap any
errors it's important to know that the
then method also returns a promise
that's fulfilled or rejected with all
the prior work so I'll get a hold of
that what I'll do is call the catch
method on this promise to trap anything
that goes wrong with the firestore get
method and also inside the then callback
if there's an error in either function
the catch callback will be invoked with
an object that describes the error what
I want to do here is long the error to
the firebase console and also send an
HTTP error response to the client you
probably want to send a custom error
response instead of whatever the error
message happens to be here so this is
just a start you should be aware that
the error message may contain private
information and you don't want to send
that to any client okay I'll run the
lentor again compile the code and
emulate the function hopefully for real
this time
first I'll run my npm run script lint
again from my shell history everything
checks out then I'll run NPM run script
build to compile the typescript this
runs the build command defined in the
package JSON
that fire basin it set up for me it
executes the typescript compiler or TSC
to convert my typescript into JavaScript
the converted JavaScript appears in the
lib folder next to source you can see it
looks a lot like the original typescript
but I think you'll agree that the
typescript is easier to read now I'll
use the firebase CLI to emulate this
function I'll run the command firebase
serve only functions to kick that off
you can see that it gives me a URL to my
function on localhost my personal
machine to invoke the function so what
I'll do is copy the URL then use curl on
the command line to make an HTTP request
to invoke the function you may remember
last time that I copied and pasted the
function URL into a web browser to run
it you can do that as well
but sometimes I like to run it this way
too and you can see here the JSON
contents of the Boston weather document
generated by my function and the code I
just showed it's important to note that
I'm sending the full response to the
client in every code path both success
and error this is very important if you
don't send a response to the client your
function will timeout and the client
will receive nothing after that timeout
that's a pretty bad experience for a web
api so be absolutely sure you're sending
something back in all cases and all code
pass ok this function works fine but
it's a little bit ugly and there's some
things I can do to clean it up
typically people chain their promise
functions together for Less typing and
better readability so I'll do that to
tidy up my function right now what I'm
doing here is removing all the constants
that contain the promises I can simply
allow the then and catch methods to work
directly with the return promises
without requiring any sort of variable
this is pretty typical when you have one
thing happening after another in
sequence so what I have here now is the
promise returned by get has its then
method called then the promise returned
by then has its catch method called and
now it's all good from now on I'll write
all my promises like this ok now you
know the basics of using promises in
your HTTP functions like I mentioned
before nearly all your functions will
use promises in some way now let's
review those two rules for terminating
your functions first for HTTP type
triggers
you have to send the response to the
client as the very last action you take
in your function for all code paths in
that function and that's what we did
today with the help of promises second
for all other types of triggers you have
to return a promise from the function
that becomes fulfilled or rejected when
the work is complete and that's what
I'll show you next time and for those of
you who know typescript pretty well you
might be wondering when I'll talk about
using async await to deal with promises
that's coming in a few videos later in
this series I personally think it's
important to master normal promises
