fire cast about cloud functions for
firebase my name is Doug Stevenson and
today's topic is advanced programming
with JavaScript promises in cloud
functions for firebase in the last two
videos of this series I talked about
using promises to manage the work
happening in an HTTP trigger and a fire
store trigger each type of trigger had a
slightly different way of working with
the promises returned by the fire store
API in the firebase admin SDK in
particular you learn the basics of
JavaScript promises and how to use them
and you also saw two rules for
terminating a cloud function which are
these first HTTP triggers must send a
response to the client to terminate
properly and second for all other types
of triggers called background triggers
you must return a promise that becomes
fulfilled or rejected when all the
pending work in that function is
complete this lets cloud functions know
when it's safe to clean up the function
invocation and move on to the next one
the code I showed you so far is fairly
simple let's go over again what it looks
like my fire store database contains a
collection called cities weather which
contains documents for a few different
cities each document stays up to date
with the current weather conditions at
that city this HTTP trigger I have right
now fetches and returns the current
weather conditions in Boston you can see
it makes a request a fire store to get
the document at the known location the
get method returns a promise that's
fulfilled with a snapshot of the
document which I can then convert to a
JavaScript object and then send back to
the client in JSON format and if the
promise is rejected with an error I
handle that too now what I want to do
here is group neighboring cities by a
larger area and create an HTTP trigger
that returns the weather conditions for
all the cities in that area so what I've
done is created another collection in
fire store called areas and the
documents in there contain a list of
cities in that area let's take a look
now in fire store you can see that new
collection and it contains a document
for the Greater Boston area this
document has a property called cities
which is an array of city IDs in that
area right now it's just Boston
Cambridge and Somerville this is an
incomplete list and I'll update that
later
so what I need to do is create a new
HTTP trigger that reads the Boston area
document gets this list of cities reads
each of the matching documents from the
city's weather collection and returns
them to the client so I'll switch to vs
code and start writing that what I'll do
here is export a new HTTP function
called get Boston area weather in that
function I'm going to query that Boston
area document get returns a promise so
I'll use the then method on that to get
the document snapshot when the query is
complete I'll convert that snapshot to a
Java Script object then access the
document property called cities that has
the array of city IDs I can iterate this
array then build a reference to each
city's weather document that I need to
read there's a little snag here each of
these calls to get returns a promise and
there will be several for each area and
I need to wait on all of them to finish
and get all of their data to send to the
client now in this situation I don't
necessarily know how many cities there
will be but I need all their results and
I don't need to wait for each one to
complete one after another they can
happen all at the same time in parallel
so what I really want to do here is kick
off all the queries at the same time
then continue after all of them are
complete once I have the entire set of
documents I'll send a final response to
the client and I can manage this all
with a function called a promise dot
let's see how that works
first I'll collect all the promises into
an array I can do that by creating an
empty array before the loop then inside
the loop I'll push each promise into
that array remember that get returns
immediately so each one of these
promises is still in the pending state
and should be fulfilled later on once I
have the promises collected my code
needs to wait for all of these promises
to become fulfilled before moving on I
can use the function promise dot all
pass it the array of promises and it
will return a new promise that's
fulfilled only after all of those other
promises are fulfilled with that I can
call its then method to continue with
more work but that means I'm nesting my
code deeper than necessary the best
thing to do here is to return that
promise from the call
now let's see what happens to a promise
return like this if you return a promise
from a then callback the then method
itself returns a new promise that
becomes fulfilled or rejected at the
same time as that other returned promise
with that new promise you can chain
another then method to it to continue
where that work left off you can use
this to write another callback that
receives the results from the promise
fulfilled in the prior callback in this
case it's an array of document snapshots
with the result from each get so this
snapshots argument is the array of the
document snapshots that are fulfilled
from the array of promises above what
I'll do here is iterate that array of
snapshots to collect all the weather
condition objects for each city but what
should I do with all these objects well
I'll create a new array with all the
results and push them there then I can
send that array of results to the client
in JSON format oh and while I'm here
I'll do the right thing and paste a call
to catch after this so I can deal with
any errors that occur
remember it's critical to return a
response in all circumstances okay let's
see what that JSON looks like at my
command shell in my project functions
folder what I'll do now is run the
linter and after that's okay
compile the typescript to JavaScript
then I'll run the emulator for HTTP
functions it gives me a localhost URL
for the get Boston area weather function
so I'll copy it switch to another shell
tab and run this curl command to see
what it returned cool and I can see all
the Boston area weather documents here
this is a good start but I can't tell
which city each object refers to so I'll
go back into vs code change the callback
to add the unique document ID to each
JavaScript object then push that
modified object into the results array
then I'll go back to my shell compile
the type script run the emulator and
then use curl again to view the results
and there we go this is kind of hard to
read though so I'll pipe it to a Python
pretty printer just to make that easier
nice doesn't that look a lot better for
testing and debugging I think so so we
saw two
new techniques here for dealing with
promises first you can chain together
items of work by returning a promise
from the callback of the then method
just like returning a promise to cloud
functions this promise must represent
all the async work that was started here
when the promise returned by the
callback is fulfilled the next promise
callback will receive the results
generated by the prior one and the catch
callback will capture errors from any of
the prior work the final promise
returned from catch will be fulfilled or
rejected after the entire sequence is
complete the second thing you learned is
that you can kick off many different
items of work asynchronously collect all
their promises into an array and use
promise all to create a new promise
that's fulfilled when all the other
promises are also fulfilled that new
promise delivers an array of results to
the next callback you should also know
that if any of those promises becomes
rejected with an error the promise
returned from promised at all will also
become rejected and that's it
once you get practiced with these
techniques it becomes easier to write
more complicated code for cloud
functions while you're following the two
rules to terminate your functions
correctly now for functions written in
typescript which I am using here there's
an even easier way to deal with series
of promises typescript gives you a
syntax called
async await that makes dealing with
promises super easy so if you want to
see how that works

channel on YouTube to get notified of
the next video in this series and I'll
see you here next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
