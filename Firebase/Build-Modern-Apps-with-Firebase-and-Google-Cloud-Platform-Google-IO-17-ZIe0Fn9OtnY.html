talk where we talked about some of the
new things and I'm going to be doing a
deep dive today speaking about how
firebase and Google cloud platform can
be used together to build some really
amazing apps my name's Andrew I'm one of
the cofounders of firebase before I dive
in though I want to say how really
excited I am to be here firebase has
come a long way in the last six years
and this year has really been our best
yet so if you saw IO last year we really
expanded the platform and since that
time over a million developers have used
firebase to build an app if you're one
of those developers thank you I really
appreciate the trust you placed on us to
help us build your app and to build your
business but first let's take a minute
to time travel back to 2011 our team
started working out of a co-working
space in San Francisco and one of the
first things that we did when we began
work and firebase was right down the
vision for what we were trying to build
and the first sentence read build the
simplest views and easiest to understand
app development platform in the world
we felt that cloud computing was
breaking its promise to developers
well it had reduced the capital required
for you to build and fail software it
had done very little to make the actual
writing of that software easier cloud
computing was supposed to save
developers time it was supposed to
reduce their cognitive load and let them
focus on delivering actual value to
their customers and it really hadn't
done that yet and we wanted to fix that
the amazing part about this statement is
that this is still our mission today
this is still what we're working on and
it's gotten a whole lot easier since
we've joined Google because we get to
work directly with Google cloud platform
well firebase is a full suite of
products for building and growing mobile
apps and web apps we know that some apps
need more than we can offer out of the
box for example they might need
specialized analytics or specialized
types of storage they might need to do
intensive computations or say machine
learning and in many of these cases the
firebase core offerings can't help you
but Google cloud platform can if you
don't know much about cloud platform it
gives developers the ability to use
Google's computing infrastructure to
build deploy and run software at massive
scale and this is a huge investment area
for Google we've invested more than 30
billion dollars in last four years on
this infrastructure and cloud platform
offers a full range of products across
storage compute networking big data and
machine learning ok so what does this
have to do with firebase well firebase
and cloud platform are really a
complementary pair and combined they
provide a full suite of products to let
you serve even the most demanding use
cases and we've really designed this
platform to make it easy to use them
together if you're a mobile developer
you can start using firebase for its
high level bubble features and its rapid
time to market and then when you need to
get more complex you can move over and
start using products from cloud platform
to augment your app on the flip side if
you're a back-end developer and you want
to start with cloud platform later you
can start using firebase when you build
out your apps this is all made possible
because under the hood firebase and
cloud share a number of common
components first they have a common
foundation they share the same project
and billing and account systems so when
you create a firebase project it is
literally a cloud project second we're
actually beginning to share products as
well
we recently announced that cloud storage
would be available through firebase
storage is Google's petabyte scale
storage offering and we also announced
that cloud functions would be available
through firebase and you can expect to
see more of these integrations going
forward with cloud products being
available directly through firebase as
we continue to integrate firebase and
cloud platform we're seeing more and
more customers doing great things
together with these technologies for
example National Public Radio is using
firebase analytics in its mobile app but
NPR wants to do some more advanced
analysis than they can do out of the box
of firebase analytics and so they're
using bigquery from Google cloud
platform so that they can match their
front-end behavioral data with their
back-end usage data and improve their
overall understanding of their users
engaged in the retention we believe that
this combination of firebase is mobile
feature set and the full power of Google
cloud is really powerful and can support
the needs of even the most demanding
applications so I'd like to show you in
practical terms what that actually means
for you what can you do together with
firebase at Google cloud and to do that
I'll be building an app right here
called favorite places that's going to
let you post pictures of places that you
love for today's demo I'll be building a
web application but everything we do is
fully cross-platform so you could do
this on iOS or Android or even using our
unity in C++ SDKs so here are the
requirements for my application first I
want to let users be able to log into
the app so they can receive a customized
experience I want users to be able to
upload photos of their favorite places
I want users to be able to view a feed
of the photos that they've uploaded in
the past and I want those images
optimized for mobile so I'm not wasting
bandwidth or battery and so they fit
nicely on the screen
to help me build this I'm going to use
several products from firebase will be
using firebase hosting to actually host
the static web assets firebase
authentication with the new phone number
authentication you heard about earlier
today for login cloud storage for
firebase for storing the photos and the
firebase real-time database to store my
seed metadata this is going to get us
most of the way there but we're still
missing the last requirement which was
the ability for you to scale images to
fit on your phone now this is actually a
relatively easy problem to solve
client-side if we want to but that
doesn't really help us because mobile
networks are slow bandwidth is expensive
batteries expensive and so we really
want to do that resizing on the server
side so we can optimize delivery of
those images ordinarily this would be a
huge hassle
we'd have to stand up a whole new
service we'd have to set up a 24/7
on-call rotation we'd have to provision
a bunch of servers we'd have to deal
with like all of the normal maintenance
and scaling and operations of running
that back-end service and I don't want
to do that but fortunately we have much
easier solution which is cloud functions
cloud functions for firebase the product
that we launched in March and it gives
you the ability to run small pieces of
suicide code in response to events in
your app without needing you to manage
your servers or scale amount this makes
it really easy for developers to do
things like send a push notification
when a user signs up or thank a user for
an in-app purchase or transform data
before inserting into their database or
in the case of this app do some image
processing when a new image is uploaded
we lost launched cloud functions for
firebase in March and the tremendous
response we've seen has been really
exciting we there are thousands of apps
today built using cloud functions and
we've seen over a billion events running
function since then
today we support a number of event
writers you can see some of the event
the products on the screen that emit
events the club functions and you should
expect to see more integrated in the
future all right so we have our
requirements list let's actually dive in
and let's build this out can I get us a
switch over to the laptop screen okay so
to save time on the demo I've actually
kind of fleshed out the early stages of
the app so you can see what it looks
like here I've already populated a title
bar and we have a box for entering your
phone number and a confirmation code
because we're going to using phone
number authentication so let's add our
first feature which is firebase log in
and log in is really critical to this
application because we want to segment
the data by user you wouldn't want
another user to be able to modify your
photos or vice versa and fortunately
with firebase off this is really easy to
setup we have an out-of-the-box
experience that lets you log in with
column providers like email and password
social off or even integrate with your
own providers and just today as you
heard we announced phone number
authentication which lets your users log
into your app using just their phone
number and an SMS confirmation code
there's no passwords for members or
emails to type in and firebase
authentication integrates really tightly
with the other firebase products to let
you control access to different
resources so this is what's actually
enabling us to segment the photos by
user and the database data by user so
the first thing we need to do is jump
over to the firebase console and we'll
jump into our authentication tab and
we'll configure phone number
authentication so if you click
authenticate sign-in method you're going
to see a new option today in the console
called phone and I'll open that up and
it turns out the configuration for phone
number is really easy you just have to
enable it which I've already done so
we're all set with configuration let's
get started
all right so for today's app I'm going
to be writing all my code in typescript
if you like text rip great if you don't
don't worry you can do all of this in
JavaScript and remember this all is
fully across platforms are on your iOS
or Android or unity of C++ apps you can
do all the same things so the first
piece of code I need to add is a
reCAPTCHA on my page and this is because
firebase phone number authentication
uses reCAPTCHA to prevent spam and abuse
the next thing we want to do is hook up
that gooey that you just saw so that
when I click those buttons for login or
confirm code that it actually runs the
appropriate handlers to do the login so
on cert some code here and this is doing
a couple of things first when I run
click the login button it's running
sign-in with phone number which is
actually kicking off the SMS
verification to my phone and then later
after I've entered that code and click
confirm it's going to call confirm on
the verification that has been set to my
to my phone alright and then the next
thing we need to do is actually handle
that login event so we want to make sure
that after the user has logged in we
hide the login screen and we showed them
login content instead and so we have a
symbol event handling here that's fired
every time our authentication state
changes and I've hidden a little bit of
GUI code here but there's a helper here
that's actually hiding the old UI in
displaying a new UI and I set up a
helper function here that we use for the
rest of our our example called on login
so I'll set that insert that here and
this is going to get called after the
user has logged in all right that's it
we've added authentication to our app
cool let's add our next feature so the
next thing I want to add is the ability
to upload photos to my app and just like
with phone number authentication the
first place we're going to start is over
in the console so I'll jump back over to
the firebase console this time I'll head
over to the storage tab
and storage and firebase is cloud
storage so you actually get access to
the full range of Google Cloud storage
products including buckets and regions
all over the world as well as different
storage classes so if I click up here in
the upper right I can choose to add a
bucket and I can select regions in the
US or all over the world as well as
different storage classes but it turns
out for this example the default bucket
is a US central multi-region bucket
which is actually perfect for what we're
trying to do and so I'm going to stick
with the default for this example all
right so let's actually add the code to
upload images into my app in the on
login handler here I'm gonna add a
little snippet and again we have a UI
helper function that is setting up the
actual the actual input form for me to
input my photo and then it's calling
into this function when the user adds
their photo and we just have a couple
lines of code here to handle that the
first is creating a reference to the
file to upload and the second is
actually writing that file into cloud
storage this these two lines of code
here is actually all you need to upload
a file directly from your app to cloud
storage alright we're all done with that
so now if I put deployed the app you'd
see that we could click the button and
it would upload the photo but the next
step is we actually want to resize that
photo we want to go over to functions as
I mentioned earlier and we'll jump over
to that code and we're going to set up a
cloud function that takes that new
object resizes it and put it back into
cloud functions so the first thing I'm
going to do here is actually create my
cloud function we have an SDK for cloud
functions that makes this really easy
all you need to do is add something to
your exports like we did here and we now
have a resize image cloud function and
we bind that to the events coming from
cloud storage with this line right here
so this means that this function is
going to run anytime a new object is
uploaded the clouds
George the next thing we need to do is
do a little bit of parsing so I add some
code here to actually look at the
request and pull out some variables that
we need and we want to make sure that
we're only doing image resizing for
newly uploaded images we don't want to
have this event run when we resize the
images because that would put us in an
infinite loop so we're going to jump out
of this function if this is not a new
upload and then let's do the actual
image resizing so I have a bit of code
here that is first downloading the image
from cloud storage to my local cloud
functions VM and putting into a temp
directory then I'm spawning a new
process with image magics to do the
actual resizing and finally I'm
uploading that file back into cloud
storage and that should do it that
handles our image resize so let's move
on to our next feature so we want to
have a feed at images so you can see
what was in our app what we've uploaded
previously to the app and so we're going
to store that in the firebase real time
database and we want to add to that feed
after the image resize has occurred
because if we did it beforehand you
might see the the non resize image and
we want to see the resized image so
we're actually gonna do that in our
cloud function as well so I'll add a
little snippet here which after we've
resized the code is going to push a new
item into our real time database with
some metadata about the new objects to
display and then finally we want to jump
back over to our client-side code and we
actually want to display the feed in the
app and so to do that we're going to
listen on the real time database to all
new children of our feed and for each of
those items I have some code here to
actually add the UI and I have a helper
function to make that a little bit user
cool
so that should do it so I'll just save
this file and I'm going to jump over to
the command line and I'm going to deploy
this
so firebase and we're going to let that
run and well this is running I want to
show you a couple of features that I
maybe didn't mention earlier that I
think are really exciting you might want
to know about so let's jump back over to
our simulator our iOS simulator here and
let's look at the top of the screen
you'll notice that this app is hosted at
favorite places dot pictures this is a
domain name I bought yesterday and this
is a custom domain this isn't something
that firebase ready for you something
that I bought and you'll notice also
that there's a little lock icon right
here and that's because we're actually
serving this page over HTTPS one of the
really cool features about firebase
hosting is that we automatically
provision an SSL certificate for you on
your custom domain and we do it for free
so if you want a simple way to get your
assets online on your domain with SSL
use firebase hosting the other cool
feature I want to point out is that if
you look in our code at the top of our
client-side code you'll notice that
there's no API keys up here there's no
default settings or configuration it's
just it just declares this firebase
variable and that's because firebase
hosting is actually configuring the
firebase SDK for me automatically I
don't have to put any special
configuration here which is really
convenient to get going
but it's especially useful if I'm
managing multiple environments they have
a staging environment and a production
environment this makes it simple for me
to do that without managing those keys
ok let's jump back over to our deploy it
looks like it's finished fantastic okay
let's give this a shot so I'm going to
go back to my mobile app and I'm going
to refresh rate and I'm going to type in
my phone number here
and I'm going to send myself an SMS
confirmation uh but Google doesn't know
if I'm a human or not so the recap shows
actually checking to make sure I'm
really a person another bot to prevent
abuse and it wants me to select pictures
of storefronts I hope I don't fail this
in front of all of you think how's that
look to that right okay OOP nope that
wasn't it all right I mean human yes
great
and then I'm going to wait for my SMS
there we go and I have it so I'll type
that in
all right we're logged in it works cool
ok so now I'm going to upload some
photos
into my app so I'll click this plus
button and I actually have a few images
already on my phone so let's upload a
picture of the Golden Gate Bridge I'll
click that button and right now what's
going on behind the scenes is I'm
uploading that picture directly from my
mobile phone into cloud storage that is
triggering an event in cloud functions
which is then downloading that image
into crowd functions resize get putting
it back into cloud functions then adding
some feed data into the real-time
database which is pushing that data out
to my mobile app and it is responding to
an event on the device to update my feed
and all that happened with the code that
I just showed you now I want to I want
to show you something that I talked
about earlier but I think is really
easier to understand if you see it and
that is that when you're using firebase
you are using cloud platform now
remember we updated that we uploaded
that image using the firebase SDK for
cloud storage and we configured this
using the firebase console for cloud
storage so of course if I go over and I
look in the console for firebase and I
reload this page you would expect to see
some images in here I can look in here
and see that there's actually there's
content here but what you might not
expect is that if I go over to the cloud
storage console tab in Google cloud
platform and I look in my bucket there I
see the exact same content they are
literally the same platform it's the
same product they have the same data
okay so I think we're all done I thought
that went really well I don't know about
you guys nothing went great and I you
know I really want to I really want to
share this with my friends and I think
my mom be super excited about this so
I'm actually going to pull up my phone
here and I'm just going to take a
picture of this app here and I got to
turn my flash on and what it what are
you doing oh wait this is sort of
awkward Michael um I'm actually doing an
IO talk right now oh well I know that
but now you seem to be trying to take a
picture of your laptop with your phone
what's that about
oh yeah no I'm really good with Twitter
and I have a lot of followers so I just
thought it'd be cool if I if I took a
picture of the app that I just built I
tweeted that actually here why don't you
hold this and I'll just pose in front of
the laptop I'll just well kind of go
right cool really when your followers
rather have a link to the content that
you're that you have on the screen there
then oh just a blurry photo from your
phone yeah that that might be cool but
it's not going to work because actually
I don't there's no way for me to share a
URL of that content there it's just it's
a single page app well there's no way to
share URL yet tell you what let me jump
in here for just a second I think I can
whip something together in just a few
minutes and I think you'll like it can I
take over here sure that sounds awesome
yeah I give this try
hey everybody I'm Michael blye I'm the
engineering lead on firebase hosting and
the firebase CLI can we flip back over
to the slides for a minute great so it's
great that we have this app where we can
upload photos and then take a look at a
feed of our photos but if this is
supposed to be a sharing app I think
we're falling short it's a little lonely
there's no way to share this with
anybody else so let's add one more
feature to our app which is a great
social sharing experience and for this
feature we're going to need four new
four new requirements first we're going
to need a shareable URL so that I can
send it to any of my friends and they
can instantly get to the piece of
content that I'm trying to send second
we're going to need that content to be
high-performance and scalable what
happens if my tweet goes viral I need to
be able to handle that load third we're
going to want the image thumbnail of the
photo that I'm sharing to show up
embedded in the tweet so that people are
drawn in and they have a bigger target
to click and finally we're going to want
to automatically recommend some tweet
text so that people have a frictionless
sharing experience they just click a
couple buttons and bam they've shared it
now how am I going to tackle all of
these new requirements you might have
heard today that we've launched a brand
new integration between firebase hosting
and cloud functions and that's really
going to help us out here now you can
create rewrite rules for firebase
hosting that will send matching requests
to a cloud function that you specify
this gives you the ability to mix and
match firebase hosting production-grade
static hosting with the dynamic
processing power of cloud functions this
is a great new tool to help you build
capable performant mobile apps so cloud
functions and firebase hosting can get
us most of the way there that checks off
three of the boxes I can dynamically
generate HTML for a shareable URL
firebase hosting is global CDN gives me
the performance and stability
characteristics that I need and because
I'm rendering the content server-side
Twitter's crawlers can pick up that
metadata and embed it in the tweet but
what I don't have is a way to
automatically recommend tweet text
you'll notice that there was no title
added to the photo and Andrew uploaded
it he just sent the image so how are we
going to tackle this last requirement
well luckily as Andrew told you a
fire-based project is a google cloud
project and one of the Google cloud
platforms strongest characteristics are
its machine learning ap is one of those
is the cloud vision API that can analyze
images and actually tell you about the
content one of the features of the cloud
vision API is landmark detection and
when we're uploading our favorite places
that's a natural fit for this feature so
we're going to use that to help us out
and build this feature so let's jump
over to the code and get started all
right so the first thing I'm going to do
I'm in the browser code and the first
thing that I need to do is add oh sorry
could we jump over the laptop there we
go so we're in the browser code and the
first thing that I'm going to do is I'm
just going to add a share button to
every item in my feed so add a little
piece of code here so I'm just defining
a share URL that's going to be / places
/ and then an ID for my image and I'm
going to add that to this helper that
we've already shipped setup so there we
go
so with that change now every image on
my feed is going to have a share button
that links to / places / ID but of
course there's nothing there yet so we
need to build that functionality so now
I'm going to jump over to the cloud
functions code now one of the things
that I like the most about cloud
function is that I was already a node.js
developer and cloud functions works
great with the node ecosystem so I like
building web apps with Express j/s and
that works out of the box box with cloud
functions so here I'm defining a simple
Express app so I just define I define my
Express app and I'm defining a single
route which you might recognize from the
last screen and then I'm just parsing a
few things out of the URL and I'm
setting up some content so I don't know
what I'm going to use for the landmark
name yet but I have a URL and a
description and a tweet and now I need
to send some data back now I could use
any server-side rendering frame
or any template engine that I want but
for our case in a simple demo I'm just
going to inline some HTML so here we go
okay so there's my HTML it's a really
simple page but one thing that I want to
call out are these Twitter meta tags
that I have in the header that's the
metadata that allows Twitter to parse
the URL and then display information
embedded in the tweet and Twitter
doesn't execute JavaScript on your site
so this isn't something that I could
have done just by loading the firebase
web f-ck and then manually rendering
that with browser side JavaScript after
the fact it has to be done on the server
other than that this is just a really
simple page that will render my image
and have a tweet button that when I
click it will have some pre-populated
text so now I've built my Express app
but I need to actually export that as a
cloud function luckily as Andrew showed
you that's incredibly easy I just add a
single line export and now I've created
an HTTP cloud function and you'll notice
that I just passed my Express app
directly into that cloud function
handler I didn't have to do any special
wrapping there was no special handling
required because cloud functions works
really well with the nodejs
ecosystem okay so now I've built my
cloud function but I want to serve this
on my own domain using firebase hosting
so how do I go about that well I'm going
to jump over to the firebase that JSON
and here you can see that we already
have one hosting rewrite set up that
redirects any URL to index.html and this
is a great solution if you're building a
single page web app that's all browser
side because you have JavaScript that
runs in the client and figures out all
of the logic for your page but now I'm
adding some server-side logic
luckily again this is really simple I
just had one line of configuration
that's going to rewrite my share URL to
the function called serve share page
that I just defined so now I've not only
built my cloud function I've connected
it to firebase hosting so it's going to
serve on my domain name now that's most
of our requirements but again the last
one was that we would Auto populate the
tweet text with something relevant to
the actual content and another one of my
favorite features of cloud functions is
that
you're executing in the cloud functions
environment you are automatically
authorized to use all of the Google
cloud API s for that project so if I
want to use the Google cloud vision SDK
for nodejs there's no config strings or
initialization that I have to pass into
that I just initialize it with a single
line and an empty call now below I'm
going to replace this to do with my
actual code so I have a single line of
code that passes my GCS my Google Cloud
Storage file over to the over to the
cloud vision API and that's going to
detect the landmarks and return that as
a response which and then saving as a
variable and using in my HTML so I think
that's everything that I need to do in
just a couple minutes I've built a
social sharing experience with
server-side rendered content that uses
the cloud vision API to populate a
description so let's go ahead and deploy
that now while that's deploying I wanted
to call out one other thing that I did
here you'll see on this line that I set
a cache control header in my response
now one of the best features of firebase
hosting is that we put everything behind
a global CDN that caches things at the
edge so that people who are in the same
area get a lightning-fast response to
images to things that have already been
cached now by default
we're not caching cloud functions
responses because we don't know how
frequently they change what kind of
characteristics they have so this is
something that you opt into but that's
really easy all you have to do is set a
cache control header on your response in
this case I'm saying public which means
this is okay to be cached by a CDN I'm
setting a max age of five minutes or 300
seconds which is how long the browser is
going to cache it and then I'm setting
an s max age which tells the CDN how
long it should cache it in this case two
hours so with that one line I'm now
telling firebase hosting that you can
cache any response from this endpoint
for two hours when you receive it and
that's really going to help me with
those performance and scaling
characteristics that I talked about so
I'm going to go over to the deploy and
it looks like that's going to be
finishing finishing up but I think that
I've built everything that I wanted to
build here so let's see if my quick
coding was enough to a
press my boss hey Andrew can you come
take a look at this
did you get it all working I think so so
I just deployed it I'm going to refresh
the page here to get the latest code all
right so you can see now there's a share
button but I'm going to upload a new
photo just for good measure let's take a
look how about that's a great picture so
you can see it's processing the image
just like before and that is just
running the same resize code that Andrew
already showed you but now I'm going to
tap on the share button and that is
going to call out to my cloud function
running on firebase hosting and you can
see that I have the image and the cloud
vision API has recognized this as the
Palace of Fine Arts I also have this
tweet button that makes it really easy
to share so I'm going to do that and you
can see that it is pre-populated the
tweet text with check out my awesome
picture of the Palace of Fine Arts and a
link to that content so I'm going to go
ahead and tweet that great and I'm going
to pull up my Twitter feed just to see
how that looks do a quick refresh
try that one more time there we go and
there you go the photo is embedded in my
tweet what do you think very cool and
that was super fast Michael great so I
think the best part about this is that
since this is that favorite places dot
pictures you can all pull it up on your
own phone to give it a try right now if
you like and well you do that I'm going
to play with it myself because that was
super cool Michael and I want to try
this so I'm going to jump back over here
to my app and I'll choose one more
picture this time I'll do the arch flip
that upload there we go and I'll tweet
one more time
there we go cool does anyone managed to
login on their phone all right I got
some thumbs up awesome cool can we jump
back to the flight
all right to quickly recap we just built
that app using six different products
from Google firebase hosting firebase
authentication the firebase real time
database cloud storage for firebase
cloud functions for firebase and the
cloud vision API and all that together
made this app work there's a lot more
I'd love to show you that's just
scratching the surface of the products
that we have but I only have 40 minutes
to talk so instead I'll really encourage
you to give this a try on your own you
can get started in just a few minutes at
firebase talk google.com or
cloud.google.com
our goal is really to handle the common
infrastructure for you so you can focus
on the things that actually drive value
for you users rather than focusing on
making the basics work I think you'll
find that between the two platforms we
really have a pretty comprehensive
offering and we reach across the entire
spectrum of mobile app development so
hopefully we can reconsider requirements
and even your most demanding
applications before I go I want to touch
briefly on another topic I'm really
excited about and that is open source
Google has a long history of prolific
open source contributions last year
alone we had hundreds of thousands of
commits to open-source repos on github
across more than 15,000 projects and
we've heard a lot of feedback from the
firebase community that you'd love to
see firebase do more this as well and so
I'm really excited to say today that we
are doing that and today is the first
wave of those releases and it's going to
include the SDKs for a number of the
backend service products on iOS the web
and our server side Adam SDKs and we'll
have more coming soon by making our SDKs
open we're really trying to show a
commitment to our community of
transparency and we're trying to build a
stronger relationship with you we
haven't we have just thrown the code
over the wall either this is going to
become a core part of our own tool chain
so if you want to report a bug or you
want to send a pull request we're
listening file
choose on github send us a pull request
we can't wait to see what you do you can
go check out these repos right now and
get hub the links are right here if you
want to learn more about 500 days for
cloud platform we have more than two
dozen sessions I believe in i/o I
highlighted a few of the most relevant
ones here but I really encourage you to
follow the link on the lower right there
that has a link to all the firebase
sessions also there's a sandbox right
out the door right here that has a
number of the firebase staff present if
you have more questions and I'm new
waiting outside right here in the
parking lot - if you would like to speak
to me with me after the talk so thank
you very much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
