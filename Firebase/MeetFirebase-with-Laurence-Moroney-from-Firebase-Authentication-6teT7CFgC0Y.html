get to meet the Googlers that make
firebase happen my name is Doug
Stephenson and on the show with me today
is warmuth's Maroney for happening is it
thanks for being on the show so tell me
what do you do with the firebase team so
I'm a developer advocate on the firebase
team so I focus on helping developers
understand the firebase technologies and
helping us understand what developers
are doing with it so which teams do you
work with in particular so the
technologies in firebase so yeah we've
got like 15 of them so there's a number
of them that I work with from like
firebase Cloud messaging and fri base
notifications app indexing some dynamic
links and remote config and of course
firebase off so you're in a new video
series right now called pirate metrics
do you do any swash buckling in there i
really wish i had an opportunity to do
some swashbuckling but unfortunately its
budget meant that i just got a plastic
carrot and an eye patch too bad if you
want to watch that video or you can
click the link in the description below
you also have another new video coming
out a geocache that you're working on
with the Maps team right yeah so as well
as like advocacy for firebase and I'm a
real geek for google maps and love
google maps and love all the
technologies around that so it's been a
real privilege to work with some of them
and I'm doing a couple of videos on one
of my favorite parts were which is
called the places API and the places API
really it helps you to understand your
place in the real world and we've like a
hundred million points of interest in
the database and you can detect it
you're against them and that kind of
stuff so we've got a fun couple of
videos based around a places based game
that I wrote where I'm going to be
hosting the video and I'm going to
actually be doing it with a virtual
cartoon character beside me who's one of
the characters in the game wow that
sounds fascinating so I think that one
that one will be available also in the
description below so this would be the
first time we'll see a googler co-host a
video with an animated yeah as barely
human alongside a simulated human so
you're doing something else with
location-based services you have a robot
that determines your location what's
that I do yes that's this little guy
here I brought him along on the show
cool he would have been jealous if I got
on the show and he didn't we have a
conference called Google Cloud next and
at this conference i'm doing a talk on
geo location now geolocation if you have
a gps is very very easy because you know
gps satellites will detect you but
there's a couple of things that number
one doesn't always work indoors number
two it's expensive in terms of both pad
at battery and circuits so there's a
great need of enterprises to have cheap
devices that they can use to geolocate
like for example if you got a fleet of
trucks or something along those lines
and so we have an api called the
geolocation api and what that does is
that if you sniffs like the Wi-Fi
signals around you or the cell tower
signals around you and you get their BFS
ids they're called along with the signal
strengths and you pass that up to google
what Google will do is by triangulating
you from these based on the signal
strength it will then pass you back an
estimate for where you are in the world
at this moment and with you know with it
like an accuracy radius around that so
for my talk in order to have a
gratuitous demo showing this I built
this little guy de Soto roba and he has
like a Python program on him that what
it does is that when I'm going to send
him running around the conference hall
he's like he's like an autonomous little
driver saying that he'll go around the
conference all like these little these
are a little ultrasound sensors rather
than eyes and so they'll hopefully stop
him bumping into people's feet and then
he will be sniffing the the Wi-Fi
signals there's no fell on this one so
we just Wi-Fi and then getting the
location back and then those latitudes
and longitudes what spot on a map okay I
call him Rudy Rudy all right it does
Rudy move can he can ya make a little
Trek on my desk here yeah really moves
so I have him he's got like a little
random program that will get him moving
so I've just launched it takes a little
while for him to warm up so you're gonna
have to catch him if he falls off your
desk oh we have a barrier over here and
eagerly waiting drum roll go Rudy go so
there's a little program in there that
I'm kind of up there ok so I've scaled
it down so that it like he will do the
kind of movements that he would do on a
desk instead of a conference room so I
don't he moving a few inches
moving a few feet he's making her he's
making a run for making it be less so
the other said like know what would what
he's actually doing is as he moves
around my face like he's only maybe two
or three inches but like when it's the
one I'm doing and when his be moving
about 20 feet and then he'll stop and
he'll take a reading of way that and
then a precariously close the user also
sound as well so hopefully he's
protecting that he was going to fall off
the useless and sedo he moved like you
consider two inches here it was about 20
feet and then take a scan and then like
store the information are they all right
let's go no put them back in the box
yeah like yeah yeah yeah looks good I'll
turn them off the best way I can that's
the end of battery yeah that's to bed so
you'll have a show kind of like this one
called coffee with the Googlers a coffee
with a Googler is the show where I just
get to have a whole lot of fun going
around and meeting Oh product placement
started meeting various Googlers and
talking about what they do a little bit
like this like you're focused on
firebase but I you so I'd really like to
meet just all kinds of people from
google and all kinds of interesting
projects and you know we've met with
people who are responsible for those
like the android auto and cars for a lot
of artificial intelligence and it it
gives me the opportunity being purely
selfish to go out there and meet a lot
of great people and drink a lot of wake
up would you care to meet a great monkey
we have nay he wants to be on your show
as well welcome to anytime okay we'll
arrange that I'll have his people talk
to your people his people can talk to my
people so you're all over the place with
developer products at google it sounds
like it sounds like you're from all over
the place as well the particular your
action i'm having problems placing that
so i'm curious where are you from i
always ask people look gasps gasps as i
say that so I don't know my first
instinct was to say New England are
sorry not doing Let's Move Island
actually I was born in the Middle East
and then I grew up between Ireland and
Wales as I left Ireland then as a late
teenager did like my education in the UK
some in Wales some in England and then
imma graded to the US in my mid-20s and
so I've got that kind of crazy mixed-up
accent yeah and another one of the
things you do is writing and I have this
long list of things that you've written
I don't even know where to start with
that so tell me what what do you do with
writing so yeah I guess it's three
different things number one is our
programming books I've done and lots and
lots of programming books but I kind of
moved away from them because programming
books are does the law of diminishing
returns the amount of effort versus the
amount of sales they don't sell what
they used to unfortunately also I've
done a bunch of sci-fi novels and some
like a screenplay writing for like I
have produced sci-fi TV show which was
really cool out it was a pilot of a show
that didn't go beyond pilot
unfortunately and then there's also
comic book writing some at the moment
I've just finished writing a for the
merit of movie equilibrium it's like
that Christian Bale I turn in it yeah so
it's its 15th anniversary this year and
for the 15th anniversary they're
actually releasing a comic book prequel
to the movie and I got to write back
which is really exciting wow that's
that's pretty interesting so you have
your work at Google you have your
writing if that wasn't enough you also
volunteer with an organization called
the breakaway program which is for
professional ice hockey players that's
right we're retired from athletics yes
what do you do with them so what I'm
doing with them is that it's really does
players are leaving professional ranks
it's it can be a hard landing in the
real world so I'm really trying to help
them have a soft landing once they get
back into the real world through helping
them maybe explore a career as a
software engineer so we've partnered
here at Google with a company called
audacity and do definitely have some
great shooters I was one of them and
they have a beginning android class
which was designed really so that
anybody not just a computer science
major or computer geek could learn how
to program so I figured I'd try it with
two former ice hockey players and they
both thrived at this they did a great
job so we're expanding that now to
launch a program so that as players are
coming out of the league that to explore
learning android development and
learning software engineer
hearing as a potential career path and
with audacity and the nanodegree plus
then there's the job guarantee so that
if you don't find a career within six
months of finishing it they refund
everything so that makes a very low risk
as well so it's really exciting yeah I
can't wait to see how that works out if
I'm actually a huge ice hockey fan so
I'm recruiting you to help oh really
with the nanodegree it's kind of
interesting that ties back into firebase
because they use firebase test lab as a
way to help automatically test the
results of some of the homework they do
yet we can't get a video with Doug
Stephenson on it not mentioning test lab
this man loves test that's right and
there's more to come so I'm all about
the test lab so the way that they're
using test lab to grade the homework
it's fair I think a fairly creative use
of chess club definitely speaking of
creative uses of firebase you have a
personal project that makes use a
firebase Cloud messaging so with that
all about so it's I had to be a couple
of smart light bulbs in my house that
are programmable so you can set their
color so I built like a little android
application that can set their color but
that was boring so I said okay what if I
build a website and that website allows
anybody in the world to pick a couple of
colors and then use firebase Cloud
messaging to tell the Android
application to set the colors of the
light bulbs so i did that i put it up
online and i can share the URL will
share it in the description below if
anybody wants to play with it and it's
been a lot of fun with people around the
world changing it and changing my light
bulbs that sometimes i'm sitting in my
home office and the lights keep changing
and I'm trying to guess like where
people are from based on the colors wow
wow so that's something you really have
your hands full with a lot of different
parts of firebase but I'd like to focus
on authentication right now so I have a
little quiz to play with you or relates
to authentication i'm going to give you
15 seconds and in that 15 seconds i want
you to name as many different mechanisms
for authentication as you can one
obvious one is a password that's the
only one I don't agree okay well then
the game is over okay so as well as user
name is possible this credit rating
identity right so using a Facebook of
Twitter or that kind of thing designing
you could have biometrics right like
fingerprints like the things
Geronimo phones with retina scans there
are things that captures that you do
associated with a password to just prove
visits the real person and now some
captures Alexei smart the face all right
kinds up you're using your time telling
me about CAPTCHA sorry so let's see we
we had password you mentioned CAPTCHA
which was not really authentication it's
more of a proving that you're a human
and not a robot but yeah that's
definitely one you mentioned a lot of
biometric voice retina scan there is
recognized yeah i would say photo ID
actually is kind of the same form right
you just ones automated and once printed
on a card there's also fingerprints
there's even signature which could be a
you awaiting authenticate that a method
message is from someone now there's also
a whole classification of authentication
that has to do with possession so
there's those token generators you know
where you read off a series of numbers
that only appears on that one token
there's wireless tags USB tokens and
over-the-air password sent to you from
somewhere else yeah that verifies your
anticipation i luck your phone yes can
unlock your phone exactly yeah i would
put that in the possession category you
have something that is supposed to be
unique I think we have a new developer
advocate for barb and Elvis well i just
took some time to resource it even ahead
of time so i got to be the expert
because i spent some time doing that all
right lawrence good job in the game you
