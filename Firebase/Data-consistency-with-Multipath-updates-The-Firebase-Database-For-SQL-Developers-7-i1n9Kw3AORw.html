hey everyone welcome to the seventh
lesson in the firebase database for
sequel developer series and today I'm
going to teach you all about multipath
updates so if you watch the previous
video you learned about denormalization
and denormalization is just a fancy word
for duplicating data to reduce or
simplify your queries and when you de
normalize your data you have all these
little data pieces everywhere and you
can just do one read rather than doing a
complex join or another query and while
this is great for read performance there
are some complexities with it when you
duplicating data everywhere how do you
make sure that all that data is
consistent when one changes and that is
exactly what multipath updates does so
let's dive right down into the laptop
the goal of multipath updates is to
combine consistency with denormalization
this is the database that we've been
working on so far or a subset of it and
we have the users and the event
attendees so the users are simply just
our users and event attendees are the
events that a user is going to and in
this case you can see that we're
denormalizing the user data so
underneath user slash one that's all the
profile information for David and we
just copy that data underneath event
attendees FM slash one and while this is
great because we won't have to do a join
to get the user data if we update david
to dave and users how do we get event
attendees to update as well well you
might be thinking I know how this works
this is pretty easy I'm going to create
a route reference to my database then
create a reference to David's location
at user slash one and then create a
reference to the event attendees record
for David at event attendees slash FM /
1 and at this point you have two
references and we can just update both
of them to have the name of Dave and
while this will work for this simple
case
what if dave is going to other events
how do we know all the events that Dave
is going to and to do this we can create
a lookup so a lookup is just a data
structure that groups related values
together and we can use one key to find
other things in the lookup table and in
this case we're using the user ID key to
find all of the events this user is
going to and we name this data structure
user events so user events slash UID
slash event ID will tell us if that user
is going to that event and in practice
this is how it look like it would be
user events slash one and then the keys
of all the events the user is going to
and we're just simply storing true next
to each event because we're just saying
true that user is going and you could
store really anything you want at this
point but true is just sort of the
convention and now that we have this
lookup table it becomes really easy to
update all of the names for all the
events that the user is going to so we
create a reference to the root of the
database and then we create a reference
to the lookup and after that we're just
going to do a reference to event
attendees because we're going to use it
inside of this once so we're going to
get all of the events that Dave is going
to and then we're going to loop through
each one because snapped up for each
will return each event as a snapshot and
now what we'll do is we'll create a
reference to the event attendees record
so this is the event attendees record
that says that David is going to this
event and we want to get that
denormalized record up-to-date with the
profile so to do that we'll say
attendees dot child and at this point we
need to provide the event key so the
event that they're going to so events
snap dot key will provide us the key
then we'll say dot child of snap key and
snap that key is just the user's ID and
you can see that because up where we're
creating the Dave's event reference
we're ending with / 1 and key is always
the last key in the reference and now
that we have the proper reference we'll
just say update and update it to the new
name and this will look through each
event the user is going to and update
everyone and keep all of
do you normalize data consistent but
there is an issue remember that this
code is written on the client and so
we're just processing three event
attendee records right now but imagine
if we were processing 300 or 3,000 and
that could take a couple of seconds for
this loop to go through and that is
plenty of time for the user to close out
of the app or leave the webpage and this
will leave your data in an incomplete
State some of the records will be Dave
and then some will still be David and
this is really hard to roll back and
update because you have to do it by hand
so rather than taking this approach we
can use multipath updates multipath
updates provide you an atomic operation
so the operation either succeeded or it
failed there's no incomplete States so
the way a multipath update works is that
you specify multiple paths and then the
value to be updated at that path and
then in JavaScript you do this with an
object with Swift it's just the
dictionary and in Java it's simply a
hash map and you can see even through
the three different SDKs that it looks
nearly the same when you create the
update object you want to make sure the
paths start from the same route and in
this case it's the root of the database
and that's what you'll do most of the
time because this tends to be easier and
then from there you update from that
root reference and then everything will
process as one atomic operation so this
is how we can create the object by hand
but you probably want to be able to
create it dynamically and to do that we
can use the lookup so we're going to
create a function in JavaScript that
allows us to update the name for the
users profile but also all of the event
attendees records that we get back using
the lookup so we'll create this function
and it will take in a route reference
the users ID and then also the name that
we're going to update so the first thing
we're going to do is we're going to
create a reference to the user events
lookup and then after that we're going
to read that data one time because this
will pull us back all the events that
the user is going to from here we can
use object keys in JavaScript to get
back all of the event keys as an array
and then we'll create a placeholder for
our update object now that we have the
event keys array we'll do a for each and
iterate through it and for each
iteration we are going to create a path
to the event attendees record so we'll
start that with event attendees slash
the event key slash the users ID and
then slash name because we're updating
the name and we set that to the updated
name now the last thing to do is we need
to create one entry for the user's
profile so we'll create a path to users
slash UID slash name and set that to the
updated name and lastly we're going to
return root ref update and then update
everything atomically from the root and
this will return a promise from this
function which is a really nice way to
model an atomic operation so to use this
we would call update name pass in the
root reference the user's ID and then
the name to update and with a promise we
can call dot then and if it's successful
this will get called and we know that
our atomic operation has succeeded if it
failed though dot catch will be called
and we can see the error so no
incomplete states and what this will
look like is you'll see that the user
profile will be updated and all of the
event attendees as well now multipath
updates are really great because you get
consistency with denormalization
but there are a few gotchas that you
want to look out for and the first is is
that a lot of first-time users and
really you know even experienced users
can destroy a lot of existing data so
this is the multipath update object we
created in the previous sample and you
can see that we're just specifying the
deep path with the new value but let's
say instead of creating the object like
this you thought to do it like this so
rather than ending with the deep path of
slash name for everyone you created an
object of name and then saved that at
the root so you might think that that
does the same thing that it updates the
name from David to Dave in the database
but that's actually not what's going to
happen what's going to happen is is that
it's going to delete all the existing
data and only update the name of day
and the reason why that is is because
when you create a multipath update you
need to make sure that you're going as
specific as possible at the path because
a set will replace all of the existing
data at that location
the next gotcha is dealing with large
data sets so this is another multipath
update object and so rather than just
updating the name across all the
duplicated fields we're also going to
update the age across all of these
fields and you can see that this starts
to become an exponential operation that
every single time we want to update a
new property it has to be updated for
every single entry and so while this is
really small if you're dealing with
hundreds of fields or hundreds of events
this is going to get really big and it's
going to be a large update over the
network so when you get to this point
you might want to switch to the server
side and the way this works is is that
you just simply update the users profile
in this case so on the server you'll
listen to the child changed event for
the users key and then every single time
a profile updates you'll get that change
and you'll be able to fan out all of
those changes to all of the denormalized
paths multipath updates are how you get
consistency with denormalization
and in one atomic operation so when
you're duplicating your data across your
databases make sure that you set up your
paths appropriately so you can get
consistency and denormalization so
