BEN GALBRAITH: Thank
you for being here.
It is an absolute pleasure to
be here with you in Berlin.
And I've gained,
through the years,
an appreciation for many of
the cultural institutions
and proud traditions here in
Germany of all different kinds.
And I think, perhaps, the one
that's most relevant to us
this morning is Germany's
worldwide reputation
for engineering excellence
across a wide swath
of disciplines.
And it's something that we can
relate to, I think, in Google.
Because there's a museum that's
pretty close to the Google
headquarters, just a few
blocks away, where there
is an exhibit to Conrad
Zuse who created,
here in Germany, the world's
first Turing complete computer,
the programmable computer,
the Z3, which I think
is just a little bit smaller
than a modern smartphone.
Maybe it's a little
bigger, actually.
But it's a really
impressive accomplishment.
At Google, we're all
about engineering.
And you see it in our products
and projects of various kinds.
Some of my favorites
include Google Photos.
I've got just
thousands of memories.
I've got a pile of kids, too.
I've got eight young kids.
And, actually, my oldest is 14,
so she's getting on in years.
But I oftentimes want to
dive in and find memories
that I can dimly recall.
And I love how
with this product I
can just come up with a
natural language expression
and find exactly
what I'm looking for.
Also, I'm thinking of
AlphaGo and the achievements
that we just shared
earlier in the summer where
we had the competition
with Lisa Dall
and surprised the
world with what's
possible with general
machine-learning algorithms
with this achievement.
And, of course, the
self-driving car project,
which has the
potential to save us
millions of hours and
thousands of lives.
The common thread between
these particular projects
and projects is machine learning
is the ability for machines
with the right algorithms
and lots and lots
of data to make inferences about
new situations and new data
that they encounter.
So Google-- I spend my
time with developers.
And what excites me
about this narrative
is the fact that we've
taken the same technology
that we've used in-house and
we've made it open-source
and shared it with the world.
And to make this
effective, you have
to spend time with TensorFlow
and define your own models.
And then you need lots and lots
of data and lots of computation
to get the sorts of inferences
that you want out of it.
And you can do all
that on your own.
But I love how we provide a
gradual grading of solutions
for you.
So if you want, you can
use Google Cloud Platform
to host your own models
and to host your own data
and scale with you.
But, really, if you're not
interested in any of this
and you just want the
end user benefits,
you can also integrate
with easy to use
API such as Cloud Vision,
Speech, Text, and Translation,
that make it as simple as
just a few lines of code
to get the benefits
of our models
and our experience and our
data in your application.
I wanted to share this
with you because I
think it's a great example
of how, at Google, we're
on a mission to make
developers successful.
And we do it with a bunch
of different platforms
and products such as the
Google Cloud platform,
such as Android, and with
the Chrome browser, which
is our contribution to the web
platform in the web community.
And, just last month,
we talked about some
of the latest developments
in this space.
So we shared that
we have started
shipping our own
phone, The Pixel,
running the latest
version of Android.
We shared more details about
our VR platform, Daydream,
which gives people an
exciting and accessible way
to experience high-quality
virtual reality.
We took where we started with
cardboard, which was a fun
hack, and made it really,
really, really reliable
and really, really great.
And we talked about Google
home and shared details
about the developer program
that's launching next month,
which is one of our first
services for the assistant.
So these are some
examples of what
we're doing to partner
with developers
to be successful together.
And it brings us to Firebase.
I wanted to spend a
few minutes before we
go into some more of the details
on why we're doing Firebase
and what it means to us and
what we hope it can do for you.
So, at Google, we have
a lot of experience
building some of the world's
most popular applications.
And we have learned
a thing or two
about what it takes to
build an app as a result.
And we've found that it's
a pretty difficult process.
You know, fundamentally,
at the core,
you're going to have to
create an application
across multiple platforms,
the web, iOS, and Android.
And we see this
space getting more
complicated over the
horizon as devices
start to become more and
more popular and more widely
adopted, devices and
new form factors.
But this isn't even really
where the complexity starts,
in my opinion.
Because user
expectations for what's
built on top of these platforms
is getting higher and higher
all the time.
Think about authentication.
If you want to really
engage your users
in today's landscape, which
is really competitive,
a lot of different apps, a
lot of different platforms,
are competing for
user engagement.
You want to make
the authentication
process, the login process,
as smooth as possible.
And, at the same time, it's
more important than ever
to have best practices for
security in your authentication
flow as well.
And you want to integrate with
third party signing providers
as well.
And so we're way beyond
creating a simple login screen.
There's a lot you've got to
do for modern authentication
to work well.
Increasingly, users expect
to be able to collaborate
with each other.
And so you've got to think
about the infrastructure
to share data in real time
across your applications,
across platforms.
And, as another
example, if you want
to get the power of social
media to drive discovery
and re-engagement for
your applications,
you will need to
implement deep-linking.
These are just a few examples of
the increasing complexity that
are really just table stakes for
modern application development.
And this is where Firebase
comes into the picture.
Because we want to move
development as much as we can
from fighting over
infrastructure,
from thinking about all
the different solutions
that you have to choose from,
learning how to implement them.
And we want you to be able
to spend all of your energy
on bringing innovation
and creativity, something
new to the world.
That's really what we're
trying to achieve here,
is making all the infrastructure
pieces simple for you
so that you can really
apply your energy where
it matters most.
And so Firebase is
a series of tools
that help you develop
your application
and then help you bring
users to your application
and grow your user base and
earn money as this happens,
all tied together with
an analytics product that
is free and unlimited,
that lets you instrument
the snot out of
your application,
just put as many events
as possible in there,
so you can see, in
detail, what's happening.
And these include products
like remote config
that make it really easy for
you to have an application that
dynamically changes
its behavior based
on what you know
about your users
and what you learn
about your users.
It has the real time
database that started it
all that makes it so
trivial to implement
really sophisticated
synchronization
features in your application,
and authentication,
a product that takes what we've
learned from doing billions
of authentication sessions
over the lifetime of Google
and bringing those best
practices to developers so
that they can use them easily.
Firebase is a collection
of 15 different features
across a variety of
categories all tied together
with an easy-to-use
console that lets you
stay on top of the status of
all your different projects
and easily integrate
them into your own
and do your own applications.
So, since launching Firebase,
the new Firebase Google
I/O this year, we're now up
to over 750,000 developers
using the product.
And we have hundreds of
the world's most popular
applications who've
adopted it, including
three teams who are here
today, Alibaba, Glide,
and The Economists.
Can you guys raise your hands?
So check out these
teams that are here.
I'd love for you
to speak with them
and learn from
their experiences.
And we're really,
really happy and honored
to have such great
partners on the platform.
So Firebase is about helping
you develop, grow, and earn.
And, since I/O, we have
been busy building this out.
We started really broad with
a bunch of different features.
And, since I/O,
we've been busily
making it deeper and
deeper, listening
to feedback from the
community, adding
the long list of features that
we want to see in the product,
and we're continuing to grow
this product more and more.
And today, at the
summit, we're going
to be talking to you
about the latest features
that we've added to
Firebase, starting
with Google Analytics, where
my colleague Steve Ganem is
going to come up just after me
and talk to you more about it.
But before I
transition to Steve,
I just wanted to say thank
you for being here today.
Thank you for being
part of this journey.
I'm really excited for you
to have the opportunity
to learn more about
what we're doing
with Firebase, to
interact with the teams
and for us to learn from you.
So please seek out those
of us in the yellow shirts.
Give us your feedback.
Ask us your questions.
And I'm really excited for
you to engage with Firebase
and see how it can make
you more successful.
Thank you.
[APPLAUSE]
[MUSIC PLAYING]

STEVE GANEM: Good
morning, Berlin.
Can you hear me all right?
All right.
Good morning, Berlin.
My name is Steve Ganem,
and I'm a product manager
on Firebase Analytics.
And I'm really
excited to be here.
It's my first time in Berlin
and I'm enjoying it very much.
So I've had this date circled
on my calendar for months
because you launch a product
and you get all sorts
of actionable feedback on it.
And you're looking
forward to that date
when you can look your
developers in the eye
and tell them that you've
heard that feedback
and that you're making
all sorts of progress
towards addressing it.
So I've been looking forward
to this date for a long time.
And today's the day that we get
to tell you a lot about what
we're doing for you.
But before I get into that,
I want back up a little bit
and provide some
context for those of you
who, perhaps, aren't as
familiar with what Firebase
Analytics has to offer.
So we're going to back
up a step and talk
about what we aimed to
launch and what we did launch
this year.
So the team at Google
Analytics endeavored
to build a brand new app
analytics solution called
Firebase Analytics
for developers
that meets the needs of
today's modern developers.
And the core
concepts, the things
we just had to get
right, are listed here.
The first one is that had
to be free and unlimited.
There's no compromise there.
So free, what does
that mean exactly?
Free is kind of obvious.
Unlimited refers to
unlimited volume of events.
Now events are
those things which
you log in analytics
solutions that correspond
to user actions in your app.
These are the things
you want to measure.
And we didn't want
to introduce any sort
of artificial limits
on our developers
or any pay walls that might
impede their ability to measure
what's going on
with their users.
So it was critical.
And we couldn't compromise
on this, that developers
need to be able to
log everything that's
important to them, even if,
heaven forbid, your app becomes
super popular.
Right?
You don't want to
end up in a situation
where it becomes so
popular that you're then
stuck you know modifying
your instrumentation
to meet those limits.
So, first and foremost,
free and unlimited.
Secondly, we wanted to make sure
that was automatic reporting so
that it was just plug and play.
You drop this SDK in your
app, you initialize it,
and it lights up.
And we have achieved that by
logging over a dozen events
automatically for you.
These are key events, things
that measure user engagement,
purchases, and those things and
over a dozen user and device
properties so you have some
more context surrounding
those events.
In addition to
that, those actually
fuel a whole dashboard full
of reporting for you, all
with very, very little effort.
So a lot of bang for the
buck with Firebase Analytics.
Thirdly, seamless integrations.
Firebase and Google offer a host
of mobile developer products,
and there's some pretty obvious
touch points between analytics
and these other products.
Our developers, like you, expect
these things to work together
and to know about
each other's data.
So wherever it can
add value, analytics
integrates with
these other products
so that your analytics
data can make them smarter,
more powerful for you,
enable some great features
for engagement.
And analytics can act
as a measurement layer
for those features
so that you can
see what the results
of your actions are.
You'll be seeing a lot of
examples of those today
throughout the summit.
And, lastly, cross-platform
support for iOS and Android.
Yes, Firebase is a
Google Cloud Platform,
and, yes, we love iOS, because
our developers have apps on iOS
and their users
are on iOS, and we
need to enable you
to be successful
wherever your apps are.
So we're committed to a premium
developer experience on iOS.

One other really important
point that I want to mention
is that, as much as we could
have foresight in predicting
all the ways you
could use your data,
and as much as we try to produce
the reports that we think
are right for your businesses,
as much as we enable you
to take action throughout
Firebase on your data,
we fully acknowledge that
developers will have custom
needs that we could
never predict.

And in the keynote, Ben was
talking about TensorFlow
and being able to process your
data using machine learning.
We can't predict
what you're going
to want to do because developers
are really, really smart
and find extremely creative
ways to use your data.
Right?
So it's imperative that you
have access to your raw data
to do those things.
So that's why we made a way
for you to do that, at launch,
through our integration
with a BigQuery, which is
Google's cloud data warehouse.
If you link your
Firebase app to BigQuery,
then, every day, all of
your raw and sampled event
data with all of its
parameters and context
gets exported over to BigQuery.
So you have the ability to
process the same data we do.

So this is what we launched
with at I/O this year.
I'd like to take a look
at how we've measured up
based on your feedback to us.
In terms of breadth,
your ability
to measure what's
going on in the app,
you're able to log up to 500
distinct types of events,
so 500 distinct things
going on in your app,
and to contextualize those
with up to 25 parameters.
So it's not just that
an item was purchased,
but what is that item?
It's not just that a
song was listened to,
but what's the title of
the artist, the category?
So the feedback
we've gotten on that
is very good, that
you're able to measure
what's going on in your app.
Secondly, depth.
Well, since it's
free and unlimited,
that pretty much
goes without saying,
we've heard good
feedback about that.
And no one's complaining
about free, unlimited,
as you can imagine.
So we're doing good
on the depth front.
Resolution.
How much fine-grained
access do you
have to your analytics data?
And this is where
BigQuery comes in,
by providing that way
to access your raw data.
And you see the
same data that we
do when we process it to
produce your reporting.
So the feedback is great.
There's been a lot of
developer interest in BigQuery.
And the last
category is latency.
This one's more complicated.
And there are actually
multiple types of latency.
So I want to spend
more time on it
because this is
where we've gotten
the majority of our feedback.
So the first type of
latency I'd like to discuss
is the time to upload your
events from the time it
was logged to our back-end.
And the second type
is the amount of time
it takes for your reports
to update and reflect
that data that we received.
That's something we refer
to as report freshness.
So, on the first
one, typically, when
you log an event
on a device, it's
scheduled to be
uploaded an hour later.
And any events that are
logged in between get
batched together and uploaded.
This is because we're very
conservative with the end users
resources.
And we think we're doing
right by the end users
and you want to as well.
It's in everyone's
best interest to not
be a resource hog on
your end user's devices.
So we're generally very
conservative with that.
On the reporting
freshness, we update
about every four to
five hours every day
to give you reports
throughout the day.
And the feedback that we've
gotten on both of these things
is pretty much this.
But I want my data now,
said every developer ever.
And of course you do.
And we recognize that.
We recognize that
the longer you have
to wait to access your data,
the harder it is to react to it,
the less valuable it is.
If you had to wait two
weeks for your data, then
how actionable is that?
And, to some degree, we trained
you to want your data now,
because Google Analytics
had real time reporting.
So you definitely
got used to that.
And we understand
how important it is.
And so we've been taking
that feedback to heart.
And I want to share with you
some of the things that we're
doing about it now.
So recently we launched
a change the SDK
for real time conversions.
So conversion events are
your most important events.
These are the events that you
want every one of your users
to log in your app.
They distinguish a valuable
user from just a casual user.
And we don't know what those
events are for your app.
Every app's going to have
a potentially different
conversion, just like
every app is different.
So in our UI, you can
actually go in there
and identify up to 10 events,
which are your conversion
events, your ideal events.
And those will be
uploaded without delay.
When we get them
on the back-end,
we'll export them
over to BigQuery.
And that's important because of
real time export to BigQuery.
This is something else
we launched recently.
So as soon as we get your
data on the back-end,
right over to BigQuery
it goes if you
linked your app to BigQuery.
And I don't know if
you piece it together,
but the implication is--
of the two slides together,
real time conversions and
real time export to BigQuery--
real time conversions
in BigQuery.
In other words, your
most important events
available in the raw to you
in BigQuery, not in hours,
not in minutes, but in seconds.
So this is very powerful and
enables you to respond to it,
react to it, learn from it by
applying business intelligence
tools to it.
And if you don't have a favorite
business intelligence tool,
I'm going to use this
as an opportunity
to plug one of my favorite
products, which is Google Data
Studio.
And I use this for
all of my apps.
I'm an app developer,
app developer background,
and I got hooked on Data Studio.
It's a very simple product
with a visual interface
and it can visualize all of
your raw analytics data for you.
It's super easy to create custom
dashboards, fully customizable,
easy to share with everybody
in your organization,
and I want to show
you a demo of it.
So today we launched Firebase
Analytics report templates,
which make it even easier
to visualize your Firebase
Analytics data in BigQuery.
So can we switch to the
demo so I can show this off?
It's much easier to show
it than just talk about it.

All right.
So this is Data Studio.
And this is a sample report.
The teams at Firebase Analytics
and Data Studio got together,
and we made sure to expose all
the metrics and dimensions that
are really important to app
developers, like yourselves.
And, from then on, it's
just a visual interface.
To look at the
parameters and graphs,
you have three
pages of reporting
here, a general dashboard,
a look at your events,
a look at your conversions.
All of it entirely
filterable in great detail
from data that's in
BigQuery for your app.
And this is not just a
sample for you to learn from.
The point is that this
template can be easily applied
to your own data with just a few
clicks in a matter of seconds.
And if you don't believe me,
I'm going to do it right now.
So we have a link to
this in our Help Center.
You click on Use template.
You choose a
different data source
because you don't
care about the sample,
you want to look
at your own data.
I've created one
here for myself.
My game's nickname is Skate.
You click Create Report.

It spins for a little while.

There it goes.
So in just a few seconds
we've now applied this report
to my own raw, then, data
being exported from Firebase
Analytics to BigQuery.
From here,-- thank you--
I'm free to customize it,
make it look like something
branded by my company that has
just the metrics and
reports we care about,
whatever custom metrics that
might be, and share that.
And maybe if I'm not the
most artistic person,
you can invite people
to collaborate here.
So let me show you a
few things you can do.
So let's say that I wanted,
instead of seeing users
by device category, I want
to break this down and see
some other metric or dimension.
So right now it's
device category.
Let's take a look at country.
It's just really easy
to select a picker,
choose some different dimension,
get a different report on it.
And then you can just drag
and drop them, edit text .
It's really familiar interface
for doing all these things.
So I really, highly recommend
that you check this out
because Data Studio
also offers a free tier.
So you get up to five reports
for free in Data Studio,
and you can share them with
an infinite number of people
in your organization.
And BigQuery offers
a free query tier.
Keep in mind that Data
Studio's query and BigQuery
for this data and
Firebase Analytics
is free and unlimited in
terms of its event collection.
So this is, I think, a
no-brainer for developers
to check out.
I really highly encourage you
to go to the Help Center today
and look into this
for your own apps.
So that was a little
bit of a detour.
We were talking about
latency and I wanted
to pitch Data Studio there.
So we talked about
real time conversions,
we talked about real
time export to BigQuery.
But there's a whole class of
other developer feedback we've
gotten that isn't
addressed by these,
and it comes in the form of the
following types of questions.
Is my app set up correctly?
There's no real
feedback telling you
you've done things
right or wrong.
Which events are being
captured by the SDK?
Again, that goes back
to that feedback.
Are you receiving my
events and parameters?
We realize that because it
takes sometimes four or five
hours to see reporting, even
if you've done things right,
you're not getting
that feedback.
And I'm really thrilled to tell
you that we've built something,
the ideal tool, to answer all
of these questions and these
pinpoints , and it's
called DebugView.
This is real time
reporting for development.
And this, again, I'd like
to show you a demo of.

So I'm going to demo it using a
simple app that we've created.
This is a coLAB we
launched at I/O.
This is called the icon shop.
Really simple mock e-commerce
app where you can buy icons.
All right?
There's an activity
icon, airport icon.
Again, just a mock app.
You can add items to your
cart, you can check out,
you can remove items
from your cart.
And I'm telling you these
things because these actions
correspond to events.
So make a mental note
of what I'm doing.
And then I'm checking out.

Then go over to
Analytics and there's
this new tab, it's DebugView.

And there you go.
So you see the time I first
opened the app, that I first
opened it.
This is an event logged
on your behalf, one
of the automatic events.
There is user engagement, the
session started, more user
engagement.
And something else
I want to call here,
it may be a little
small and hard to see,
but there is information
there telling you
what screen this was logged on.
So we have launched automatic
screen tracking as well.
So you can tell which activities
and which view controllers are
in the foreground.
And then you will know
how much time users
spent on each of these.
You'll know where users are
spending time in your app.
So you see here, it reads like
a narrative, adding to cart,
user engagement, what
did I add to the card,
the activity icon for 40
tokens, then the location icon
for 15 tokens, and more.
I'm going to go back over
here and log a few more.
So log this one.

All right.
So it's like a feed.
So when you have new
events-- because we
want to let you
pause and actually
analyze the data without
it scrolling off screen,
you need that ability.
So you'll see the events
accumulating up top.
It says six new
events, seven, etc.
You click on that,
those animate in.
You see more events here.
You see my purchase
being made there,
how many tokens were
made, how many were spent,
what screen that took place on.
And this is one I really want
to call out, this error event.
What this corresponds
to is an API error.

So every analytics
SDK you use has
some rules about the length
of event names and parameters
or the characters
that could be used.
And ours is no exception.
And different SDKs
handle that differently.
The way we handle
that is that we
log an error event to let you
know that you made a mistake.
The goal is we
want to inform you
that your instrumentation
isn't pristine.
We would like you to update your
instrumentation because the end
goal is we want you
to come through, pass
through DebugView, and end with
the perfect instrumentation
of your app so that
your measurement is
as accurate as possible.
So we need to give
you that information.
So we have, all along, been
logging this event for you.
We just haven't made
it visible to you,
so you really couldn't
do anything about it.
That is what DebugView is
going to tell you here.
When you click on
this error event,--
I know the font
may be small there,
so you can actually come up,
if you'd like a demo later--
it tells you what
error code it is.
And there's a web page that will
tell you what that error means.
And it gives you
a reference value,
letting you know what
you tried to pass
to us that we didn't like.
So really easy,
really actionable.
You go and you find the place
in the code where you're
logging this event, you fix
it, you come back in here,
you verify that
there's no more errors,
and your instrumentation
looks good.
The other use case we wanted
to make sure we handled
here is that you've been using
your app for a little while
and then you want to go
and check and make sure
that the events that were
logged jive with the experience
that you had.
So, in the top right, you'll
see the top events summary
that shows you all the events
logged in the last 30 minutes.
So you see that I added
five items to the cart.
Here it shows you the
five instances of that.
And you can look at the
various items that were added.
And, for each one,
you get the time stamp
of when it was logged and all
the details associated with it.
This is super
comprehensive and it
should cover all the gamut
of all these questions you
are asking, from
knowing whether or not
you integrated the SDK,
that binary signal,
to the finer grained
signals of, am
I logging everything correctly?
The very first time I had
access to this news with my app
I found analytics bugs that
were there for over a year.
It's awesome actually
using the product
and seeing the value yourself.
Being the PM on analytics, I'm
actually the guinea pig for it.
And all my apps get
integrated features first.
So I feel your pain
before you even feel it.
And nothing is really
a surprise to me.
So when a tool like this
comes around and makes
my life easier, it's
really easy for me
to understand how valuable it
will be to you, our developers.

So that is DebugView.
And-- thank you.
[APPLAUSE]

So, if I'm predicting
correctly, your reaction's
going to be something like this.
Awesome.
When can I have it?
And my response to
you is, for you?
Today.

We're launching this today
with limited availability.
But, in appreciation
for your attendance
here, at the Dev Summit.
We want to make sure
everyone here can have access
to it if they want.
So just look for someone
with the yellow shirt--
well, a yellow shirt
that says Firebase--
after this or any time
throughout the day,
and they'll show you
how to get connected
and how to get
access to DebugView.

All right.
So we've talked about our
launch goals and a summary
of what we endeavored to build
and launch and what we did.
We talked about the
feedback we've received
and how there is a lot of
actionable feedback regarding
the latency.
We've introduced a
few neat new features.
And what's last here is
a taste of the future.
And what I'm trying
to tell you is
that we understand how
valuable real time signals are
and how users actually consume
real time reporting differently
than they do the rest of
their aggregate reporting.
And we know this
from talking to you
and also from our experience
with Google Analytics real time
reporting.
And so we're endeavoring to
build something brand new
that's very
inspirational, that helps
you connect with what's going
on in your app right now.
So I want to give
you a sneak peek
of the big brother of DebugView,
which is called StreamView.
This is an inspirational, live
view of your analytics data
that's meant to
inspire you, give you
insights into how users are
actually using your app,
and give you immediate feedback
of your engagement efforts
with your app.
And I want to show you
a sneak preview of it.

All right.
So this is an early version
of it, but operational,
of a real app.
And this is the users
who are using it now.
And I want to point out
that, unlike your aggregate
reporting, which just continues
to add users to report,
this is dynamic in that users
that weren't there this morning
when I checked this,-- a
lot of Americans woke up--
are there now.
And a lot of people who
were there earlier are not.
And that's the
element of now added
to these reports that makes
them so different from the rest
of your reporting.
So this first screen
you land on is just
geo map showing you where
your users are in the world.
It's good and it's helpful,
but you can go a lot deeper.
So you can see, at the
top, user properties being
logged by this app.
So these user properties,
the ones that you log,
based on information you
either know about your users
or inferred by their
use of your app,
one here is whether a
wearable is available.
You see that 25
wearables are available.
Well, where are
they in the world?
You apply that as
a filter and you
get to see who's using
wearables in the world.
It's that easy.

Top locations.
Of course, you get your
country's breakdown.
But, better than that,
when you click on it,
you get detailed information
about what cities
your users are in right now.
And you can apply those
as filters as well.
You can also see what app
versions your users are using,
which is useful
because, when you're
rolling new versions
of the app out,
you want to see that
everybody is updating.
And you see there's
some stragglers here.
And I wonder if there
are any in Germany.
Let's see.
So you apply that as a filter.
Oh, there might still
be some old ones.
And, oh, look at that.
Someone in-- OK.
You got lucky.
I thought there'd be
someone in Berlin.
So Munich.
Someone in Munich's got
to get with the program.

But you can also look at events.
So users are, of course,
who's using your app.
Events are what's going on
in my app, again, right now.
There's always this
element of right now.
And we'll will switch
to that in a minute.
But I want you to
just think about how
you would use this report.
When we say this report
is inspirational,
a big part of that is
we imagine everyone
in your organization wanting
to take a look at this
throughout the day.
It's sort of a conversation
piece in your reception area
maybe, and even guests who
come in can take a look at it.
So the map is one
aspect of that,
seeing how it changes
dynamically throughout the day.
But events are a big
part of that as well.
Because that's what's
going on in your app.
And you want to monitor
your KPI in real time.
So switching over
to Events, you see
the events that are being
logged by your app now.
And you see a whole host of
them, whatever's going on,
whatever we're collecting.
This one right here, Play
Selection, this is a radio app.
So they can see what stories
are popular in their app, what
people are playing right now.
So this can be
another great insight.
And you might want to
know where are people
listening to these stories.
Again, you can apply
it as a filter.
And the whole report updates.
So now you're seeing where this
story is popular right now,
who's listening to it.
This gives you more insight and
more connection to your users
because you know they're
doing these things right now.
You think about, wow, if
I send a notification,
these are the sorts of people,
this is what they're doing now,
this is what it would
be interrupting.
So it gives you more of
a intuitive connection
to the users who
are on your app.

You can also expand this to
make it a more full screen
view and experience.
So you can focus on it.
And this will update dynamically
as new events roll in.
So this is another one
of those showcase pieces.
If you're an app
that has-- I think
there's a use case for every
app, really-- a search bar,
you can see the
top search terms.
Or if you're an e-commerce app,
the top items that are being
added to the cart or purchased.
Your radio app, the top tracks
that are being listened to.
Whatever it is, if you
just have this somewhere
common in your workplace,
imagine just how fun
it would be to casually glance
over there throughout the day
and see what's trending.
You might discover some
things about the world
and about trends going on,
based on what your users are
consuming at that time.

All right.
So there's more features here.
Location.
Just like with the users,
you can filter by those
to see what people are doing,
for example, in New York.
Get more insights into
how they're using it.
So now that filters the
rest of the reports.
So you can see what events
they're actually logging
and what app version.
One more element to it, you can
see a trend over the last 30
minutes.
So this is the element
of a new dimension
of time within real
time reporting,
to see if there are any spikes
based on either what's going on
in the world or what you've done
manually to engage your users.
Something that I
think would be really
powerful is if you run
any sort of engagement
or install campaign, you
can head to real time
to see if people are responding
to it the way that you thought.
So if you launch a new
version of your app,
you head to real
time and you see
how many app updates
are happening
and where they're happening
if you're rolling it out.
If you launch a new app,
you'll see first opens
logged all over the place.
If you send push
notifications that
are meant to drive
users to convert,
this is going to be
the place that you
go to get that immediate
feedback of whether or not
it's working.
E-mail campaigns,
dynamic links, whatever
it is, this is your place
for immediate feedback.
And I'm excited about
all the use cases here.
One new thing that
we're doing that I'm
especially excited
about-- I know
I'm especially excited
about all of it.
Right?
And it's really neat to
see it with real live data
in an app-- is User Snapshots.
User Snapshots.
And if it looks like
DebugView, it's intentional.
Just like in DebugView,
it reads like a narrative,
the stream of events
and time stamps
logged by your
development devices.
The user snapshot
gives you a snapshot
of the events logged by
real users in the real world
with time stamps and the
sequence all preserved
with the parameters
and all those things.
So the inspiration behind
this was focus testing.
I don't know how many of you
have either taken part of
or have been subject to a focus
test or have run one yourself,
but typically you
get a group of people
together from a
demographic and you
want to see how they
use your product.
And you'd be surprised
how often people
use your product differently
than you thought they would.
And that's so true
with apps as well.
So what you can do
is you can actually
select users who are in a
certain demographic, certain
country, certain app
version, click on User
Snapshots, and it's going
to select people randomly
from that criteria,
show the events
that they're logging on
their devices, so you
can get a sense of what
they're doing in your app, what
screens they're
transitioning to, maybe
if they run into crashes.
And you can cycle through
Next and Previous.
So you can compare
that to someone else
in the demographic, giving you
a better idea of maybe it's
a fluke or maybe
this is something
common in that region.
So a totally new way to think
about your analytics data
that real time enables
that can help you
give you more insight
into how a group of people
uses your app, perhaps
differently than you thought.
All right.
So, in conclusion, just
to sum up what we launched
and where we're going,
Firebase Analytics
is free and unlimited,
automatic reporting, seamlessly
integrated with other
Firebase features, actionable,
which you'll hear more about
throughout the summit, access
to raw data to do with
it what you please,
and, now, up and
coming live reporting.

Thank you very much.
That's it.
[APPLAUSE]

Thank you.
[APPLAUSE]

Now I'm going to hand
it over to Francis Ma,
lead PM for Firebase.
He'll talk to you about
some more releases that will
help you build better apps.
Francis?

FRANCIS MA: Great talk.
[APPLAUSE]

Hello, everyone.
My name is Francis Ma, and
I'm the lead PM for Firebase.
So, as you heard earlier,
we've been hard at work
since releasing the new
Firebase at Google I/O. We've
been making a lot of updates
across iOS, Android, and web.
So the exciting updates
we saw from Steve earlier,
I have even more to
share with you today.
Over the next 10 minutes or so,
I'm going to talk about some
of the updates and how Firebase
can help you build a better
app and some of the
tools and resources
to help you integrate
with Firebase more easily.
So let's start with
ways in how Firebase can
help you build a better app.

There it is.
So one of the most basic
yet often difficult
ways of ensuring
user engagement is
to make sure that your app is
of high quality and crash free.
And, as users, we've
all experienced this.
When an app crashes,
it's very frustrating.
Sometimes so much so
that I would go and leave
a negative review
in the App Store.
Now, as developers
and business owners,
this could be detrimental.
And that's one of the
key motivations where
we've released Firebase
Crash Reporting,
to give you a tool where
you can monitor errors that
are happening out in the wild.
And since releasing this at
Google I/O a few months ago,
we had offered this as
a beta product as a way
to really collect
feedback and continue
to work with the community to
make sure that we can hone in
on the features.
And now we're very
excited to share
that Firebase crash
reporting is out of beta
with several new updates.
First, we've improved
the user workflows
so that you can mark
individual errors as fixed
and you can track which
ones have been fixed by you.
And, also, we get
e-mail alerts so you
get notified when new errors
or regressions happen.
Now, as developers,
we want our data now.
And, previously,
with crash reporting,
it could take up to 20 minutes
before when an error happens
on the end user
device until it's
reported onto the dashboard.
We've been working
really hard at this.
And now we're happy
to share that it's
near instant with
subminute latency.
We've also strengthened the
integration of crash reporting
and Firebase Analytics.
So in addition to just
showing you the errors
that are happening
in the field, we're
now also showing you the
trail of analytic events that
are leading up to these errors.
So not only do you
get to see when
these errors are happening,
but the context in which
it happened.
For example, if you're
building an e-commerce app,
you can see whether an error
happened on some edge case,
like the users
modifying a profile,
or happened during a
critical check of flow
that has real and direct
impact on your business.
So we believe showing
this insight not
only helps you diagnose and
fix the problem sooner but also
able to prioritize these
errors to see how it actually
impacts your business.
In addition to monitoring
the errors that
are happening on the
field, a better way
is to prevent them from
happening in the first place.
With the diversity of
the Android ecosystem,
we've heard from developers
that it's often not
as easy to get access
to devices to test on.
And that's where we've
created Test Lab for Android.
Today, we're excited to
share that we have increased
the number of new devices
available through a Test Lab
to give you even more access to
new devices and popular devices
to test on.
We've also made available,
with the latest version
of Android N, the 7.1, which is
currently in developer preview.
So that means you can test your
app on that now to make sure
that your app is
ready on day zero
when this version is released.
Lastly, we've also
heard feedback
from developers in wanting
to try out Test Lab
but don't want to go through the
process of setting up a credit
card.
And so we're also introducing
a new free pricing tier for you
to try out Test Lab, running
up to 10 tests per day
without having to
set up a credit card.
So if you have not tried
out Lab for Android,
now is a great
opportunity to do that.
So I just talked about
how Firebase has updates
to help you build a better app.
And this is really important.
In fact, we're going to have
a follow on session at 1:30
PM today to talk about
how the Firebase can
help you use some of these tools
in more details with live demo.
But let's switch gears
a bit to talk about some
of the new updates
we have for you
and how Firebase helps
you integrate more easily.
First, I want to start with
an update on Firebase Cloud
Messaging.
Cloud Messaging is
the infrastructure
that provides push notifications
on iOS and Android,
and it's a high-scale,
reliable infrastructure,
used by hundreds of
thousands of apps,
including many of Google's own.
We're very excited to share
that with expanded capabilities
to the web with a
new JavaScript SDK.
With the JavaScript
SDK, this means
implementing FCM and Web Push
notifications much easier
because the SDK takes care of
the complex, client-side logic,
like implementing
your own service
worker, or the
server-side logic,
like managing
payload encryption,
automatically for you.
So it's a really easy
way to get started.
And if you've already
integrated FCM on iOS or Android
on the server side,
it can bring over
a lot of the
existing capabilities
and expand that to the web,
functionalities like topic
based targeting or
device group targeting.
So if you have a web app,
this is a really easy way
to get started.
Be sure to check that out.
Another update I want to share
is the Firebase UI library.
Oftentimes, when you're
integrating with Firebase,
it involves you working
with UI elements.
For example, if you're building
Firebase authentication,
you might need to create
a user login screen.
Or if you're serving an image
that's backed by storage,
you have to write some
client side code as well.
And this is where
Firebase UI helps you.
We've been making a lot
of enhancements on this.
And now we're officially
bringing this up
to version 1.0.
And with this update, one
of the really cool features
is providing an
out-of-box login UI
that incorporates a lot
of the best practices
that we've learned
over the years
to help you implement a login
screen to really maximize
the user conversion.
So if you're using
Firebase authentication,
this is a great way for you
to help bootstrap your UI
experience.
In addition to that,
we've added the ability
to load and display
an image that
is backed by Firebase Storage as
well as adding functionalities
to help you manage your
Firebase database data,
like doing joints and
interactions on the client
side.
This is an open-source library
that's available on GitHub.
And you can get that for
iOS, web, and Android.

Another update is on the
Firebase command line
interface and a new
admin SDK that we'd
like to share with you.
Now, we recognize that
programmatically access
is really important,
especially for those of you
with a sophisticated set up.
And that's where we have
created the Firebase
CLI in the first place,
to provide a way for you
to integrate that into
your development workflow.
Examples like integrating with
your continuous integration
system to be able to kick
off tests automatically
with Test Lab or deploying
them automatically
to Firebase Hosting.
And one of the new
features that we're
excited to share with you is
the ability to import and bulk
migrate your existing
user database
into Firebase authentication
through the CLI.
This has been one
of the top features
we've heard from the
community, so we're
very excited to share
that with you today.
Switching gears
to the admin SDK.
This is a brand new SDK
designed to give you
programmatic access, using
a server side admin account.
So you can do things like manage
your authentication user data
or use that to have
full read/write
access of your database data.
Really, a lot of
programmatic access
that you would want to do as
opposed to coming to the UI
console and have to
do that manually.
We're just getting
started on this front.
So if you have specific
use cases in mind,
we'd love to hear
from you as well.
Now, for the game
developers out there,
we have something for you, too.
We know that many game
developers build games using
c++ or popular game
engines like Unity.
And, today, we're excited
to share a new unity plugin
for Firebase as well as our
expansion of the c++ SDK.
So if you're a game developer,
now it's really easy
to get started with Firebase.
Be sure to check that out.

So we just talked
about how Firebase
helps you build
better apps with tools
like crash reporting
and Test Lab
as well as some of the tools
to help you integrate Firebase
more easily.
Now I'm going to talk about
some of the new resources
that we've created to help
you learn more about Firebase
and to get started.
Now, one of the
best ways to learn
is through hands on interaction.
And that's where we've
created this new Firebase demo
project, which allows you to
try Firebase with real data,
hands on, even before
your line of code.
So this project is
based on a real app,
a game called Flood
It, that you can
download on iOS and Android.
And we've integrated this
project with several Firebase
features like analytics,
notifications, remote config,
crash reporting, etc.
And, through this demo, you
can get hands-on interaction
to do things like drill in
on the analytics reports,
see some of the areas
that are happening
and crash reporting, or even
see some of the notifications
funnel.
You can get access to this
demo projects through that URL
below.
And to give you guys a
taste of what it's like,
I'm going to ask my colleague,
Doug, to demo that to you.
DOUGH STEVENSON: All right.
Thank you, Francis.
So it's really easy
to get started.
The easiest way is
probably to just go
to firebase.google.com
Scroll down,
and there's a link
for Try a Demo.
If you click that,
that will take you
to a help page that describes
what you need to do.
It basically boils down
to joining a Google group.
And if you follow that link,
you can join the group.
It can take a couple
minutes to get started.
But once that's been
added to your account,
there's a link to go
directly to the Firebase demo
project in the console.
And so what we can see
here is that there's
an Android app and an iOS app.
Before we go any
further, I'll actually
show you how to install this.
So to get Flood It from the
store, simply search for Flood
It, choose the one from
Lab Pixies, that's our app.
I already have that installed
so I will go ahead and run it.
And I'll play a
quick play version.
So the goal of the game is
to convert the entire screen
to the same color.
And you do that by changing
the color of the area
that you control.
I'm just playing
randomly right now.
I intend to fail this game.
So, eventually, when
I run out of steps,
it's telling me I have 5
more steps that I can spend.
And if I ran out
of steps, it will
ask me to do an in-app purchase
so I can buy more steps.
So let's look at how this
looks in the console.
So if we go to
Analytics, you can
see that the dashboard
is created entirely
from automatically
generated data.
There is nothing you have
to do, no lines of code
that you have to write.
Simply integrating
the SDK will get
you a fully formed dashboard.
You can see how usage is going.
And there's an interesting
spike here on the third.
I'll go into that later.
So what I can do is look
at the events for this app.
And if I expand this out,
I can see all the events.
This is both automatically
generated events and events
that have been custom coded.
And there's a particularly
interesting one,
a special one called
Select Content.
When I drill into
that, I can see
the different kinds of content
that's being added here.
Oh.
I hope we don't
have a demo fail.
Oh, my screens wider, so
it looks a little different
than I'm used to.
So you can see that there are
levels, modes, board types,
and in-app purchases.
So I want to see what kind of
levels are being selected here.
And I can see that it looks
pretty normal, except there's
this strange level 27.
I don't know why that's so high.
Why is this level so common?
I don't really know.
I can take a guess,
but I don't know.
So there's another
event that I can
look at that's
being logged, it's
called Spend Virtual Currency.
And virtual currency
in this game
are those extra steps
that you can buy.
So I can see, again,
that people are
spending a lot of virtual
currency on level 27.
This is telling me maybe
this level is just too hard.
Maybe I should ratchet down
the level or the difficulty
of this level to make it a
little bit easier so people
aren't getting stuck.
And these are the
kind of insights
that you can get into your
app by using analytics.
Now, I'd also like to
show you remote config.
So we're using remote
config in this app
to perform some experiments.
And there's one value
here that we're changing
in four different buckets.
So the number of initial steps
can either be 5, 10, 20, or 3.
Now when I launched the app,
I was in the five bucket.
So this is where I was landing.
So you can test to see how
variance on this number
affects the usage of your app.
So if you switch back
over to analytics,
I can do a funnel analysis.
And there's a number
of funnels here.
The one I'm interested
is Extra Step Compulsion,
which measures the progression
from running out of steps
to actually buying more steps.
And so, for each
one of those groups,
I can take a user
property, the user property
is initial extra
steps, and I could
compare the people who get three
initial steps who are looking
at a 1.9% conversion rate.
I can compare that to people
who have 20 extra steps, which
is 8.3% conversion rate.
So I can compare
and contrast and see
which one of these
options will actually
make my app more money,
which is very good to know.
The last thing I'd like to
show you is notifications.
So with Firebase Notifications,
you can send messages directly
to users of your app.
And so you can see
here there's a list
of notifications we sent.
The most recent
notification is a challenge
to complete a level.
And you can see here that,
out of the number of messages
that were sent, 2% of
them were clicked on.
And 5% of those clicks
turned into conversions.
And I believe a
conversion, in this case,
is defined as
someone who actually
went and completed a level.
Now this message was
sent on November 3rd.
So what I'll do is I'll
go back to analytics
and point out that the
overall usage of the app--
remember that spike that was
on November 3rd-- that directly
correlated to the message
that was sent out.
So you can see, when you
send Firebase Notifications,
how that affects the
overall usage of your app.
So analytics ties together
these components very well.
And you can use this
demo app to figure out
how you might want to
instrument your app
and what you could do
to better understand
how users are using it.
And that's all I've got.
Back to Francis.
FRANCIS MA: Great.
Thanks, Doug.

So you just saw
the very cool demo.
And you can access that
directly on the front page
of firebase.google.com It's
really an easy way for you
to learn Firebase if
you haven't, or it's
a good way for you to also use
that to show to your colleagues
on what Firebase can do.
Another resource
that we've created
is a new online course
for Firebase on Udacity.
Udacity.
Is the one largest
online learning platforms
for developers.
Google has over
45 online courses
with over 1.8 million
students enrolled.
And now we have a new
course called Firebase
in a weekend, which gives
you an instructor led
interactive video session to
help you jumpstart into IOS
and Android development.
So if you are looking to
get started on Firebase
or you're looking to
expand your integration,
this is a great course where you
can complete in just two days.

So we're very excited
to have you here and be
able to share the updates
that we've been working really
hard on over the past
couple of months.
And we're going to
continue to work hard.
So we're really
looking forward to get
the feedback from the
community, as always,
to help us continue
to refine our product
and to work together to
help you build a better app
and grow a more
successful business.
Thank you.
