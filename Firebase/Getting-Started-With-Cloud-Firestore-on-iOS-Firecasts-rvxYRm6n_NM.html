interested in getting started with Cloud
firestore the hot new database in the
cloud for mobile apps hey me too
Wow one of the odds we meet together in
a video like this well let's work
together to save our data to the cloud
on this episode of fire casts so I'm
working on a little app here that lets
me store an inspirational quote I mean I
can't just be expected to start doing
work right I need an inspiring quote
preferably from like Einstein or maybe
Marilyn Monroe to motivate me and what
better way to do this then with an app
so my app here consists of a text field
where I can enter my inspirational quote
and another one where I can save the
author's name and then we've got a Save
button where we're gonna save whatever
inspiring message our user is entered to
the cloud later on we'll load whatever
data our user has saved to the cloud and
display it at this big label here at the
top so we can see the latest
inspirational quote that we've entered
so if you want to follow along go ahead
and create your own version of this app
um it really is nothing more than sort
of these UI elements here just make sure
you have some IB outlets for the text
fields and the label and create an IB
action for the button called o save
tapped now I've already gone ahead and
created a firebase project in the
firebase console installed firebase
using cocoapods
copied over my configuration file to my
new XE workspace and initialize the
firebase library if you don't know what
I'm talking about
check out this getting started video
here and the link in the description
below and then come on back it's okay
I'll wait alright next we need to make
sure we install firestore so I'm gonna
go into my pod file here and make sure
I've added a line for pod firebase slash
firestore and then I'll save that and
run pod install to install the new
library so I can open up my XE workspace
and I am good to go now before we go
ahead and write some data let's take a
moment to understand how cloud firestore
data generally works frankly this could
be the subject of its own separate video
and it probably will be one day but this
here's the executive summary so cloud
firestore is a document database that
means it kind of stores your data in a
big tree like structure kind of like the
original real time database but
everything is placed into documents and
collections now you can think of a
document
is something like a dictionary it's got
key value pairs which the firestore
folks like to refer to as fields and the
values of these fields can be any number
of things from like strings to numbers
to binary values to little JSON II
looking objects that the team likes to
call maps and collections are basically
well collections of documents now there
are a few rules around the use of these
things the first is that collections can
only contain documents nothing else no
collections of strings or binary blobs
or anything else here second is that
documents can't contain other documents
but they can point to sub collections so
it's very common to see a collection
containing a bunch of documents which
then point to sub collections that
contain other documents and so on and so
forth
and a workout app for instance I might
have a user's collection and this
collection would contain a document for
each user and then each of these
documents might point to a workout sub
collection that in turn contains a
document for each different type of
workout the user is performed and I
don't know these might contain a history
sub collection that keeps track of every
time the user performed one of these
workouts along with like their average
heart rate or other data now if you're
coming from the real-time database land
this kind of deep nesting might be
giving you heart palpitations but calm
down don't worry this kind of data
structure is completely normal in the
cloud firestore world where queries are
shallow meaning that when you grab data
from a document you'll grab just that
document and not any of the documents
contained in any of these sub
collections which is nice the third rule
is that the root of your database can
only consist of collections in a normal
production app this is going to feel
pretty natural you're going to have like
your collection of items and your
collection of users and your collection
of games or what have you the one time
it's going to seem kind of weird when
you're creating a little test app like
ours and you just want to save like two
strings so looking at our app at the top
level I'm going to start with a
collection that I'm calling sample data
this will then contain one single
document called inspiration and this
document will itself have two key value
pairs or fields one called quote and
another called author incidentally note
that this is basically a global document
that I'm altering meaning I'm not
storing one quote per user I'm just kind
of letting everybody in the world alter
this one document if I were looking to
save a different quote per user I'd
probably be setting up a user's
collection
and creating a different document for
each user makes sense all right let's
start building so first off in my view
controller I'll make sure to import
firebase remember that's all I need to
import no matter what specific firebase
libraries I'm using next in my save
tapped call I'll grab the text from my
text fields and maybe check to make sure
that they aren't empty do that for both
of these okay now I'm gonna create the
data I want to save in my document this
will be a dictionary of type string any
and I'll use the key quote and the text
field value as my value and then we'll
do something similar for the author and
yes if this were a real application I
wouldn't hard code the key names like
that I'd probably be using constants
okay now I just need to save this to the
cloud and to do that I need to specify
in which document I want to put this
data and we do that through an object
known as a document reference now it
turns out I'll be using this same
reference multiple times throughout this
project so I'm going to make it a
property here in my class and then I'll
set it down here in my viewdidload
now there are a few ways of setting my
document reference first I could call
firestore collection sample data
document inspiration now I kind of like
doing this because it serves as a nice
reminder that you're always going to
alternate between collections and
documents but it does start to look a
little verbose and kind of weird when
you get several layers deep so an
alternative that I sometimes prefer is
calling firestore document where I pass
along a slash separated string as our
path in our case the path would be
sample data slash inspiration just
remember then your path you're always
going to be alternating between
collections documents collection
document and so on
so now that I've specified my document
let's go back to my save tap method
where I'm going to call set data on it
which will take in the data I created
above as the contents of my document now
this will replace my current document if
it exists and it will create it if it
doesn't it also conveniently creates the
sample data collection - I don't need to
worry about whether or not that thing
exists then in my completion handler I'm
just going to do some basic error
checking and well that's about it let's
give it a try
so I'm going to start on my app I'll
enter don't be a slacker here in the
text field and I'm pretty sure that was
said by Sir Isaac Newton so I'll hit
save and
well looks like I'm getting an
authorization error and this is because
just like the real-time database my
cloud firestore implementation contains
a set of security rules that determine
whether or not a certain action is
permitted and at the time of this video
by default they're set up so that nobody
can read or write to the database so the
proper solution here would probably be
to adding some sign in using firebase
off and then create some proper
well-thought-out security rules based on
what information I'm willing to share to
each user that said all that would make
this a much longer video than it already
is so I'm gonna do a little bit of a
hack here and make my sample data
documents open to the public so let's
head on over to the firebase console I
will select my project go to the
database section and make sure I've got
cloud firestore selected here for my
database options then I will click on
the rules tab and I'll add these lines
here to allow reading and writing to
anything that's part of my sample data
collection like I said this is probably
a pretty terrible idea from a security
perspective but at least I've contained
the damage to just what's in my sample
data so I'll publish that and we are
done
so I'm gonna wait a minute and then give
it another try I'll go back into my app
hit save and yeah alright looks like it
worked and I can verify this by going
back to the firebase console well select
the data tab I'm gonna look at our
sample data collection find our
inspiration document and sure enough
looks like we have saved our inspiring
quote to the world whoo-hoo okay next up
we need to show our users their
inspirational quote by grabbing that
data and populating our label with it
now like the real time database cloud
fire store lets me listen to changes in
the database and update my app in real
time but I know that for some of you out
there the idea of creating a real time
listener for all your data is weird and
strange and sometimes you just want a
basic fetch call to get it right
so I'm gonna show you how to do that
first and then we can talk about getting
fancy with some real time listeners so
I'm gonna create a fetch button I'll add
a few constraints and create an IB
action for it and we'll call it Oh fetch
tapped okay let's edit this method so I
already have my document reference as
you recall I created it as a property
earlier so I'll simply call get document
on that reference to fetch the document
this comes with a completion handler
which I will make a trailing closure
like all the cool kids are doing these
days and the two arguments passed in
here are a document snapshot and an
error now a document snapshot is
basically an object that represents your
document you can find out it's ID reads
a metadata about it
make sure the underlying document it
represents really exists and most
importantly grab the data that it
contains by calling data on it
so first we'll see if our document
exists and if it does we will call data
on it to extract the contents of that
document as a string any kind of
dictionary and yeah I should probably
add in some error checking too but for
brevity's sake I won't next I'll get our
quote by grabbing data quote since
grabbing contents from your data like
this will always be an optional value
I'm going to use the double question
mark operator to specify a default value
here in case this is nil and I'll do the
same thing for my author name and now we
can do some fancy string interpolation
to display this in my label incidentally
you might be asking yourself hey don't
we need a weak reference here but it
turns out we don't really because this
block isn't retained beyond the fetch
completion so there's little risk of a
retain cycle here so we're gonna run it
and there we go I can now save my
inspirational quote to the cloud and
then load it with a click of a button
and it shows up in my label this is
great we've got our data successfully
saved and loaded from cloud fire store
but what if you are interested in
getting your data in real time what if
this explicit fetching seems quaint and
old-fashioned to you well let's show you
how to get your data in real time to
basically the process is going to work
nearly the same let's override
viewwillappear
and in there I'm going to bring up my
doc ref but then instead of calling get
document I'm going to call add snapshot
listener and this will fetch my document
the first time I call it but then it
will also grab updated data anytime
thereafter when my data changes this
call has a completion handler with a
document snapshot and an error kind of
just like my get document call so in
fact I'm going to copy the exact same
code for my get call into here to update
my label and well that's that's actually
it so you might be asking yourself hey
don't don't we need a weak reference
this time around since this snapshot
listener is gonna stay around for a
while and it turns out the answer is
still no as long as we do the right
thing and
these listeners some time before our
viewcontroller is d allocated that's not
only good for memory but it also help to
keep your network usage low which means
better battery life for your user and
potentially lower database costs for you
so I'm going to create a little quote
listener property here
to track that listener that I created in
my view will appear call then in my view
will disappear method I can just call
remove on that quote listener reference
and there we go that'll keep my app nice
and efficient by only listening for data
when this to you is on screen so let me
run the app again you can see that
thanks to my snapshot listener my label
automatically gets updated with the
inspirational Newton quote that was used
previously and then if I change my
inspirational quote to this one I'm
pretty sure this was Gandhi who said it
you can see that my label gets updated
automatically without my having to even
touch that fetch button Wow it was fast
maybe too fast right looked like my
label got updated before I even got that
console message that my data was saved
to the cloud how'd that happen well
what's happening is that cloud firestore
is making my app run as speedy as
possible by notifying me of changes that
happen locally as if they had happened
on the server but in the meantime it's
still going ahead and updating that data
remotely in the background now my client
still receives an update from firestore
that this data has been changed on the
server but by default the firestore
library will ignore this event because
with the exception of a little bit of
metadata that says yes this is really
from the server
it's basically identical to the first
now if you want you can also get
notified by the sdk about the second
event the one that happens when the
write actually occurs on the server and
you can do this by adding some options
to your document listener that say yes
notify me even when just the metadata
changes like so and so when I do that
this callback will get called twice once
for the change in my local cache and
then once for the server and there may
be times when this behavior is what you
want but most of the time honestly this
default behavior works just fine so I'm
gonna go back to that and there you go
congratulations you are now saving your
data and one of the most powerful and
sophisticated online databases in the
world and using it to store two lines of
text which maybe is a little overkill
but in a real app you'll appreciate this
power trust me now there's a lot more to
learn about cloud firestore including
more details on how that data
structured how subcollections work and
how to run some more sophisticated
queries all of which are great topics
for future videos in the meantime go
back and change those security rules to
their a little more secure and then when
you're done with that be sure to check
out the documentation and try using
cloud firestore in your own app as the
saying goes the journey of a thousand
miles begins with reading the
documentation I'm pretty sure Miles
