FRANCIS MA: Hello, everyone.
Good afternoon.
And welcome to the
Firebase Fireside Chat.
[CHEERING]

My name is Francis Ma and I'm a
product manager on the Firebase
team.
And with me here today, we have
members of the Firebase team
and an opportunity for folks
in the room to ask questions.
And so, just in
terms of procedures,
we have a mic over there
on each side of the room.
And for the audience who are
looking to ask questions,
be sure to speak really closely
and loudly into the mic,
so that we can hear
you very clearly.
So be sure to put it
right up to your mouth,
as though you're about
to kiss that mic.
So first off, I would like
to do round of introductions
to folks who are on the panel.
Why don't we start this way
and then we'll go across?
MALAYA: Hi, everyone.
My name is Malaya.
I am UX Lead for Firebase.
STEVE: Hello, I'm
Steve and I'm a product
manager on Firebase Analytics.
TING MAI: I'm Ting Mai, product
manager for Cloud Messaging
and Notifications.
IAN: Hi, I'm Ian.
I work in Developer
Relations for Firebase.
ANDREW: I'm Andrew.
I was one of the founders
of the acquired company
and now I am an
engineering manager
on some of the products
in our develop pillar.
DEREK PHILLIPS:
I'm Derek Philips.
I'm an engineering manager in
the great city of Waterloo,
in Canada.
[CHEERING]
I manage some of the Firebase
console and the iOS SDK teams.

KEITH SIMMONS:
I'm Keith Simmons.
I'm an eng lead on
Firebase Crash Reporting.
ROB DIMARCO: I'm
Rob DiMarco, early
Firebase employee and
engineering manager at Google,
working on the Realtime
Database, Hosting,
and Authentication.
RAGHAVAN: Hi, I'm Raghavan.
I'm a lead on some of the
products in the growth pillar,
in particular, Dynamic
Links and Invites.
[CHEERING]
NIRANJAN: Hi.
My name is Niranjan, and
I lead the app quality
efforts on Firebase.
FRANCIS MA: All right.
And so here we have the team.
And for folks who
have questions,
feel free to line
up behind the mic.
You guys can get up and just
start standing behind the mics.
And I can start to take
questions from the room.
So to start off, I can
ask a few questions
while you guys can get up
and stand behind the mics.
So Andrew, you were one of
the original co-founders
of Firebase.
Maybe one thing you can
share is, how has it been
different since joining Google?
ANDREW: Sure.
There's a lot of differences.
I think one of the
differences you can see
is just look around
you right now.
This is the kind of event
that we-- we always joked we
would have a Fire-Con sometime.
And I guess this is it.
And this is really an
incredible megaphone for us
to talk about our
products and to share it
with the whole world
in a way that we really
couldn't have done on our own.
We sort of joked that the team
has expanded from 23 people
to around 55,000
people because we're
working with teams
all across Google--
everything from the kind of
hardcore data center team,
to the folks who build the
storage infrastructure,
to all the folks in
marketing and sales
across the whole company.
So we have a scale
that's enabled us
to do some really cool things.
And you saw the fruits of that
at the announcement yesterday.
And I'm really excited
by all the stuff
we're going to be able to do now
with all the power of everyone
else in the team and
all of Google behind us.
FRANCIS MA: Really cool.
So we'll take a first live
question, over to the left.
AUDIENCE: So I've been following
the product for about a year
now, from where it's just
kind of like the database
as a service.
And it seems now, today, it's
kind of Firebase everything.
What was that transition like?

ANDREW: Sure.
I'll grab that one.
So when we were acquired, we
actually had multiple products.
We had an authentication
service, a hosting product,
and the database.
But the database was, by
far, the most well-known.
And that's because we'd solved a
couple of problems really well.
We did the offline
feature set and we
did the realtime
feature set really well.
And the reason that we
kept the name Firebase
when we expanded into
the broader platform
was really to convey
that some of the core
values that we had as
a startup were things
that we wanted to embrace
across the entire suite.
And these were things like
the cross-platform nature
of the product and
the ease of use.
We put a lot of effort,
in the original product,
into having easy to
use APIs, into having
great documentation,
good customer
support, a strong community.
And all of these
things were values
that we thought
were very important.
And it was a way of
us communicating out
to everyone else that
this is something
that Google's very serious about
in all of these new products.
We want everything to
work on all the platforms,
to be well-documented,
to be really easy to use.
And I think you asked how
that transition has been.
I think it's been
pretty awesome.
It's been a way for us
to take some things that
are really important to us-- the
developer experience has been
really important to
us-- and leverage that
across 15 products
rather than three
and see us able to help
develop our experience not
just in building
the applications,
but also in growing
applications, and earning
money, and the other things that
Firebase is doing right now.
So I think it's been great.
It's a lot of fun.

FRANCIS MA: And we'll take
a question over there,
to the right.
AUDIENCE: So I had a
question for the Crash team.
And so I was just wondering if
you guys see the product-- so
currently, there
are some other tools
that do the same thing--
Crittercism, Crashlytics.
Do you see Firebase
Crash working with those
or does it really
kill those products?
KEITH SIMMONS: So I think
Crash Reporting is really
meant to stand alone.
I think kind of the
value-- the reason
that we built Crash Reporting
as part of a bigger platform
is though, at its core,
Crash Reporting is always
about understanding the
frequency that your app is
crashing and what
are the major bugs,
I think that crash data has
a lot of additional value
that really comes out as
part of this bigger platform.
So to sort of paint a picture
about how Crash Reporting is
enhanced by Firebase,
every time a crash occurs,
we create an exception
event in Analytics.
So now you can use all of
Analytics' powerful features
to understand how
that's actually
affecting your user base.
And then you can build
an audience around that
and push notifications.
So if you have high
value users that
are suffering from crashes, you
can send them a coupon to say,
hey, we know this
was a bad experience.
Come back.
So I think that's
really what we're
sort of bringing new to the
crash reporting experience.
It's sort of unlocking this
extra value around your crash
data.
AUDIENCE: So replacing
Crittercism and Crashlytics?
KEITH SIMMONS: Yeah.
I think, again, we're
meant to stand alone.
Another value that
Firebase really brings
is we're a single pane of glass.
So we pool all these
different things
that maybe you're
getting from other places
and now, suddenly, you can get
it all from a single place.
AUDIENCE: Great.
Thank you.
FRANCIS MA: Yeah.
I think one thing to
note is what we're really
looking to do is just to
generally provide value
to help you build better apps
and to grow your business.
I think it's great that there
are many choices out there,
available.
And we definitely
want to encourage
you to pick the best tool that's
suited for your needs as well.
And so if you have
any feedback for us,
we'd love to hear
it, in terms of how
we can improve our products.
But generally, I think that,
at a high level, what we really
want is to help you build better
apps, whatever tools you use.
So we'll take another
question over there.
AUDIENCE: I have a question.
And then followed by
that, I have a feedback.
So the question is--
right now, there
is no easy way to decide on
versions of the database.
So let's say I keep on
changing my database.
How do I go back and
forth between the versions
and see what I've changed?
That's not very easy right now.
I had to write some
custom code for that.
And the suggestion I
have is-- right now,
because you have almost all
the aspects of app building,
but still, two aspects remain.
One is transactional emails.
So based on
registrations and stuff,
we need to send out emails
and stuff to the users.

And OTP-- One-Time Password in
combination to SMS services.
So if you could add
those two services,
it becomes pretty robust.
ROB DIMARCO: First off,
thank you for the feedback.
Much appreciated.
Regarding database
versioning, it's not something
that we give you out
of the box, but I
think that all of the
building blocks and primitives
are there to build
this yourself.
And it's something that we
see lots of customers do,
depending upon their
specific use case.
The thing that we
generally recommend
is structuring your
data in such a way
that the current
state of the world
may be computed by
looking at a delta of lots
of little changes over time.
So rather than taking a
snapshot of the entire database
at a given point in time
and exposing via the API--
give me the database at
this singular moment--
look to structure
objects that you
want to be versioned
as a list of changes,
very much like a wiki.
So if you think of
that example, I'm
either removing something
or adding something.
And by looking at all
of those small changes,
I can look at an ordered
list of operations
and eventually compute the
current state of the world.
If you want to make that
a bit more efficient,
you can periodically
take a snapshot, just
like a wiki would or lots of
other sort of similar business
applications.
That's my general
recommendation.
Using push IDs, you can
get easily structured lists
where each element in the list
was added chronologically.
And this is, typically, a
good approach to follow.
It works pretty well for us.
That gives you the
fairly easy capability
of rolling back is just removing
the last change that happened.
Or, if you wish, you could
sort of apply the inverse of it
to get back to the prior state.
We've got a number of services
that work in this same way that
are built on top of Firebase.
So I can tell you it's sort
of a tried and true strategy.

FRANCIS MA: All right.
Let's take another
live question.
And just a reminder,
go up as close
as you can to that mic, and
talk really loud into it,
and we'll make sure
everybody can hear you.
AUDIENCE: Hi.
Is that loud enough?
FRANCIS MA: That's great.
AUDIENCE: OK.
So last January, Parse
announced they're
shutting down their service.
And I was wondering
how that affected you,
since you're obviously going
in the opposite direction?

ANDREW: Sure.
As you imagine, I get this
question a fair amount.
I think when that
happened in January,
we got that question
from a lot of folks.
And there was
people asking, hey,
why haven't you made
some big announcement
about your intentions
or what you want to do?
And our thinking
was really that we
wanted to show Google's
commitment to the space.
And the best way to
do that was to launch
some really amazing products.
And so hopefully, it is evident
from all the new products
coming out today and everything
you're seeing at the event
here that we're serious
about the space,
that we are aligned
with developers,
that it's very
important to Google
that developers are
successful and that they
build great applications.
This is a large,
long-term investment
on the part of Google.
And I hope to prove that
out to you over time.
AUDIENCE: Thank you.
FRANCIS MA: All right, let's
take another live question.
AUDIENCE: Hi.
Thank you for Firebase.
I had a question about-- let's
say you're building a betting
app or something-- because
I hear with Firebase
we say that we're
not supposed to have
server-side code, right?
But let's say you
have a betting app
and you want a bank account.
You can't allow the client to
be able to set his own money
or points.
So are there examples of
that type of buyer base app?
And I've been asking
around and they
say to use Firebase Queues
or the newer Triggers.
So whatever you can talk
about, could you share with us?
Is there examples of using
Firebase Queues and things
like that in server-side code?
Like what is your
best practice on that?
ROB DIMARCO: Yeah.
To start, I think it's worth
saying that we've really
tried to emphasize the
power of client-side code,
but have really worked
hard to make sure
that Fireside works well
from a server as well.
Lots of Firebase are
built this way, in fact.
So firebase.com-- the website--
the Firebase hosting product,
the Firebase
authentication product
are all built using
the Firebase Realtime
Database for components
or all of those products.
In those cases, we're
running lots of server code,
either using the REST API
or with our Node.js SDK,
to do sort of lots of reads and
writes with privileged actions
to the database.
There are certain
classes of work
that is not ideal
for client-side code.
So in these cases, you might
need a third-party service
integration, where
you're reaching out
to some service with
a secret credential
that you can't send
down to the client.
Or maybe you've got a
computationally intensive task
or you've got some
workflow that is really
just too complex to be
captured in our security rules
language-- which,
while very powerful,
is not fully exhaustive.
You can't write
arbitrary code in there.
In these cases, we recommend
using our Server SDK,
if node is preferable.
We've also got the
Java Server SDK
as well, which, together, tends
to cover most of the market
that we've looked
at for handling
these types of workflows.
In addition, we've
got the REST API.
So all of those things are
not second class citizens
in Firebase, they are
first class entities.
We intend to support them.
We intend to make
them work just as well
as all of the client SDKs.
So just as an example,
think of the Firebase Queue,
if you have seen that
open source repository.
It tends to be very popular.
It tends to be sort of
a prime example of what
you can do from a server that
is not ideal from a client.
And this is working
through complex jobs that
have lots of steps, and have
lots of failure conditions
where you need to incrementally
go from one state to another,
and you want to assign certain
numbers of worker owners
for given tasks.
It tends to work really well.
And Firebase hosting is
built using that same queue.
It tends to be really
robust and a great use
of the realtime database.
AUDIENCE: Are there any
examples of that online that we
can use as a starting point?
ROB DIMARCO: Absolutely.
Quite a few.
If you find me right
after this talk,
I'll be over there, by the door.
I'm happy to point you
in the right direction.
AUDIENCE: Cool.
What's your name?
ROB DIMARCO: I'm Rob.
AUDIENCE: Rob.
OK.
ROB DIMARCO: Thank you.
FRANCIS MA: All right.
Let's take another live
question over there.
And yes.
Get close to the mic.
Really close to the mic.
AUDIENCE: Hi.
First, thank you for Firebase.
It looks absolutely amazing
and I think everyone here
is pretty excited about it.
At the moment, it looks
like all of the components
rely on Google Play services.
I was wondering if
that was ever going
to be removed as a dependency?
Because, obviously, it
makes it quite difficult
to publish on
devices which don't
support Google Play services.

FRANCIS MA: Raghavan or Ian?
Yeah.
IAN: Yeah.
So at the moment,
most of the services
do depend on having Google
Play services on the device.
Analytics, AdMob--
a couple will run
without Google Play services.
It's something that
we're looking at,
in terms of which services are
handling that kind of market.
But in general,
the primary focus
is on devices with Google
Play services on them.
There's things we can do that
we can't do anywhere else.
And those kind of
facilities are what
allow us to do some of the
really interesting things we
can get on Firebase.
So that's our primary choice.
But of course, what
you can do with that
is going to depend on
your specific application.
Sometimes this is something
that you can flag out
with a build variant or that
you can check for at runtime.
You've always got the
facility to compile
the SDK into your app, and
then check if Google Play
services is available
at runtime, and disable,
enable features as relevant.

FRANCIS MA: Oh, there's
one more over there.
I'm sorry.
I completely missed
you guys over there.
Yes, let's take
that, over there.
AUDIENCE: So this is more of a
question about which direction
you guys see Firebase heading.
Because with this announcement
of Analytics, Crashlytics,
you've now entered the territory
of Google Analytics, where
it seems like, from the
announcement and the keynote,
there are some very
good features going
towards more mobile
analytics, very
specific to that-- Crashlytics
and things like that.
Do you see the
future of-- will you
be consolidating at some
point, Google Analytics?
Or do you see this going in
separate paths of maybe just
mobile and some other kinds
of services, like web?
Because I know Firebase
can do web as well,
but now we're at a
point of-- it looks
that we should use Firebase
for Android or iOS,
but when do we know when
to use Google Analytics
versus Firebase?
FRANCIS MA: Steve?
STEVE: I'll take that.
FRANCIS MA: And just a
reminder for the panel
as well, talk as closely
as you can into the mic.
STEVE: So Firebase Analytics
is Google's preferred--
this is the SDK you should
be using for mobile app
development and measuring.
This is it.
This is the direction it goes.
It was created from scratch to
meet the needs of mobile app
developers today
because it was apparent
that Google Analytics
for apps couldn't do so.
So really, if you're
making an app with Google,
you should be using
Firebase Analytics.
Now that said, if you have a
website that you're measuring
and you really want
to-- we've made
Firebase Analytics
actually work really
well with Google Analytics.
So if you have a website
that you're measuring
and you want to see all of
your reporting intermingled
with your website
reporting, then you
can actually layer in Google
Tag Manager on top of Firebase
Analytics, and send your
Firebase Analytics data
to Google Analytics, and
see your reporting there.
If, instead, you really just
like the Google Analytics--
like the console, you like
being in that website--
you can link your Firebase
property into Google Analytics
and see your Firebase Analytics
reporting in Google Analytics.
And lastly, if you need
to combine the raw data,
you can actually send both sets
of raw data over to BigQuery
and analyze it there.
So we feel like we covered
all those bases and use cases.
It's really up to a developer
how much they really
still rely on their Google
Analytics instrumentation.
AUDIENCE: Thank you.
FRANCIS MA: We'll take
a question right there
in the middle.
AUDIENCE: So this is
a huge UX challenge.
You took 15 different apps
and turned them into one.
Can you talk a
little bit about how
you went about--
where do you even
start when you're taking
15 different things
and combining them all?
MALAYA: Yeah.
So we were really fortunate
to have the original Firebase
team have a lot of data on how
developers use their product.
And then just working really
closely with engineers
and products to
really understand
the requirement and
what's different really
about these products.
We just started from there
and we were fortunate,
like I said, to have that data.
We also have material
design, which
is a pretty complete spec, and
other internal resource that we
could get inspiration from.
And throughout the
expansion of features,
we continued doing
a lot of research.
So we had 155 research sessions
with real users, you guys,
to make sure that our
assumptions were validated
and our ideas were
completely validated.
Also not just on
a usability side,
but also on the feature side.
So we also had a
pretty good team.
So it all came
together rather nicely.

FRANCIS MA: All right.
Let's take another live
question from the right.
AUDIENCE: Is Firebase
Analytics COPPA compliant?

STEVE: So the data that
you collect is your data.
And so basically,
you need to make sure
that you're in
compliance with laws.
It's something that's important
to stress-- that the developer
owns their own data.
So we're processing your data
for you to suit your needs,
but you should be
mindful of that.
AUDIENCE: Is there
some resource I
could point a COPPA
person to that would
have that information for them?
STEVE: Again, it's going
to be your responsibility
to comply with the COPPA laws.
The data is yours.
FRANCIS MA: All right.
Thank you.
So let's switch gears a bit.
We've asked a lot of
questions around analytics,
some other stuff
around database.
We also have some
new products as well,
in terms of, say, Dynamic Links.
Raghavan, maybe just
a question for you
is, what are some best
practices you would recommend
on using Dynamic Links?

RAGHAVAN: So the whole
purpose of Dynamic Links
is to help you control
the user experience
and make it extremely
user-friendly.
So some of the things that we
have seen that you should do
is if somebody clicks
a Dynamic Link,
your goal is to get the user
to the content they want
to see as soon as possible.
So if you have a sign-in
screen, for example,
then don't ask them to
sign in to see the content,
if it's public content.
So show the content and
then you can ask them, hey,
to see more of this, or to save
this, or bookmark it, or do
something with it,
they can sign in.
So that basically helps you
get users to the content faster
and gives them a
great experience.
So that's one big factor that we
have seen in reducing friction.
The other thing comes
when you actually use
Dynamic Links in sharing flows.
The call to action that is
used to actually get the user
to click on the link-- so if you
just have something that says,
get the app, that
doesn't actually
tell the user how they're
going to benefit from actually
clicking on that link.
So instead, what
we've found is it's
much more useful to
say either get the app
and listen to the song.
Or get the app and
see this image.
Or get the app and learn
more about something.
So if you communicate
the value that they get,
then they're much more likely
to actually click on it
and they know what to expect.
So that's two things that
we have found very useful.
FRANCIS MA: Great.
And for folks in the
room-- I see some folks
that just walked into the room.
As a reminder, there are mics
here where you can line up.
And we'll take live
questions as well.
So feel free to
get behind the mics
if you guys have questions.
So another question that I
have, maybe one for Derek,
is Firebase has always been
focused on cross-platform.
And now that we have
expanded the portfolio, what
sort of role does iOS
play relative to Android?

DEREK PHILLIPS: Yeah.
So Google is well-known for
doing a lot of work in mobile.
We've done a lot of stuff
on Android in the past.
And we've certainly
made big efforts in iOS.
But one of the things
we were most excited
about with the
Firebase acquisition
was that we basically had
people who were very committed
to cross-platform.
They cared a lot about
iOS, they cared a lot
about web, as well as Android.
So right from the
beginning, we wanted
to make sure that the focus
of this was on cross-platform.
So we put a lot of effort,
right from the beginning,
into making it really easy
to get onboarded with iOS.
We made sure that all of
the APIs were well vetted,
were designed sort
from the ground up,
and thought about exactly what
iOS developers would want.
So this is a real
commitment from our side
to make sure that we treat this
is a cross-platform environment
and do everything we can to
make iOS development great.
FRANCIS MA: And we
have a live question.
We'll take one over there.
AUDIENCE: Hi.
Firebase looks amazing.
I'm super impressed with it all.
One of my questions is
that I have a big retailer
and they have all of
their user demographics
currently in Salesforce.
So the segmentation rules
for the push notifications,
remote configs, et cetera,
would be really awesome,
especially if we could
integrate it with Salesforce.
So I was wondering if that
is something that's possible
or in the pipeline?
FRANCIS MA: Anybody want to--
STEVE: So specifically,
you're wanting
to use your Salesforce data
to target push notifications?
AUDIENCE: Exactly.
STEVE: Is that right?

IAN: Oh, yeah.
FRANCIS MA: That's
a tough question.
That's how we can tell.
IAN: Incorrect mic usage, sorry.
So one thing-- there's a
couple of ways you can do this.
You need to build an audience
in Firebase Analytics
in order to target it
with push notifications.
One of the ways we've seen
people kind of address
this is if you have another
source of user segmentation,
you actually pull
that into your app
and you set a user property
in Firebase Analytics.
And from there, you
can build an audience.
And you can use that.

AUDIENCE: Is there any kind
of constraints around that?
So of you have like
millions of users
that you need to bring
in, do we kind of--
IAN: So there's no-- you're
kind of thinking of like,
is there like a bulk import
where I can just drop this in?
No.
There's nothing like that.
But if you are having
those users come back
to you, come back to
your app, you then
have the opportunity
to start building that.
What I would kind of look at
is whether you can put that in,
run it for awhile, and
then you can actually have
both systems going in parallel.
So if you have an
existing system
you're using for re-engagement,
you can try this out,
and you can see how it
works, and whether it's
performing for you.
And you'll have all that
great Analytics data to kind
of A/B test and come back to.
And by the time you've
made a decision,
your active users will be
in the new audience groups.
So you'll be in
a good situation.
AUDIENCE: Awesome.
Thank you.
FRANCIS MA: And that's
a really good feedback
as well that we'll
take back to the team.
And we're very excited to
be sharing Firebase with you
here, at I/O. At
the same time, this
is really an early day for us.
And so we're going to continue
on to make improvements
to our products.
So any feedback similar
to those or anything else
you guys have, we
would love to hear.
It really will help
us shape the product.
Let's take another live
question over there.
AUDIENCE: Hello.
It is the case that there are
some products that Firebase
is somehow or in some
way overlapping--
or maybe substituting, I don't
know what the correct word is.
For example, GCM is now
rebranded and renamed
to Firebase.
But there are also things, like
App Indexing or Analytics that
don't really get rebranded.
They just exist in both cases.
I'm not sure if
that's the direction
in which the whole app
development is going, more
into the Firebase direction?

Or are those just
things that will
coexist, as in some products,
Analytics, and Firebase,
and in the same
case, App Indexing?
It exists now with
Google Play services
and also through the SDK.
STEVE: I'll speak to the
Analytics portion of that.
So Google Analytics will
continue to exist as a product.
And the SDK, the Google
Analytics for Apps SDK,
will continue to
exist because there's
a lot of developers
that are using that
and are happy with it.
But Firebase Analytics was
built from the ground up.
Brand new product.
Free, unlimited.
I mean, there's a lot
of obvious reasons
why you would use
Firebase Analytics.
Not the least of which is
all of the integrations
with the other products here.
So if you're happy with
your current integration
and you don't need
anything more,
the hit limits in
Google Analytics
aren't an issue for you, and
all of these other integrated
values don't matter to
you, you can stay there.
But really, we're trying
to encourage developers
to move to Firebase
Analytics and take
advantage of all of the
integrations we offer there.
AUDIENCE: And is
the App Indexing
part of the question the same?

FRANCIS MA: Ting Mai?
TING MAI: So I can talk about
GCM, the rebranding of GCM
into FCM.
So basically, FCM is
the new version of GCM.
And last year, we
launched GCM 3.0.
And when we were thinking about
what GCM 4.0 could look like,
we thought it was a good
opportunity where we the Cloud
Messaging onto Firebase
because of two main reasons--
one is to really focus on our
commitment on cross-platform.
And then the other one,
like Steve was mentioning,
is really the ability
to better integrate
with the rest of the
Firebase services,
to be able to provide you with
a really rich set of services
as a mobile developer.
So that was kind of
like the key rationales
from the GCM perspective.
FRANCIS MA: Yeah.
And I want to add
to that as well.
I think you highlighted
some good points.
I think stepping
back a bit, just
to recap some of the
Firebase principles
that Andrew mentioned
earlier as well,
it's that, for Firebase,
the things we really
want to focus on are
three things-- one,
to make sure that we provide
a great developer experience.
Number two is to ensure that we
have a cross-platform offering.
And three is that
wherever it makes sense,
that we can integrate
the products together,
so that it can be
more useful and easier
to use together for you.
And so in some of
the examples you
talked about, like
Cloud Messaging,
for example, that
has really been
the direction the
Cloud Messaging
team has been heading.
And to reflect that
and to continue on
to emphasize our commitment
towards that direction, that's
the reason why we're
calling the newer
version of Cloud Messaging,
Firebase Cloud Messaging.
And it was the same
thing for App Indexing
as well, where now, we're
calling this Firebase App
Indexing for the reasons
that, over the past year,
we have expanded App
Indexing to be on iOS,
we've improved the
API to make it easier,
and now it's also
integrated with Firebase.
So it's all packaged in that
one SDK to make it easier.
So that's the
general theme of what
we would call for Firebase.
And so in other instances--
in the case of Analytics,
that required a
bigger change for us
because the needs of mobile apps
is drastically different than,
say, for web pages.
And so in that instance, we had
to step back and really just
re-think, from the ground up,
how do we solve this problem?
And thus, we have built a
brand new analytics product
and called it Firebase Analytics
to address that problem.

We'll take another
live question.
AUDIENCE: Great.
Is this good?
FRANCIS MA: Yes.
That's great.
Close to the mic.
AUDIENCE: First of
all, some feedback.
I'm a huge fan of Firebase.
I've been using you
guys, off and on,
for the past couple of years.
And I really appreciate
your communication
with the developer community
through Stack Overflow
and the Google Group.
I find it extremely
helpful, the back and forth
that goes on there.
And so kind of going off
that, I had two questions.
One was related to the emphasis
on cross-platform on mobile.
I saw that you guys
started off with Android,
in terms of the device testing.
And I was wondering
if there are any plans
to expand that to iOS as well?
And then the second
question is kind
of more on the server
and database side.

Platforms like
Parse, Amazon, and I
think there's a
Google version of this
that had the concept
of lambda functions
or like Parse cloud
code-- and I was wondering
if there's any kind of
thoughts on implementing
that on the Firebase side?
So kind of like a
client-side code
could call like a
one-off back-end function
on the Firebase end.
FRANCIS MA: Maybe Niranjan,
you can take the first one?
NIRANJAN: Sure.
I can take the first
part of the question.
So right now, we
don't have anything
to offer on iOS
for device testing,
but your feedback
has been noted.
And we'll take that
into consideration
as we plan our
upcoming feature sets.
I will note that on-device
testing generally
matters a lot more for
Android than for iOS,
due to the nature of the
ecosystem in general.
Android has a lot
more device diversity,
and there's a lot more form
factors and screen sizes.
So in terms of
testing on-device,
it's actually a lot
more beneficial,
in terms of return on
your investment there.
And iOS, you can actually
get by, quite a bit,
without simulators.
Having said that, definitely,
your feedback has been noted
and we will take that
into proper consideration.
ANDREW: Regarding the
question about functions--
as you can imagine, this is
a question that I get a lot.
And this is something
we're definitely
thinking very hard about.
There is a product called
Google Cloud Functions
that was announced by the
Cloud Team a couple months ago.
And we are looking at how we
can work with that product
to improve the experience
for everyone here.
We don't have anything
else to announce there yet,
but we're definitely
thinking about it.
AUDIENCE: Can I actually
sneak one more question in?
So this has kind of been
touched on a little before,
but I'm kind of curious
if you guys see yourselves
as-- if I start
off a new app, it
seems that having all
this stuff in one place
would be super helpful.
But for instance, I was just at
the Firebase Notification talk.
And are each of those
components something
that you see as something that
just that one aspect would
be useful to integrate into
an existing app that already
has a back-end that wouldn't
necessarily be Firebase?

IAN: So that's a really
important use case.
We've just been
through-- coming up
to the launch of this-- a early
access program with partners.
And like you kind of saw
with IZ or with Skyscanner,
they're not making their entire
app use every single feature.
They're implementing the
things that make sense to them.
So different parts
of the service
can be used in different
ways in your app.
In particular, things like
FCM, Crash Reporting-- they
don't take any code changes.
You can just drop
them in and start
using them, which is
really, really cool.
Analytics-- if you
just drop in Analytics,
you're going to collect
information with nothing else.
So there's parts of
that are designed really
to solve the problem of,
how do I try this out
for an existing application?
And there's other
parts that are there
to solve specific problems.
If you want to
integrate remote config,
you need to take some
action based on that.
So you've got to think
about what feature
you want to use it for.
But no, it's a hugely
important thing for us
to solve both the brand
new user case and also
someone that has an
existing app and just
wants to take advantage of
some of this functionality.
AUDIENCE: Awesome.
Thank you.
FRANCIS MA: Yeah.
And one of the things I
want to highlight around
that question as well is we
have a single SDK for Firebase
as a package.
But the way that you can think
about it is really a tool box.
So we provide the container
with all the tools
you need in there, but
it's really your choice
to pick and choose the
specific components that you
need as well.
So we make everything
convenient for you,
but you can choose the
specific components that
are valuable for
your app and only use
the ones that you need.
That's completely
at your own choice.
So we'll take a live
question as well.
We'll take one from the
middle, right there,
and then I'll go over there.
AUDIENCE: My question is about
complex query on Android.
Are you planning to
expose an API that
allows the developer
to query and order
notes based on a combination
of [INAUDIBLE] keys?
A combination of keys.
ANDREW: This is also a
very common question.
We don't have anything
in the works right now,
but why don't we
talk afterwards?
I can get an idea of
what your use case is,
and we'll take it back
to the team, and discuss.
AUDIENCE: Thank you.
FRANCIS MA: And we'll take
a question on that side.
AUDIENCE: So I've got a question
about push notifications.
In our product, we have
server-side processes
that run jobs and stuff and
occasionally send notifications
to our client location.
And so we built our own
push notification system.
And so I want to
know, does Firebase
have an API, so that we
could, from our server-side,
basically tell Firebase to
send down a custom notification
to our clients, so we can
remove all that code that we
had that was custom?
TING MAI: Yeah.
So I think you could use the
Firebase Cloud Messaging.
So Firebase Cloud Messaging
is really the message delivery
platform.
So we have both
the client-side SDK
that you can integrate
to receive message,
but we also have the
service-side endpoints and API,
so that you can actually
send from your push server
directly to FCM push endpoints
to deliver the message.
AUDIENCE: And just a
kind of followup thing,
I heard it several
times where you guys
were saying that everything's
free and unlimited.
Can you speak to what's the end
game for Google to make money
on Firebase?
FRANCIS MA: I can
help answer that.
I think, just to clarify,
there are offerings
that are free and
unlimited, like Analytics,
Cloud Messaging,
but not everything
is free and unlimited.
For example, the
Firebase Database--
there's a price plan on that.

So not everything is free.
That is one thing I
want to first clarify.
I think your other,
broader question as well,
in terms of what's the
end game for Google?
Just even stepping back, one of
the things that we would really
want is to help you
develop higher quality apps
and to be able to grow
a successful business.
And if you look at
other things that we
offer at Google-- for example,
we have our Advertising,
we have Cloud.
We have many different
businesses at Google.
But at the end of day, one of
things that we really focus on
is helping users and
helping consumers.
And by empowering and helping
you guys create valuable apps,
we believe that it's
going to be great
for the overall ecosystem.

We'll take another live
question over there.
AUDIENCE: I'm from Hong Kong.
I'm a user of the old Firebase.
My question is, the
old Firebase doesn't
seem as it is integrated
with the Google
global infrastructure.
The servers are still
in the US, while we
are in Asia Pacific, the
launching for calling
the Firebase seems
to take so long.
Is there any plan
for the new Firebase
to have the data center in some
region close to the end user?

ANDREW: I hear this
question a lot, too.
We definitely want
to do better here.
So you're right.
When you're talking
about the old Firebase,
I think you're
talking, specifically,
about the Firebase Database.
Some of the products
that we already
had-- for instance,
the Hosting product--
actually is located in
a number of regions.
But the Database is
currently in one region
and that's in the US.
This is definitely something
that we want to do better on.
We have users all
over the world.
We're especially interested in
places like emerging markets.
And we want to do
a better job there.
So yes, we're thinking about it.
We don't have anything
to announce right now,
but I would love to talk
afterwards and maybe understand
better what regions
you're concerned about.

FRANCIS MA: OK.
We'll take another
live question.
AUDIENCE: I had a
question about Analytics.
I know you guys are tracking a
lot of engagement type metrics
automatically without requiring
any work from the developers.
I was wondering for more like
UI Event Tracking stuff--
is there anything in the
pipeline to ease some of that,
whether it's like adding
some sort of auto-tracking
or using-- specifically,
at least on Android--
some type of annotations to
be able to track UI Events?
Or is that an exercise sort
of left to the community,
similar to what they've
done on Google Analytics?
STEVE: Yeah.
Good question.
It's something that
needs to be recognized
and we're actively thinking
about that right now.
We're definitely thinking
about a manual way
to track it that
allows developers
to say what the context is
in which all the Events are
occurring, so that you can
understand how much user
engagement is happening on a
certain screen, for example.
Like how much mind share a
certain item gets in a shopping
app or something like that.
But then also, just in
general, what sort of apps
are occurring in different
contexts of your app.
And then on top of that, there's
like the automatic measurement,
using maybe like the
current activity.
So we're thinking about
what options to give there.
And should it be automatic
or purely manual?
But yes, definitely
thinking about it.
AUDIENCE: Thank you.
FRANCIS MA: Great.
And we'll take
one live question.
AUDIENCE: So I've been looking
at the new storage security
rules.
I really like how you can
use the authentication,
and you can look at
the file type and size.
So I was wondering, for
these use cases where
possible-- one, introspecting
on the details of the file,
like for an image only allowing
certain dimensions or sound
or a video clip only
allowing certain lengths.
And then also, possibly
looking at the user's
details in the database.
For instance, some users are
allowed a larger profile image
than other users.
And seeing that in
the database and doing
security rules that way.
ANDREW: Yeah.
So there is a talk
tomorrow morning
that's actually been given
by some of the folks that
built the storage products.
So I encourage you to come.
It's called, From Zero to App.
So if you come there, you can
learn a bit more about storage
and you can meet the team.
The question about enforcing
security constraints
based on the content
is definitely
something we have
thought a lot about.
I would love to be
able to say, you
can only put a PNG
file here, but not
a WAV file, for example,
or restrict on size.
We don't have those
features right now.
We would like to.
So why don't I introduce you to
the right folks and we can take
down your feature requests.
Regarding accessing data in
the database from your rules,
I don't know yet.
I think that is a less
likely thing for us to build.
There's various performance and
consistency constraints there.
And I can talk with
you afterwards,
if you like, about some
of the difficulties there.
But definitely,
that's something that
would be very cool,
if we could do it.
AUDIENCE: All right.
Thank you.
FRANCIS MA: All right.
So we have two minutes left.
And we have time for
one more live question,
but just before we close,
I want to remind folks
that we have an office hour
right after this session,
over in Stage 9.
So that's another tent
where we have many more
members of the Firebase team
who can help answer questions
and go also deeper, in terms
of helping you integrate,
if you have specific questions.
So be sure to find
us there, if you
have other questions as well.
And we'll take one
more live question.
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering
what the adoption, internally,
was.
So how many other teams
are consuming the product?

FRANCIS MA: Raghavan, it looks
like you can talk about that?
RAGHAVAN: So I think
it varies by product.
So some of the products
are used quite a lot.
So I think of the
example of Dynamic Links.
It's heavily used inside Google.
Google Maps-- the links you
click there for send the URL
are all using Dynamic Links.
So I think like most companies
outside, many internal teams
have their own infrastructure.
But I think they're moving
where it makes sense.
ROB DIMARCO: And particularly
now that we've launched,
I think there's some
internal advertising
to do to get everyone
else on board
with using Firebase internally.
I know that there's a lot
of excitement about it,
but truthfully,
all of our effort
over the last couple of months
has been leading to this week.
As for how Firebase has
traditionally dogfooded,
and used their own software,
and their own infra--
I can tell you that
firebase.com is
built using Firebase Hosting
and Firebase Authentication.
And each of those
services, in turn,
are built on the database, as I
mentioned to another person who
asked a question.
So a big part of
the Firebase ethos
is to make sure our
products are really
good by using them ourselves.
And in turn, we work really
hard to make great APIs
and very performant services
because we are consumers
of those products, too.
TING MAI: And for Messaging,
there's actually a lot, a lot,
a lot of internal teams using
Firebase Cloud Messaging.
IAN: Yeah.
It's just worth being aware
that a lot of this stuff
is the public facing
version of something
we have in internally.
So they may have
a different name,
but internally, we're using
something very similar.
So you will find it in
the apps, just not quite
looking exactly the same APIs
as you're seeing it here.
FRANCIS MA: All right.
And we're at time right now.
Thank you for coming out to
join us in this Fireside Chat.
And as I mentioned,
we're all going
to be over there in Stage 9.
So if you have more questions,
please come find us.
And we also have more
sessions and also Office
Hours tomorrow as well.
And you can check your
schedules for that.
Thank you for coming out.
