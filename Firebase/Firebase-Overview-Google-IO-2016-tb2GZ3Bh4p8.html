thank you thank you good afternoon and
welcome to firebase overview my name is
Francis MA and I'm James Tamplin and we
are the product leads of firebase
alright so you all heard some pretty
exciting news in the keynote this
morning what did you guys think so in
this session here we're going to give
you the next level of detail and we have
an immense amount of code to cover so
let's get going
so creating a successful app is still
too hard developers like you our time
and resource constrained it doesn't make
sense for you to be managing a dozen
different tools or to be building
infrastructure that isn't your core
competency and we think that building a
successful app needs to be significantly
more simple and to accelerate our effort
in this front in late 2014 we acquired
firebase and welcomed James and his team
firebase was a mobile backend as a
service that lets you build a mobile app
on iOS Android and the web without
managing your own back-end we've seen
incredible growth over the past year and
a half and a since had grown over
450,000 developers on firebase and since
then developers like yourselves have
been asking for even more and so we've
been working with teams from across
Google and with developers from across
the world large and small to make our
product offering even better and today
we're proud to share with you the new
firebase
so until today
firebase had three features that helped
power your apps back-end and we're
expanding we're adding more tools to
help you develop your app including
additional back-end services and tools
to ensure that you ship a high-quality
application second we're adding tools to
help you grow your user base to acquire
and engage users and we're also helping
you to earn money but on top of these
three pillars we're adding a brand new
analytics product that ties everything
together so from the original three
products firebase is expanding to a
suite of 15 products and integrations
and this is what it looks like today
so we're super excited to share with you
our all of the details but you should
know that as we're expanding we're doing
so according to the original principles
that we had for firebase first developer
experience matters firebase is renowned
for easy-to-use ap is excellent
documentation and great support and
we're continuing all of that with our
new offerings second firebase is
cross-platform it's not just for Android
whether you're building iOS apps Web
Apps or Android apps you can use
firebase and third firebase is an
integrated suite of tools there's one
SDK one console and one place to go for
documentation and support and where it
makes sense data flows between our
products to help you do more faster so
that's an overview of our principles now
I'll turn it over to Francis and we can
dive right in now we're going to do a
product walkthrough to show you how this
all comes to life we're going to start
with an onboarding experience to show
you how you can quickly integrate with
firebase and then we're going to walk
through these features to show you how
you can use firebase to develop grow and
earn let's switch over to the demo so
what you see here is the new firebase
console this is the single place where
you need to go to setup and manage your
app over here on the left is a
navigation for you to access the
different firebase features and getting
started is very easy I'm going to show
you an example of how it's like
integrating an app on iOS so I clicked
on the iOS button and now a wizard pops
up I just enter the bundle ID
and now a config file is automatically
generated you just need to drag and drop
that into your IDE after that you can
use the cocoa pod package manager to
download the SDK which is these three
simple commands with that now the SDK is
installed on your development machine
and next all you have to do is copy and
paste these two lines of code in bold to
get the basic integration started you
import the SDK and you just configure it
and boom you're done and now rendered so
let's switch back over to the slide and
so the two steps that you just saw was a
very quick way to get started with the
basic integration that basic integration
gets you firebase analytics firebase
analytics is a brand-new product built
from ground up from our experience in
running Google Analytics except it is
designed specifically for the unique
needs of mobile apps instead of focusing
on sessions and pageviews it is event
centric and user centric and being the
hearts of the firebase product suite the
inside its connects across all firebase
features and most importantly it is free
and unlimited let's switch back over to
the demo and I'll show you what this is
like
now to walk you through the demo I'm
going to show you a production app
called bingo blast
bingo glasses you can imagine this is a
bingo game that's available on Android
and iOS so now we're back to the console
and you see these are the apps that I
have I have my production app on Android
a pre-production app in iOS and got some
analytics populated but let me drill
into firebase analytics for this iOS app
so the main view for firebase analytics
is this dashboard that gives you an
overview of all the key metrics for your
app it shows you the number of active
users across from monthly weekly daily
it shows you the revenue that you get
from in-app purchases it shows you where
your users are coming from across
different marketing channels it shows
them how often they're coming back to
your app it shows them it shows you how
often use or how much time users are
spending in your app the in-app purchase
activities are making and the
distribution of your app versions across
different devices but here's the cool
part we also layer on top unique Google
insights that give you the breakdown of
the countries of where your user bases
and also demographics and their interest
you get all of this from just the two
lines of code that I've just shown you
now if you want to drill in and get
deeper insights you can use you can lock
analytic events to get fine-grain events
are happening inside your app to get a
deep understanding of how users are
behaving for example in the case of the
bingo game you can highlight you can
measure things like how often users have
highlighted an app or how often they've
made a mistake you can drill in then see
these events happening as they for for
different users another key concept for
analytics is the notion of audiences
audiences lets you group your users
based on their behavior and user
attributes
here out of the box we have predefined
your entire user base and also a
specific audience for those who have
made an in-app purchase let me show you
how you can create a new audience so I
just click new audience and now I can
just type in a name Oh
typo so I want to see how many of my
users are Canadian purchasers so I can
go into user properties find the country
and here it is and they have taken an
event in app purchase
and boom there you have it now I've
created an audience and now whenever I
have Canadian users making in-app
purchases they will be grouped in this
audience and the two key things to know
about audiences is that first it lets
you drill in to filter your dashboards
and your data across analytics to get a
deeper insights so here is the overview
of my entire app but let's say I want to
zoom in on just the purchasers note the
graph looks very different now now I can
really drill in to see how my paying
users are behaving another aspect of
audiences is that it's integrated across
other firebase features so that you can
take targeted actions for example being
able to send targeted notifications or
run experiments to specific groups which
we'll show you in a little bit so I've
talked about ways that you can see how
users are behaving in your app let's
switch over to the attribution tab in
this view it lets you see where your
users are coming from and not only just
where users are coming from but we also
provide the next level of insights on
what actions they're taking and you can
go back and attribute the actions to the
source that they came from for example
in the case of in-app purchase you can
set up your different marketing channels
with different that you may be
advertising across different ad networks
and see of which of those ad networks
drive the most in app purchase so that
way you can tell not only which channel
drive you the highest volume of users
but which of those drive the most
valuable users another insight that
analytics show you is the concept of
funnels so going back to the bingo game
you can see how how many users are able
to make it through the tutorial as an
example we also have another view the
notion of cohorts or user retention that
shows you how often users are coming
back so after I've the first-time users
have launched my app on day 2 day 3 how
often are they coming back and we also
show you a cohort view for week after
week there's a lot more to go through
analytics and what I've just shown you
was just the overview we're going to
have a
session right after this here in the
same room to go talk more about
specifics on analytics and share the
best practices with you so if you're
interested be sure to stay around let's
switch back over to the slides so we've
just seen a fantastic overview of just
how powerful firebase analytics is now
let's jump into the products that
firebase has to help you develop your
app we'll start with our back-end
services and first authentication so
most apps want to know who a user is so
they can provide them a more
personalized experience and this is
exactly what firebase authentication
does it helps you with identity and user
management we support email and password
login social login through Facebook
Twitter github and Google now there are
two and we also integrate with your
existing loss system if you want extra
flexibility so there are two cool things
to note today first is authentic a
firebase authentication now runs on the
same technology that powers Google's own
authentication systems and second we
have a brand-new out-of-the-box UI
library it helps you implement your
login flows using best practices and
stops you from having to reinvent the
wheel so you can get up and running
quickly and it's open source and on
github authentication also integrates
with other firebase features for example
it'll let you grant users access to the
real time database on a per user basis
speaking of which let's move over to the
real time database it's probably the
feature that if you've used firebase
before you're most familiar with it's a
cloud hosted no sequel JSON database and
whenever you write data into the
database it stores and synchronizes it
out to multiple clients in Miller tour
every client who cares in milliseconds
now this real time functionality is
perfect for building rich collaborative
application
and your users are used to these and we
let you deliver nowhere
should people see the phrase
pull-to-refresh ever again next the
real-time database also has a cool
function where it stores data either
in memory or on disk on the device and
this means when you're going through a
tunnel or you lose Internet connectivity
your app stays responsive when you come
back online
everything synchronizes back up to state
the next feature I want to talk about is
firebase hosting so if you're building a
web or a mobile web application you
should use firebase hosting to host your
HTML your CSS JavaScript and images it's
backed by a CDN for global low latency
and it's holy and we give you an SSL
certificate so it's secure by default
and we're announcing today that the
price of bringing your own custom domain
to firebase hosting is now completely
free
so you might want to store more types of
data than just structured JSON on your
database or static assets for hosting in
fact one of our biggest feature requests
has been the ability to store files like
user profile pictures videos and audio
files and we heard you so today we're
announcing firebase storage it's easy
file storage
it handles poor internet connectivity
and it's backed by an accessible from
Google Cloud storage so that means you
get the full power of juice yes like
global edge caching and it's accessible
using the Google Cloud Storage API s so
you can integrate it if you have
existing infrastructure let's switch
over to the demo and we'll see this in
action
so what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to request some audience
participation
so I've got an app that's built in fire
built five a storage into it and I'm
going to ask you all to throw up your
hands and make some noise while you're
at it so now we'll go over to the five a
storage console or refresh this tab and
we'll grab this latest picture we'll
open it up in my browser and there you
all are
pretty cool right so the next figures
feature I want to talk about is firebase
remote config so remote config gives you
key value pairs inside the firebase
console and when you update them they
push down to your application without
you having to publish a new version to
the store you can use this for some
pretty cool things like putting gates
behind your features and rolling them
slowly out to your user base you can use
it to optimize your checkout flow or
your onboarding flow or you can target
different types of behaviors at
different users so let's take a look
using the bingo blast as an example I've
instrumented here the number of seconds
you get to complete each bingo level and
we saw earlier Frances have in turn
mented an audience called Canadian
purchases and it turns out that we know
from firebase analytics that people who
pay for our app in Canada are just way
too good at bingo and so we want to make
it more difficult for them so what we're
going to do is we're going to go over
two conditions you can see I've got
conditions so I can target things that
my iOS uses my Android users or random
10% of my user base and I'm going to
create a brand new condition I'm going
to call it can adn purchases and here
you can see the different types of
conditions I can target so things like
device language device country app
version so I want to say user in
audience to connect with firebase
audiences in analytics and choose the
iOS version of my application that
Francis was working on and I've got
Canadian purchases I create a condition
boom I go back over to my parameters I
select level three I'm going to select
Canadian purchases and instead of giving
them 40 seconds we're going to give them
50 I publish changes and now everyone
who's a paying user in Canada my bingo
game is now harder for them so that's
remote config we'll go back over to the
deck
so we've seen how firebase can help you
with your back-end services now let's
take a look at how we can help you ship
a higher-quality application we're doing
this in two ways the first of which you
were introduced to last year at Google
i/o as cloud test lab now we're bringing
it in to firebase and rebranding as
firebase test lab for Android test lab
lets you test on the most popular
devices before you push your app to
production it gives you reports and
screenshots and it'll let you run a
custom set of instrumentation tests or
if you haven't written them we'll spider
through your app and give you robo tests
by default but you're not going to catch
everything in the lab so that's why
we've built firebase crash reporting so
you can get crashes coming in from the
field we'll prioritize by the crashes a
frequency and impact will let you drill
down on the version of your application
in the OS and also integrated with
firebase analytics so we'll go back over
to the demo and we'll show you these so
I'm going to start with test lab the
first thing I need to do is click run a
test here I have the option to import
intrument instrumentation tests if I've
already written them but in my case I
haven't so I'm going to click run a robo
test and I'm going to upload an apk so
we're going to wait just a few seconds
for this to upload and we'll try that
one more time
and the demo gods are against us so it's
a well after I've uploaded this what
will let me do is pick the devices that
I want to run on and the Android OS
versions once I've done that it'll spit
out a set of results and I can go into
them here so here's one I I made earlier
so we can see all of the devices so I'm
running this on Moto X a Galaxy s6 and
Nexus 5 etc by clicking into one I get
these four tabs along the top one of the
most interesting ones is activity map so
this is going to give me a holistic view
of how tests lab is seeing my app on
this screen and on this device and how
its spidering through it so I could get
things like screenshots to double-check
that I'm it's appearing okay on this
device and I can even get a video of
test lab walking through the application
I can see logs and filter by errors
warnings and info so that's Tesla
jumping over to crash reporting let's
look at some actual data from bingo
blast so I can see in the last 30 days
on this top card I've seen nine nine
thousand three hundred individual
crashes they've been clustered into one
hundred and nineteen types of crash and
they've affected in purple here two
thousand six hundred users in this
second card
they've been prioritized for me so I can
say that this curl close has affected
one thousand two hundred users and has
occurred five thousand three hundred
times I can click into this to get the
details in this top card I'm going to
get aggregated details about the type of
iOS version it's affecting and the
devices it's affecting and then I can go
down here and cycle through each
instance and view the stack trace so now
we'll go back to the deck
so that was test lab and crash reporting
and they help you ship higher quality
applications finally I want to talk
about some of the integrations that
we've done with firebase and other
Google services first we've integrated
firebase with Google Play things like
in-app purchases flow directly through
to firebase analytics and things like
application not responding or ANR's
flow through to firebase crash reporting
secondly Google Cloud we've connected
firebase with Google Cloud at an account
level so you can easily attach Google
cloud resources to your firebase
application easily so this lets us do
things like access Google Cloud Storage
from both firebase and from Google cloud
and you can expect much more of this in
the future we're working closely with
the Google cloud functions team to help
you bring lightweight compute to
firebase so that's how firebase can help
you develop an application I'll turn it
back over to Francis to talk about how
you can grow a business with firebase
so just so James just talked about how
you can use firebase to develop an app
more easily and tools that can help you
build a higher-quality app now I'm going
to talk about how you can use some of
the firebase features to grow a business
we're going to talk over ways that you
can use firebase to acquire more users
we engage more users and also to earn
more easily let's start with user
acquisitions now we know that users
often discover app through word of mouth
and I'm sure many of you have gotten
email like this from a friend that have
shared an app with you but oftentimes
when you click on that link you end up
in a static page like this it doesn't
even know what type of phone you're on
and as developers we built this is
because the work actually to turn a web
link into the States
into into a specific state in your
native app it's a lot of work especially
when you have to do this across two
different platforms so let's assume that
the user is able to go in and choose the
right store down
load and is able to download your app
and starts it now she would come into
this generic screen not really the bingo
game that she was invited to and that
isn't a great experience either so all
in all this is really high friction not
only for users to share your app but
also for you to promote your app through
other web channels like using email SMS
or posting this on a tweet now imagine
would it be nice if that was a much
easier way where you can share a link
and that link can be dynamic and figure
out the type of phone the user is on
whether or not the app is installed if
not take them to the right store and
when the users installs it and starts it
for the first time it will take them to
the right content of the app but not
only that it will take them to the
specific state that the link was meant
for them the user was invited to a bingo
game challenge and now there are brought
right into it with this these three
clicks and to help you solve that
problem fire based dynamic links is what
does that for you dynamic links provide
a single URL that you can configure
where do you send your users on-the-fly
that one URL also works across different
platforms and the states can be
preserved even through the install flow
and we also provide analytics insights
as well let's switch over to the demo
and see and show you how dynamics set up
words so here I'm back to the firebase
console on the Left I can access my
dynamic links okay and up on the top
rights I can create a new link it's
really simple so let's say I have a fall
promo I can type in HD URL right here
oops
and now I can select a specific app that
I want to send them to so in this case I
have a production app and also a test
app I can select the right app and
likewise on iOS now there are other
Advanced Options as well but to get the
basic link traded it's that simple just
create now a short link is automatically
generated for you and you can use that
link and the right behavior will happen
just I had shown you earlier and here
are some other examples of links that
I've created and now you can go in and
see how many clicks these individual
links have driven through so you can use
that one link and use it across
different campaigns or you can choose to
create different links and be able to
see which of these links are performing
best let's switch back over to the
slides so on the topic of sharing with
dynamic links another great way to help
you do that is with firebase invites
firebase invites provide a drop-in
widget to help you create a sharing but
sharing UI for your users through SMS
and email but not only that Google will
also suggest to the sender the
recipients that they should send to and
all of this is built on dynamic link so
the same behavior happens it works
across platform when the user clicks on
the link the stage will be preserved
here's an example of what dynamic or
firebase invites look like over on the
left is your app where let's say you're
running a promotional campaign where
both the sender and the receiver gets
15% off so the sender clicks send now
the middle screen is the firebase
invites widget you can customize that to
match the look and feel of your app and
notice the list of recipients there it's
not just an alphabetically sorted list
it is a list that's suggested by Google
on who's most likely to be interested in
this app and on the right is the
recipient who is using a different
device again because this is built on
dynamic links it works across platform
and when they click on it it will take
them to the right spot in the app so
I've just talked about two ways that you
can drive or again
growth with dynamic links and invites
now to feel your growth engine a great
way to do that is tapping into the reach
of Google through Adwords
since last year we introduced a new
feature called universal app campaigns
it's an easy way for you to drive
installs through the reach of Google
across the different properties for
example Google search Google Play
YouTube or the Display Network you can
reach over billion users all you have to
do is set a specific budget and Google
will automatically figure out the best
channel to help you find the most
valuable users and we've seen incredible
traction over the last year and to date
we have driven over 2 billion app
installs from our ads we've offered this
on Android and now we're expanding this
to iOS as well and here's the cool part
AdWords is integrated with firebase so
what that means is you can take your
audiences from your firebase analytics
and use that for remarketing in AdWords
so I can go back and send a specific
promo to my Canadian purchasers right
into Adwords another aspect of this
integration is that it lets you import
your events from your analytics into
Adwords as a way to track conversions
not only does it help you measure the
result but it also helps inform AdWords
to help optimize your campaign for those
actions so let's say if the specific
action I want it's not just a drive
installs but really a one users to come
in and make in-app purchase I can send
those events over to Adwords and AdWords
will automatically optimize for that so
this is a really cool way to fuel your
growth so I just walked over some
features to talk about active horn users
let's switch gears to talk about how you
can reengage users to extend the
lifetime value of these users one of
these cool ways of doing that is with
app indexing
app indexing is a great way to get your
app content exposed through Google
search now some of you may have heard of
app indexing before this is the same app
indexing and now it's integrated into
firebase to make your integration even
easier you can use the same in SDK and
now you can get your app is indexed to
Google search and one thing to note is
that through app indexing Google search
can use that as one of its signals for
its for its ranking so when your indexed
your app it's a great way to further
increase your exposure through Google
search another great way to drive
re-engagement is through notifications
many of you are familiar with Google
Cloud messaging it's the most popular
messaging service that's used by over 1
million apps and since over the past
year we have worked really hard to
improve the developer experience we've
also expanded it across platforms so not
only is it targeting for Android
developers but it also works on iOS
Chrome and web push and now we've also
integrated that with firebase as well do
those three principles sound familiar to
you better developer experience
cross-platform integrated with firebase
to reflect our commitment to continue to
make this better we're now calling this
firebase cloud messaging
additionally we're also building a new
feature called firebase notification
firebase notification is a new UI
accessible through the console that's
built on top of cloud messaging this UI
lets you compose a notification without
writing a single line of code and since
this integrated and part of firebase you
can take the same analytics audience and
use that to target your notifications
and since it's also connected with
analytics you can also measure the
conversion events let's switch over to
the demo and I'll show you what this
looks like so here on the Left I can
access notification view
creating a notifications really simple
just click new message so let's say $5
promo a now I can even schedule that to
be sent at a later time it's a long
weekend in Canada next week I will send
that promo at that time and I select my
app and now watch this I can specify the
specific audience that I want to target
to my Canadian purchasers but there's
more I don't want to just send a
notification to get them to open the app
what I really want is to make sure that
they are taking the actions inside the
app that I wanted to take for example if
I want them to continue on and make more
in-app purchases so I can set that as a
conversion event and if I want to I can
also specify other Advanced Options like
passing in my own custom key value pair
to specify a state when they open the
notification so I click schedule they
asked me to confirm and here now I have
the schedule is going to go out on May
23rd let's switch back over to the
slides and we're going to travel in time
to the Future May 23rd notifications
will go out to thousands of my users and
now on the bottom right there you can
see the conversion funnel the number of
notifications that were sent the number
that were opened and the number that
converted the number of users who have
taken the in-app purchase action that I
wanted them through so in addition to
using firebase to help you grow your
audience you can also use it to help you
monetize more easily one of the most
popular ways of monetizing and mobile
apps is through display ads and AdMob
helps you do it AdMob offers many
engaging formats from video interstitial
or native that can match the look and
feel of your app today it's there over 1
million developers that are using AdMob
and AdMob is also integrated with
firebase that means you can use the same
okay to use AdMob with your app but not
only that you can also use AdMob with
other firebase products such as remote
config so that you can now use that to
say run experiments to figure out which
format is best or you can try to
experiment with the different
positioning of your app or if you want
to supplement your income in became in
the case of bingo blast I can now show
ads only to those users that are not
making in-app purchase so we've just
talked about ways on how you can use
firebase to help you develop grow and
earn let's switch over to here from some
of the partners who we've been working
with and share their experience about
firebase
we're going to show you two videos first
is from NPR so National Public Radio are
well renowned broadcaster here in the US
they're moving towards a broadcast model
and trying to understand how they can
best engage their mobile users and the
second is called is there are high tech
startup based in New York City who's
developed an innovative location-based
application so let's take a look at what
both of them have done with firebase
with NPR one we are reimagining what a
listening experience could be outside of
the radio it's the radio but better it
has all of the great stuff that we've
spent 40 years perfecting with NPR one
we see the opportunity of reaching a
more diverse audience that have a device
in their pocket at all times my name is
Mike safely in the lead mobile developer
for NPR digital media my name is Nick
Despres and I'm the innovation
accountant at NPR
my name is TJ's mystery and a little
senior product manager of NPR work
there's some of the biggest challenges
in any mobile app are that first
impression when the user first installs
the app you've got a very limited amount
of
to convince them to keep the app and to
get engaged in the experience trying to
figure out how we can get users into the
content as quickly as possible was the
real focus of integrating firebase and
dynamic links using dynamic links we
were able to shorten the number of
interactions it takes for a user
installing the app to get from the
promoted content to the content from 20
to 3 so that user is able to get right
into the content we're driving more and
more listening per user every week it's
really astounding creating playlists of
content that are configured by the
podcaster or by a member station or by
us internally and with firebase we have
that at our hands having the analytics
product interact with things like
dynamic links remote configuration cloud
messaging and adds a real multiplier
effect and the integration with the
broader firebase suite I don't have to
go outside the platform to figure out
what's working so it's not just about
shipping the product faster
it's about analyzing the results faster
and with the integration with all the
other firebase products we're really
excited about all the things we can
learn from it
and so we'll go quickly into the next
video which is is we started is on a
living room couch and we really started
because the problem that we had which
was asking the same questions or our
closest friends where are you what are
you doing
we were baffled by the fact that there
wasn't a solution that solved this
problem
and we felt like we could build one that
was better the value that is drives for
all users is knowing which of your
friends are nearby so if you look around
where we are right now in arena how many
times have people go on to a basketball
game hockey game or a concert and found
out the next day that they had friends
were at the same event and think about
all those moments that are missed
because they didn't know they had
friends there so what we're solving is
letting people know who's nearby and
making those moments matter
my name is diesel pelts and I'm the
founder and CEO of is I'm Marc French
co-founder of is we felt there was no
reason users should manually go fetch
data when I get a text message or no
reason for me to tap refresh we felt why
should it be different from anything
else and firebase let us solve that
firebase really allowed us to enhance
user experience by making it real-time
simplify the UI by not having a refresh
button and cut down on development i'm
like any startup the most valuable asset
that you have is your team and your time
and what firebase is allowed us to do is
save 50 percent in terms of time by
moving that much quicker with a product
it's a game changer
we're using 8 features from firebase
right now their analytics remote config
dynamic links the real-time database and
more traditionally that would have been
in 8 different places and now we go to
one place for the firebase console we're
eager to launch this product in a big
way we're seeing how people are using
the product and how they're inviting
more and more friends that were
concerned we're growing very very
quickly so we sleep a lot easier at
night knowing that we got firebase
that's really there to build that
infrastructure if you're developer use
it we love it and it's enabled us to
focus on developing the user experience
and not have to worry about the things
in the background that should be there
we're super excited to be part of Google
i/o today and what we're making
available is everybody here at the event
has access to is so invite your friends
and see what's going on at the event in
addition for everybody that's watching
at home they can also sign up for the
app ed is app comm / i/o
so it's fantastic to see these two great
companies using firebase NPR to give
their mobile users a much better
experience and understand what's going
on in their application and is who's at
the other end of the lifecycle just
getting started and using the full power
of the firebase platform to build and
grow their application is we chose
because you today will be wandering
around shoreline you should download it
is app comm / i/o and you can see where
your friends are throughout the fiorina
and so to recap we've just walked you
through the product suite of firebase
firebase offers develop back-end
services that can help you quickly build
an app easily without managing your own
back-end infrastructure we also provide
a set of tools that help you build
higher quality apps we help you acquire
more users we engage them and also earn
more easily and tying it all together is
the analytics product that gives you
insights to help you develop grow and
earn now remember that when I started
this I showed you
getting started with firebase only
required copy and pasting two lines of
code you can do this right after this by
going to firebase Google comm and if you
want to learn more about each one of the
features we just talked about we have
specific sessions on each one of these
features so be sure to look at the
schedule since firebase since we just
unveiled firebase today the schedule has
just been published so be sure to check
them out and if you have questions along
the way on help in looking to integrate
firebase you can come to one of our
office hours at 3 o'clock today or at 6
o'clock with many members from the
firebase team here and our goal is to
help you integrate firebase before you
leave Google i/o thank you so much for
coming out so we're also here we are in
the yellow t-shirts so you have the
office hours but also grab the firebase
team and we're giving this to you early
or so we're out we're early in our life
