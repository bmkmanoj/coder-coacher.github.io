coming today to this session
my name is Timo I'm a product manager on
Google search and I work on app indexing
and here with me I have Fabien was a
software engineer who also works on app
indexing we're very excited to talk to
all of you about app indexing today I'll
start out with a quick overview of what
happening is all about I'll tell you a
little bit how you can use Google search
to get more active users and to get keep
those users engaged then farming is
going to talk a little bit of how how
you can get started with app indexing
will conclude with a very exciting
outlook of what we are going to do later
this year around personal content with a
couple of very exciting demos every day
users come to Google billions of times
with information needs and that happens
in many countries more often on mobile
than on desktop now your app can be
relevant to these billions of
information needs your app content can
help all of these users that come to us
with various needs that they have now
the question is how can you actually
connect your app with all of those users
and their needs and that's what we're
going to talk about today now the answer
is firebase app indexing now with app
indexing can get your app and its
content into Google search that means
you can acquire new users you can
experience organic growth and you can
keep those users engaged now one of the
changes that we've announced this week
is that app indexing is no part of
firebase firebase is a suite of
integrated products designed to help you
develop your app grow user base and earn
money epideictic is one of 15 api's that
helps you the developers build amazing
apps we in the grow pillar and that
means that it can lead to more active
users together with your app content and
Google search
we can delight all of those users to
come to Google for with various
information needs now who here today is
familiar with app indexing awesome it's
a good number so for those of you who
are familiar with it you'll find that
farming is a couple of interesting
changes to announce know for those of
you who are not familiar with it don't
worry about it with firebase you have
all the tools you need to get started at
your fingertips
now next let's talk about some of the
products that we've pulled to help you
grow your app and keep your users
engaged now let's start with growth and
installs through google search now here
you can see on the search results page
we can help you get your app discovered
for very you know specific search intent
such as IO 2016 we can show you results
from apps such as you can install that
app for example here all I have to do if
I wanted to install that app step on the
green button it goes to the place so can
download and install the app if I have
more you know generic information is
such as you know google apps or racing
games we show multiple apps to choose
from now through app indexing we can
also help rank these types of results
better now having to install an app that
creates a lot of you know friction
between users and their needs as well as
you know your app content now yesterday
Ellie announced something really
exciting at the keynote which is instant
apps it's an amazing new experience that
keeps you know user coming to you at
faster now instead of having to download
an app first I can simply tap on that
result and they go right into the app
work and find all the information that
they need now this will ultimately
reduce this barrier that stands between
the user and your app content next let's
talk a little bit about engagement is
how Google search can help you with that
once in a person stalls we can
organically open results from search
results page in your app here for
example a search for i/o schedule can
see there's a result from the app all I
have to do now is tap on it and it goes
right
to the app or find all the information
that I need
through app indexing again you can we
can help you rank those results better
on the search results page with the
google app we've put the power of Google
search at our users fingertips for
example here with the search box on many
Android phones on the home screen all
they have to do is tap on the search box
type in the query and they're good to go
earlier today I looked up various
sessions in the i/o app now mine my own
session included now if I want to get
back to that session all I have to do is
type in rules which is the title of the
talk and I see a results appear here
while I type in the Google app now when
I tap on this it goes right back into
the app we can find all the information
such as the stage in session et cetera
now the Google app helps reengage users
with your app content like this for
thousands of apps and it's really really
easy for users just get right back in
because all they have to tap on the
search box and tell us what they're
looking for now besides the search
results page and the google app Google
brings your app content to our users
fingertips in the form of now and tap
anywhere on Android here Fabian told me
about a new movie Captain America that
either we should check out now all I
have to do is tap and press the home
button and I get more information
through Google now on tap here I get the
card for Captain America you can see
that there's a couple of app results as
well now these episodes are there
because these apps use our using app
indexing now if a tap on the IMDB
resolved it goes right into the app I
find all the information that I need now
that's really an amazing feature because
it puts your app content in front of the
users anywhere where they are on Android
now let's talk about metrics a little
bit more than 10,000 apps are using app
indexing to grow there and keep their
users engaged but it includes most of
the top apps that users use every single
day
all over the world that translates to
more than 200 billion app URLs in our
search index which is truly an amazing
number let's look at some of the success
stories of partners that are actually
using app indexing the Guardian saw an
increase in CTR but almost 5% for apples
over web or mobile web URLs Etsy saw an
increase in daily app traffic where
almost 12% and Aliexpress saw an
increased transaction value by 200% now
those are some truly amazing numbers
that tell you the home port nap indexing
is for these partners that any app
really should use this technology to
grow their user base and keep their
users engaged now with that I'm handing
it over to far beyond so you can tell
all you need to know how to get started
Thank You Timo so let's talk about what
you need to do and how you can get
started enabling all of these great
features that we just saw working for
your app and as Timo outlined the key is
really to get your app into the Google
search index because once it's in there
we can then surface results for your app
in all these great places like Google
search now on tap the autocomplete
feature and we can bring users right
into the relevant screen in your app
over the last year it's actually gotten
quite a bit easier to index apps so that
that's something we're really excited
about and you'll see that in a moment
when I step through there's three basic
rules that you want to follow if you
want to get this engagement and growth
for your app first your app needs to
support URLs so that you can actually
link right into the right place second
you need to call our API so that we can
actually better understand the
content in your app and three you wanna
make sure you can keep an eye on you
know the impact you're getting from
following the first two rules right
how many more active users you're
getting and if there's still room for
improvement optimization in your app to
get even more out of it we'll step
through these one by one
in a second starting with supporting
URLs let's do a quick show of hands who
here has an app or has worked on an app
that supports URLs how great about half
and how many of you have worked on app
indexing specifically so getting your
app into the index all right cool
excellent
so let's talk about URLs first URLs were
invented for the web right and so web
sites support URLs naturally you have
different web pages each one comes with
their own URL and that's what you see in
the address bar at the top of your
browser as you navigate the web but for
apps it's a little less natural to
support URLs and we really have to think
about it and write specific codes to
actually handle the URLs in our apps and
make sure the right screen comes up when
your app is started with a URL but it
it's really very important to do that
right because when we want to find
relevant content for our users we don't
want to send them to your app just
launch the app but we actually want to
take them straight to the right place
right so this is really one of the one
of the building blocks of app indexing
next you know there's a question of if
you have a URL like the one that's on
screen here how do you actually know
that there's an app that can handle this
type of URL how do you know this might
potentially link into an app and how do
you find out what that app might be so
we somehow need to link up the website
with the app or with the set of apps
that can also show that content and it
turns out in the web world we actually
have a very similar challenge where a
web browser needs to find out what
Webster
it should go talk to to actually get the
webpage you want to look at right so
when you type a URL into a browser the
browser uses something called the domain
name system or DNS to resolve the domain
name into an IP address which basically
tells it what server to talk to and so
that's worked really well for the web
and over the last year we've actually
seen a very similar system being
established for resolving a domain name
into a mobile app and actually it's it's
two systems one for Android and one for
iOS but they work very similarly in fact
almost almost identically and I'll step
through how exactly it works in just a
moment what they do these systems is
they allow you to create this connection
linking from your website to the app and
basically declaring hey this is the app
or this is the set of apps that can
handle my URLs and then also the other
way around have the app declare you know
what are the kinds of URLs I can handle
and then with this two-way connection
that's really then what helps us
understand that space so let's look at
how this specifically works on Android
and then I'll go into iOS second and
I'll just continue to use the i/o app as
an example as I step through because
many of you might already have that
installed in your phone today and so you
can actually check out some of these
things right after the session yourself
and then also we'll be publishing the
source code for the i/o app light year
after the conference so you can go see
the implementation behind of this behind
all of this
so every Android app has something
called the Android manifest and here's
an example of the i/o apps manifest more
specifically of the intent filter
section and that's where it declares
that it can handle any URL in the domain
events that Google become that starts
with the path IO 2016 / schedule /
anything and then there's this little
attribute that you can see auto verify
equals true that's a very new attribute
from API level 23 that tells us that we
have this two-way connection
meaning that the system can go talk to
the website and the website will verify
and confirm that in fact this is the app
that it wants its URLs to link into and
also if you add this attribute what
you'll actually get starting from
Android 6.0 marshmallow is that your app
will be set as the default handle for
these types of URLs right when it's
installed so that means that even the
very first time a user taps on one of
your URLs anywhere on their phone be
that a messaging app or or the web or
anywhere they'll be taken straight to
your app and they want to get this
disambiguation dialog that you might
know that will ask you you know if you
want to open this in the in a browser or
or in this app so that's another great
benefit you get there but for any of
this to work the server side has to also
check out right the other connection the
other side of the connection so how this
works is you host a small JSON file at
the predefined path on your website that
refers back to the app by package name
and certificate fingerprint and that
part is really important right for
Google for example to understand that
it's okay to link results from search
for these types of URLs directly into
this app because that's something we
really don't want to do unless we know
you know the website owner actually
wants these this traffic to go into this
particular app right instead of the
website on the iOS side we have
something called entitlements as part of
the app itself and again that's where
you would refer to the domain for which
the app can handle URLs and on the
server side again a small JSON file
different one but you know similar in
spirit where you point back to the iOS
app by iTunes ID again a fixed
predefined path on your website where
this goes and you know an interesting
difference here actually between the iOS
and the Android system with iOS
the path prefix that kind of defines
what exact set of URLs the app can
actually handle is defined with the
server-side configuration file on iOS
while with Android this is part of the
app itself in the intent filter so now
you've got this two-way connection set
up and of course you still have to write
the code to actually you know bring up
the right screen and so forth in your
app and I'm not gonna go into details
about that here but at least now we have
a clearer system for you know finding
the right app to link in to just given a
URL but until recently actually many of
us have still been using custom URLs and
let me give you an example of what I
mean by custom URLs I mean URLs that use
a custom scheme so not HTTP this is an
example of how this might look like for
the i/o app and for a particular session
so these links are broken in several
ways so I wanted to take a moment to try
to discourage you from using these as
much as possible if you can at all help
it
one of the issues here is that we do not
have this system here right where we can
somehow reliably resolve any part of
this to an app so it's really not
exactly clear what app this should
actually link into and then also it
really doesn't work across platforms so
if you want to share this URL with a
friend to send them a message or post it
on social media you you can't really
write because if your friend opens this
on a mobile computer or a desktop
computer rather then that's not gonna do
anything on a desktop computer and so in
these cases you still have to then send
the web URL which works anywhere because
it opens the web page but then if your
friend does receive it on a mobile
device then now that's not gonna go into
the app right even if they have the app
installed because now you would first
have to translate back from the web URL
to the custom URL and now you'd have to
have like some sort of big mapping table
or translation rule so long story short
by using web URLs HTTP URLs you can
actually sidestep a lot of these
headaches and so that's what I would
recommend but let's say your app does
support HTTP URLs
so now you're ready to test and if you
want to just test your rap in isolation
let's say you maybe you haven't gotten
the server-side file deployed yet for
enter it you can just launch your app
from the Android debug bridge with a
view intent and and passing the URL even
a test out and that should launch your
app and get you straight to the right
screen if you know if you've done
everything right and then once you've
got the connection in both ways
established if you have the little JSON
file for for Android or or iOS or both
deployed on the website then the easiest
way to test is probably to just send
yourself a bunch of URLs in an email or
something and just tap on them on your
device and then that should go straight
into into the right screen and so that's
all the basics you know that is required
for your results to start showing up on
google it might still take a day or two
for us to actually pick it up and to
start showing these results to users so
in the mean time what you can do you can
check out our brand new preview tool you
can find this as part of our
documentation which is launched to the
earlier this week you can enter any of
your URLs and will instantly show you a
preview of how your results are going to
look like on mobile for your users so
that's kind of cool so with that let's
go on to the next slide and talk about
the second rule calling the API as a
user uses your app and browses the
content in your app you can call the API
with the URL and the title of the
current screen and that helps us better
understand how your app works and what
content is important to users and that
can actually also be an interesting
signal for us to help rank these results
on Google search another place where
this is really important is the
autocomplete feature that teemo showed
you earlier here we have very limited
real estate on the screen we can fit a
max of maybe five or six
results tops so we want to make sure to
really show only the most relevant
results and so in this case here just
knowing that I've looked at my own
session before in the i/o app that's a
very strong signal for us that there's
you know Ally high likelihood I might
want to get back there right and that
that's important content for me and so
that's what we would join autocomplete
if I just type a few characters and with
one tap I'll be right back in the app
and in terms of the code that we asked
you to add for this it should be fairly
minimal it can basically be the cell
down to three lines per activity or per
type of screen that you have the first
one is constructing the URL for the
current session again this is the
example from the i/o app second putting
together the action object with the
title and the URL that describes what is
happening and you see that we use the
view action here we also support other
action types such as listen or purchase
or bookmark depending on what it is the
user does but viewing will be one of the
more common ones and then third you call
the start method to indicate that the
action is now starting and there's a
corresponding end method as well that
would be called by the i/o app as you
navigate away from the session details
screen again and if you have
instantaneous actions in your app like
you know bookmarking something or
purchasing something then you can just
call the end method
straightaway and and be done with it and
to make it you know as simple as
possible to do this we've added support
to Android studio one of the things
Andrew Sileo will do it'll tell you if
there's any issues with both you know
your implementation of URL support in
general or your implementation of
calling the API and it'll also help you
generate most of the code that you need
to write to call the API and it can also
help you generate most if off dr2 intent
filters and then you can also test right
from within Android studio
we have a feature where we can
essentially simulate you know linking
into your app with a given URL and
Android studio will show you what
parameters were passed to the API in
this instance and then also show you a
little preview of that page in Europe on
the iOS site the API is even simpler and
a little bit more limited currently
which is asked that you add a single
call when the app starts up to to
register the app on the device and so
now you already essentially know
everything there is to get your app into
the index and now you really want to
make sure it actually worked right and
you're actually getting more active
users and you want to see if there's any
issues or maybe what you can optimize
and tweak to get even more out of this
so one thing you definitely want to do
is track refer traffic meaning you know
keep track of how many users find their
way into your app through Google and a
way to make this simpler or like to make
this simpler for you we've added this
method get referred directly on the
Android activity object a little over a
year ago with API level 22 and you can
think of it similar to the HTTP referer
header right it tells you where a user
is coming from in terms of a URL so in
our example here if a user is coming
from Google calm in a web browser then
the refer will be google.com and if the
user is coming in through the Google app
which could be any of you know Auto
completions or now on tap all of these
things then the URL would be the second
URLs and you see on screen here the
Android - app URL notation is just a way
that we use to put both like a package
name and the URL inside the app into one
URL so we can kind of package it all
into one one string so if your traffic
is coming from any of these - refers you
know the user came in
Google and you can lock it accordingly
in your analytic solution if you don't
have an analytic solution yet by the way
you might have heard about this new
offering also under the firebase
umbrella that we launched yesterday
firebase analytics which offers
unlimited reporting for free for your
app so that might be a strong candidate
to consider here and then from our side
we also offer some analytics we have a
tool called the search console that you
can log into and you can verify that you
own a given app and then we'll show you
metrics on you know how many results are
we showing for your app how many clicks
are these results getting and also how
many installs are happening as a result
of people discovering your app on Google
search and that's basically it so make
sure to support your else and many of
you already do second call the app
indexing API so we can better understand
the content and we can better rank your
results and if you already support URLs
in your apps then this is really the
only the only rule you have to follow in
addition basically and then three make
sure to log into the search console to
see if you have any issues and to see
the benefits that you're getting and you
know what you might potentially be able
to optimize further you can find all of
this and more at cheetahs CEO slash app
indexing but before you do that I'm
gonna give it back to Timo for the
exciting last part thank you so much for
being I hope everybody knows a little
more now what it takes to get your app
and its content do Google search now
we'd like to talk about something very
special that's going to come later this
year that revolves around personal
content now so far we've talked about
how to get your public app content to
Google search so you can grow your user
base and keep your users engaged but
everyday users all over the world
interact with or creates a lot of
personal information whether that's
messages that you send or receive
documents to create no playlist that you
listen to or photos that you take now
all that all of that data is really
important for many many different user
needs as our users have every single day
for example wouldn't be amazing if we
could just find that message from a best
friend that talked about this awesome in
a sushi place to check out this weekend
just by typing a few characters will be
great to find a shopping list
when I'm at the grocery store we also
miss I could just you know having a few
characters and get back to that playlist
before my Sunday morning run know your
app content can help with many of these
different user needs and that's why we
excited to announce today that later
this year we're going to let you index
personal content on Android we're going
to extend app indexing to let users find
anything in their apps through the
Google app now when we design this
addition to app indexing we sort of
follow three core principles which are
privacy control and simplicity
first of all personal app content stays
on the device and doesn't leave the
phone it means that we will search over
that data on the phone next you as the
developer will be in control over the
lifecycle of that data you determine
when Condor gets indexed updated or
removed and finally if we go to the
three advanced ones well there you go
we had simplicity in mind when we bought
this Fabien already explained how easy
it is right now to get that content into
Google search just a few lines of code
and want to keep it as simple as that
all it'll take just a few lines of code
and your personal content will be
indexed on the phone now let's look at
some of the cool experiences that we
could actually enable with that addition
we've worked with some very special
partners in an early access program to
demo some really cool use cases that
this edition will be able to unlock for
that you need a little bit of help from
five in here hope you can see the screen
all right I don't know whether okay fair
enough so my friend Henry sent me a
message
before telling me about a great a great
session so check out on Friday
totally forgot the title for it so let's
see whether we can get back to that all
we have to do is tap on the search box
here tap on the search box and all we
have to do is type the name okay it's
too bright I don't know whether we can
adjust so what I want to do is find a
message for my friend Henry was talking
about this session to check out so all
we have to do is have insiders
demonstrators type the name in the
search box and normally you see
completions for that and instead what we
will show is a contact card for that
contact as well as a message from that
app in this case Henry sent a message
through viber and all we would have to
do is tap on the result and it goes
right into the app where it can then
read the message in that conversation
and now that seems to be better yes okay
how about this we just go for it and
then you just have to imagine that you
see the right things just do it like
this a little purple that's good okay
anyway Henry's telling me to check out
Google's vision for machine learning
which is tomorrow morning at 9 a.m.
sounds like a great talk that should
totally check out now okay this is gonna
be now really tricky but right we need
to go down a little bit to see what else
we got that there you see vision all
right going into the next one if we go
back to the home screen now by the way
who went to the concert last night
awesome was amazing wasn't it now we
happen to go as well and Fabien sent me
a message actually with a video that he
took now all we have to do is search for
Fabien then we see there's a messaging
Glide X and so all we have to do is tap
on it and let's see whether we can play
that back
looks like a lot of fun awesome now
going back to the previous message
tomorrow morning 9:00 a.m. I remember
had breakfast planned with with Adam so
again let's try to find the message
because I've totally forget the time can
we tap on it search for item and there
it is that's a message in LinkedIn all
we have to do is tap on it we jump right
into it and there we go
8:00 a.m. on Friday thank you now 8:00
a.m. I guess have to get up a little
earlier tomorrow fair enough
I love eating yogurt for breakfast
the other day I started reading an
article was called how yogurt affects
the brain that I never finished reading
but I did save that one in pockets so
now if I want to go back to it all I
have to do is type in part of the title
and we can tap on it it goes right into
the app where I can then go ahead and
read it on my way home tonight Thank You
favi I'm sorry for the technical
difficulties now these examples really
show the power of that data and user
needs so through the Google app we can
let users find anything that they're
looking for in the app several roles
around the person life with the personal
data all through the Google app by
tapping on the search box typing in a
few characters and they see your app
content right there and all of this will
be powered through app indexing
later this year now here are the
partners that we've worked with in this
early access program they've done an
amazing job in enabling these
experiences and we're looking forward to
working with more of you later this year
now if you're interested in this have a
look at this link here and share your
interest with us later this year we will
follow up with more information around
availability of this extension of app
indexing now quick summary we showed
that with app indexing you can get more
