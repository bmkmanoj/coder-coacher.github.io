name and firebase authentication and
firebase you can now use phone number
auth where a verified phone is enough to
signing user into your app in this video
I'll show you exactly how you can do
that on iOS you'll use the firebase UI
off libraries that you can find at this
URL this open source library does all
the heavy lifting for you so that you
can focus on building your app and not
all the many different user flows that
you might need to take into account when
implementing authentication before
coding the first thing you'll need to do
is have a firebase project in the
firebase console if you don't have one
already you can create one at this URL
once you've done that you need to go
into the authentication section and
click on the sign-in methods tab there
you'll see a list of the various sign-in
methods and on this list is phone flip
the enable switch to on and then click
Save your app can now handle firebase
phone authentication now there are a
number of things that you need to do to
get firebase working on an iOS
application including downloading the
Google service info.plist file updating
URL types and configuring push
notifications you can find details on
how to do all of that on this page
because firebase off--you why does all
this heavy lifting for you it makes it
really easy to use so first of all
you'll create an instance of an F I are
off for firebase off and an f UI off for
firebase UI off next you'll need to
configure the providers that you're
accepting for sign-in providers are
things like Google sign-in Facebook and
of course phone off this is used to
create an f UI phone off object which
can then be called to setup the off flow
these of course should match the ones
that you set up in the firebase console
earlier earlier you so we set up phone
off now we're using phone off in the
client this can be seen here the flow
triggers the facility to enter a phone
number and when the user touches verify
firebase will send a text message
containing the verification code when
this verification code
correctly the sign-in will be successful
when the sign-in completes the delegate
will receive that did sign in with user
function which gives you an F IR user
that you can then use to derive
information about the user or an error
that you can use to present details to
them about why the sign-in failed and
now if you look at your firebase console
you'll see that the user is there and
has a firebase ID so they're a full
firebase user able to access data based
on your security rules and that's it as
you can see it's really easy to
implement phone authentication on iOS
using the firebase UI libraries you can
learn more about it and download the
sample app that I showed in this
presentation at this link you can also
learn more about what you can do with
firebase at firebase Google comm and
subscribe to our YouTube channel for
more fire casts conference talks and a
whole lot more I'll see you on there
