know Michael tell me when the release is
don't just tell me the release date I
don't know
this interview is over
oh hey everybody welcome to meet
firebase the show where you get to meet
the Googlers that make firebase happen
my name is Doug Stephenson and on the
show with me today is Michael Bly
Michael hey thanks for joining me on the
show happy to be here and for those of
you at home you may have noticed we have
a completely different set here we are
in the basement studio here at firebase
I believe this is the fire basement am I
am I saying that right okay this is the
fire basement so welcome to the fire
basement how are things going for you
today Michael good this is my first time
to the fire basement I guess yours this
is my first time for the fire basement
as well what do you do with the firebase
team I am the tech lead a manager for
the firebase hosting team as well as the
firebase CLI I've also here and they're
contributed to cloud functions for
firebase okay now I there's one
particular thing about you that I've
been told is that you love escape rooms
oh that's true about that I've only done
one escape room in my life I think I've
probably done like 20 of them funny yeah
there were 20 I think it started on my
birthday one year like they were still
pretty new I lived in LA at the time so
just tried one out and I just really
liked the sort of puzzle solving and
it's sort of video game logic in real
life and so kind of got hooked on it and
go to them whatever I come across them
what do you mean by video game logic I
mean you know so in video games you're
like oh you have to find the you know
Lion crest that goes to the lion door
and then that leads you somewhere so
it's just applying like these puzzles
and logic and things that all fit
together you know but it's all arbitrary
okay okay but you're doing it like in
real life with yeah okay that's pretty
interesting so on the topic of video
games it seems like a lot of people at
Google who joined the show here love
video games I'm included I'm known as
kind of a retro gamer but I'm curious to
know what kind of video games do you
enjoy so lately I've been playing a lot
of overwatch but I also really love
rhythm games so like way back to parappa
the rapper on the playstation or
and or dance dance revelution just any
of those yeah Parappa kind of helped to
find the genre yeah I still have this
song stuck in my head yeah they do stick
yeah and I'm a big fan of rock band so I
played the heck out of rock band in fact
on one of the other shows I brought in
my plastic guitar and played it and then
Matt gaunt played the actual guitar
which is far more impressive getting a
plastic guitar I used to play it in
Boston all the time I'd take it to bars
and have like rock band night instead of
karaoke nights so I'm curious you played
prep rock band and were there any other
rhythm games lots of them so like I when
I was a freshman in college I played
dance dance revelution at the arcade
everyday I played I don't know DJ Hero
guitar hero there's a game called Rhythm
Heaven for the Wii I don't know just I
anything I can get my hands on so there
were a couple oddball ones I had a
Dreamcast
I love the Dreamcast there was one game
in particular space channel 5 oh yeah
all those songs are stuck maybe I buy
the soundtrack too that I beat the game
in like 40 minutes it wasn't hard but it
was incredibly fun yes I also listen to
space channel 5 soundtrack when I'm
coding - oh yeah yeah it's just somehow
it just keeps me keeps me grooving it's
a really unique stuff all right we'll
take a break here thanks for joining us
for this half and I'd love for you to
join me here tomorrow on the firebase
channel on youtube to pick up the rest
see you here next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
