episode I want to talk with you about a
very important thing your identity but
much more importantly your users
identity we offer a suite of products
that help you get your users securely
signed in to your site and apps and once
they're in if you want you can then more
deeply integrate with Google products
like YouTube Drive or contacts but as a
developer it's sometimes confusing when
you're faced with so many different
options for building sign into your app
so in this forecast I'm here to help
first up is firebase off now if you're
building something new whether you're
using the firebase database or not
firebase off to me is the natural choice
it provides a complete authentication
system for your website or your mobile
apps and that's Android or iOS and it
includes all back-end services it also
offers the open source firebase UI so
you can quickly implement off best
practices into your app in a way that's
easily customizable to fit with the rest
of your apps visual styles and did I
mention that as well as Google sign-in
it also supports multiple identity
providers such as Facebook and Twitter
now you might have an existing auth
system in an existing app and you aren't
yet ready to make the full leap to
firebase well that's okay the one thing
you can do to make it work better is by
using smart lock for passwords without
doing any migration away from what
you're presently doing smart lock for
passwords will help people to sign up
with a single tap they can remember how
they've signed in and it will help keep
them signed in automatically across all
of their devices and this is done with
client-side code you don't need to mess
with your servers another option is if
you don't already have off on your app
or site and you aren't yet ready to make
the leap to firebase well don't worry
you can still build a seamless
experience for your users with Google
sign-in this lets them sign-in to your
app or site with their Google
credentials and they also become
authenticated across all of their
devices and of course it will integrate
with other Google services such as your
calendar it will even allow over-the-air
installation of Android apps when users
sign into you
site that's pretty neat right and that's
it for this forecast hopefully I helped
shed a little light on the options that
are available for you as always if you
have any questions please leave them in
