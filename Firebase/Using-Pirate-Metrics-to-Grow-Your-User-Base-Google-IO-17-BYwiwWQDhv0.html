you're having a great time here I'm Kyra
Lewis and I'm Laurence Moroney and we're
here today to talk to you about pilot
metrics and how to provide a framework
that helps you launch your app through
your audience and sustain it in the long
run
so both Lawrence and I wanted to start
up at Google and after a lot of
extensive market research we decided to
do something that nobody at Google has
ever done before so we built a chat app
I told you that laughs it's called
really friendly chat and if you've done
any of the firebase code lab you've
probably heard a friendly chat you've
probably built friendly chat if you
haven't done so check it out it's a
great way of learning firebases
touches on a lot of the technologies in
firebase but we decided like you know
friendly chat we wanted to do a little
bit more all right so the journey
finding shots we added translation so
you can chat with people even if they
don't speak the language so Lawrence
could you show us a quick demo sure can
we switch the demo box okay so here I am
using really friendly chat and so I'm
using an iPad emulator and I'm chatting
with my friend I echo who has
exceptional taste and she's using an
Android device and what happens is I'm
chatting in English and as you can see
what I'm saying in English she's seeing
in Japanese so by you know having this
conversation she says nice to meet you
and then I realized you know I might be
a impinge on her time so I'll ask hey
what time is it over there
and so Alaska and I'll send it to her
and I've typed it in English and then
she will instantly see it appearing on
her android screen in Japanese and then
I don't read a word of Japanese if
there's any Japanese readers here you
can hold me accountable for this so
apparently it's translated and she sees
that
so then she'll send something back to me
whoops she'll send something back to me
like this and then she says oh it's
dinner time I go oh okay I'll better
leave you alone then and I'll get back
to my demo right I'll get back to
talking at i/o but this is really
friendly chat we wanted to make
something so that we let's let's still
the startup together
Barolo 9 in this startup with
we have this application and we want to
grow this application so let's change
back for the slide please
so parole is going to be our growth
hacker and she's going to teach us how
we're going to grow this application so
let me mention the dirty fendi chart we
wanted to launch it in a systematic
manner so we turn to pirate metrics but
before we understand pirate metrics
let's first go to a very typical user
lifecycle users are required in a lot of
different ways to public relations
through social media to add they all
play a role but once you acquire a user
your job is dirty half done you might
have just gotten them to the landing
page of your website but what you really
need to do is to make them experience
the unique selling proposition of your
product for a social media product this
would be to follow friends interest for
your game it could be to complete one
level you need to ensure that the user
realizes and experiences that one unique
thing about your products so of course
now once you've gotten your a user and
you've activated your user you'd
generally face an uphill battle to
retain these users how many times have
you built an application and you put it
out there maybe you've done a marketing
campaign you've gotten a ton of installs
but then after week one a week two your
insults go down how are you going to
hold on to these users how are you going
to make sure that they keep using your
applications after the few first few
days so the goal for any healthy product
is to keep your users coming back if
you're churning all of these users and
all that money you've spent on acquiring
them it kind of gotten wasted so one way
of doing this is friends help friends
discover great apps and friends help
friends discover great content so your
your your users can be your greatest
than your strongest advocate no
acquisition strategy is as powerful as
one where your users are telling their
friends and their family and people
around them that your app is awesome but
in order to be able to get your people
to do this we really need to reduce the
friction so we're going to talk about
some of the technologies in firebase
that will help reduce this friction and
stop the users from being able to share
with their friends and ultimately we all
want to monetize our users each of your
users is the amount a different amount
of
and you want to identify who's worth
more than the other and then tailor your
sordid experience to serve this audience
better so let's summarize the user
lifecycle we have the following five
stages acquisition activations retention
referral and revenue so if we put all of
these together this is called pirate
metrics and this is the strategy our
imaginary startup is going to use to
launch this application and speaking of
launching things anybody want to see
shirt how about this side oh right in at
hands ever that hopefully our launch of
our application will be successful well
pirate metrics is all about acquisition
activation retention revenue referral
and revenue and it's called pirate
metrics because if you put the first
letters of all of these together you get
the first as we mentioned is acquisition
and here we want to understand how to
acquire users so we came up with three
strategies we bought a space and web
searches and optimized our sensor we
also built a great website that people
can use to discover our application and
we also decided to walk through partners
to spread awareness about our
application let's see how we dive into
each of them
the fourth is advertising campaign so
let's say as a user you're searching
traveling to Japan you'll probably see
an advertisement this will take them to
the landing page and will tell them more
about our application now because you've
ended up at the in our website through
an ad about Japan you might get a tailor
experience with some images about Japan
some traveling recommendations and the
site can contain a dynamic link that has
contact to connect them to the pen pal
in Japan now if we use your has the
application it will launch it directly
if they don't it will take them to the
Play Store page of the web Facebook page
where you can go and install the
applications and then end up right
inside the app where you can chat with
someone directly in chat more
as per all mentioned this is built on
dynamic link and anybody here use
dynamic links for firebase ok feels cool
so dynamic links what makes them really
special is the fact that they maintain
contact through an installed session
it's not just the link to the landing
page of your app in the Play Store so if
you have a link for example in our case
what really friendly chat what we wanted
to do is if somebody visited the landing
page for having pen pals in Japan that
then there would be a context to link
them to a pen pal in Japan so once they
click on it and they launch the app
instead of fishing for people in Japan
or finding people to be a pen pal where
they get linked to one directly and in
addition to this sort of dynamic links
work and in addition to this because
this is pirate metrics we want to start
thinking in terms of analytics we're
just launching our app for the first
time we don't know how successful it's
going to be we don't know how successful
dynamic links or any of our strategies
are going to be and because we've used
firebase for this then we can say hah
now we have all of these analytics that
we can put it into into it we can see
what strategies work and we can see what
strategies don't and then we can refine
it accordingly so here's an example of
like we're on our landing page in our
site and we said here's another example
of where we can do context of a dynamic
link in this case instead of linking to
a pen file even though that's what the
screenshot shows we could have like a
Contact Us link in the app that would
link somebody into a chatroom with our
support staff or people who can answer
questions about the application itself
and then that becomes a strategy for how
we can grow the app by getting people to
use our app to speak with us you can
also tie your firebase analytics account
with AdWords accounts to make your
acquisition strategy smarter say for
example you're trying to get users who
charge in Spanish now from your five is
AdWords account you can import the event
where users sent a message in Spanish
and track its performance in your
analyst in your AdWords analytics
account to measure whether you're
getting the right kind of users or not
you can also create custom audience and
show ads to them this could be an
amazing way to retarget users say for
example some users try to access your
app and chat in a different language
that is not supported earlier now you
can build an audience and once you start
supporting this language
you can target notifications to them and
bring them back for your application so
we have done all the work that will help
people find our app and get and get them
to install it but to make an impact and
ensure they stay engaged with our
absolutely friendly chat we want to have
a great activation strategy first of all
something like your appendage art has a
user base experience a user needs to
sign into the app login with your
account and then end up directly where
they can charge with a pen pal now to
make this experience seamless we have
firebase authentication Lawrence could
you share more info about it sure
definitely so the idea behind firebase
authentication is to make it as easy as
possible to sign up your app and sign
into your app but before I do that shall
we sign into a t-shirt okay I see some
hands in the middle let's try a higher
pressure shot whoo oh nice catch
one-handed
I hear the 49ers are looking for
receivers you should give them a call so
I'm a Seahawks fan sorry anyway so all
sent occation firebase authentication is
one of the biggest things that we see
user drop-off in apps is if they have a
very user hostile signup experience the
doctor roll parole and I are strangers
to you and if you're going to a play
store and you're installing our app and
then suddenly we're asking you for your
name your address for a reset email for
phone number all of this kind of stuff
that's something that could turn you off
very easily so firebase authentication
has been designed with that in mind so
it allows federated identity from
different providers such as Facebook
github Twitter and of course Google and
as you saw in the overview and in the
keynote yesterday then we've added phone
off to that as well so that instead of
even giving details such as like your
email address you'll be able to sign in
with your phone number and another
really neat thing that's in there that
we find that will allow you to have a
friction free signup experience it's
anonymous authentication so anonymous
authentication allows you to effectively
sign in and go through the security
rules in firebase with an app but
without providing a username and
password so we thought this is a really
nice thing if we're activating our users
that once they start our application
that they have an initial experience
that
turn them off and hopefully is one that
delights them another one that we said
hey look a great way of activating users
is initial delight and as we saw when I
was demoing it earlier on that we said
we want to have a fast fluid seamless
experience in something like this we
were doing translation and it's a great
strategy again it's like if the users
context of what you're bringing them to
do you activate that instantly you bring
them for that as quickly as possible it
was a one tap sign in and then suddenly
I was connected with a pen pal in this
case my imaginary friend I echo and so
it's connected a trivia question by the
way I'll give a free t-shirt so whoever
sees me first in the fan box and tells
me where she's come from she's not
entirely an imaginary friend
everybody's gonna Google it now just
like so anyway so the idea is like if I
sign into the application and I have an
initial experience that delights me
that's giving me exactly what I want to
do and that's which is fast and fluid
they're not fishing for context they're
not looking for pen pals and they're in
the application and they're using it
right away doing something interesting
now part of this comes from remote
config now I've spoken with a number of
developers over time and I chatted with
one developer that built a customized
onboarding experience with remote config
that I thought was really interesting
because they built a cookbook
application and if you were at the
firebase grow session earlier on you
would have seen it and by providing it
on customizing on board for people who
are interested in cooking so for example
if I want to cook Chinese food that have
Chinese screens if I was cooked Indian
food that has Indian screens initially
as soon as I sign in they were actually
almost able to double their growth
overnight by using remote config to give
that customized onboarding experience
and firebase ought to reduce friction
and signing in so we thought hey should
we do this ourselves right and if we
want to sign in we want to give them for
example if they're chatting with
somebody in Japanese we want to give
them this really really pleasant
welcoming screen so now let's just speak
up or not see if we can learn from
existing users when Laura's launched the
app he saw this really nice shade of the
Korea pegs yeah that's not really my
thing though when you were getting Japan
thanks cherry blossom I feel it's really
nice yes don't know my name sorry
okay so now let's see what we can do
about it
remote conflict is driven of analytics
so we could for example face that will
give this really nice shade of Sakura
pink to all the Japanese people who sign
into our app and for all boring guys
like Lauren we have the same standard
plain UI that's much much better I think
so once we've gone beyond the background
color then part of the next experience
in using the app to be delighted was to
have a responsive fast fluid app so for
that we use the firebase real-time
database and one of the neat things
about the real-time database is it works
cross-platform you've probably seen and
heard a lot of it but it's this
event-driven database instead of like a
query style database allows you to have
these instant responsive updates in your
app and makes it really nice and it
works really well in the circumstances
of flaky networks so for example with
something I could chat out that's really
important now think about I'm chatting
with my new best friend in Japan and she
travels through a tunnel and she loses
connectivities and what's gonna die
nothing Tokyo already very connected
okay so I'm trying to get my new best
friend in Japan and I travel through a
tunnel and I lose connectivity then I
don't to lose the context of my
conversation what's going to happen well
you know if I built this and I was using
the real-time database to store my chat
then I'm going to get with a little bit
of code I'm able to get a rethink what
so once I come out of the tunnel and now
I'm reconnected to the web that I can
actually synchronize up all my chat so
all about all that time that I was
offline is it wasted and I'm not
alienating my new best friend by not
chatting with her should we take a look
at the code of what it takes to build
that here it is so I can't be anything
there that's exactly right
I didn't need to write any code to do
whatsoever without a single line of code
you know as I was using the firebase
real-time database then I was able to
get this offline online reconnection and
I see everybody getting that camera so
I'm going to aim at them so far base
analytics targeting is far better than
mine
acquiring users and delighting them is
great but it's not enough to have them
engage with your application for a long
time with the amount of competition
there is between devices app sites
I already feel that really penny charge
would get lost in the mix that's why we
need a really good retention strategy
offenders mind from winter off one of
the top ecommerce apps in India decided
to use target notification for the
engagements they saw a 200% increase in
conversion rate and a 300% increase in
open race notifications are a great way
when used properly or when used properly
can Joey help you have target the right
kind of users and bring them back to
your application
but let's face it a lot of times we get
this family notification and they Jory
annoy us so we can bill we can have our
notifications be driven off analytics to
target the right kind of audience say
for example are the certain users who've
not used an application in a while and
has made purchases in the past now if
you want to bring this audience back we
can we can create it as a separate
audience of all those users who made
purchases in the past and same target or
know of coupon code so they can use it
to buy it this will really help us
prevent the terrible terrible issue of
notification spam Norns pretty sure the
quick demo of how notifications would
work as fans making me hungry
can we change for the laptop please so I
want to show a very basic example here
so any Android studio users here ok good
a few of you so you know if you use
Android studio the very basic
application you can build is file new
application and it's populated with an
empty activity so that's what I've done
here I haven't written any code in this
whatsoever a new MPI cig activity
application and then on the right hand
side I said I use the firebase assistant
to just click two buttons number one was
to connect my app to firebase and number
two was a - the end to my app I've done
nothing else other than create it and
collect those two buttons and now I run
the app and the app is running here and
you can see it's the boring old
I call a pirate metrics notification and
has hello world in the middle but this
app is now actually activated to receive
real-time notifications and just to
prove this to you I'm going to open the
notification composer and I'm going to
pick the app by the number of copies of
that app in this project so I pick the
pirate metrics notification one and I'll
enter a message but somebody give me the
message that I'm going to enter so you
know it's real what's that I'm sorry I
can't here on this page Yoho mateys
okay that's a great one Yoho Mady are
ask Carol about the parrot we had a
parrot and she lost it so I'm going to
put that in and I'm just embarrassing
our peril sorry about that and I'm going
to click send message and oh I
right-click somewhere I'm going to click
send message and I'm going to click send
on this and if you come over here to the
emulator it should demo God be with me
okay I launched a t-shirt while we're
waiting what should happen if it's
behaving but it's not behaving is that
when devices are connected notifications
are generally received on connected
devices with about 98% and notifications
are received in less than 500
milliseconds I think I'm one of the 2%
right now check out the moment anybody
woo they're going to get mad at me I'll
move on from the demo I'll get that one
working later and I'll show it to so if
we switch back to the slides
that was the coding demo so I want to
talk a little bit about app indexing
next so we've been talking about all of
these strategies that are part of pirate
metrics and we're thinking about the
technologies that we use and try to fit
them into our growth hacking strategy an
app indexing is a really interesting one
anybody here use app indexing out of
interest okay cool good so I think I'm
going to make your day so if you have a
site that contains content and you have
an app that contains the same content
then all you have to do is to connect
your site to your app using asset links
in Android or using Universal links in
iOS and what happens is when the Google
spider crawls the website and it sees
that your app is associated with that
site then people who have installed that
app can then render the content in the
app instead of going to the site now if
you think about this this is logical
because if people have spent the time
and effort to install your app on their
device they've sent a signal that says
I'm interested in this type of content
in this app so for example if you're a
sports fan and you want to see like the
you install like an application for your
favorite sports team if that application
hadn't had built app indexing into it
and all they had to do like I said is
put these links on the site to connect
the food and then on the application
itself build something that receives
incoming link and renders them an
activity or review then what will happen
is users searching the web for scores or
news or details about that team are
getting reengaged with your app
automatically it's a very very simple
investment and at 3:30 we're actually
going to be talking and demoing where
Yahoo Japan built this into their app in
just a couple of weeks and achieving
great growth and greatly engagement
through that and the neat thing like I
said is that hey we all install way too
many apps on our devices and what
happens when we start running out of
space what happens when we move to a new
device those are the apps if you're not
constantly engaged with them if people
aren't going to your app as part of
their daily workflow those are the apps
that get uninstalled to make room those
are the apps that gets forgotten when
you transfer to a new device and we
think app indexing is a really powerful
technology to re-engage your users to do
that make laurence mentioned olio
friends help friends discover great apps
with absolutely nothing as important
that can help your product go wider
at the word-of-mouth campaign for
instance if I saw a recipe of C cookies
and I wanted to share it with Lauren see
you know he could bake me some if you
want me to make you see cookies
different big trouble - but my cooking
is notoriously bad I have ended up in
the hospital with my cooking true story
so but if parole wants me to do that and
she said that there was an app and there
was an app with a recipe for these well
what's the workflow generally going to
be I go to my device for those of the
place or at search for a recipe app and
have you ever done that there are
hundreds of them so we okay parole which
recipe happened to be like the one with
the orange icon or something like that
with yeah and I'd be like okay there's
dozens of those and then it would take
me time to find the app and then I have
to search for the sea biscuit recipe and
there may be more than one I miss that's
a lot of friction so how do we make that
easier I guess you saw you have it a
little easier something there not a lot
of sad applications out there that's
true and even less from Google but you
can still make your users life a lot
easier so we have five is invites to
help you do just that
five is invites is built-in sign up on
top of dynamic links it provides you a
separate picker that does not tell you
which apps you want to use to share your
application but actually gives you a
list of contacts that you can share your
application with and it has context to
put the top the top contacts and the
most relevant contacts right on top of
the list
Laurens pretty sure I do why sure can we
switch to the demo laptop please so I'm
back to my really friendly chat right
now and I'm chatting with my imaginary
friend and she's not going to do a pin
and invites because she doesn't have any
friends so it's just going to be mail do
some app advice an app invites is a
drop-in widget as per all mentioned that
you can use within your app it's an easy
API I'm going to show the iOS code for
it in a second but what it does is it
gives you the typical system dialogue
that you'll see when you want to share
an application and I don't know if you
just noticed that when I launch this
application it was a bit of a
spinning-wheel
before it gave me these top six contacts
because what's going on here is that
there is a lot of work being done by
Google in machine learning and an AI to
try and figure out that when you're in a
context of trying to share an
application instead of just giving you
an A to Z list
it thinks about the context of what's
going on right now and it's picking the
top people on this list from people that
I'm regularly emailing with or maybe
it's the time of week that I'm doing it
or it's applications that I've already
shared with them that they've installed
or we have both have the same types of
applications that kind of thing and as a
result and it's giving me this dialog
and as you can see it's picked six
people that I'm most likely to interact
with and it's really funny because if we
can switch back to the slides
so today's Thursday and parole and I
have rehearsed this talk on the last
three Tuesdays and usually when I show
this there's one contact that showed up
that didn't show up here and I wish he
did because typically on Tuesdays I chat
with this guy because we've practiced on
Wednesdays and on Tuesdays were chatting
about where we're going to go for
breakfast on Wednesday and he shows up
as one of my fast contacts but he didn't
relate because unfortunately it's very
safe
you know but that's just showing that
effect how the the intelligence sorting
is going on because again we're talking
about we want to reduce friction and
having friends share content with
friends and one great way of doing that
is like how many contacts do you have in
your address book Harrell probably 600
okay she's got about 600 contacts in her
address book and my surname begins with
M so if we just did it by basic sorting
I'd should probably have to filter
through 300 people because M is in the
middle of the alphabet before she could
share with me but because parole shares
a lot of apps with me if she was to do
this and I would be at the top of the
list and again friction free make it
easy to share and all that comes
automatically when you're using a
firebase invite so here's the source
code for our beta invites and how I did
it in the really friendly chat that you
see here
I'm as an iOS developer I generally
prefer objective-c I never got intersect
into Taylor Swift sorry about that
so and here's all that I have to do
there's an F I our invites object and I
use that to create an invites dialog and
that's it that first line of code and
that's what gave me the dialogue and
then on the dialogue I set the delegate
for it to be this particular view that
I'm in and what that will do is it'll
give me this callback once the invites
have been sent and this callback is like
invite finished with invitations and in
this callback my code here is a little
bit dumb it's just going to show a
dialog that says I've sent ten
invitations but what we're thinking in
terms of pirate match
Rickson were thinking in terms of growth
hacking now I could do something really
interesting here where for example I
could create a custom analytic and I
could store that custom analytics so if
I've now just shared really friendly
chat with 20 people I could have an
analytic code on it that I've shared it
with 20 people and we could build a
reward mechanism in so that we get that
sustained growth through friends
referring and we give an incentive from
friends referring friends to great
content and great apps so now when it
comes to before we release our app and
when we test our app there's really two
phases okay the first of these is what
do we do before we ship it and the
second of these is what do we do after
we've shipped it how do we maintain and
keep our app up-to-date after we've
shifted and I'd like to put this in the
terms of referrals because bad testing
on your app and bad reviews on your app
are effectively referrals from strangers
how many times have you gone to take a
look at an app on the Play Store and you
look at the reviews and you look at the
one-star reviews and you go
I'm not installing that app that's
effectively a stranger has given you a
bad referral and if it's a five-star
review and it encourages encourages you
to install that app that's a stranger
giving you a good referral and late
Laurence mentioned we have to be able to
handle crashes after we ship the
application as well and that is why we
now have crashlytics as part of firebase
traffic extra bytes actionable insights
down to the line of code which led to
your abs to the crash of your app so
lowering what do you think shall
investigate putting into this app I know
you're a great photo but still I think
you're a pretty good coder so you can do
it in iOS other than Android how about
that so let's see about that actually
one thing I forgot to mention before we
move on to performance monitoring is
that if you want to test your
application and make sure that it works
before you ship there's something called
patch lab for Android and I see a quick
survey here how many here have a pixel
excel one can I borrow it for six months
now anybody want to loan me one for six
months before I can share this now they
always say no but anyway okay so the
idea is like if you're building an
application I don't have a pixel excel I
wish I did and I'm building this app and
I need to know what it looks like on a
pixel excel and fasted before I ship my
application and this gentleman won't
loan
so what do I do even worse what if I
can't buy a pixel XL in my country or
what if I want to shift it to other
current my application to other
countries where the phones that they're
most common in that country I don't have
in my country so that's what tax lab
brand droid is all about and what test
lab for Android does is that Google have
put together a data center with physical
and virtual versions of all the common
devices and particularly all the obscure
devices that you may not be able to get
your hands on and if you build your
application is in apk you upload it to
this data center and then once it's in
this data center it can be tested and
pressure ports and stacked as such
traces of what's going on all that gets
fed back to you there are custom tests
that you can design that a specific gear
app and then there's Robo test from
Google that you know testing the basic
things open/close log in log out all of
that kind of thing
so as a result now I can test it on all
of these devices and I don't need to
borrow that gentleman's pixel excel so
then after we ship this performance
monitoring right yes and you have to
ensure that our app is behaving in an
optimized model after we shove the
application as well for example if it is
eating too much Network or bandwidth
causing it to slow down we can now use
app apps monitoring tools to make sure
that this data is being tracked and
combined with crashlytics in case it's
also leading to crashes we can so we can
optimize the future versions of the
application and make sure that that
these issues are resolved I'm finally
making money firebase makes it a lot
easier for you to track all your revenue
in one place to drop by at a 30 M
tomorrow same fee at this stage so it's
at Stage five or you'll probably also
find out sitting at the back making
notes it's a great session on AdMob and
firebase analytics working better
together Lawrence what do you think will
you be able to show us a demo of
dropping and adding to sure sack and
apparently they're renaming that session
to hangover cure so if you want to go
over there 8:30 in the morning up for
the party it'd be good but let's let's
take a look at what it looks like to
actually add in the code that we have
adding an ad it's a really friendly chat
and if you remember when I was showing
really friendly chat a moment ago you
probably saw the banner ads in there
that's just running on a test machine so
the banner ads were just showing basic
stuff but if you think about when you
want to put ads
to your application the important thing
is that if you're putting ads and you're
taking up some of your users eyeballs
and taking up some of their attention
span with an ad a very important thing
is that the ads are contextually
relevant and with AdMob one of the neat
things is that it's very easy to put an
ad in an app which I'll show in a moment
but the ads are they're going to be
getting are very contextually relevant
so if this was a real app that I was
showing and I'm chatting with my friend
in Japan about Japanese II thing I'd be
probably getting adverts for travel side
hotels in Tokyo new anime shows all of
that kind of stuff and so let's take a
look at the code for that now I've been
showing ILS code all the time so I'm
going to switch back to my favorite
Android and in Android if you know in
your layout file you're just going to
simply add a thing called an ad view
which is come Google Ads GMs ads ad view
so you drop an ad view object onto your
layout file you give it an ad unit ID
which is the second parameter from the
bottom which is just that string flash
banner ad unit ID so when you've signed
up for AdMob and you you know you're
creating your ads and you're creating
your ad campaigns you get these unit IDs
you put that in there if you're a good
Android programmer you have a separate
strings file with that in it and that's
what I'm doing here and referring to
that string and then within my view
itself all I have to do to initialize
the ID of this we're all familiar with
creating a handle to control by using
find view by find view by ID to get it
and now I just create a new ad request
off of an ad request builder and loads
the ad video the ad request into the ad
view and that's it so I grabbed one view
I've dropped one control onto my view
I've written three lines of code and now
I have the power of the Google
advertising and all that the smart
matching that's going on in that
advertising that I can put into my app
and that will hopefully help me monetize
my ass another really powerful elements
is in-app purchases it's tracking of
in-app purchases in firebase analytics
no line of code is required at all for
example if we had a sticker pack in our
app it will automatically be tracked as
an in-app purchase without is doing
anything at all
see so we've designed for our bass I'm
still trying to get that demo to work
we've designed firebase to give you the
suite of technologies for sustained
growth
the thing about growth is all too often
we put an application we build an
application we put it in the Play Store
we put it in the I store and maybe we
hope to get flash started or maybe we
hope to go viral because the celebrity
is using it and very very few can
achieve sustainable successful growth in
that way so the idea with with firebase
and as we've designed it and the
firebase grow technologies is to think
about what are the popular what are the
common frameworks that growth hackers
are using to systematically to
programmatically and to
deterministically grow their
applications now pirate metrics is a
beautiful one of these because it helps
you but think about the five phases of
launching an application and growing it
with the public
so we want to we built firebase in that
way so that you're not buying a lottery
ticket if you're building your
application and you're pushing it into
one of the stores then you can think
about acquisition through the
acquisition technologies you can think
about activation through the activation
technology similar for retention similar
for referral and there's something in
there for revenue and we are really only
getting started with this so as we
continue to grow and evolve the firebase
platform we're continuing to grow and
evolve all of these and don't forget all
of these are bound together by analytics
and analytics is something that we're
also continuing to grow and evolve and
if you're building and you're launching
a new application what you can start
thinking of is launching it using pirate
metrics you have everything before
you've gained a single analytic to give
you a strategy but then once your
applications out there and analytics
start coming in usage patterns start
coming in then you can start refining
your model you can start refining how
you're requiring people you can start
refining how you're activating and
retaining them and all that kind of
stuff so we think there's a beautiful
suite of technologies here most of them
are free to use when they work like my
cloud messaging didn't I'm sorry but all
of this is something that will help you
to get that sustained growth without
buying a lottery ticket or hoping to be
slash started yeah and I must mention we
have been makiura to sign for this for
providing this amazing framework that
will help you launch your app through it
i'm jory sustain it in the longer
so that's it so much guys thanks a lot
