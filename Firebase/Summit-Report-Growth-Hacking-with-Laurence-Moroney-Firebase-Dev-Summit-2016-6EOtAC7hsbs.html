and we're in the ask for a base lounge
where great community lots of great
questions lots of brilliant developers
that I've been meeting and chatting with
and talking about various growth hacking
technologies and you know growth hacking
it's it's it's a really really
interesting concept it goes beyond
marketing and it goes into technology
and its really three main things that
make up growth hacking this
experimentation so that you can really
engage with your users and give them
what they want there's growing your user
base and you can do that directly by
marketing to a potential user base or
indirectly by using your your users can
be advocates to reach other users and
then finally there's engaging and
re-engaging your user base so that like
maybe people have installed your app and
have forgotten about it so in firebase
we got a whole suite of technologies and
one of the things that we've been doing
and picking these technologies and in
designing them was really aligning them
to the needs of a growth hacker so for
experimentation we've got remote config
that allows you to do easy a/b testing
for for growing your user base directly
we've got like AdMob and AdWords that
you can use to directly advertise to
users across all of googles properties
or you can go in directly through things
such as app invites or dynamic links and
then finally for engaging and
re-engaging your users you've got a
brilliant powerful firebase
notifications and firebase cloud
messaging as well as the one of my
personal favorites which is app indexing
that allows you to discover your apps
through google search so we'll be
talking about that today with lots of
really really cool demos so come check
out the session
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
