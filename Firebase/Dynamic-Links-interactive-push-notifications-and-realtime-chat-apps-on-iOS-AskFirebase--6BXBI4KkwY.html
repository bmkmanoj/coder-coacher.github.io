plucker to ever pluck mother pheasants
Simon simply said that the firebase
database is scheme Alice that's my time
twister that's firebase 9 take one
what's up everybody welcome back to
another episode of hash tag ask firebase
and today is a super special episode
because we have my coworker my colleague
my friend here I say my muse ah Todd
Kerpelman on the show and Todd is a
developer advocate here at firebase with
a specialty for iOS fun fact about Todd
is that his favorite color is red
and the makers first car is Nissan and
his favorite childhood friend is named
Adam his mother's maiden name is Davis
in the first four of his social security
is nine one four two David are you
stealing my identity well apparently I
already have oh we have a great episode
for you today Todd is an amazing iOS
developer so we have lots of questions
focused on iOS today so how about we get
started sounds good question time
you're much better gorillas than me this
is from beneath on Twitter who asks hey
ask firebase hashtag whether any videos
coming up on crash reporting on iOS and
the answer is yes eventually I've got a
few videos that I need to do on
analytics first we're gonna have a
little series on that and then maybe one
or two on dynamic links that I'd like to
address some advanced topics there but
then yes I do want to at least cover the
basics of screencasts on all the
features that firebase has to offer one
of those being crash reporting it's
generally easy to set up testing it is a
little weird because you have to kind of
make sure that Xcode doesn't sort of
grab the crash before crash reporting
does I heard that you just published a
video on firebase storage in iOS that
might be true but only subscribers would
get to find out so maybe you should
subscribe somewhere down here it's not
about you there's a button down here
right here look underneath here there's
probably strange oh there it is what's
that up what's that out in the horizon
it looks like another question this one
is also from beneath on Twitter who has
a two-parter here one how can we send
interactive push notifications to iOS
devices and two how can we send push
notifications to all devices from my
terminal and Mac what is an interactive
push notification time well I don't
quite know what he means but my guess is
it probably has to do with those
categories that you get in notifications
on iOS so you can specify a category
that a notification belongs to you can
then add actions to that category and
that gives you like those nice two or
three buttons that get associated with a
notification when you receive them on
iOS so the answer is that you can do
that but when you are sending this
notification to the firebase cloud
messaging service you need to add the
click action key instead of category so
if you're sending this to a pnsu would
say category my special category within
firebase cloud messaging you need to say
click underscore action and then add
your category name and that will make
those notifications interactive on iOS
unless of course he's talking about some
of the extra special fancy stuff that
Apple has added into notifications on
iOS 10 for that that requires a fairly
new user notification framework and
that's something that we will be
supporting soon if not by the time this
video is out so keep a lookout for that
for the second part how can we send
notifications to all devices from my
terminal in Mac so firebase
notifications
this really nice feature where you can
say hey let's send this message to
everybody who's using this app you can't
actually do that with a curl command or
something like that from the terminal
what you can do as a workaround and I
think what a lot of developers do is
they simply have every instance of their
client subscribe to like in all users
topic within firebase cloud messaging
and then you can send a notification to
everybody within that topic from your
desktop or you know from your server
from a little curl call and that's how
you basically send these notifications
to all of your clients thank you for
that two-parter both very good questions
let's see what else we got incoming
question this next question comes to
malucia on Twitter and Ellucian asks I
saw a codelab
on how to build real-time chat for the
web can we do the same for Android and
iOS
and yes solution you can if you go to
the code labs website there's actually
two code labs one for a firebase iOS
code lab and Swift and then another one
for firebase Android code lab that will
get you up and running building your
magical chat app in no time so if you
want to check that out the link is in
the description great question Lucian we
got a question coming in this is from
David West who asks wait what oh wow
really really David West on Twitter his
name is actually David one maybe he's
your evil twin
yeah wait what if he's the nice one yeah
that would make you wait so David asks I
love using firebase on iOS thank you
what is the best way to sync data to and
from watch OS well from what I
understand is that watch OS doesn't
support all of the libraries that you
get on your iPhone and mainly for
firebase the problem there is see if
network that's how we do the socket
connection so what do we do time so yeah
my understanding is you cannot connect
to firebase directly from your watch you
would probably have to use your phone to
communicate back and forth to firebase
and then communicate any relevant
changes back up to the watch from there
and for that I think you'd probably use
your standard like watch connectivity
library with the update application
context call to do most of that but I
would like to add a caveat that I
haven't actually made any watch OS
applications so I may or may not know
what I'm talking about because I don't
have an Apple watch but if anyone out
there would like to send me their Apple
watch I
was not an Apple watch but if you would
like to send me an Apple watch I promise
that I will wear it during my next
episode that is a great question David
West and I'm watching you
oh what's going on in there I got
another question it's in 3d I've never
actually geek like this before okay tell
you what you do to me top they do this
so the next question comes from Anton on
YouTube and Anton asked
can't a dynamic link survive a sign up
or login process so Todd what are those
words actually mean ah so the deal with
firebase dynamic links what makes them
so special is that they can survive the
app installation process meaning that if
a user clicks on a dynamic link goes to
install your app and then opens your app
for the first time that app can retrieve
the original context of the deep link
that the user clicked on to install your
app in the first place and then you can
use that information to provide them
with sort of a customized first-time
experience and so on
I believe what Anton is asking is well
what if you need your user to like sign
in first or go through some type of
setup process the answer is yes a
dynamic link can survive that too but
it's up to you the app developer to
actually remember that so you will get a
dynamic link context when the user first
opens your app but if you want your user
to go through the whole process of
signing in before they can use your app
you've got to remember that somewhere
you know store it in like your user
settings or something so you can grab it
later then after users finished signing
in setting up an account doing whatever
it is you need them to do then go ahead
and grab that original link and then
perform whatever first-time experience
you want to present to that user all
right thank you very much Anton great
question thanks for clarifying that's
why I'm here for so let's stop question
time
this question comes from Nichkhun on
YouTube who asks how can I get real-time
active users of my app through firebase
is it possible well now since this
question was asked in response to our
firebase analytics video I'm kind of
assuming the question is how can I do
this through firebase analytics can I
open up my analytics page and see how
many people are using my app right now
and the answer basically is no you can't
quite do this generally speaking if
you're looking at timing for firebase
analytics your device will send down
data from the device to firebase
analytics about once an hour or on iOS
when your app goes into the background
now once firebase analytics receives
that data it can immediately export that
data to bigquery if you've linked up
firebase analytics and bigquery and you
can see your data in there nearly as
soon as firebase analytics receives it
and then on the firebase analytics side
every couple hours it will process the
data that it has and lunges it up and
spits it out to you in sort of a nicely
formatted way but if you're actually
looking to see how many people right now
are using my app you can't really do
that through firebase analytics so if
only there were some other way well
thank you for asking a question but you
can actually use the real-time database
to see which users are active in your
app we have a real-time database that's
awesome it's real-time in at the
database so if you use the real-time
database that has a present system so
the real-time database uses a socket
connection so that is a persistent
connection from the device up to the
real-time database so when someone joins
it knows that and when someone leaves
and knows that as well so you can use
the on disconnect methods to know when
someone signs up you just do your
business and then when they do on
disconnect you can just remove them from
a queue so to have a list of active
users and when they leave just plug them
right off well that works too I guess
alright virus it works firebase yeah
that's cool all right well thank you
very much Nichkhun for your question
good question excellent question I would
say was it a good question I think it
was a good question was a good question
yeah thank you all so much for stopping
by this show and thank you Todd for
stopping by as well oh thanks for having
me
this was fun oh yeah always a pleasure
Todd and if you want your question
answered on next week's episode make
sure to send it on YouTube Twitter Stack
Overflow and like always use the hashtag
as firebase and that's all thank you all
so much and we will see you next time
alright I gotta go change all my
passwords
I don't know I already did that for you
wait a minute terrible there we go yeah
that's how you fight in fire fatal and
aggressive patty cake patty she heavy
awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
