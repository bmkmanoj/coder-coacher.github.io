the engineering leads for five days and
i'm here today with our product manager
suffer to introduce a new service in the
firebase family by now i think you know
what firebases is this cross-platform
mobile backend suite of services that
helps you develop an app grow your user
base engage your users and your money
and firebase remote config allows you to
instrument your application so you can
run a be testing of your features so why
config it's a story that starts many
years ago when i joined a small team
that has this big ambitious goal in mind
to build an open mobile operating system
back then we wanted something that will
allow us to configure a few things for
different OMS and carriers for example
our old system cloud-to-device messaging
used config to determine that the period
of a heartbeat to connect to networks
based on carriers on different location
in the world and this service proved to
be really useful so much that it grew
really really big and when other parts
of the company figure out that the
service existed a lot of colleagues of
mine they were building applications at
Google started using the system and at
some point I think all major google app
use the service but the usage wasn't
really perfect because as we built a
service for the platform we didn't have
compartments so there was
cross-pollination of the configuration
files for applications each app could
read and write other applications files
so when we build firebase we group
together to build these services we
decided was the right time to build to
make the service right for applications
and also for third parties so you could
use it and we had to do two things first
we had to make sure that config files
were for apps so different apps could
not read each other but mainly we had to
make it scale
eight years ago we didn't predict the
success of Android and billions of
devices made us like we had to react
attack the system to make it scale at
that other side and also all these
applications on top we didn't foresee
that would use the service they post
quite a complexity and also because
firebase is cross-platform we added iOS
devices and many more applications on
top but we made it so today we have
firebase remote config which is a web
console where you can type values for
your variables that you use to
instrument your app so you can turn on
and off features in your application and
you can make your code behave
differently and you can target devices
group of devices based on language
carrier operating system type
application version and more and you can
have multiple of this in parallel and
for each group you can also select a
small percent of them to get the initial
configuration files so you can dis
staged rollouts staged rollouts are
important because if you unleash if you
uncover a bug you contain the population
that it's looking the bug and if you
want to test something we've got early
feedback from users like if you have a
button that says buy what you want to
try a different thing like get then you
can get early feedback from your users
and even further we we connected with
firebase analytics so now you're a be
testing becomes really powerful because
you can have a feedback loop of what
works and you can target the population
based on your analytics data and you can
do all this without repackaging APK is
your users don't have to download and
update version of your app it just on
the fly works just changing values from
the web console to get fire base config
is very simple you pull in the fibrous
SDK and this is an objective-c example
for iOS you initialize config and you
download the values when the application
opens and then you threw out the code
you can use this value those variables
to unlock new features
and the same goes for Android this is
the two slides before into one and the
top party of the initialization and then
you play with the variables well let's
see in details how this product works
and how we can control rocket lunches so
please welcome safa our product manager
thank you so I'm here today to do three
things I'm going to introduce a new term
wiring up your app I'm going to argue
that it pays to always wore up your app
before you launch and I'm going to show
you how remote config is a good solution
for this to do this we're going to have
a little bit of fun let me introduce you
to rockets express a pizza delivery
service and interplanetary pizza
delivery service in the solar system and
of course this service has an app and
we've packed a whole bunch of gizmos and
features in this app none of many of
them have never been seen or tried
before do i hear you groan already
thinking oh my god these are all going
to crash so our whole priority has been
to get this thing launched so you know
there's the pressure you've probably
experienced this yourselves we're aiming
to get to IO after all and I mean
Jupiter's I owe the moon and it's and
our whole goal is to get this puppy out
there so we can catch the launch window
okay our launch goes pretty well we
should right past the moon we approach
Mars and we wear plan is to actually go
right past Mars because we're gonna in a
rush to get to IO but something
interesting happens now when we get to
Mars we spot a bunch of Martians and
they're having a pizza emergency over
there and we realize that they could use
our app to get their pizza so our CEO
that's you turns up to our engineer and
says hey Toria we need to get a message
out to people to show
them how to order pizza with our app
unfortunately Toria replies saying sorry
sir we were in such a rush to launch
that we didn't wanna power up in advance
so you ask what do we have to do ok
Toria says we were suppose we should
have used firebase remote config and and
so the CEO asked for how much is it
gonna cost us and how long is it going
to take and toria replies it's
absolutely free and it should be pretty
fast so so we have to go back to the
hangar and wire up so the first question
is what does Toria mean by wiring up
your app you can think of your app as
this complicated spaceship it has a lot
of systems a lot of people working on it
and of course you can always run down to
engineering every time you need to
change or a correction etc but really
what you want to have is a control
center it's a mission control center
like you see here in Houston that way
you can make changes without relaunching
your app every time we like to think of
this mission control center as the
remote config console and here's the
first screen of a remote complete
console before you've entered any
mission control parameters and here's a
few mission control parameters in your
remote config console except we actually
call these config parameters and as you
can see they simply cause consist of key
value pairs ok so just a few lines of
code and you see over here the key is
special message and you just get the
value not hard at all to program this
and here we are special message we're
back in the console and we're putting
into special message what we're going to
say to our Martian friends ok we
refitted our app we came back we now
have a special message and it was
important that we put this in behind a
config parameter because maybe by the
time we've relaunched and come all the
way back
things have changed we actually have to
say something a little different so
that's so this worked out for us and we
left a bunch of happy Martian app users
now and grew our user base okay on to
the next stage of the journey which is
the asteroid belt and here the danger is
negative comments from crashes and our
goal is to get through the asteroid belt
while minimizing the negative comments
clearly crashes can be pretty crashes
and failures can be pretty bad for you
here's some negative comments first two
are pretty self-explanatory the last one
really gets me the user likes rap it's a
good app they are loyal they want to
stay with you and they're working really
hard to get over tech problems that's
that's really sad more shame okay so
after some careful analysis using
firebase crash you figure out that
there's one feature that's bringing down
your whole app and you desperately call
Toria saying oh no and thinking actually
not saying thinking oh no we do we have
to go back we do we have to go refit our
app we have to do everything again
fortunately Toria has been smart what
she did what she realized when she
refitted the rocket ship was that she
could actually go the whole way and put
everything behind a config parameter so
what she did is she put all every
feature behind the config parameter you
can think of these as feature flags so
basically here's what one of the things
that helps you do this is this default
file that we have it allows you to
program lots and lots of features
without actually having to put them all
on the console so then only when you're
on the console do you go do you only
when you need to change it do you change
something on the console here's a local
default file for iOS and here's the same
thing for Android again completely
cross-platform everything works on iOS
and Android
and you fetch the local default files
surprise with exactly the same lines of
code there's no difference all that
happens is when you fetch it the
override value from the console override
your local default and we've done a lot
of work to make remote config very
efficient so when you want to get stuff
from the server for example you use a
fetch call the fetch call checks your
local cache I mean check your cached
values and there's a time to live and
sees if the time to life has expired and
only when it's expired does it actually
go and fetch stuff so that relieves you
of warning of worrying about how fresh
is your stuff what you do is you call
fetch anywhere you wish and convict
takes care of the rest same similar
things apply to the rest of the API okay
so now to turn off a feature or you'd go
all you do is you go back to your
console and the its default value is
true but now you just turn it to false
and that turns off the feature so thanks
tutorials for site we managed to
navigate our way through the asteroid
belt without what while minimizing the
negative comments ok now we finally
approach our destination which is IO a
few interesting facts about I oh I think
you've guessed by now I like space it's
the fifth moon of Jupiter it's similar
in size to our moon and it's got an iron
core but most importantly of all it
looks like pizza I mean I could swear
those are olives and there's a pepperoni
on it and trust me go search on the
internet and people will say it looks
like pizza so so then we have a real
problem now that we're getting to IO
realize that in a in a moon that looks
like pizza people must know a lot about
pizza so are they going to be okay with
our basic pizza which is what we thought
we're going to give them or do we need
to experiment with something else like a
thick crust pizza so that's really
essential
so so you the CEO this time timidly goes
down to Toria and asks any chance we can
experiment with thick cars pizza and
your supplies Toria says absolutely how
come well when you wired up your app you
automatically get use of convicts
conditions now what you can do is you
can apply rules to select a subgroup of
your users so here I am showing on the
conflict console some of the conditions
some of the rules you can use for
creating a condition and here it is I've
applied a specific condition experiment
one variant a two special message as you
can see with this default value is basic
pizza but its experimental value is
special thick crust pizza ok let's look
at a little bit more closely at two of
these rules specifically user in random
percentile and user in audience so
you've probably gone to a few firebase
presentations by now and you know that
firebase analytics has as a thing called
audiences here in this screen you can
see I'm creating an audience based on
app version and what this does is that
it segments the user groups to something
smaller so you can target them and
clearly i'm calling this I of visitors
and these audiences are available to the
file to firebase as a whole because it's
a well integrated system so here I am
you can see that in conditions for
remote config I have a drop-down that
shows you all the audiences that are
available for my app and here I'm
choosing i/o visitors which we just
created but I like to also draw your
attention to that little button on the
right called aunt with an aunt and yes
if you guessed it it enables me to add
another rule over here I'm adding user
in percenter at ten percent so what this
mean
is that i took my audience of i/o
visitors and i'm targeting ten percent
of that audience now the same thing it's
the same exact thing no difference
applies to special message okay so next
thing is we need to actually track this
in firebase analytics well how do we do
this here's a little tip what one of the
things we can do you can use user
properties in firebase analytics here
i'm setting up experiment one and you
set up experiment one in remote config
to reflect the value of to reflect which
experiment is happening so here I have
experiment one that shows you either if
the default value fired or the
experiment one variant a fired then a
couple of lines of code you get the
value of experiment 1 out of config and
you put them into the user property what
this does is now every event that goes
to firebase analytics is now tagged with
the value of experiment 1 which you can
then use in your in the analysis by
filtering for the value of experiment 1
to see to see for example if its variant
a ok so what's the vote is it going to
be basic pizza or is it thick crust
pizza I think the user is there were
very sophisticated and they liked and
thick crust pizza but so now we want
thick crust pizza to apply to everyone
so we go back to remote config we get
rid of the condition and we make the
default value thick crust pizza and now
everybody get stickers pizza so we did
our experiment we got our results and we
set our default and as you can see
they're pretty happy with their thick
crust pizza ok so now for some real
space ships out there exploring the
universe here's fabulous it's a app that
is incubated at duke university center
for advanced hindsight and its purpose
is to help you
rid of bad habits and replace it with
healthy rituals actually I'm using it
myself to improve my own sleeping habit
you can think of a fabulous as the
ultimate a be testing platform why
because you're trying to change user
habits and user habits are very
difficult to change so you have to be
able to experiment like crazy to be able
to figure out what works for these
people and the fabulous team has wired
up their whole app with config
parameters that they filled in with JSON
objects here's an example of one of
their a/b testing it's specifically
interesting because they've combined
notifications firebase notifications
with config and as you can see at the
top there there is a notification
showing a little rocket very relevant to
us and and if a prompt when you click on
that their default action is to take you
to this screen that asks you to set up a
full screen alarm for some activity and
you can you know you can choose that and
get started interestingly enough you can
now use firebase they can use firebase
remote config to experiment with the
percentage of their population what
happens when they click on a
notification in this case when you click
on that notification it actually comes
up with something completely different
comes up with a picture of a part tree
asking your question and if you answer
the question like as it is asking if you
need if what does a tree need and if you
answer yes it needs some water it comes
back and tells you a little bit about
their research and hopefully that will
have a different effect on you and cause
you to choose drink water as a good
habit to to try out here's another app
yummly they are for choosing recipes now
I have a personal connection with this
which is I often have to cook meals for
my daughter and I have to admit I'm
cooking is not my strong
sweet all the free food at Google and I
actually struggle often to come up with
a good recipe that she actually likes we
humbly really helps me out with this
with their dietary preferences and their
shopping list and everything that goes
with it to help me find a good meal so
they wanted to experience experiment
with their connect screen and it's the
first screen that their users see and
what they wanted to do is to find out
how can they improve their login how
they can improve their conversion to
login here's a bunch of parameters and a
bunch of conditions that they've set up
to test just that one of these tests was
interesting to me and I'm showing it to
you over here on the lid on the left
with a you can see that they have a
generic screen and on the right they
have a contextualized screen based on
the users search or based on some other
parameter and so it would stand to
reason that a contextual screen would
have a better impact on login and bright
well wrong it's not it doesn't do that
they actually ran this experiment and
they found out that their generic screen
was much more effective in fact with
search their generic screen was twice as
effective and with the recipes the
generic scream was twenty percent more
effective so they went back and actually
got everything back to generic and it
really goes to confirm how important it
is to be able to experiment with stuff
before you actually go in with
assumptions okay a few words on
conclusion now when you many of us when
we're creating apps not only do we want
to run a great business but we would
really like to go and have an impact on
the world and make change how people do
things perhaps go further and change how
people think and perhaps go even further
and change what is possible so to do
this we have to have a close
conversation with our users
you can with apps you really have the
potential to talk to millions of people
affecting how they think and how they
live with the very greatest apps and the
greatest conversations you can
profoundly shape our culture to succeed
in this conversation you need to
instrument your app so that you can
listen to see what users are up to and
we know that firebase analytics provides
you a free and easy solution to do so
but listening is only half of this
conversation the other half is to be
able to respond fast to what users throw
your way and responding fast is
essential because that way users can
stay engaged and they can understand
that you're being responsive and making
changes that make sense for them so
we've built firebase remote config to
make it easy to do just this respond
fast it's got a simple API it's got a
straightforward console it scales
massively and it's integrated with
analytics what remains for you to do is
to wire up your app before you launch so
you can always complete your
conversation with your users here's what
you can do next the documentation is at
firebase google.com / docs / remote
config if you forget that just go to
firebase google com and search for
remote config and sure will turn up you
can also look at our support and at our
youtube and twitter feeds on behalf of
francisco myself thank you very much for
coming today and we really look forward
to seeing what you do with firebase
remote config so that we can actually
make it better
