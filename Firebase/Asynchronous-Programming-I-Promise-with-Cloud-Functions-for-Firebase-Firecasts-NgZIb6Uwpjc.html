cast for cloud function my name is Jen
person and last time we saw how a
promised object was used to tell cloud
functions to wait for a database bright
to complete before cleaning up the
promised object came from the real time
database API so that function I didn't
have to do anything with the promise
other than return it from the function
there's a lot more to promises than that
if you're going to be writing code with
cloud functions you'll definitely need
to know how to work with them so I'll
pack some of those details for you today
a promise
represents some asynchronous work that
should eventually complete if you're an
Android developer this is very similar
to the tasks object that you use
sometimes with a firebase Android SDKs
when the work tracked by a promise is
still executing the promise is in a
pending state then if the work completes
successfully the promise is said to be
fulfilled or if there's an error the
promise becomes rejected these are the
only three states that a promise can be
and pending fulfilled or rejected and
once the promise becomes fulfilled or
rejected it can never change state again
now let's go back to that code from the
last video I returned the promise coming
from the database reference set method
when you return a promise like this
cloud functions will wait until the
promise becomes fulfilled or rejected
before moving on and cleaning up that
function this is fine however sometimes
you might want to trigger more code to
execute after a promises fulfilled you
can do that with the then method on the
promise object let's see an example of
how that can be useful imagine you're
beginning to write a function that
emails an employee's expense report to
their manager when it changes here we
have a database trigger with wildcards
for any employee ID and report ID nested
inside I can get the employee ID from
the event params
the string containing the report from
the event data and a reference to the
root of the database to use later I need
to code up a few things in this function
to make it work the plan here is to
first read the manager's employee ID
then I'll use that ID to look up the
email address of a manager and finally I
need to send the report to that email
address I can find my employee ID by
building a reference to the node where
the employee's data
stored and looking at the manager field
under that note that ECMO script 6 which
is the flavor of JavaScript supported by
node gives me a neat way to insert a
variable into a string by using
backticks as the string delimiter now
I'll use the method once on the database
reference to read the data in that field
once returns a promise that becomes
fulfilled when the data is available to
give the snapshot with the manager ID
I'll use the then method on map problems
to trigger some code when it becomes
available a couple things to note here
then take the JavaScript function that
itself takes one argument what you see
here is the Eggman script six syntax for
writing an anonymous function here snap
is the argument to that function and
that fat arrow introduces the function
body in curly braces now I'll get the
manager's ID from the snapshot which I
can use to find their email address
stored in their own employee record so
I'll build a reference to that and use
once again to read the data there's one
more important thing to know about that
function pass to the venn method if you
return another promise from there when
that promise gets fulfilled it will also
fulfill the promise returned from then
so when once finishes loading the email
address I can arrange to do more work
after that using the promised return
from then at this point I have the
manager's email address and the report
from the original event and now it's
time to send the email let's imagine
that I already have another JavaScript
function that will do that and returns
yet another promise that becomes
fulfilled when the email is queued for
delivery I can return that final promise
from the functions to tell cloud
functions that can terminate and clean
up after the email is cute and that's
pretty much all we need to make this
function work but actually I can shorten
this code up a bit
it's common to change all the promises
together to make this code easier to
read and write so I'll tidy up this
function right now
that looks better don't you think
reading this function out loud you can
say first use the employee ID to find
their managers employee ID then use the
managers ID to look up their email
address then send the report to that
email address
and that exactly matches the three steps
that I stated earlier but what happens
if something goes wrong during any of
those steps we can handle that case with
the catch method on a promise you pass
it a function and it will be called if
any promise in the chain is rejected so
a lot of cash from my code I'll pass it
an anonymous function that will be
called with one parameter which
represents the reason for the rejection
that object probably contains some error
and you'll have to check the
documentation for the method that gives
you the promise in order to know how to
use it here I'll just log it catch also
returns the rejected promise so I don't
have to do anything else here because
I'm already returning that from this
function with the return statement at
the top of this chain alright as you can
see training men methods with promises
is pretty handy way of sequencing bits
of work that depend on each other's
output but what if you have some items
of work that don't depend on each other
and could execute concurrently working
all at the same time you can handle that
with problems as well let's take a look
at another situation let's say I'm
writing a function to send to employees
an email when one wishes to thank the
other I already have their employee IDs
ready to use from path wildcards I can
look up their employee records
independently of each other with two
separate queries now I have two promises
that will each become resolved when the
records are available with these
promises ready I can pass them in an
array to the function promise all this
function returns yet another promise
which is fulfilled only after all the
promises in the array become fulfilled
so I'll use its then method to keep
doing more work the result object that
comes from this promise is an array of
fulfilled results that each correspond
to the promises in the array I can index
into that array to find the snapshots
provided by each promise now I can reach
into those employee records to get the
names and email addresses to use for
composing the email it's great to
recognize the efforts of your employees
if send email also returns a promise we
can use those to wait for both emails to
be queued using promise all again
and to finish this function properly I
should return the promise that comes
from the first promise all this will
make my function wait until all the work
is fully complete before cleaning up now
you know a lot about promises you will
use them frequently with cloud functions
in fact every function you write should
return a promise if it has to wait on
work to be done and they almost all will
be doing exactly that the only exception
is HTTP functions which do not return
promises for that type of function you
have to send a result to the client now
I'll cover that in another video but for
today be sure to keep your promises when
working with Clive functions and I'll
see you here next time on the firebase
