notifications in this session
I'm Francesca and I'm going to introduce
why we believe that notifications are
important later on ting may our product
manager will come on stage and introduce
what we have built so you can use
notifications effectively and finally
Lawrence our luncheon t-shirt guy hi and
developer advocate will show you this
product with a few demos so let's begin
why notifications when we embark in the
journey of developing an application we
all dream about its success we think
about how much our users will love our
applications we want them to come to the
application and one more and more
because user engagement plays a really
big role in application development and
notifications are this messages that
parts in front of a user they grab their
attention and hopefully they make them
do something that we want you a month
ago I bought a ticket to a festival and
this application is reminding me that in
three days the festival begins and maybe
I should come back to the app and check
the final lineup or buy tickets for the
shower or schedule the concerts and
share them with my friends so
notifications are really powerful in
getting the users back into our
application in fact there are studies
that show that users that achtung to
notifications are twice as likely to
come back as opposed to those that don't
but if we send too many notifications we
might upset the user will overwhelm them
and we achieve the opposite effect users
my silence the notifications or even
worse and install our app so we need to
get a few things right we need to know
when is the right time to send the
notifications if I get a notification
now to come back to a game and play a
new
level is probably not as effective we
need to understand who we should target
if you have a like a wetsuit sale and we
target runners maybe you're not as
effective as if we target surfers and
finally what is the message what we are
trying to convey to the user because if
we get these things right there is when
we grab the user attention and we get
them to do what we need if you write an
application and we sleep in a bag and
your bugs happen right we definitely
have bugs in our applications it's not
warrants obviously not lawyers well we
want to target just the population that
was affected by the bug we don't want to
send an apology to the entire population
of our users so notifications are really
important but to get these things right
we need some sort of feedback and here
is when analytics come to help because
with good analytics data now we can
improve our engagement strategies and
our marketing and growth accurate people
they can spend time in focusing on how
increase our user base and our content
editor can send content updates as they
write the articles and our product
managers like Tim may hear their super
epic and send announcements about new
features that make the usage of the app
even more compelling so we think that
this is very important to get it right
and near the firebase we bought a new
product that will let you do exactly
this please welcome ting way to show you
firebase notifications
Thank You Francesco so let's take a look
at firebase notifications it is part of
the firebase product and firebase is a
suite of integrated product that helps
you to develop your apps grow a user
base and our money
Francesco just mentioned that
notification is really important in
helping you to engage users with the
right contacts and the right analytics
it could be even more powerful but the
process has to be simple so that people
can really focus on getting the content
of the message sent an interesting
message is going to bring your user back
much more effectively so let's see how
five based notification is going to help
you achieve that many of you are
familiar with firebase cloud messaging
the new version of Google Cloud
messaging has been reliably different
delivering messages to Android iOS and
chrome users firebase notifications is
built on top of firebase Cloud messaging
it is cross-platform it's designed so
that you can set the right target with
the right contacts and be able to
evaluate the effectiveness after it is
simple as you can see from this console
anyone should be able to send a
notification or message without having
to write a single line of server code so
that you can really focus on getting the
content of your message right but it is
not just a form so that you have to fill
out all the mandatory fields before you
can send a message it's designed so that
you can set the right target by using
analytic insight FCM topics or even
device and app info once you have
defined your right target it's about
engaging your user with the right
contacts for example use language so
that you can localize your message
so that your Italian users will not be
getting a German message for example or
send your message so that is delivery
when the user base all the users are
timezone don't have to worry about
became user at 3:00 a.m. in the morning
get them mad turn off notifications and
potentially say bye to your applications
every applications has its own
customizations and you can do that by
using the custom data feels you can pass
in a dynamic link so that you can take
user to the right contacts and the right
flow of your app or provide the discount
code so that you can apply the discount
when you search happen open your
notifications you've just seen how easy
it is to send notifications best
effector is they're actually bringing
more of your user back not having that
much of a difference or actually turning
your user away five based notification
is integrated with Sybase analytics and
provide you with a default stock of
analytics so that you can understand the
effectiveness right off the box when
sending a message a lot of the time
there is a goal that we want to achieve
and you can set that by using conversion
events we track send and open for you by
default but obviously you can provide
your own so now let's go take a look at
the console and see where you can find
the analysis switch to the laptop
all right so what do you so what you're
seeing here is the five-eighths console
and you can find notifications on the
growth because we believe that it can
really help you to re-engage your user
takes to improve the experience so this
is where you have all the campaign's
that you're managing if you click on one
of the campaign's that has already been
completed it's loading all right this is
where you're going to see the analysis
the notification funnel so there's some
interesting data here number of sent and
how many of your user actually tap and
open your notifications so apparently
this particular promotion is not as
effective in getting the user open the
notification so we did you Paulo there
and if you actually provide conversion
events when you send notifications we
will track the number of times your user
actually click that particular actions
that will lead to that events so this
gives you the basic inside of
notification effectiveness if you want
to do more analysis this is when you go
to analytics so there's one trick that I
would like to share with you here today
so if you go to analytics and look for
notification opens under the events tab
this will bring you the default analytic
events report view so you see the total
count the breakdown by messages and
topics as well as the breakdown by
location and demographic if those data
available to you the trick that I want
to show you is if you actually click on
one of the messages up here will
actually automatically apply filters to
all the dashboards and all the event
reports in analytics so now you can
really do some serious analysis of how
this particular notification campaign
actually impact your
line sense mattress and factors so now
let's go back to the presentation please
all right so we've just seen the product
walk through so now Lauren's a developer
advocate is going to show us some demo I
don't about you guys but I'm a really
really lazy programmer so I really like
to write as few lines of code as
possible but yeah thank you so actually
before I demo I don't I got one day's I
got my demo wrong earlier I was fixing
it so as let me see if I can whoo okay I
see people waving oh so I'm a very lazy
programmer in general I like to write as
few lines of code as possible I want
things to be made as easy for me as they
can be and that's one of the things that
really attracts me to firebase
notifications because it's just so easy
as a developer and so first of all I
want to talk about two scenarios for
building applications and one is when
you're receiving notifications in the
background and I want to talk about just
how easy it is for you to build the code
for doing that so the first one I'm
gonna show is here's the code that you
do if you want to receive background
notifications in iOS any other lazy
developers here you know a single line
of code and I mean technically it's not
even a line of code it's a line of
configuration right you add a single
part to your iOS application and use the
firebase Messaging part now a lot of
people asked well why messaging why not
notifications and you may be familiar
with Google Cloud messaging and now it's
new evolution there firebase Cloud
messaging if they're so similar and the
underlying infrastructure is used in the
same way that we said there's no point
in shipping two sets of libraries
because they're so similar so if you
incorporate the firebase messaging pod
into your iOS application you can also
then grow into firebase cloud messaging
as well but all you got to do is put
this into your application and you're
good to go and then for Android it's
almost as easy you just build this into
your build up Gradle file
you're gonna compile come Google
firebase for our base messaging 3.0 and
that's it so if you create an
application and I'm going to demo in
just a moment where I use the Android
studio and I did file new application
and if you're an Android studio
developer
be familiar with the empty activity
template which just gives you a hello
world that's all I did
and then I added this line to the build
up Gradle and let's demo it now can we
switch to the wolf vision so I have an
app running in the background now and
ting Mei is going to send a notification
to this app sorry switch to the laptop
notifications
why should I send what should we say
what kind of notification just so you
know it's real any hockey fans here
who's gonna win the Stanley Cup penguins
oh okay who said the Seattle
Thunderbirds you're my hero
they're not even in it okay let's send
penguins oh sorry
easier this way
all right so can we switch back to the
phone so now early so the phone was just
sitting on the desktop and the
notification is just come in you can see
it up in my notification tray so now if
I slide down from that my application
was just called firebase notification 1
and you can see ting May has actually
sent the notification penguins and then
if I touch on that it's gonna launch the
app and this is the familiar hello world
app from Android studio I wrote no code
to be able to get that it's not pretty
cool right I've never had so many
applause for doing nothing before this
is great so can we switch back to the
slides please so now those background
notifications and then people say okay
that's great but what about when the app
is in the foreground
what about like if I want to be able to
do things and I want to receive a
notification and have it maybe change in
activity in my app while the app is in
the foreground like the classic example
of this is if you're using like some
kind of IP telephony app and then you
receive an incoming call it's gonna
change your activity to be able to
handle the incoming call in most cases
you want to answer some cases you want
to ignore and you call that kind of UI
so you're changing the context of the
app upon receiving a notification so
let's take a look at how we would
actually do this in this case and I'm
still a very lazy developer so it's not
a whole lot of work but it's a little
bit of work and it's a little bit more
so in Android here's all I have to do
okay I'm gonna create a service class in
this case I call it my firebase
messaging service because like I said
I'm a really lazy programmer and I've no
imagination about what to call the thing
and I specify an intent filter on that
so it will handle particular actions so
that this class is the one that will
handle the action and the action that I
want to handle is comm Google firebase
messaging event so what I'm saying is
that once I compile my application and I
have that service class in there if this
application is running on the device
whenever an incoming message comes an
incoming notification comes then this
class the firebase messaging service
class is the one that's going to handle
it and this class would look a little
bit like this so it's just you know
straightforward Java code here this is
my lazy my firebase messaging sir
and I'm going to excuse me I'm going to
extend the fire base the base fire base
messaging service class for that and
then whenever I receive a message once
I'm extending then I just received this
on message received and it's going to
contain a remote message and then
there's a bunch of attributes of that
remote message that I can do something
with some I put together a screencast of
this that went on YouTube last night and
one question that somebody asked me was
well like how would I generate a custom
notification so say for example I'm like
Android AM and Android and we have the
ability to have a custom notification
and you can reply or you can do
something directly in the notification
here's where you would do that you're
receiving the remote message in you can
parse metadata out of that remote
message and then you can generate a new
notification that you would then render
an Android with that custom stuff on
there on also if you have like an
Android wear watch connected to it you
can like send the notification so there
so there's lots of really fun and lots
of really great stuff that you can do
and this is really all the code that you
have to do to be able to do that it's
you create the service you create the
intent filter your service has to extend
firebase messaging service and then you
handle your stuff in the on message
received pretty straightforward pretty
easy right and then people go but what
about iOS I say okay iOS now forgive me
my slides I tend to use objective-c I
haven't become a fan of Taylor Swift yet
so people are laughing at my challenge
this is great so my last session nobody
laughed so and so and so when you're
writing an iOS application you just have
your application have a did receive
remote note notification handler on that
that's the second line of code here and
that's going to receive an NS dictionary
and if you're an objective-c or an iOS
programmer you're familiar with an NS
dictionary it's just a set of name value
pairs so there's going to be a set of
name value pairs keys and the value for
that so as you can see here the user
info bracket key that I'm doing there
that would be just where I read out the
keys like maybe it's the message ID or
the message body or something like that
and then I could do something
interesting with that in iOS so should
we see this in action what do you think
not okay so can we switch to the laptop
please actually switch back to the phone
first please and I have my application
here running in the foreground and it's
same file new HelloWorld application
from Android studio except I added a
service class to that with all the code
that I just showed you on the slide and
I'm running it and now can we switch to
the laptop please and ting may we'll
send a notification and what what what
kind of things should we send what do
you think something other than penguins
cuz I don't really like the Penguins
I'll Sidney Crosby skate better turtles
turtles
there's no hockey team build the Turtles
that's okay name a hockey team sharks
thank you you a former Seattle star
plays for the Sharks Patrick Marleau so
I'm a big sharks right now sharks
they're gonna win tonight right so as
ting my sends that can we now switch to
the phone please and we should see an
incoming notification is going to change
my activity drumroll everybody thank you
for the drumroll there it is and we see
this activity now that comes in and this
was launched in response to the
notification so in that slide you know
where I showed you earlier on that I've
received the notification and I received
data I have another activity that I just
launched stuck that data in a bundle so
it was the from and the text and in anis
activity I render the text it was really
really as simple as that
we're probably talking 15 lines of code
total to do the whole thing and this is
me receiving custom notifications from
firebase notifications and actually
doing something active with that how
easy is that
what are we going to do next year so
with that so ting May I would like to
pass it back to you and we're gonna talk
about some customers right Thank You
Lawrence thank you
I got applause because I shirts all
right so I hope you guys enjoy the
t-shirts as well as the demos that we
just shown you we definitely like it um
so we have to shown you how easy it is
in history people to stand on vacation
without using the console and also how
simple it is to actually integrate on
the client-side we don't want the
develop of product in vacuum so we have
been gathering a lot of developers
feedback and there are many developers
who actually integrate with firebase
notifications already today I would like
to share the experiences from three of
them and for the rest please go to other
firebase session and heard about their
experiences
so first up in the air someone is taking
a picture so having the air helps user
to manage their travel experience after
they have already booked a flight ticket
so they would guess lifestyles change
alert for example and what they found is
firebase notification is reliable and
flexible and they were able also to
really allow them to focus on the
important metrics of their app buzz but
an application that help you to book bus
ticket they were sent to you new route
information or this town code and they
were able to integrate with firebase
analytics really quickly whilst you able
to customize to their user experiences
Milan studio is able to use firebase
notifications in their latest
application true day an application that
helps user to celebrate anniversaries
they have users around the world and
they're able to use a time song feature
so that they don't have to worry about
sending notifications after midnight and
disturb their users so these are some
really interesting real life examples
and testimonies on how flexible simple
and reliable firebase notification is so
we've covered a lot today we talked
about why we think notification is
important in the engage
users what we build to help you to
better engage your users and we also
will show you some demos and also
partners feedbacks in summary there are
three key takeaways we build firebase
notifications so that anyone can send
notification without having to write a
single line of server code and we make
the server in win a minute we make the
client integration super simple as well
so that you can focus on getting the
right user with the right contacts and
with a tight integration with analytics
you'll be able to measure the
effectiveness of your notifications
we're really excited to announce on
firebase notification is available to
you today so for those who are
interested to learn more please go to
the five basic google comm check out our
documentation and support page we really
look forward for your feedback because
we wanna develop a product that really
helps you to better engage your users so
thank you so much for coming to this
session
