system that allows users to sign in and
sign up for your application it also
allows federated identity through
providers like Facebook Twitter and of
course Google now when doing this your
users will demand a rich user experience
and providing this as well as solving
identity problems can be a lot of work
luckily firebase UI makes all of this
really easy and in this video I'll show
you how to do a sign in and sign up with
Google in a web app as well as using an
email password combination before we
start you'll need to create a firebase
project and then enable authentication
on it the console will then provide you
with code snippets to put in your web
page
let's take a look step 1 create a new
project in the firebase console step 2
enable authentication click get started
click setup sign-in method enable email
password and enable Google step 3
if you're going to run these pages on
your own domain be sure to add the
domain name step 4 go back to the
overview screen and click Add firebase
to your web app then you'll get the
initialization code okay now we've done
everything we need on the firebase
back-end the next step is to build a
site that presents sign-in options this
takes you to a page once you've signed
in and displays information about the
user on that page and that's it it's
just two web pages but wait surely when
signing in you might need to build more
pages things like choosing between
different accounts on the machine
something like this or if you want to
sign up a new user then you probably
need something like this well the good
news is firebase off UI does all of that
for you let's just build our pages and
we'll see it in action
here's my first page it's just basic
it's near-empty HTML remember that code
from the firebase console well I'll just
paste that in and then from github I can
use the code for the sign-in widget you
can find that code here and I'll paste
it here yes that's github because
firebase off UI is fully open source I
need to configure it to tell it which
page to redirect to after signing in and
also which providers I'm using earlier
if you remember I turned on email and
Google so I'll do that here and now the
logged in page again it's pretty basic
and I just paste in the same code not
this part it's a callback that happens
when the off state changes so we'll
write a little info about the user to
the page in that case and that's it
that's all the coding we need to do so
you now have a page with to sign-in
buttons there's a sign-in with Google
button and a sign in with email button
think about the different flows for
sign-in with Google button
I might have no Google accounts on this
machine in which case I have to give the
use of the facility to create one or
there might be more than one account
signed in in this browser in which case
I have to give the user the ability to
choose one of them or of course I might
have a user already signed in with
Google in which case I should just sign
them right in let's see this in action
okay I now have a browser with no Google
Account signed in I click sign in and I
get this as I have email sign-in as an
option it falls back to email sign-in
but I really want to sign in with Google
so I need a Google account so if I
select more options I can do that
and this is all without writing any code
for it okay here's the next scenario I
have multiple accounts signed in on this
browser so when I try to sign in it
gives me an account chooser that's
pretty neat right
and then there's this simple scenario I
have one account in this browser so when
I click sign-in
I should just sign straight in and I am
so lots of different user flows but
you're given the optimal standard user
interface without needing to write any
code and that's what the open source
firebase of UI does for you so we just
saw what happens when a user tries to
sign in with Google but what if you want
to keep your own user store and not
Federation identity provider like ours
well no problem the email sign-in gives
you just that if you try to sign in with
email
what firebase will do is list the Google
accounts based on their email address
that are signed into this browser
already but if you don't want one of
them and you just want to use your own
you can sign in with that said but of
course you might need a sign up page so
that someone can create an email
identity to sign in to your site with
and that's also provided for you
Google smart lock will even save it for
you if you want let's see that in action
I'm now back on my home page and I'll
select sign in with email here are two
email addresses that I signed in with
previously if I pick one of them I'll
get either the Google sign-in password
entry if it's a Google ID or the email
password one if it's an identity I set
up on this page I enter the password and
I'm logged in
signing up a new account is easy you
just click the Add Account button enter
the details username and password and
the account will be created one subtle
but powerful part of this is that
firebase off the UI also detects and
prompts your users to use the sign-in
method that they previously had used so
for example if they had signed in with
Google previously they will be taken
directly there to do so again saving
them time and effort and saving you a
lot of code
and that's it great UX for signing in
and signing up very little coding for
you I hope you enjoyed the screencast on
