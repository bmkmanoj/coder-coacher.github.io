Google i/o thank you all for being here
even at this hour
my name is r.j. and Thomas Walton I'm
Abe Haskins we we all work on cloud
functions what you have here is some of
the best-looking Twitter handles in the
team so I created mine just for you a
week ago but if you want to follow a
more experienced cloud functions you can
follow Thomas or Abe especially Abe is
great we are here today all three of us
to talk about cloud functions about
testing and about open source so you
might wonder to yourself RJ why do we
need to talk about this because I know
how to test my code I've been doing this
for for ages I know everything there is
to know about open source and well it
turns out this is Silicon Valley and
we've gone and changed the world and the
world of serverless looks quite
different from what we were familiar
with before so everything is different
right nothing we know applies anymore we
need an entirely new set of best
practices well not quite there's there's
a small snag which is that best
practices take practice they take a lot
of time to build so this is not
something that would just pop up pop
into existence in the what is it like
two months since we launched cloud
functions into beta it is not even
something that we could have experienced
in the few years that we've been working
on service it is something that forms
over literally decades so we actually
don't think that you should throw out
best practices that you know that you
love that you're familiar with but the
old is the new all you need is a new set
of tools to apply what you already knew
the old best practices that you may
already be familiar with and then to
apply those in the new world of service
with a new set of tools so what we want
to do today is basically do three things
we want to bring you into a mindset that
we think is conductive to writing good
code and then we would like to call out
a few best practices that roll out of
that mindset and then we would like to
give you a few concrete examples of how
to apply those best practices in a world
of cloud functions in a world of service
more generally so let's dive into that
mindset this is what we call the open
source mindset and the open source
mindset is interesting it is good to
look at because it's one of the most
thorough mindsets that you can get into
when you're when you're developing code
open source turns out to be a hard place
to develop code for example other people
might deploy your code and this is true
whether you want it or not like people
can just take it and run it anywhere you
will have to assume however that even if
other people help you out and contribute
some code they won't maintain it so the
code is your problem whether you like it
or not you will also have to assume that
the code will get reused because this is
something we've all done we copy and
paste and most importantly at least in
my opinion hopefully you're doing this
for fun and especially with open source
where you're doing this in your free
time it had better be fun or you won't
do it
now you might may say to me well RJ this
is all well and good but actually I am
you know in a cushy job I get paid
to write code none of this is actually
relevant to me why am I here
other than for the nice air conditioning
on a hot day so we actually think that
this mindset is useful no matter where
you code or how you code so for example
if you are in a closed source
environment in some sort of company say
the same rules are useful to you as well
for example even though the number of
people that deploy your code are fewer
you might deploy to a staging
environment at 17 different development
environments as well as eventually
production your code is most definitely
your problem people will call you on a
weekend if you break if it breaks even
if somebody else breaks it you're the
person they know wrote the original bit
of it so you're going to get called
reuse happens everywhere not just in
open-source
copy and pasting works at your workplace
as well if that's like a closed source
company and most importantly again at
least in my opinion hopefully your job
is fun so with that in mind I think we I
hope to convince you through this talk
that the stuff we tell you even though
it comes from a mindset of open source
it is actually useful no matter how you
code or where you code with that let's
dive into that first assumption the
assumption that other people deploy your
code so from that roles a best practice
that we want to share with you which is
that you should put your configuration
in the environment don't put it in
configuration files especially don't
hard-code it into any any of your code
put it in essentially environment
variables this is not new advice this is
something you may have heard from places
like the 12 factor app but we want to
show you how to do it if you're
developing in a service world so let's
take a look at firebase hosting firebase
hosting lets you host static files that
can be your
HTML your JavaScript but if you are
using something like the firebase SDK
which I hope many of you will be using
or else will get a chance to play with
soon then you need to configure that
that SDK because that SDK talks to a
back-end which means you need things
like an API key and then API key is
different between your production
environments your staging environment
everybody's dev environments so how do
you avoid hard coding your SDK your SDKs
API key
when these files have to be static well
the answer is here on the second line of
code that you see there you see a
firebase in knit Jes and that little
snippet of code will initialize your
firebase SDK by pulling environment
variables into your code and configuring
your code that way and we have been
smart enough to set those environment
variables for you no matter where you
are either running locally using
firebase serve or on the cloud when
you've run firebase deploy so this is
super useful if you now get clone this
file and you get firebase deploy it to a
completely different project it'll work
there's no code editing no configuration
editing which means that it's super easy
to switch between environments great so
this is useful this however is the
front-end let's have a look at the
backend code the cloud functions code
it's actually even easier there this
example imports the firebase admin
module into our no GS environment and
you same as with the client-side SDK you
have to initialize it well you can do
that by saying functions config firebase
that pulls environment variables in
it'll initialize your admin SDK and
you're ready to go once again I can
deploy this to any firebase project
it'll just work just great
now with that I'd like to hand it over
to Thomas oh I'm sorry I forgot one of
my slides and this is actually one that
I'm very excited about so sorry it turns
out there's of course cases where you
want to put stuff in the environment
where you can't just rely on the
environment variables that we set we set
for you and that is possible too
so in this example what I'm doing is I'm
on my command line writing firebase
functions config set and then I set some
secrets some API key some configuration
value that I like and it's there it runs
in my it appears in my server-side
environment I can load it in the same
way that I loaded the fire base
configuration environment so it's super
easy to access it's great if you are
deploying a new project you can clone
your environment configuration from the
one project to the other you do that
only when you're setting up the project
so you copy it across once you edit
whatever values need to be edited when
you set up a new project and now you
have a new environment that your code
can run it so if you're developing code
I highly recommend that you think to
yourself can I just clone this exact
code deploy it somewhere else and run it
that would be the goal all right with
that over to Thomas
thanks RJ that was definitely worth
covering in depth it's one of my
favorite features of the cloud functions
SDK for firebase so with the show of
hands how many of you have ever either
released software or deployed to
production okay that was about as many
as I expected how many of you were
stressed when you did this that's about
a hundred percent so this is actually
one of the most nerve-wracking parts of
our job and I find it absolutely crazy
how often we fight getting ourselves a
basic safety net and so there's an
obvious piece of advice that you'll see
all over the open-source community Adson
test so before we dive into how to test
cloud functions specifically I'm going
to take a very quick detour on how you
test JavaScript code generally since
that's what we use to tether to write
our cloud functions these are the node
modules we're going to be using in our
talk today so if you want to take a
quick picture you can look look them up
a bit more later so here's a very simple
unit test that tests the Fibonacci
sequence and we're using two different
tools here this part is mocha mocha is a
test runner it lets you define your test
Suites with the defined command and your
test cases with the it command you can
also define callbacks that should be run
before or after the whole test suite or
before after every test case then mocha
will give you a test runner that will
run all your tests and aggregate the
results a nice human readable summary
the one thing though good doesn't do
however is actually verify any behavior
in your app so for that we're going to
use a second tool chai we like using
chai for two reasons one like mocha it
helps you get very human readable tests
it reads like English so you can
understand your test as a contract for
the expectations in your code the other
reason is that chai is incredibly
extensible we're actually going to use
an extension to try later on in the talk
now once you've written your test I
highly recommend that you wire it up to
your package JSON
package.json supports a script field at
the top level of the file and there's a
well-known script called test you want
to do this that way you can just run npm
test because you may remember how your
tests are run but this is the industry
standard way of grabbing a random node
module and testing it and if you conform
to an industry standard people know how
to run your test if they know how to run
your test it's more likely that they
actually will so back to our regular
program let's talk about cloud functions
specifically so for many of you this may
be here release process you followed our
DS advice your code can be deployed
easily to a staging here now you have a
hacking party and try to break your app
and if you don't see anything your
rollout to production I at least hope
this is your your plan and not just this
part so if this is the way you release
your act if your needs are so complex
that you need to do a full system test I
can still help you automate that middle
step because it turns out the firebase
command-line tools are actually a node
module you can include them in your code
just like any other library so now we're
going to write a system test that
actually tests our staging environment
for a live HTTP function we'll use the
before hook to actually deploy the
current project to our staging gear next
we'll create an actual HTTP request that
is targeting our staging here we can
grab any off-the-shelf HTTP library and
send a real live request to real live
servers and then verify the actual HTTP
results so this is a very powerful tool
for the most complex of testing needs
but there are some downsides to this
because obviously if you're deploying to
production and talking to an external
server it's going to take a lot longer
for your test
so you should save the technique as a
last line of defense another drawback is
if you're actually targeting the staging
tier you can't have multiple people in
your team run your system-wide test all
at once they're going to collide with
each other so let's try to make this a
bit more advanced and go from a system
stuff to an integration test well it
turns out that just like the fire based
tools the code you write with cloud
functions to the library as well you
haven't written a whole life or a whole
binary you can import it inside your
test so here we've actually imported an
actual HTTP function from our cloud
functions code now you may not know this
but the thing you create with a cloud
function is actually a callable function
you can call it yourself so now instead
of creating a real live you know service
and running a real live Network request
we're going to use an extension to try
called chai HTTP with this we can give a
network response handler what your HTTP
functions are and it has created an
in-memory web service so now they can do
true HTTP level testing or here we're
doing a get request with a query
parameter against our actual cloud
function the whole function and still
verifying the result as an HTTP response
body now this is a great idea for
integration tests there is one small
problem though if you followed our date
advice this is your index AF at least
the start of it this line right here is
the special magic art I told you about
and as he said it doesn't depend on your
code it depends on a special environment
we create in production and the local
emulator which means that this is
actually going to throw an exception if
you run it in a unit test but we can add
another tool to our JavaScript tool belt
and solve that problem we're going to
use sign-on it's a very powerful tool
for creating mocks creating spies and
subbing different
mutations so first we're going to
include the firebase functions library
and then actually modify it we can
change the behavior so that functions up
config no longer depends on this
automatically created environment and
instead it returns a fake object now we
can run our integration tests so as a
quick aside some tips about these tools
sign-on or a similar library called NOC
are really really great for certain
cases I love using them to mock the
system clock in the firebase functions
SDK we have behavior that doesn't kick
in for a minute or so but with by using
sign-on we can fast forward the system
clock and test their behavior without
waiting a minute in our unit test you
can also use a spy to make sure that a
callback gets called and if you have a
dependency on an external service you
can use knock to mock the entire network
interface what I just showed you isn't
honestly the most powerful use of
sign-on though because we created a
side-effect in index AF and then worked
around it it's kind of strange because
if I create it another test suite I'm
going to have to add that same
boilerplate all over again and if I add
a new side-effect in index AF I'm going
to have to modify all those test Suites
and whenever you find yourself rewriting
the same code over and over again that
should be a code smell and you should
try to think about how to approach it
differently and that brings us to our
next mentality a singer code will get
reused if you see that code is being
copied and pasted in your codebase if
you break something and you find out you
have to fix the same fix several places
there is a solution for that look at how
you can make your code more modular so
let's rewrite our actual cloud function
so that it's more easy to test without
those side effects I recommend that you
treat your index AF like your main file
in traditional programming people don't
often test their main file instead the
main file is very simple boilerplate
that composes very very rigorously
tested libraries and so we can do that
here as well we're going to move the
logic of our Fibonacci function into a
library file and include it in index
drea inside our crowd function will call
this mathematical version of the
Fibonacci function now this mathematical
version is incredibly easy to unit test
you don't even need to create an
in-memory server which will save you a
lot of time in your unit test and then
there's this bit right here that seems
very coupled to the fact that we're
cloud function is that a lot we can do
but you're probably going to write this
over and over again in your other HTTP
functions so instead just make that
another library function and this has a
few benefits because now you know that
in your HTTP functions you have a
consistent rendering strategy and this
one library can be tested independently
and reused if this is your image AF I
wouldn't hold it against you if you
didn't unit test this because you can
now have very focused tests for
everything inside of it
this leads me to a few other tips and
how to create testable complex backends
try to make your index is so simple that
it has little to no conditions or loops
next try to make sure that you have no
Global's in any other file if you need a
global make it a parameter and your
utility method initialize it in index jf
and pass it in you will find that your
libraries are dramatically easier to
test I even recommend this when you're
doing things like the firebase admin SDK
don't the admin database in your live jf
take that from index at Jo
some other tips related to HTTP
functions you know in general you should
not be building libraries or cloud
function specific because you're going
to have a harder time testing them and
if you have something that's innately
coupled with the nature of HTTP make a
standalone library that you call within
your cloud function here's a more
complex example than fibonacci we have a
cloud function that is an API for
getting a user's order status we
obviously need to authenticate the user
but we don't need to do it in index dot
JSP can create a simple testable method
because it makes sense that this is tied
to HTTP you might accept a session token
based on you know cookies headers or
query strings but that doesn't mean it
has to pollute your global code now that
we have this nice isolated HTTP method
the retsoor business logic can be more
abstract or get query order status take
an authenticated user and we can
continue from there so I'd like to leave
you with a few more tips on how to
improve the quality of your code first
of all you should always lean on
industry standard methods or tools
because when you import these libraries
you're not just importing the dev code
you're importing their unit tests and
the best way to improve your code
quality is to write less of it if you
find that your code is getting more
complex and adding to the edge cases ask
yourself how you can try to narrow down
your scope and simplify your app so with
that I'm going to hand it off to Abe to
add a slightly personal touch to Talk
Thank You Thomas
so far we've been talking a lot about
code but this last section this last
assumption with the open source mines
that is more of a philosophy and more of
an idea about why you're writing code
and building things in the first place
so we want to assume we're doing things
for fun and I think the best way to
illustrate running a fun project is to
talk about an actual project that I've
been running for a couple of years this
project is called JPEG cool and JPEG dot
cool is the simplest service you could
run I started about two years ago and it
has a very simple functionality if you
put JPEGs are cool flash anything into
your browser it'll go and it'll find you
an image or an animated gif and it'll
return that to you so for example if a
you typed in JPEGs a cool
slash firebase logo it'll get you back
up firebase logo and it just returns
that as an image if you typed in JPEG
dark cool flash Google logo it'll get
you back this really complicated
animated gif of the Google logo is it's
not very consistent in what it returns
but it'll always get you something and
it's always kind of interesting here is
some other interesting ideas if you type
in fire chips you'll get a nice pretty
fire fire bass from last year's i/o or
firebase hot sauce try user names things
like that it'll just return some image
sometimes it's related sometimes it's
not but it's an interesting project so
with the open-source mindset over the
two years I've been running JPEG cool as
a side project I've got to learn the
really applied version of this mindset
and I can go through each of these
assumptions and see what they look like
for me in a real application so
assumption 1 assume others deploy your
code which I paid cool no one else has
ever deployed the code however with our
dart the JPEG full mindset I forget how
to deploy my code I don't remember
kubernetes commands very well I don't
remember how ISS aged into this box two
years ago to set this up so I don't
remember so I need to make my deploy
process optimize for that
then I assume my code gets reused the
core code base of JPEG cool hasn't
changed in two years however how I
deliver it to you has changed
dramatically in some cases it was
running on just a compute engine VM it
ran on a kubernetes cluster it's now
running entirely on firebase cloud
functions or Google cloud functions for
firebase this has moved around a bunch
but that code has stayed the same so
it's gotten reused a bunch of different
ways then assume it's your problem
people ping me when JPEG pool goes down
as a small service most of the users of
JPEG pool are my friends or family
co-workers people like that and these
people have no filter about bugging me
when it goes down I'll get calls and
text messages and everything whenever it
doesn't return an image and that's very
very annoying so if we assume I do this
for fun I'm not doing it for fun anymore
I'm sick of people pinging me
so we need to optimize for this we have
to come up with a situation where I can
stop thinking about my pesky users and I
can just have fun having the code
thinking about the actual problem and I
can always be ahead of my users so if
something does break in production or
there's some issue I can be aware of it
so first we need to be able to get code
out quickly this is step one we need to
make shipping JPEG cool as easy as
committing code so it's no kubernetes
commands we don't even want to think
about firebase deploy I do this with
JPEG cool VR service and continuous
integration firebase has built-in
continuous integration support so you
can generate a token and provide that to
a service if you're not familiar with
continuous integration this is the idea
that you have some external service
generally that knows how to deploy your
code you set up some rules and some
guidelines and it watches or get or
other repository and when you make a
change it runs it it tests it and it
ships it out to production so in other
words once I've set this up set up my
firebase deploy command in my continuous
integration environment I know that if I
commit to master in the JPEG file
repository about a minute later it'll be
shipped to production and that's all I
have to remember I'm not going to forget
how to use git so this works really
really well when I'm responding to
issues at 2:00 in the morning
this is part of a bigger narrative
though we don't just want to shift fast
we want to debug fast that helps
reacting fast but it doesn't really help
us debug what's wrong with the
application a JPEG cool doesn't serve up
an image it could be breaking in a bunch
of different spots so we need a way to
have a new level of insight into our
application while it's running in
production
this is stackdriver if you're used to
using Google Cloud or even parts of
firebase you may have heard of stack
driver that driver is Google cloud
solution to dealing with any any
problems related to insight of your
application so if you want to know
what's happening when your application
is running in Google cloud you'll want
to look at stack driver and this is
linked to in the Google Cloud console
it's not in the firebase console but if
you go into the Google cloud console
you'll see it in there and just about
every part of Google Cloud links out to
stack driver in some way your App Engine
astros data often this into stack driver
every every application and compute
engine will log out to stack driver it's
really deeply integrated so in terms of
knowing what's happening stack driver is
where we're going to want to look the
first and easiest solution or perceive
this use of stack driver is to let it
enhance consoled out log for us
obviously console dot log is the common
denominator when we're building code
it'll print out in my terminal on my PC
it'll print out in a log to a log file
on a server so this is the de facto
standard for knowing what's going on and
that's honestly kind of upsetting
because it's just a big stream of text
that's not that interesting this is what
it looks like
this is stack driver logging so these
are just console logs coming from my
application and you can see we have time
stamps we have the function in this case
it's request cool or fail cool and then
we have these crazy IDs and these crazy
IDs are actually individual invocation
so if we click on one of those stack
driver logging will automatically create
a filter that allows us to see the
invocation the lifecycle of that one
function call so we're not looking at a
bunch of sliced logs from different
functions overriding each other we can
step into one and we can figure out
exactly what's going on in this case I
can read that and see that somebody
types in JPEGs are cool slash crickets
and they got back some image
that one looks pretty good to me however
this is just the beginning
this is console dot log improved we can
go farther than that this inspector ever
error reporting and this is something
that's built-in when you deploy your
Google Cloud functions this is a way to
know anytime something throws an error
in your function in this case I have a
few different areas that have risen up
over time you know silly mistakes like
rest that on it's not a function or to
not read a property but these bubble up
and get caught by stackdriver reporting
if you want you can configure this to
send you a text message alert you on the
Google cloud mobile app different things
like that but it lets you know if
something is breaking in production that
you are aware of it if we click on one
of these we get a graph of how often
it's been happening when it was last
seen we get the sack trace we can step
into individual occurrences of this
issue we really get a whole new level of
insight without writing any code they're
not even in putting in SDK into your
JavaScript code this is just the
awesomeness that is the functions
environment this is a type of monitoring
that is very simple you're not doing
anything right you're not importing
special things you're not importing an
SDK but we can go farther we can
actually build custom metrics around
stackdriver and all the data that Google
Cloud throws in the stock driver to get
an even better idea of our service to
make sure we're confident that our
service is up now JPEG cool has a bunch
of functions like I said here are the
invocations of different functions so
here we see so cool we see a test
function called hello world being
executed and we have more down there
that aren't shown one of the most
important ones here that is down on that
list because it doesn't get invoked very
often is the cache cleaner job if you go
like me and download random animated
gifts and things off the internet and
throw them into a cloud storage bucket
like JPEG cool does you're going to find
that a lot of animated gifts are really
really big like hundred megabytes big if
you're just randomly grabbing them and
this is an issue if you're paying for
the service like I am so I don't want
those in there if no one's access to
this gift in two weeks but it's still
taking up 100 megabytes of storage I'm
going to go clean that out and so I do
that as a cron type job the cloud
function that just triggers every
day and it just cleans it out the
problem is if that function fails if
there's something in there that makes it
not succeed it doesn't get invoked
something happens wrong with the cron
process that's actually triggering it
I'm not going to know it's just going to
fail silently and it won't ever be
exposed to my users so I set up a custom
policy the daily cache cleaner job
policy and all this does is watches
invocations of that specific cache
cleaning function and says if it ever
doesn't get invoked for a given 24-hour
period
something's wrong and if it doesn't get
triggered we need to know about it
so that's exactly what this does this is
a couple of situations over the last two
months where our last few months where
this job hasn't gotten invoked it
happened on April 5th happen on March
21st just for whatever reason my job
didn't get invoked and as soon as this
happened as soon as it became started
failing it sent me a text message and
said hey your cron job is not working
anymore something's wrong that's great
but that's really only half of the
narrative here once this daily tasks
cache cleaner job got back healthy
excuse me once it was healthy again
I got another text saying hey the
situation has been resolved your
function is running well again and
everything's ok so the combination of
these checks a couple other monitoring
checks I have uptime checks with HTTP
pings things like that all set up in
fact driver monitoring I can be
incredibly confident that JK cool is
always up and if something goes down
I'll know about it before any of my
users and with that I'll hand it back to
RJ for some closing comments yes
Thank You Abe all right before we send
you back into the heat we thought we
quickly recap a few of the higher level
statements that we've made and the first
was the best practices take practice so
don't expect that in a world of cloud
functions of serverless that we've been
talking about we will have to completely
reinvent the wheel we will keep using
the best practices that we know and love
we just use new and maybe even better
tools to use those in our new world
secondly we would argue that you should
pay attention to how open source does
development even if you don't do open
source development because it helps you
write better code that is more robust
more reusable all that good stuff we
would like to invite you to meet us in
the sandbox that is right outside here
the tent that says firebase on it will
be there basically until IO closes if
you have any comments questions remarks
find us there we'd love to hear it and
here are some useful links in case you
are curious all of us work on cloud
functions and we would love for you to
take a look at our documentation play
with it and once again let us know if
you have any comments and if you'd like
to learn more about cloud functions
about firebase about the whole back end
as a service service world you should
check out our YouTube channel that is
youtube.com slash firebase with that
thank you so much
and feel free to follow us on Twitter
especially Abe is addicted he is very
entertaining so I hope to see you all
outside in in our tent and thank you so
much for being here see you next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
