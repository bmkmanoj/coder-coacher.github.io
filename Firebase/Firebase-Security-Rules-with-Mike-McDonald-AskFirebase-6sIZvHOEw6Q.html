welcome to ask firebase the weekly show
will be answer all of your firebase
questions I'm your host David East just
kidding
I'm not David my name is Mike McDonald
and I am an iOS developer and product
manager on firebase storage I like
building embedded hardware and long
walks on the beach this week on hashtag
ask firebase we're talking about the
firebase real time database and securing
your app from malicious intruders if
you're interested in more join me David
East Mike McDonald at the firebase
summit in Berlin on November 7th we will
talk about all of the exciting new
things the firebase team has been
working on see the link in the
description to learn more now on to our
first question
Ian from Twitter asks how different is
hashtag firebase from a no sequel DB
like MongoDB great question in there are
many different kinds of no sequel
databases you have key value stores like
Redis you have document collection
databases like Mongo you have columnar
stores like bigquery firebase real time
database is another kind of database
we're a JSON database we treat all of
your data like a big blob of JSON in the
sky design for syncing data back and
forth with lightning speed this means
it's super easy to integrate real time
data into your web or mobile app since
they probably already take JSON and the
firebase real time database is fully
hosted so you don't have to manage your
own servers administer a database or get
paged at 2:00 in the morning when it
goes down unfortunately it means that
some other aspects like complex queries
or aggregation aren't supported thanks
for the great question in we've had a
number of questions on security this
week so rune on twitter asks how to set
a rule to let users access only their
data but allow admins to see all data
great questions are in in your database
security rules you can write read rules
that and/or or different security
expressions together for instance one
expression can be allow a user to access
her data and another expression can be
allow all admins to access everyone's
data you can or those two expressions
and get the rule that you want if you
want to learn more take a look at our
database security rules doc linked in
the description below thanks Arun let's
take a look at the next question
one Carlos from Twitter wanted to know
what are the security risks of
publishing my API key how do I encrypt
or decrypt it in an angular open source
project well Juan Carlos you'll be happy
to know there aren't any risks and
there's no need to encrypt your
client-side code your API key is
basically just a friendly way of naming
which project you're using so we can go
ahead and route requests appropriately
it's like if you were to go and call
your friend except their name is a Iza
syc asdf some something-or-other I don't
know firebase authentication as well as
our back-end security measures like the
real-time database security rules and
firebase storage security rules are what
prevents unauthorized access to your
resources great question though thanks
Juan Carlos next question
loco alien on Twitter is wondering how
to prevent a user from a website based
on firebase to look at the source code
created in JavaScript from a web browser
well welcome to client-side programming
the problem with building a web app is
that anyone can right-click and view
source and see everything that you wrote
this is why it's generally a bad idea to
store keys or secrets in the app and
it's why Twitter user Juan Carlos was
worried however there is a tool that you
can use called a min a fire or an Uggla
fire which provides security through
obscurity since it makes your code
completely unreadable unfortunately
that's not a true tool for security you
want to rely on firebase authentication
and firebase security rules for
protecting against unauthorized access
it's a great question though thanks loco
alien moving right along
Dennis on Twitter is wondering if I
query with no filter will I get one only
contacts I'm whitelisted to read or to
all contacts well Dennis this depends on
your security rules as I said earlier
the real-time database is a JSON
database and when you query for your
data at a certain location you get all
of the data at and below that location
so you would get all of your contacts
it's important to know rules are not
filters a reed will either return all of
the results if the reed is allowed or
none of them if it's rejected that's
true whether you query with the filter
or without a filter
I'd recommend watching the key to
firebase security one of our popular i/o
videos for more on writing great
security rules thanks Dennis next up a
follow-up question from Dennis is there
a multi get function like equals
an array of numbers use-case getting
contacts that i'm whitelisted to read
well Dennis you'll want to arrange your
data in a way that you can perform a
single read and get all of the data that
you need imagine instead of maintaining
a full list of your contacts and
querying to get the ones associated with
you imagine flipping that around and
keeping a list of the contacts that you
own on your user object happy hacking
Dennis great questions this week
security is an important topic and I'm
glad people are interested in it when
you have more questions feel free to
reach out to us on Twitter Facebook
YouTube Stack Overflow our Google Group
we have a fax number at six five zero
six one oh that nevermind using the
hashtag ask firebase also make sure to
LIKE and subscribe so you can stay up to
date with the latest firebase content
and I hope to see you all in Berlin
welcome to fight attack take 16 another
question from Dennis if there's some
great questions this week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
