today's episode of fire cast we're going
to be covering firebase authentication
and just as a reminder to you this is
one of many episodes in a series on
firebase on the web where we cover
things like the real time database
firebase authentication firebase hosting
firebase storage pretty much firebase
everything for the web and we also cover
JavaScript frameworks so angular ember
react polymer you know all that good
stuff so if you want to see those
episodes make sure to hit the subscribe
button
but today we're covering firebase
authentication we're gonna go over how
to get everything set up in the firebase
console and then after that we're going
to build a little app that uses email
and password authentication so let's get
going so when you're working with
firebase authentication and the
JavaScript SDK you're going to be
working with in this off namespace which
returns to you all the auth methods you
need to log users in and today we're
going to be focusing on email and
password so to log a user in with email
and password we can call auth dot sign
in with email and password and as you
might have guessed it takes in an email
as well as a password and what this will
do is it will sign in an existing user
and return to you a promise where you
can resolve that user but let's say you
don't have a user and you want to create
an account well to do that you can
create user with email and password that
takes an email and a password and I
think you're starting to see a bit of a
pattern here and so what this will do is
it will go and create the user and it
will also log them in so just like
before with sign in with email and
password they both return promises which
allow you to asynchronously resolve the
users data but since it's a promise it
will only resolve one time so if you
want to monitor authentication state you
can use a different method for this and
that method is on off state changed
which takes in a callback and this
callback fires off every single time the
authentication state changes so whether
a user logs in or a user logs
that will trigger this callback function
so in the case that a user logs in this
firebase user parameter will be
populated with the current users
information but if the user logs out
this firebase user parameter will be
null so these are the main three methods
you need to know for working with email
and password authentication but to
practice them let's go and build a login
in sign up form so here I have a web app
with a couple HTML elements we have a
email text box a password text box a
login button
a sign-up button and a not seen log out
button because no one's logged in so we
shouldn't really present them the logout
button and all of these elements are
correspond over here in our HTML the
email text box the password text box our
login button sign up button and unseen
logout button and then down here is my
application code stored in my app j/s
file and if you're wondering worm
including the firebase SDK it's up here
in the header so I have some pretty
sweet web fonts and then also the 3.1
version of firebase Jas and yes of
course my own home-brewed styles right
here
so now let's kick this app off by
opening up the app j/s file so default
inside of app j/s I have configured my
firebase application so I have all my
configuration keys and then I just call
firebase dot initialize app and you can
find all this information in the
firebase console so the first thing I
want to do is I want to get all of these
elements that I referenced before into
the Dom so I'm going to get all these
elements with the magic of editing which
you can see is just everything we
referenced before email password login
sign up and log out so now that I have
all the Dom elements and once you first
attach a click event to this log in
button where I gather the email and the
password fields and then send them off
to firebase authentication to log in a
user so let's
add a little comment for that and I'll
grab the button so BTN login add
eventlistener
click and then provide the callback
function so inside of this callback
function I want to get my email and
password field so we'll grab the txt
email value and the password dot value
and I'm also going to store firebase
authenticity 'la States and then now I'm
going to sign in with sign in with email
and password and sign in with email and
password returns to me a promise which
allows me to resolve the user or I can
use this promise to catch any errors
that might happen and log them to the
console so essentially what's going to
happen here is I'm going to provide an
email and a password click this login
button and this will fire off the add
event listener function and then inside
of here will gather email and password
send them off to firebase authentication
and then if there's a user it'll log
them in if not we will catch that error
and log it to the console and I see that
I actually have a little typo right here
so I want to switch that from password
to pass so now I'm going to go and log
in a user so David at my supercool
emails calm with my super secret
password and when I log in you can see
we actually get an error and this error
says that the given sign-in provider is
disabled for this firebase project and
enable it in the firebase console so
let's go over to the firebase console to
see what this is all about so here in
the firebase console I'm in the
authentication tab and underneath here
I'm going to click on sign-in method and
you can see within sign in method that
we have this table of all of the sign-in
providers so email and password the one
we're using Google Facebook Twitter
github in my personal favorite anonymous
and what you might notice is is that
under status all of these are disabled
and what this means is that we can't use
them so to enable them we can go over
here and
click this pencil and then enable so now
I'm going to go and refresh this page
and I'm going to try another one David
out whatever emails comm and when I log
in we get another error and this error
says that there is no user record
corresponding to this account which
makes sense because we don't have any
users so how are we supposed to log
anyone in so let's fix that by attaching
event to the signup button so back in
our app I'm going to add a click event
for the signup button so BTN signup dot
add event listener click with a callback
function and then now inside of this
callback function I'm going to do
something really similar to what's going
on inside of login because essentially
all we're doing here is we're getting
the email the password and then we're
calling sign in with email and password
and checking for any errors and we can
really do the same thing inside of here
but rather than call sign in with email
and password we can just call create
user with email and password so let's
just copy and paste all this code and
then now change sign in to create user
so one thing you might be wondering is
is how do we know that this value right
here is an actual email well we don't
and on the client that is up to us to
validate that because firebase
authentication just assumes the input
you send to it is an email or whatever
that you want to pass back to it and
it's lenient and leaves that up to you
so like a good developer we are we're
just going to leave a little to-do note
check for real email ok so now I've done
that I'm going to log in with a very
real email and with my password and then
when I click sign up nothing happens and
we don't see anything because while we
are checking for errors we are not
actually resolving the user so on this
promise I could use the dot then method
to resolve the user and then log them to
the console but this promise will only
fire off one time which leaves me in the
dark for any authentication state
changes
so rather than using dot then I want to
use a real-time authentication listener
so using fir based auth dot on auth
state changed I can pass through a
callback function and this will let me
know every single time the
authentication state changes so this
fire based user parameter could contain
a populated firebase user or it could be
null if we're not logged in so inside of
here I'm going to write an if statement
to check for the user so if the user
exists let's log them to the console
otherwise log a little message of not
logged in so now when i refresh the page
you can see that we have the user logged
to the console so I can go and open up
this user and if I scroll down you can
see that the same email is the one we
use to create the user so now we've
given the users the ability to log in
and sign up but when they're logged in
we'd like to show them a log out button
so they can click that and log out you
can see down here in our HTML I have
this button of BTN logout and by default
we have this high class on it which sets
it's displayed to none so I'm going to
go back to my app j/s and add a click
event to be able to log out when that
button is clicked so I'm going to tap
into it's BTN log out add event listener
click with this callback function now
inside of this callback function I'm
going to call firebase auth dot sign out
and this will sign out the currently
authenticated user so now my log out
button will work when it's clicked on
but we can't see it so what we could do
is inside of this on off state change
listener we can check to see if we want
to display the button if the user is
logged in so if the user is logged in
we're going to get into the class list
of BTN logout and we're going to remove
the hidden class and if they are not
logged in we want to add that so now
when we refresh the page we can see that
we have our nice logged out button and
that we are
logged-in and if i go and click the
logged up button you can see down to the
console we log the message of not logged
in which means we logged X so that's
pretty much everything you need to know
to get started with firebase
authentication and if you like this
video make sure to hit that like button
and subscribe and also if you want to
learn more about firebase authentication
like using Twitter Facebook Google
github off then you can check out our
documentation which the links are in the
description but before I head out I want
to see what you all are using for
firebase authentication like what
provider do you want to use and what
kind of apps are you're building and
that's all but I'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
