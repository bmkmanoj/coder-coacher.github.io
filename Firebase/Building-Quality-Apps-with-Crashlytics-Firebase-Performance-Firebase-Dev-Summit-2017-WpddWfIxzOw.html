being here super excited to be back in
Amsterdam I love the city my name is Ali
I'm product manager on firebase
performance monitoring and in a few
minutes I'm gonna be joined by Jason
who's product manager on crashlytics and
together we work on app quality and
firebase it is a subject that we deeply
care about we work on it very hard and
we think is highly correlated with user
satisfaction and overall a more
successful business and we believe that
because we've seen the data we've seen
that 50% of one-star reviews in the Play
Store has something to do with stability
in bugs and on the other hand 60% of
five-star five-star reviews make a
mention of speed design or usability so
your end users really feel it when your
experience is performant and is stable
and because of that we've been working
hard building a number of tools that
help you with your app quality and these
tools span across different stages of
your development lifecycle starting with
the test and development stage we build
test lab for Android which helps you
keep a pulse on things like stability
and performance before you get out into
the wild and then once you ship your app
into the wild and you have real users
using your app we have tools such as
performance monitoring and crashlytics
that allow that allow you to understand
the end user experience in production
now hopefully you got the chance to
check out the talk given earlier today
by Justin and Doug about building
quality games this talks a bit about
test lab and other app quality tools if
you haven't check it out on YouTube but
in this talk here we're gonna be
focusing on three things we'll talk a
bit about performance monitoring we'll
talk about it a bit about crashlytics
and share some exciting news there and
we'll also share with you seven tips to
maximize your app quality so let's start
with performance this year at i/o we
were super excited to announce firebase
performance in beta for both Android and
iOS is an SDK that allows you to
understand how your app performs from
the point of view of your
users it does things such as
automatically collect data about your
network activity and I've short
durations but it also allows you to
custom instrument things specific to
your app and then for all this data that
is collected we built a beautiful
console that allows you to visualize the
data so that was a few months ago and
ever since then we've been absolutely
amazed at the reception that firebase
performance has had today just a few
months after we're processing as many as
thirty billion daily performance events
that are collected from over 200 million
app installs and we have apps from all
over the world from India to the
Americas to Europe we couldn't be more
excited about it and we thank you so
much for the great feedback and
enthusiasm that we've had so let's talk
a bit about what you want to have in a
performance monitoring tool we think
that there's two categories of issues
that every app developer should be
concerned with the first category of
performance issues has to do with on
device performance this is things like
how smoothly your app renders how
efficiently you load your resources such
as files specifically images and so on
and for that we build this feature
called traces and traces are basically
records of performance they are
performance reports between two points
in your app and it could be any two
points it could be the time between a
user taps on an item until they see the
details page it could be as short as a
database fetch or as long as an entire
checkout flow it's really up to you all
you need to do is create a performance
trace object give it a name like
checkout flow to represent that action
start it and stop it and when you do
that you get automatically the trace
duration reported in the console so you
can effectively use these traces as
timers but it's not just timers as much
more than that because you get to also
attach custom metrics to it using our
counter API so you can count things like
how many times you drop the frame during
a trace or how many times you made a
call to the local disk and so on so you
really understand the full picture on
performance on the device between two
points so that's the first category the
second category is about network
activity between your app
and the back is that it uses and for
that we automatically monitor for you
HTTP and HTTPS requests from the time
they're sent from your app until they're
received and we'll keep an eye on
metrics like response time upload and
download payload size as well as success
rate so will tell you things like how
often requests come back with a 400 or
500 ok so let's see what all that looks
like in the console so I'm gonna show
you here is the out-of-the-box
experience this is things that you see
in the console just by installing the
SDK without writing any code so I'm in
my brand-new firebase console I have the
stability section expanded here and I
have performance selected and the first
thing I see is the dashboard tab which
gives me high-level data from both
network requests and traces so the first
card here shows me a list of
automatically instrumented traces that
includes things like a trace for a
background session and the foreground
session as well as app start and as you
know AB star duration is one of the most
important metrics that a an app
developer must optimize for next here is
seen on the network's success rate over
the last 30 days so you can keep an eye
on failures when they happen and how bad
they are the third card here is about
network response latency so it's a world
heat map of latencies based on countries
so here I have my app offered in the US
in Canada and that's fine
India on the other hand has a higher
network latency this is something we can
investigate a bit later on next to get a
breakdown of network volume by mime type
so you understand where that your data
usage is going and finally you get a
breakdown of app start durations by app
version now here you see something
interesting you can see that version 1.0
the latest version of released has a
much higher estar duration than the rest
as a matter of fact if you scroll over
here you can see that the 95th
percentile so almost the worst case
scenario for it goes is up as seven
seconds which is far far far from ideal
now this gives me a strong indication
that something went wrong in this app
version but often when you investigate
something like this you want to
understand if this issue can be
attributed to any other factors
and that's what I can do by clicking on
the details page here now I'm looking at
a start duration broken down by multiple
attributes including a version like we
saw earlier but also by devices here for
example I can see that the iPhone 6 has
a higher absurd duration than the rest
of the devices but that's kind of
expected it's a slower device because
it's older and I can see other
breakdowns like which countries the
users were in which OS levels they were
on and so on and I can see here that
nothing else stands out so now with a
higher degree of confidence I know that
the issue that I have with apps are
duration is correct is directly
correlated with the latest version that
I have and I can go to fix it so this is
a lot of powerful information that you
get just by installing the SDK all right
so that was a little bit about
performance monitoring what I'm gonna do
now is hand it over to Jason and he's
gonna tell us all about crashlytics
Jason
thanks Ali
all right since you heard earlier today
we've been working hard to bring the
best of both fabric and firebase
together and that's why today we're
extremely excited to announce the
firebase crashlytics is now available to
all firebase developers so if you're an
existing firebase developer we recommend
you test out crashlytics and upgrade and
if you're an existing fabric user you're
all set for now and we'll let you know
soon how you can take advantage of
crashlytics from within firebase well
let's talk a little bit about what that
means for crashlytics to be available in
firebase because as many of you know
crashlytics is the market leader for
crash reporting used by hundreds of
thousands developers in hundreds of
thousands of applications and installed
on over 2.5 billion devices but what
we're able to do now is bring
crashlytics into one unified console so
it can truly work better together with
all the firebase other fighter based
products that you know and love and
you've heard some examples of that today
and while doing that we made sure to
keep the install process amazingly
simple so whether you're using great on
Android cocoa pods and iOS you want to
install the SDK manually you can use
your existing Google services file and
get up and running in a matter of
minutes just like any other firebase SDK
and something that we're particularly
proud of is while we were building
firebase crashlytics we did a bunch of
usability testing and alpha testing with
developers like yourself and got
feedback on how we could really refine
the user experience you could get in and
solve stability issues even faster so
that's something we're particularly
proud of but before we dive too deep
into the features of crashlytics let's
remind ourselves why crashing 14
solution like crashlytics exists so this
is an example of a crash that ali sent
me he was in Boston visiting me a couple
weeks ago we were practicing our talk he
was searching for burgers in Boston and
apparently he only gets expensive
burgers and right when you're at the key
moment of this filtering to try to get
the results app crashes obviously not
ideal so as a developer I want to get to
the bottom of this and before using a
crash reporting solution like
crashlytics
you might be staring at something like
this so if you actually know how to plug
your phone into your Mac and find where
they hide this crash report in Xcode
you're going to be looking at an
unscented stack trace if you
look really close you can see that at
least my app code is in there you still
can't do anything with this it's still
just nonsensical memory addresses what
you really want is a crash reporting
tool they can take that crash along with
all the other crashes that are happening
in the wild group them prioritize them
give you an idea how your app is doing
stability wise release over release and
one great measure of that is looking at
your crash free user statistic so we
have a lot of customers who use this as
a key performance indicator to know if
their apps are getting more stable or
less stable release over release and all
these crashes we get that we prioritize
them into what we call issues and issues
are ranked by the number of times
they're occurring and the number of
devices they're occurring on and you can
clearly see here the line of code that
crashed the file name and we'll even do
things like call out interesting bits of
information like maybe this crash is
only occurring on iOS 11 so maybe that's
indicative of something changing and the
latest release may be a deprecated API
that you're not supposed to be using
anymore well let you know that maybe
this crash is only occurring on rooted
or jailbroken devices that could
indicate that someone's using your app
in a way that you didn't intend so maybe
you don't want to fix this crash just a
couple quick things there to like really
help you know that just to get a better
idea of what I mean what you're gonna be
into solving this crash now diving even
deeper you'll see that you get this
issue detailed page so now you can see
the full now symbolic ated or unobvious
cated or Optus get it on a few skated
stack trace you'll see how the crash has
been trending version by version are you
increasing in is the crack is your is
this issue getting worse is this issue
getting better you can see an operating
system device breakdown and the console
isn't the only place you can find out
about crashes will alert you real-time
via email the second and new issue
arises so you're gonna have peace of
mind whether you're out grabbing a beer
a couple of coffee that we got your back
we'll let you know when a new issue
arises not only new issues but also
regressed issues so if you close an
issue you think you're all good and then
we see that pop up on a new version will
let you know immediately about that and
there's one alert we think you should
pay extra close attention to and this is
what we call velocity alerts and
velocity alerts are when one issue is
causing assist a statistically
significant portion
of all sessions to crash so this may
indicate that you need to issue a hotfix
right away or rollback because something
really wrong is happening with your
application and you get all this out of
the box
this was crash reporting and also some
of the stuff that I'll walk through with
performance monitoring but we really
wanted to talk through today is ways by
which you invest a little more time in
your upfront setup and ways that you can
use crashlytics and performance
monitoring along with other firebase
tools you can really maximize your app
quality so we have seven tips for that
start with crashlytics but before you do
that let's remind ourselves the crash
that all you experienced he was
searching for burgers in Boston the
expensive ones and then he crashes now
if I'm lucky I may be able to look at
the stack trace see the line of code
that crashed and know exactly how to fix
that but if I don't I'm gonna want to
reproduce that crash and a great way to
retrace the user steps is with custom
logs so from the issue detail page you
can see the logs tab and diving into
that this is the order of operations
that ollie walk through in a session
everything from when the splash game
reloaded all the way up to when he
tapped a filter view in the app crashed
so if I actually can't figure out how he
got himself in that situation because I
don't understand I can go look through
custom logs and try to recreate the
steps that he took and you actually saw
example this earlier today in in the
talk earlier in the goldmine application
now a great feature that firebase crash
reporting had actually this is a code
example so this is actually the example
of how to log custom logs and
crashlytics simple one-line this is
where I'm logging the filter button
tapped on my button action and then this
is what I wanted to mention so a great
feature that firebase crash reporting
had was called breadcrumbs and
breadcrumbs are a lot like custom logs
except for you get them for free with
analytics so this is a great feature
that crashlytics is going to be
implementing soon so if your existing
firebase crash reporting user it'll be
coming soon to crash looks as well now
sometimes it's not just about the order
of operations that causes the crash it's
actually the context that the user is in
you could imagine maybe it's the size of
the file they have
trying to upload may be so many items
they have in their shopping cart the
level they are on a game in our case
it's actually what they're trying to
filter for what they're trying to search
for and particularly the expensive price
category so if I scroll through a bunch
of sessions I can see the other keys and
values are changing but price remains
constant so for some reason when users
are trying to search for the three
dollar sign level of restaurants that's
what's causing the crash so I know that
I need to go debug my application and
figure out what about that data my app
isn't handling specifically for that and
as I mentioned keys are just key value
pairs so here's an example from the
friendly eats application where I'm
recording the key and value for all the
items in the picker view so those are
two ways that you can really debug
tricky issues but occasionally what you
want to do is you want to kick off a
workflow before the debugging even
starts or for a really particularly
critical party or application and now
with crashlytics starting today being an
event source for firebase functions you
can do that so let's walk through an
example so imagine you have a purchase
flow or something really critical in
your application that you really really
want to monitor it specifically and kick
off a workflow around and in our case
and friendly eats it's actually our in
new reviews that's a new feature we just
launched we hope it's gonna drive a
bunch of engagement so we have a team
standing by to make sure that nothing's
going wrong there so when I see a new
issue in the new reviews view controller
I wrote a function to am on
automatically send that issue to a slack
room you can send it to email or
anything else that you can do with
functions we're a team of developers are
waiting by to solve that very
specifically and you could imagine the
use case where maybe I'm a be testing
this new feature so it's not at the top
of my list but I know it's really really
critical so why don't I want to make
sure someone's standing by to pay
attention to this even if it's not my
top two or three or four or five crash
and this is an example of what it looks
like in slack so you can see the new new
crash was detected in the reviews page
so we're going to dive into that crash
and go directly into firebase
crashlytics and figure out what's going
on and here's here's how you actually
use that there's a function where I'm
registering a new function
called new review crash that's going to
get executed when we see something in
that view controller and if so we're
gonna forward it to slack with the
message new crash detected in the review
page so there's another this is just
another example of how these two
platforms are getting better together
from day one
so crashlytics as an event source or
firebase functions so debugging crashes
is great well it would be even cooler as
if you could prevent crashes before they
even happen now it sounds like a lofty
goal but there is one tip I recommend
you try and that is listening for the
fact that a user's crashed in the
previous launch of your application and
you could do something like say you're
sorry but even more practically what you
may want to do is clear out any cache
data that you have for that user because
there could be a user this in this state
that every time they launch your app
you're trying to access something that's
corrupt that you have in cache and it's
causing them to be in a perpetually
crashing situation so this is a great
tip if you think your app may be able to
take use of this to make sure that you
set your user up for success from the
start if you detect that the crash in
the previous session so these are a few
tips with crashlytics and how do you can
really can maximize maximize the most
out of crash reporting what I'm gonna do
now is turn it back over to Ollie and
he's going to walk through some ways
that you can get the most out of
performance monitoring
thanks Jason
so moving on to the performance side of
things
a great tip we have for you is that you
should monitor all your network activity
in one place and to consider why this is
important keep in mind that we used to
typically build apps that were more or
less with more or less stuck to their
own back-end and that's pretty easy a
minor what what we're seeing these days
more and more is that app developers
include a lot of third-party SDKs into
their app now each one of these
third-party SDKs would come with their
own back-end so understanding network
performance from the perspective of your
user requires that you understand how
all of these backends behave and that is
something you can do with a performance
monitoring tool so let's see how this
can be done using firebase performance
I'm gonna go ahead and switch back to
the console here and if you remember the
last time we took a look at the
dashboard page we saw that there is a
high network latency in India so here I
see a median overall of seven seconds
almost I'm gonna go ahead and switch to
the network request tab and take a look
at what I see here so the first thing I
see is a list of URL patterns and URL
patterns are basically aggregations of
common urls so we'll take urls that
appear frequently that are sent or
requested from your app that will have
dynamic ideas like say a user ID which
strip tease away and we will collapse
them into a common pattern and this
gives you a better way of looking at
meaningful stats so here you can see a
call to a third-party analytics service
there's an image service to fetch images
product details and so on you also see a
couple of warning badges the first one
here is for the image service and if I
hover over it it tells me that this
particular image service has a median of
more than two seconds as a matter of
fact I can see here it's five seconds
now we saw that India has a higher
Network latency in than the rest of the
countries and one thing that I want to
do is see if that problem is
concentrated in the image service so I
can go ahead and click on filter select
country select India and now filter all
this data specifically for Indian users
and now I see that the mean
in response for the image service in
India is almost 20 seconds and every
other service seems to be fine so now I
know that this problem that I have in
India with Network latency is
concentrated in the image service okay
so that's one problem the other one if I
hover over the other warning badge
complains about the checkout service
having a success rate lower than 90% so
I'm gonna click on it to see further
details here I see a few metrics
associated with the checkout service
things like response time in payload
sizes but what I want to look at is
success rate which in this case is
almost 88% obviously that's an ideal if
I click on View more not only do I get a
breakdown by different attributes of
this metric like we saw with a start
duration but I also get a breakdown of
the error codes that come back so I can
see that the majority of my failures for
this particular service is 500 errors
with some 503 s 502 s another 400 errors
but clearly the problem is concentrated
in 500 errors and that's something that
I can address on my server so that's one
data point but I can further refine it
with another data point using these
attributes so I can take a look through
them to see if anything stands out and
indeed I see that the count the country
break down here tells me that I have a
success rate that is almost perfect for
the u.s. in Canada but in India I have a
zero percent success rate so now I know
that not only do I have a 500 error but
it's also something that is appearing in
India specifically and that's a lot of
information for me to get started on
fixing this networking issue and that is
something that you can do consistently
across all your back-end services
whether is something that you hosts on
yours on your own or something that is
used by a third-party SDK in your app
all right next tip firebase performance
is a great companion for Android Varro's
so if you've published an app recently
to the Play Store you probably noticed
the brand new Android vital section and
this is a section that gives you a lot
of great data on your crashes your ANR's
and also on your performance data and
you might have seen something like this
where play tells you that you have slow
rendering and/or for
and frames in your app in this case slow
rendering talks about when frames take
more than 16 milliseconds and frozen
frames is when frames take more than 700
milliseconds so you have an experience
where the app appears frozen for almost
a second and no one wants that obviously
basically what this says is that your
app has slow rendering this is important
information for every development
developer to have but typically the
follow-up questions that we get when
developers hear information like this is
where in my app does this happen what is
the context which activity does it take
place in or even more granular which
action and that's exactly the kind of
thing you can use firebase performance
for so in this scenario let's imagine
that you have three activities in your
app that are animation heavy and you
want to understand and analyze which one
of these has the biggest rendering
issues in the activity class you can
instantiate a couple of objects first of
all you instantiate a traced a
performance trace and you would also
instantiate a frame matter a frame
metrics aggregator object this is a
class that Android gives you to allow
you to collect frame data and then in
the onstart method you would activate
both of these objects so you start the
trace and you start collecting frames
data and in the on stop you would do a
couple of things within your performance
trace you would add three counters one
for the total number of frames one for
the number of slow frames and another
for the number of frozen frames and then
you would iterate through the frames
data that you collected throughout the
trace and every time you see a frame
that takes more than 16 milliseconds you
would increment the slow frames counter
every time you see a frame that takes
more than 700 milliseconds you would
increment the frozen frames counter and
you stop the trace now the next time you
go back to the console and you click on
the traces tab first of all you would
see a number of new traces other than
ones that are automatically instrumented
in this case the three activities that
we instrumented using the code that we
just saw
if I click on say the Browse activity in
addition to the duration cards I see new
cards here for the counters that I added
that tell me the median and the general
distribu
of the total number of frames as well as
slow frames and frozen frames so now I
can compare the proportion of slow and
frozen frames to the total number to
understand the rendering performance of
this activity and I can do it across all
the other activities as well to
understand the culprit where is my
rendering issue taking place so this way
you understand and discover the issues
performance issues in android vitals on
a high level and then use firebase
performance to dig into the issue and
get to the bottom of the solution also
pretty soon we're going to be adding the
capability to break down any of these
metrics in the console by app version so
you're gonna see cars that look like
this and allow you to easily identify if
you have a regression in a certain app
version on a specific metric out of
these metrics finally wherever it makes
sense
you should always consider using remote
config to tweet performance on the fly
if you have an user mode config it's the
service that allows you to set config
parameters in the firebase console and
push these out to your end users without
having to push an app update and it
turns out this is quite useful for
tweaking performance a very good example
of this is tweaking caching logic if
you've ever worked on caching before you
know that one of the decisions that you
have to make up front is the cache size
how big is the cache how much
information am I gonna save locally on
the front on the device right and this
is an important decision because you
want optimize it for a couple of things
first of all you want to optimize it for
all your end-users out there and this is
a difficult thing to do because you have
a lot of users with a lot of end devices
or a lot of device models and so on and
finding the optimal value is not an easy
thing there's another problem with this
as well is let's say you start with some
value and later on you figure out
another value that is more optimal now
you have to actually update your code to
push an app update wait for users to
pick up the update it's just not that
practical instead what you can do is
have the cache size value read from a
remote config for ammeter and then in
your caching logic you would drag that
logic around with a tree
so you can start a trace called image
fetch and then after the caching logic
you would stop the trace and within the
logic itself every time you find an
image on the device otherwise you have a
hit that cache hit you would increment
the counter for that and any time you
don't find the image on the device you
have to fetch it from the backend you
increment the counter for cache misses
now before pushing your app into
production you would go back to the
console and this time I'm gonna start
with a remote config console and I'm
gonna go ahead and add my first
parameter here I'm gonna call it cache
size and I'm gonna start with the value
of zero which basically means no caching
right I'm gonna add the parameter
publish the changes and now I'll head
back to performance after I've pushed my
new app version I'll click on traces and
I can see this you newly instrumented
three is called image fetch I'm gonna
click on it and as I expected I have
counters for cache hits and cache misses
and I have zero cache hits because my
cache size is zero right okay so now I
head back to remote config I would add
this value and now give it a value of 20
