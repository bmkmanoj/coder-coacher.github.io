am a group product manager at Google and
I lead mobile app analytics I can hardly
believe that it's already been a year
since we stood on a stage not too far
from here in introduced firebase
Google's integrated app developer
platform and with it we launched
firebase analytics are all new apps
first analytics platform that we built
from the ground up to be completely free
and completely unlimited and since last
year analytics remains a key investment
area not just for firebase but for
Google as a whole and at Google we take
a unified approach to our measurement
solutions and so to underscore that for
all of our users we wanted to formally
introduce you all to our new name and
that's Google Analytics for firebase so
Google Analytics is of course the most
used digital analytic solution in the
world and we think with our new name
we're going to make it clear to all of
our customers web app and otherwise that
we're building towards a unified
solution and now while our name is
changing our commitment to app
developers and app analytics remains
unchanged and we fully appreciate that
the challenges that the developer
community faces is their daunting and in
our many ways very unique let's take a
look at some of them so building a
successful app and with it a successful
business is really hard finding a way to
make that process repeatable is even
harder it's really really hard but as
Google we believe that good data is
often the key to unlocking that type of
success but for developers you also know
that even having access to good quality
data is in itself really hard so the
amount of time that people spend on
mobile devices I don't need to tell you
this is just staggering
and then of the time spent on mobile
over 85% of it is spent engaging with
apps and that usage and turn throws off
just a ton of data
and very few tools are available to
actually help developers capture all
that particularly tools that are within
reach of developing businesses but if
you could assume for a second that you
had a tool that would help you collect
all that data
you then have to be able to find trends
that are responsible for your successes
and your failures and even if you're
able to spot those trends it's not good
enough to just have simple understanding
and a vacuum you need to be able to use
that data in all the places that you
care about and take action and drive
your business forward and these are
exactly the type of challenges that
we're building Google Analytics for
firebase to help you solve so today
we're going to talk about Google
Analytics for firebase from three
slightly different angles first I'm
going to step us through what we see is
the core of our analytics offering then
I'm going to have Steve come up and join
us and he's going to talk about some
exciting enhancements we're introducing
today to our reporting capabilities and
then finally Krista is going to come up
and she's going to talk about growth
strategies and how you can use our cross
network attribution solutions to really
drive your business forward so turning
to our core when we approached Google
Analytics for firebase we built a
solution to be completely free and
completely unlimited even for the
largest of apps so now you have the
opportunity to understand all of your
data without compromise and this
includes all of your raw event data all
accessible and all for free but what's
more though is analytics works simply by
adding firebase to your app analytics is
just set up automatically and right out
of the box you get access to the most
important signals and you have all that
information summarized for you at your
fingertips so let's take a look at that
so this is our app dashboard it provides
summaries of all your key data points
and then has drill ins for deeper
analysis throughout the product so I'm
going to step through and zoom in on
some of these cards quickly the first
right at the top is helping you
understand key engagement metrics this
is active users card so here we're
zoomed in it has daily weekly monthly
active users like all of our line plots
it has a comparison to the previous
period and it quickly summarizes user
engagement
then when you look at a different
definition of user engagement you're
able to see how much time your customers
are spending actually engaged with your
app and ideally that engagement is
turning into revenue and so here on the
average revenue card
we're summarizing average revenue per
user also prepaid user again broken out
by the same daily weekly and monthly
summaries for many apps that monetize
effectively they're using in-app
purchases in-app purchase is an event
that's able to be captured automatically
both on iOS and on Android and the IOT
summary card summarizes your top
transactions and then has a drill in
link for more detailed reporting to
drive successful businesses particularly
those built around IEP user acquisition
strategy is key and that's where cross
network attribution comes in and you're
able to use the cross network
attribution summary to understand your
best performing channels and how those
channels are turning into lifetime value
with a deep link to the full report and
what's the point of acquiring users if
you can't keep them and that's what
you're seeing here in the cohort summary
Kristin is going to come up and talk
about these techniques a bit more in
just a few minutes switching gears a
little and moving down the dashboard
you're also going to find device and app
info so here you're looking at the app
versions card this is the devices card
and it summarizes the model of advice
along with OS information and then this
last set of cards gives you more insight
into your users here we're looking at
location information and then by
sprinkling in some Google proprietary
data you're seeing age and gender
information and then lastly interest
category information so all great data
quickly summarized for your users it's
great that all of this works out of the
box and is automatic but you're not
limited to the automatic event we built
Google Analytics for firebase to be
highly extensible so you can track up to
500 distinct events each with 25
different parameters and log those
events on a complete unlimited basis if
you don't know what to track we go so
far as to
suggest different types of events to you
based on the different types of apps
that you might have it's a great way to
jumpstart your implementation but it
also helps you understand even more
deeply around these behaviors because
many of these events feature first-class
reporting it's great to have it all
brought together and summarized all your
data but what's the point of having it
in a silo you need to have it available
to you in all the places where you care
about and so Google Analytics for
firebase is of course at home in the
firebase console it's just where many of
you know and expect it to live it's also
available in the Google Analytics UI and
so this way all of the users across your
organization can have access to the same
analytics capabilities in whatever
product they're most familiar with but
that's not all your analytics data is
also available for you in cloud
messaging
both to understand what's happening and
to use for targeting the same is true
for remote config your analytics data
works with crash reporting to help you
understand engagement patterns that
might be leading to crashes and it can
be used natively with cloud functions
cross network attribution in analytics
works in a complimentary way with
dynamic links and for enterprise
customers analytics works across the
Google Analytics 360 suite one of the
ways that it works with the 360 suite is
through Google tag manager tag manager
lets you remotely configure the event
measurement from your app from a web UI
you can modify events you're already
tracking you can have one event fire in
response to another event and you can
even send your event data to other
destinations not just at Google but with
also our tag template partners including
kochava and Thun and many others and
then simply by linking firebase to
AdWords your analytics data is available
for you to use for conversion tracking
and actually use as a signal to drive
all of your app related campaigns and so
while this equips you with the start of
the right data in many of the places
where you need it like I said it's
really just the start of the right data
so with that I'm going to invite Steve
up on stage and he's going to showcase
some of our latest announcements related
to reporting Steve Nikki thank dress
good afternoon Google i/o my name is
Steve Gannon and I'm the product manager
on analytics before coming to Google I
actually spent almost 20 years
developing video games and I launched
about 30 titles in that time frame let
me tell you there's nothing more
exciting than launching a game now that
you get you work on this thing for
months or perhaps years to get it ready
and it starts to come together and
become fun and then you finally get to
the point where you're ready to put it
out there in front of your real users
and press and get that feedback you've
been looking for and I know a lot of you
can relate with launching your own
products last year right here at Google
i/o when we launched firebase I got that
same thrill that same buzz and since
then I've had the opportunity to speak
with many of you at events like this on
social media
good old Stack Overflow and sometimes
directly over email and I've gotten a
chance to help some of you understand
your reports but also to get your
feedback on what's working well in the
product and what we can do to improve it
for you and if I could categorize your
feedback it would generally fall on
these two themes first would be that you
really want deeper reporting and you
want real-time features and I'm excited
to tell you that we have some pretty
huge improvements in both of these areas
that I'm going to tell you about today
first what do I mean by deeper reporting
I mean that type of reporting that
better helps you better understand how
users are behaving and performing in
your apps and also the type of reporting
that helps you understand how your app
business is performing sometimes this is
a matter of Google connecting dots for
you by augmenting your data with other
data that Google has and sometimes it's
just a matter of surfacing data that
you're already collecting in more
insightful ways and one feature that's a
perfect blend and showcase for both of
these things is our brand new
integration with AdMob now you may have
heard since we talked about this in the
keynote just preceding this but this
integration finally allows data to flow
between the two platforms and goes a
long way towards us enabling deeper
according for those 1 plus million apps
that are using AdMob today you see
showing an ad in your app isn't as
simple as a binary decision anymore
there's lots of decisions to make
there's a decision of what primary
network to use what mediated networks to
use what formats where to place your ads
refresh rates how to render native ads
and if you're using reward to that how
much reward to give to your users and
beyond that showing an ad in your app
isn't something you do in a vacuum this
is a sacrifice of the real estate of
your app and you need to make sure that
as you're earning revenue you're not
sacrificing the user experience or else
you might win the revenue battle and
lose the overall user engagement and
retention war you need to pick the right
winning strategy for your app and
analytics can help you measure that
winning strategy but first you need to
get your AdMob data into analytics and
that's exactly what we've done for you
with this integration it's entirely
automatic just by dropping into
supported versions of our SDKs into your
app will automatically bring AdMob
impressions and click into AdMob not
just our sorry into analytics not just
for AdMob but for any networks that you
mediate through AdMob as well and
because we have this direct integration
with AdMob we can also pull your AdMob
revenue into analytics and factor it
into key business performance indicators
like average revenue per user and the
LTV of your ad campaigns so now you have
an overall overall revenue metrics that
take into account both your purchase
revenue and your ads revenue and you can
go deeper with this in addition to
showing you these metrics you can break
it down in a number of ways we let you
break them down by ad unit ad format ad
source and also by screen because we
know where these ads are being shown in
your app we can help you understand
which screens are performing better in
terms of your ad revenue and because all
of this is happening at the event level
this data that we're bringing it from
AdMob you can go even a step further and
apply your audience filters and user
property filters to understand how ad
performance differ
among different segments of your user
base that's especially important when
trying to build a winning strategy for
your app for advertising because then
you can they be test and understand how
different strategies actually perform
now we've given some of you early access
to this and some of the feedback that's
come back it's been incredibly
encouraging konnichi connect
co-president of beat where the games be
works games had one of Hibiscus said if
this integration has completely changed
the way we think about game design and
monetization and we hope it can do the
same for you as well help you
fundamentally think about what your ads
strategy should be since now you can
really measure it and understand not
just the impact on the revenue but also
on user engagement and retention so
needless to say we're really excited to
get this in your hand if you're
interested in trying this out it's
available today just check out our Help
Center article for more information and
you can check out the reports as well in
our demo project for firebase which is
available on the firebase console
through the link explore demo project
and you can see this reporting in action
for a real app we also have a dedication
entirely dedicated to this on Friday
that you definitely should check out
called AdMob and firebase better
together by continuing with the theme of
deeper reporting I want to touch on
something that you've been really vocal
about since launch last year and it
revolves around event parameters so
events are the data points of analytics
you log events to tell us what's
happening in your app what actions users
are taking and you associate parameters
with them to contextualize those events
so it's not just that a purchase
occurred but you can tell us what
product was purchased as the rest
mentioned our API is extensible though
and you can tell us
you can log custom events that are
correspond to specific features that you
have in your app and attach parameters
to those as well and although you can
use those events and parameters those
custom events and parameters in audience
definitions reporting around the values
of those parameters has historically
been related only to those suggested
events that we prescribed for different
business verticals that russ showed you
well you've been very vocal about the
need to see reporting on those parameter
values in analytics and so today I'm
excited to tell you that we actually
made that available to you now we're
launching custom parameter reporting in
analytics so alright so next time you
and this is available now you don't need
a new SDK for it if you just go to your
event detail report in analytics you'll
see this prompt to add event parameters
that you want to be reporting on now you
can register up to 50 of your most
important event parameters typically
you'll send us either a number or a text
parameter and here's what you'll get out
of that when you send us a number we'll
produce both a sum metric and an average
metric there's different use cases for
both of those so if you pass in this
case I'm showing a screen where for a
product purchase I want to show some
metric of the product value so I have a
high-level view of how much money I'm
making through these purchases compared
to the last period it's pretty simple
and easy to understand but it doesn't
have to be revenue related you can do
this to track any high-level kiba's key
performance indicators in your app so
for example if you have a music
streaming app you want to measure what's
the total amount of time the users are
spending listening to music or watching
video or if you have a travel app and
you want to see how much how far your
users are traveling you can measure that
as well or and we compare it against the
previous period so you can filter this
as well and see how it differs among the
different segments of your user base
additionally we also supply it with an
average metric pictured here is a event
from my game called level n where I
logged the total score looking at the
average here plotted against the
previous period I can see what the
average scores are for users who are
playing my game and I find the average
one to be actually especially insightful
I'll have to see what you come up with
but some really common things you can
use this for really useful questions you
can answer are things like on average
how many friends does the user have when
they make their first post in my social
network on average how much time does a
user spend in my app before they make
their first purchase how far our users
at
are traveling in their morning jog and
now it's a cinch to get those answers in
analytics just by registering those
numeric parameters additionally you're
also passing up text parameters here is
another example from my app it's a game
it's a skateboarding game and users are
unlocking various achievements and now I
can get a breakdown of the most popular
achievements that they're lost they're
their unlocking and grab them against
each other to see what the popularity
and distributions like now you can use
this in your app to see things like what
are the most pot what's the most popular
content or what are the most popular
search terms and also on what screens
are certain actions taking place and
again as I mentioned with all analytics
reports you can then filter these
reports by your audience segments and
user properties to see how behavior is
different among the different segments
of your user base because it will be and
the better you understand that the more
tailored you can make your app
experience and your app updates to serve
their serve your audience I'm personally
very excited about this one it's
something I wanted in my own apps and so
I'm anxious to put it in your hands so
you can give it a shot to again this is
available today you don't need a new SDK
for it so you may have noticed as I
mentioned screens a couple of times both
in the context of the AdMob integration
and also with regards to custom
parameter reporting that's because now
we started tracking screens
automatically for you so what we'll do
here is screen as you just transition
from screen to screen there's a couple
of things we do for you the first is
that signal of transition we log a new
event called screen view for you but
identifies the screen that you're going
to as well as the screen you came from
secondly this is context wherever we can
as an analytics project we want to
augment your reporting by adding context
to your events so for example we add
demographics locations and interest data
so you know better who is using your app
now we've added screens into the mix so
you know you have a net sense of where
certain actions are taking place in your
app now this enables us to produce
actually a new report on the dashboard
which breaks down user engagement in
your app by screen now you can see where
users are spending time in your app what
are the most popular screen
there and again you can segment this to
get down to the lower grain trends and
now I can't talk about deeper reporting
without at least
touching on data studio last year late
last year we launched our beta reports
of our report templates for data studio
and this data studio is an often product
that showcases what's possible when you
link your firebase app to bigquery
because it visualizes your raw data and
allows you to fully customize your own
dashboard using that raw data produce
the metrics you care about in the order
you care about and share them with the
rest of your organization not I'm going
to give you a walkthrough of this and a
bit using my own app so you can see what
in action now a common theme here has
been the use of context to better
understand that action and another place
that one place that's especially
important to understand that context is
in regard to a recent launch from our
friends over at Android that's Android
instant apps the android instant app
experience is seamless it combines the
accessibility of a website with the rich
user experience of a native app and
because it's so different it stands to
reason that users will actually behave
differently in the instant app and
that's kind of the point right but in
terms of measurement of instant apps you
need three things the first is that you
need a high level overview across your
internet and installed app of what's the
user performance and behavior is like so
you can track your KPI and understand
from a business point of view how you're
doing but you need the ability also to
distinguish between instant app behavior
and install that behavior so that you
can understand such a new technology you
need to understand how in snap behavior
is different for your users as well and
thirdly it's very common for users to
graduate from an instant app to the
installed app and when they do you want
to make sure that you're measuring that
person as a single user rather than two
completely disjoint users in all three
of these ways we've thought ahead for
you in analytics can support you in all
these use cases we've put together a
developer guide to help you think about
how you ought to measure instant apps
and you can check that out and if you're
thinking a building an internet for your
own business just know that firebase has
you covered there okay so that covers
for the deeper reporting section now
I'll move on to the real-time reporting
section Google Analytics launched its
real-time reporting almost six years ago
and it was way ahead of its time it
really sets the standard for real-time
reporting and so when we set out to
build our own real-time reports in
Google Analytics for firebase we already
know that users how users love to view
these reports knowing what your
end-users are up to in your app is
inspiring and it's insightful and it's
also critical this real-time nature of
it for validation and for debugging your
app so we wanted to set out to build
reporting that satisfied all these same
use cases and so earlier this year we
launched a series of reports to do so
starting with stream view stream view
gives you a real-time view of your
analytics data as we collect it and it's
not just fast it's rich it's dynamic and
it's surprisingly deep you get event
location detail down to the city level
and event data down to the parameter
level and as you're exploring and try to
understand how these how your users are
behaving you can actually apply these as
filters to find out for example what are
users in San Francisco buying or where
are the top players in the world located
you can apply user property filter to
get at that to see the individual
journey of a user stream or user
snapshots can deliver you that users
Maps it's like a virtual focus test we
visualize the stream of events coming
from a single device along a timeline
and so as you're following this it's
like you're following a user's
progression through your app I mentioned
it's like a virtual focus test anyone
who's administered a focus test knows
that invariably your users use your
product differently than you think they
do and you're going to learn something I
mentioned before about how we log a
screen view event automatically for you
you'll see that show up here and the
sequence of screen view events actually
identifies the users path through the
app you can see the events that
long there and even the crashes that
that are logged if you've integrated
crash reporting you'll also see ad
impressions and clicks show up here now
through our AdMob integration we realize
this interface is also ideal for
debugging that's why we built debug view
on top of it as well as an app developer
myself I know how critically important
it is to instrument your app right the
first time if you make mistakes and
you're tracking and you release that app
version it will be haunting you for ever
sending polluted data into your
analytics and there's no way to get it
rid of it so we wanted to build a tool
that helps you to validate it and get it
right and ensure that your data is going
to be pristine after you launch your app
debug view lets you log the events in
real time for your development devices
let you examine every single event every
parameter you're sending every user
property as it changes and if there are
any errors in your tracking we don't
hide those we actually log an error
event or parameter along with the
necessary details and links to Help
Center articles to help you address that
and validate it before you launch the
feedback on all of this real-time
reporting has been awesome so far as an
analytics PM you don't often get to
build something that actually inspires
emotions so when you know that you do or
when you do you know you've done
something special and this one on the
top middle I don't know if you you can
read it is actually my favorite and it
says my next child will be called debug
view and I love that because that you
know I named it so I think it's a
beautiful name and right now my
daughter's relieved at home because
she's not named debugged you Ghanem but
anyway you can see that the feedback has
been exceptional but some of you have
told us that you actually need access to
the underlying real-time data from the
real-time reports and so we've made that
possible through our integration with
bigquery now because the bigquery
question comes up all the time and a lot
of you have questions about how it works
I'll walk you through the process of
linking the bigquery using it and
showing you how you can lay your data
studio on top of that so can we switch
to the video or to the demo please
okay so here I'm in my firebase console
and I go to my project settings which is
where I'm at now and this is for my my
own game project and you can choose here
to link to bigquery here is where you
have to enter your your billing
information mine's already here so I
choose to continue and now I can met I
can look at the links to my datasets
going over to look at my dataset here
you can see I have one data set for my
Android app one for my iOS app each of
them has daily tables with full of data
so I have 469 days worth of data in one
in my android data set but also this
intraday data set intraday meaning these
are the events that we've received
throughout today right up until right
now so I have users or login events in
my app right now there's being sent in
real-time from our back end over to this
bigquery data set and I can run queries
on it this is a simple one just to see
the list of names of events and you can
get that a pretty simple one but you can
imagine that you can export this data
visualize that combine it with your own
whatever you need what I want to show
you a better way perhaps for those of
you who have ideas for how you want to
visualize it but maybe not the
availability or the technical chops in
sequel that's why we built our data
studio integration we built hand-built
three pages of reports here to help you
go deeper with your analytics data and
you can either hand built by analytics
and data studio PMS as I mentioned and
you can apply multiple filters all at
once
to go deeper with this so for example
I'm going to apply here a level end
filter event filter and maybe if I want
to know what level is my users are
playing I can apply that I see the
breakdown of the school and the rooftops
level maybe I want to know what city's
users are playing rooftops because
that's my advanced level no tell me
where my power users are I can see that
Sal Paulo is actually extremely popular
which isn't surprising if you know
anything about the skateboarding culture
but here's how easy it is to customize
it and click on that I can say maybe I
don't want event someone account of user
I don't want city I want to look at my
app versions and tables are so boring I
want a pie chart and then I want to
change this to AB version and just like
that I've customized it and I can share
it with ref so how hard I work to
produce this form so it's that easy a
lot of you have questions about how
expensive is this how much is typically
working with raw data is expensive what
data studio is entirely free unlimited
number of reports a number of sharing
customization and of course it queries
your bigquery data but bigquery has
historically offered one terabyte per
month free tier it's extremely generous
for some apps it would be really hard to
use that all up in a month
but today bigquery has also launched a
10 gigabyte per month free storage tier
making this just ridiculously cheap and
affordable to work with your raw data so
I have to highly encourage you to do so
alright go back to the slides so that
was a lot of stuff I know we covered but
actually that's not all we're up to so I
want invite krysta to the stage to tell
you more
krysta thank you Steve
so my name is Kristy Sidon and I am also
a product manager on Google Analytics
for firebase so we've just heard some
Steve's about a ton of awesome new
features they've just been released in
Google Analytics for firebase I don't
know about you but I'm really excited by
a lot of these so now let's look at how
you can use a lot of these new features
along with some of our core product
functionality help you drive growth and
attribution for your businesses now once
you've built and launched your apps you
want to pay close attention to your
analytics data to understand how your
app is being used you also want to
understand the source of the traffic
driving users to your app and to
determine your highest value networks
and campaigns for conversion events such
as first opens in-app purchases and more
an important way to determine who your
best users are is by understanding their
post-install behavior with conversion
events so considered what the drivers
for your business are out of the box we
must first open and not purchase as
conversion events but every business is
different every business is unique and
you're going to have different events
that might be meaningful for your
business so it would encourage you to go
ahead and mark those events as
conversion events in the UI to unlock
attribution reporting on those events
for example you might decide that
something like an app update is a really
good signal of user engagement with your
app and so you might want to mark app
updates as a conversion event to unlock
attribution reporting on ads update by
doing so you'll have further visibility
into the various ad networks - running
campaigns on by seeing which campaigns
are leading to more engaged higher value
users simply put conversion events allow
you to focus on the most valuable events
and users and determine your high value
campaigns driving engagement in your app
now that we've covered the basics on
understanding how users are finding your
app and what they're doing in there
I want to talk to you about attribution
so we have built several integrations to
help you grow with a single SDK
first up universal app campaigns so you
cannot have a successful mobile app
business without having a successful
growth strategy and you need to answer
two questions to execute on that
successful growth strategy first who are
the best customers for your app and
second where do you find them which
media channels are most effective at
finding these customers and getting them
to install and use your app and that can
be complex so we've built universal app
campaigns or UAC
to help you reach people across multiple
billion user properties including Google
Play search YouTube Gmail and millions
of apps and sites across the Display
Network
all you have to do is tell us the app
you'd like to promote the price you're
willing to pay per install and a few
more bits of information like the ad
text your videos and your assets and UAC
will then do the work by using machine
learning to deliver the maximum number
of installs at the price that you've
specified and UAC is now even better
AdWords has launched the ability to
optimize for higher value installs this
means that you're not just optimizing
for the number of installs but also for
the post install events such as in-app
purchase that you've specified as
conversion events through firebase now
UAC is an incredible feature in AdWords
that we know will help you bring a lot
of high value users to your app but
let's say that you're a large market or
a large developer and you manage by ABS
programmatically using the double-click
digital marketing suite that's why I'm
really excited to announce that today we
have a new integration with several
quick digital marketing and this is in
beta as of today
now firebase tracks install and post
install events can easily be imported
back into DDMS as conversions this means
that large advertisers can seamlessly
integrate firebase to their overall
programmatic buying measurement and
optimization needs using double hook but
we know that you're not just advertising
with AdWords in double-click and that's
why we are continually investing in
growing our third party advertising
network today I'm excited to announce
that we have over 50 ad network partners
and we're continuing to invest in this
area we've invested in integrating with
all of these different pieces to help
you advertise across platforms allowing
data from all of these to come together
in the same platform to help you make
solid decisions on the data that you're
collecting simply put we're creating a
single source of cross network
attribution truth
now that we've covered attribution let's
focus on using your analytics data to
drive growth let's look at a case study
who is call is an app the axes and types
of caller ID and their service model is
a bit more passive than most because
they're actually reliant on the
frequency for which users are getting
calls so instead of focusing on
something like retention rate as their
most important metric uninstall rate has
become the most critical metric for
whose call so the hoos call team started
using Google Analytics for firebase to
log the removal of apps automatically
and with bigquery they were able to
easily analyze that data in depth they
soon realized that they had a first-day
uninstall rate of almost 70 percent that
is really bad so armed with this data
the who's called teams focused on
improving the process of onboarding by
running a bunch of a/b tests on getting
people to accept permissions and keep
the app and what they were finally able
to do was reduce that first day
uninstall rate by 14% and increase the
retention rate by 6% to sum this up they
said that using firebase we were able to
consolidate and measure important
metrics within a unified platform it
relieves the burden of data analysis and
allows us to take action where it really
counts I think that this is a really
really great example of using your
analytics data to actually drive growth
and that data will help you to not only
understand where your users are coming
from but will give you insights into
their behavior in your app now you've
been focused on growing your high-value
users and now you want to retain them
using Google Analytics for firebase you
can identify these high-value audiences
and send these audiences for
reengagement campaigns you can also use
these audiences across other areas of
firebase specifically to target them in
cloud messaging and remote config
recently we launched a couple of updates
to these targeting options first logical
audience
nations such as includes olives or
includes at least four notes for example
you could create you can target
audiences that contain at least one of
purchasers lifetime value greater than
zero or high-scoring users with an offer
for free character in your app to
incentivize them to come back
second you can now target using user
properties in cloud messaging and remote
config for example this screenshot shows
a user property condition named high
level users and this is users who are at
or above level 20 in your app now debs
can use this to customize the app
experience for users of different skill
levels are we by leveraging remote
configs this allows you to get much more
granular and specific with your
targeting options to reach the users
that you're interested in so I've talked
about several ways to understand your
user behavior drive growth and
attribution with new integrations and
expanded functionality I hope that
you'll give some of it a try with that
I'm going to hand it back over to rest
thanks Krista thanks Krista
so we covered a lot of ground today we
introduce you to our new name Google
Analytics for firebase we looked at the
core of analytics and the enhancements
we've made to it and then Christa took
us through how you can use attribution
to drive your growth strategies but we
really do hope that this session was the
start of a conversation and to keep that
conversation going there's a number of
other firebase sessions happening
throughout the rest of i/o I'd
particularly like to highlight the
session Steve mentioned earlier the
AdMob and firebase better together
session that's happening Friday morning
at 8:30 would hope you guys would all
come and check that out if you have
questions just want to engage with us
personally we're going to be at the
firebase sandbox so you can find us
there and we'd love to hear all your
thoughts with that on behalf of the
Google Analytics for firebase team thank
you all for coming out and enjoy the
rest of i/o take</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
