firebase test lab team and we are here
in the ask firebase lounge at the
firebase summit in Berlin so Ali and I
just gave a talk on application quality
my name is Ali I'm product manager on
crash reporting I think the pure
interest from developers so far
everybody came with a specific question
it was in hi can you tell me a bit about
cross recording or test lab or whatever
it was people that tried the product
they liked it they hit some use case and
they wanted to know more about it they
wanted to know best practices or whether
a feature is coming soon and you know
that that shows how much interest there
was it's encouraging for us and it helps
us shape the direction going forward we
did some announcements together we
poured on the crash reporting side we
announced Analytics integration we
announced a new workflow for how to
close a particular crash notifications
on the test lab side we a lot we
announced zero cost testing free testing
available as part of the free tier
within five days we also talked about
the espresso test recorder which is a
way of very easily creating
instrumentation tests by simply
interacting with your app it's so cool
it's something that really will
revolutionize how people create tests so
that's that was very exciting with a lot
of good feedback from that certainly
with espresso test recorder i would just
download android studio to dot to wear
it under a special test for is now GA
and it's available on the run in the run
menu you can just say run espresso
record test and as far as I and our
documentation online for Tesla crash
reporting yeah absolutely for people
that want to learn more about crash
reporting the documentation site is a
great place to start and if you want to
get a feel for the console check out the
firebase demo project is public I think
it was mentioned today in the keynote
you just enroll yourself in a group and
within a couple of minutes you'll have
access to see what the console looks
like and it's gonna have real data for
cross reporting that you can see so you
can experiment what kind of analysis you
can make for a specific error and get a
context on a specific cluster of errors
so it's really useful to get
sending other products so for people who
want to learn more about espresso test
recorder they can download Android
studio version 2 dot to wear a special
test recorder has gone GA it's on the
run menu run record espresso test for
test lab and uploading tests and the
free tier this is all a part of our
documentation which you can find on the
documentation site
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
