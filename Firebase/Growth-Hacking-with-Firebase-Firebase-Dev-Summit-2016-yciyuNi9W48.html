how firebase guides you through the
steps of building an app test it make
sure it's solid grow your user base and
make some money
so in this session we will focus on
those products in firebase they'll help
you acquiring users and keep them
engaged so they keep coming back into
your app and ask for more so I'm here
with Lawrence I'm Lawrence I'm a
developer advocate on the firebase
platform and I'm your demo monkey for
the day and I'm Francisco one of the
engineering leads and firebase and I
believe you have quite a few live demos
so what can go wrong
yeah I'm sure they're gonna work line it
up so growth hacking and it's a term
that you've probably heard and one of
those terms that you could ask a hundred
people what growth hacking means when
you get a hundred different answers so
we decided to be very academic about it
and do lots of really deep research and
come up with the most authoritative
source that we could find Wikipedia
Wikipedia and wikipedia defines growth
hacking is this it's a process of rapid
experimentation across different
marketing channels and product
development to identify the most
effective and efficient ways to grow a
business so with that in mind we took a
look at growth hacking and what did we
get so it boils down to the fact that we
think growth growth hacking is main
three main areas one is experimentation
we believe it's it's very important to
be able to react to what users like and
don't like and this is key to acquiring
users and to retain them and then the
next one is like building your user base
and there's two ways that you build a
user base one is directly of course
let's marketing directly to your users
through social media through advertising
and all those kind of things but perhaps
more importantly is indirectly where
your users become advocates on your
behalf and then sorry yes that's the
experimentation so I know you guys but
when I see lawrence coding building apps
it doesn't really quite get them right
the first time so one thing you can do
it it's build app publishing in some app
store a Play Store and then you use the
loaded give some feedback and then you
can go back update your app create a new
version
update it to the store and maybe
using updated and back and forth this
has a lot of churn and you might lose
use it along the way so a good way to do
this a better way to do this would be to
be able to change variables on on the
fly from a caller console and so we
build this product called remote config
that lets you do that so when you close
your app you can set some variables that
will lock and unlock certain code paths
and it you can change the values of
these variables and apply to different
sets of users in parallel and you can
apply this through things we call
conditions so for example based on
language or country or operating system
version but we also hooked it with
analytics so you can select by user
behavior so a classic example I use for
remote configures if your app has some
purchase lets users buy something you
want experiment what gives you better
conversion rate so you have a button
that says buy maybe you wanna try it
with get or try and you want different
colors and once you get that eye formula
so you got the best conversion now you
can apply user behavior and say well I
want to give some discount to those
users that ever bought something my app
and maybe in the past two months and I
want to do like 20% try to lure them in
but for those that bought a week ago I
still want to give some discount but
maybe not as much we can say 10% for
those ones but I'm blabbing and talking
a lot let's say let's see a good demo
yeah it's one of those things that's
really useful the remote configures the
fact that you you can decouple your
application from some of the variables
that I used to host it
so I'm just gonna give a brief demo of
an application that I've been written
writing and it's a game and this game is
one that's location-based so it's like a
party game where you know you can set up
any three locations in the world and
your users then you assign a code to
those three locations and then if you
give that code to your friends and
they've downloaded the game then they'll
be guided through this story where
they're interacting with this character
and this character is lost and she's
she's trapped in a parallel dimension
and she like you know you got to go to
all these locations and play games and
augmented reality to rescue her so I
walked around Berlin yesterday and I
picked a few locations in Berlin and so
I'm entering the the game called Berlin
and I'm starting the game
and we'll see now that the game do we
have sound so like you know that was she
was just saying hello hello is there
anybody out there and there's a button
saying I'm here so if I do that then the
character will start talking to us and
we still can't hear her can you hear
that the character you'll hear it in a
moment is like when I first wrote the
game I wrote it for the US market and
this character was speaking in English
and so one of the most popular markets
for this type of game is in the Far East
in Asia and in Korea and I tested this
game when the Korean market and one of
the things that you know from the point
of view of Av testing that remote config
was able to help me with was that if I
set a variable on the server side that
says this is the language that the
character is going to speak you know
instead of me shipping multiple
characters with multiple languages I can
decouple it all from my application and
I can use remote conflicts they do an
a/b test by setting up say 50% of users
in Korea will hear it in English and 50%
of users in Korea will hear it in in
Korean so here you can see I have my
firebase console open and I've set up
this analytic that says hey if you're in
Korea make the Perth make the language
Korean for everybody else make the
language like USA so should be speaking
in English but in in remote configure
things such as conditions so for example
here for the random condition I could
say that you know if they're users in a
random percentile less than 50% then I
can change the value to a different
amount but just for the purposes of
demos I'm just going to override it now
and I'm gonna say the default value
would be Korean I'm going to update that
and then I'm going to publish the
changes and these changes as it says
they're going to be immediately
available after all my apps and users so
once I publish that if I relaunch the
game and if audio is working if we can
switch back to the tablet please and
let's see if audio is working I'm gonna
pick the game to be in Berlin whoops
let's say ok and here we go and let's
see if we can hear her there's no audio
he's working under my feet as we speak
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna unplug it
don't worry about the audio and I'm
gonna hold it up here and you know you
will skip we'll skip come see me
afterwards if you want to see this this
this works beautifully in rehearsal but
it's not working today but the whole
idea of remote config is by using a
server-side variable and that
server-side variable can be driven by
analytics I can change the behavior of
my application without shipping a new
version of the application in this case
had it been working you would be able to
see the character switching languages
between English and Korean maybe it's a
good thing because I don't know what
she's saying in Korean and she might be
saying something I don't want you guys
to hear so so next up that was
experimentation and the next thing is
talking about building a user base with
firebase so there's a number of
different ways that you can build the
user base with firebase as I mentioned
before there's direct and there's
indirect no an indirect way of doing it
is by having your users become advocates
on your behalf now one of the things for
me is that I have this awesome 15 year
old son who spends way too much time in
the Play Store looking at games
exploring games downloading them
installing them seeing if they're any
good and if they are he shares them with
me if they're not he just deletes them
right away now not everybody is
fortunate enough to have an awesome 15
year old son like I do and as a result
it's like how are you going to discover
games you've probably gonna discover
through word of mouth through friends
and those kind of things as well now if
you're a developer if you were able to
drop in app invites into your
application what would happen is if my
son downloads your game and starts
playing with it instead of him calling
me up and describing the game and
telling me the name and where I could
find it in the App Store and all those
kind of things I he'll just send me a
link an email or SMS and I can install
the game directly off of that but more
than that it's also really really
intelligent
so because Play Store knows that I
install games that he shares with me
what would happen is if he was trying to
share a game with me I would be right at
the top of his list so it'll be it's a
very smart list that's generated for you
there's a lot of AI goes into this so
instead of it being like an alphabetical
list of your contacts you know I will be
at the very top of his list and his mom
who says he spends way too much time
playing games would be right at the
bottom of the list so this is how app
invites works it's a widget that you can
drop into your app very simple to use
and very powerful so that your users can
advocate your app on your behalf and
it's built on a technology called
dynamic links and dynamic links are
really interesting in that there are a
lot more than just a URL they are a URL
that can maintain the context of a
session you know throughout that entire
session now that that probably sounds a
little bit complex so it's I like to
illustrate it with a scenario and the
scenario is like I really like to eat as
it probably shows and I'm a terrible
terrible terrible cook I've poisoned
myself cooking so it's not another good
thing when I cook so but I like to eat
and I discover recipes and I'm fortunate
enough to have a wife who's a fabulous
cook now how many of you have had a
scenario such as this one where you're
looking at something an app like in my
case of recipe and like I call my wife
and say hey Rebecca yeah yeah you know
that recipe for lasagna yeah it's in the
recipe app yeah the one written by
Francesco yeah the one with like the
weird surfer dude on the icon so it's
yeah that's the one yeah yeah what you
mean is 500 of those in the Play Store
no no the one with the yeah Francesca's
one yeah that's the one yeah ok can you
download it and then I wait like 10
minutes until it downloads and then 10
minutes later what was the recipe again
I can't remember how many of you have
had that that happens all the time to me
those kind of things but if Francesco in
building his recipe app had put dynamic
links into it then from this from this
lasagna recipe I could just touch on it
to share it my wife Rebecca would get a
link to the app in the store and then
she would download it from the store and
launch it directly into the into the
lasagna recipe that I wanted to share
that I wanted her to know about and you
know my wife is a really really smart
woman and even she has trouble with
these kind of things right so that's
dynamic links and then finally if you
want to reach your users directly we
have Adwords and the idea behind Adwords
and firebase is that AdWords give you
the concept of having an intelligence
spend so that you can set your budget
for how much you want to advertise your
app to end users and it also has the
intelligence to advertise your apps or
the relevant end users so if you're
building for example a an app for I
don't know for like baby care and things
about babies you know your app isn't
going to have baby diapers advertise to
people who are consuming sports or
consuming games those kind of things you
can set up campaigns you can set up that
intelligence
and and you can have the relevant
content serve to users who are very
likely to install your app spread across
all of Google properties such as YouTube
Google Play search and other apps like
that so those are some of the
technologies in firebase for growing
your user base and Francesco can you
tell us about those for engaging your
user base and now today we have a big
user base we want to make sure that
users keep on using our apps there are
stats this shows that around 23 25
percent of users just use the app only
once and then abandon it so we have a
few tools that help you with that the
first one is app indexing which index
the applications on your device so if
you open the Google Search app on your
phone and you look in that example the
recipe app then it's gonna show up in
the results so if you forgot that you
had it because you never use it the time
you need it and it's show up again and
then you become a user how many of you
have built an app and you've done the
marketing campaign behind it and you've
gotten tons of installs of your app and
then those installs drop off after week
2 or 3 and you look at activity in your
app and even after a few weeks it's
dropped off and hardly anybody's using
your app it's dropped into their app
drawer and forgotten about right and a
very powerful tool to get users back
into your app is obviously notifications
notifications is it's quite intrusive is
that thing that makes all of us pick the
phones out of the pocket and check if
there's something actually important so
it shouldn't be abused and users tends
to silence notifications or uninstall
the app if they get a little feeling
that getting spamming so we built this
tool in firebase which is a console you
either helps you target the right users
at the right moment with your
notifications you can compose messages
and select time when to send it even
scheduled in the future and select the
time zone of the device and then it can
target your users based on all those
things that we talked before with remote
config so for example operating system
type language version and of course
analytics so you can still target those
users that made an inner purchase but in
the past two months maybe not in the
last week and also we tied it with
analytics so you have a final analysis
so you can see what happens to your
campaign in real time you can see how
many messages have been sent so far how
many have been received by the users
might have been acted upon so that's
your goal and you can see how successful
it's been your campaign so far with
notification with we focused on the
power of this tool but also making it
really really simple
is that simple to call notification it's
really simple to code notifications and
I can step through it so you know here's
a quick look at it what you'd have to do
in iOS it's a ton of work as you can see
and but Todd and Johnny are going to be
talking about notifications and cloud
messaging in iOS in the next session so
I'm going to just skip over to Android
and I don't about you I remember always
hearing that the best developers are the
ones who write the least code so I took
that to heart and try write as little
code as possible and so if I want to
build an application that has
notifications in it this is a much code
I need to write it's it's a lot right
it's can well thankfully they don't pay
us by lines of code that we actually
write so all you have to do in an
android application in your build our
Gradle file is just compile in the fire
based messaging library and it's as
simple as that so like let me show you
what that looks like in action if we can
switch to their tablet doesn't it need
sound is there no this one doesn't need
Sam thankfully the sound demos done so
thanks I used to do a thing that if my
demos failed and I was in another
country I would sing a song from that
country but I didn't learn a German song
for no sorry I can't do it but if this
application looks familiar this is what
happens if you go to Android studio and
you just say file new and give me a
single activity application that's it
that's all that I've done here and I've
added that one line of code that we
spoke about so I'm going to just take
this application put it in the
background and switch over to my laptop
and on my laptop now I'm in the firebase
notifications console and I'm going to
like send a message so I just clicked on
that button to send a message and I'm
gonna pick I'm gonna pick the entire
user population of this app I could use
analytics to filter them but given that
the entire user population of this app
is 1 and that's me I'm just gonna pick
all of them and then I'm going to enter
a message and you know I've given this
demo before and people thought nah that
can't work because you're you've
probably faked something you've probably
like predefined a message so I'm gonna
ask the audience like if you guys give
me a message to send but we need to put
a bit of structure on it you know
because I don't want people just
shouting out stuff at random so say hey
we're in Germany and apparently Germany
you guys are really good at football
right you're like number two in the
world behind Ireland is
that correct so let's pick a football
like the Champions League is going on
give me a team that's gonna win the
Champions League Dortmund
I heard Dortmund thank goodness I was
worried somebody would say Borussia
mÃ¶nchengladbach and there's no way I'm
typing that so I'm gonna type Dortmund
for the win you know something like that
and then I'm gonna scroll down and click
send message and if we can switch back
to the tablet so here you can see my
tablet and look carefully in the upper
left-hand corner if I just move this
over a bit I'm gonna click send and you
should see a notification appearing and
there it is the notification has
appeared my app was in the background
and if I swipe down you should see it
says Dortmund for the win it's kind of
hard to see on this screen if I move it
up a little bit you might see it when
the autofocus kick saying now trust me
it says Dortmund for the win
and when I touch that my application
will relaunch right so it's a really
simple application that I built I wrote
no code whatsoever you know I just
linked that one line in from the
firebase messaging library and then when
I send from the notifications console I
actually get it rendering in my
application and allows me to reengage my
application so if we can switch the
slides for a second so that was a really
simple one my app was in the background
and it allows me to reengage with my
users by you know sending them a
notification so when they touch on the
notification the app gets relaunched
that's a little bit primitive and you
might want to do a little bit more
intelligent whether you want the app
maybe to be running in the foreground so
that you don't have to have it in the
background or you might want to be able
to do something with the notification so
for example metadata that's in that
notification that when you touch on it
it will drive the behavior of your
application itself so how to do that in
Android is very simple it's a little bit
more code and so here in your Android
manifest you'd set up an intent filter
that catches a messaging event from
firebase and that intent filter is going
to drive an activity and within that
activity I have a firebase messaging
service that extends the firebase
messaging service and this is just this
catches an on message received event and
from that I can pull out the metadata
and then launch an activity you're
passing that metadata to it so that I
can see it in action so let's let's
what this looks like and see how this
actually runs this is what it would look
like in iOS but again Todd and Johnny
are gonna cover that so here's the same
application okay if the eagle-eyed
amongst you might have noticed that the
original one was firebase notification
one this is for our base notification -
all I've done was add the code that you
saw on the slides and so if I am gonna
send a message to this one so okay
Dortmund are gonna win the Champions
League who's gonna do they gonna be in
the final Wow
Bayern Munich you might get booed I
thought seriously I thought somebody was
gonna say Borussia mÃ¶nchengladbach just
to get me to type it but I'll type
Bayern Munich then in second place
second place and then I will just send
this notification I'm just using the
same console that we were using earlier
on but I'm targeting this application
and I'm sending it and when I send it
now you'll see the notification will
appear but now the note open if we can
switch back to the tablet please but now
the notification has actually driven me
to launch a new activity where the data
that I had just sent that notification
content that I'd sent Bayern Munich in
second place launches this activity and
you can see I just render it in a text
field there and we can actually see the
notification here it's hard to see on
this camera but it's the same thing and
it's this data is actually appearing
within the application itself if we can
switch back to the slides please I would
save this work note to self never use
Bayern Munich in demos and never use
sand in demos so that's firebase
notifications and how firebase
notifications works you can see was very
little code that I used and then from
the firebase console I was able to send
those notifications so I didn't need to
build any kind of server or do any kind
of coding it was all stuff that was in
the client right so firebase
notification is very useful for your
growth hackers so if you want to do
campaigns it's great you log into the
console and and think about the
promotions you want to make but
sometimes you really want to hook your
business logic in your application
servers to be able to send messages to
your application so for example if
you're building let's say a social
platform and it's posting something and
I'm commenting commenting on this post
what we want to deliver in notifications
to his device that someone
wrote a comment and so in your logic you
can just hook it and send and use the
rest api support messaging firebase
identification is built on top of cloud
messaging which is a very popular
service we service over a couple
trillions messages every week and he has
a bunch of really cool API is including
topics so now your users can subscribe
to topics that are interested in too so
for example if you have a a music app
and they care about
Tyrolean music so they subscribe to DJ
it see if there is a new album they get
notified then you can buy it Cloud
messaging delivers to Android iOS and
recently we hooked it with web push so
now we deliver also to Firefox Chrome
and opera and soon other browsers that
have joined the web push community so I
believe okay
we had some partners that that just
wrote the implementation of firebase Cal
messaging on JavaScript SDK and they all
state how much more engagement to God
through this project I believe you have
a final yeah one more demo no sound in
this demo either thankfully so if we can
switch back to my laptop we can see it
here so for firebase cloud messaging as
francesco was talking about and as you
saw on that architecture diagram you get
a whole lot more flexibility you get
things like being able to send two
groups of devices or being able to send
to individual devices or being able to
send two topics but to be able to build
this you need like a little app server
that you build yourself and this app
server can collect the FCM registration
IDs of your devices and then it will
post to FCM and your behalf and you just
say hey FCM send this message to this
device or to this group of devices or to
this topic and it will do it for you so
I've built a simple app server that you
can see this is actually running on a
public URL so the brave among you if you
want to go to that URL you'll see this
page right now and you know you can type
in a message there and send it there's
one device register to it so that big
string that you see underneath is the ID
of this device here and so if you have
any questions for us about FCM or any
questions first about growth hacking and
the stuff that was in this session you
can type them in there and an FCM will
actually send its
my phone and it'll appear on my watch
and I mean I can give an example of that
now so I'll say hello room sorry about
the broken demos and if I send that oh
my watch somebody just said hi hi maybe
I said it so soon another hi-ho I'm
getting tons of them so and if I click
send on that now and I show my watch
oh no I'm not showing that one no not
that one either I was brave enough to do
it so I'll send mine and it will say oh
I can show it on if we can go to the you
can see on my watch and I'm receiving
somebody just said hey and somebody said
responsive design and somebody said I
and I better and somebody said nope so
I'm gonna start taking my watch away in
case anything comes up so you know that
that's how easy it is to build my watch
is vibrating like crazy my battery's
gonna be dead by the time I leave the
stage and so but that's how easy it is
in fcm here's a very simple PHP
application that I've built if you guys
want to see how it was built you know
come see me I can share some of the
source of that with you but all it does
is it's collecting those registration
IDs watch is still vibrating it's
collecting the registration IDs storing
them into a my sequel database and
rendering that page so then when in the
app when I run my app I have to take my
watch off but when I run my app it's
really distracted when I run my app I
then like create it I get a registration
ID from FCM I posted up to that server I
generate that page and then there was a
text box on that page and whenever you
guys are typing in that text box FCM is
then dispatching it to my phone and
because my watch is paired with my phone
I'm able to get all these messages and
this is going insane okay the last one
said firebase is awesome so I think
we'll keep that one right so so that's
that's how FCM works it's you know it
might sound a little daunting at first
when we say hey you got to build an app
server or something of those lengths but
it's actually very very simple it's up
to you how complex you make your app
server what kind of logic you put on it
for filtering your users in this case
this was a very simple one that I built
but very easy to do it's just getting
IDs and then calling I'm curling with
PHP so the FCM registered to the FCM
server to get it to dispatch the
messages and you can see messages are
coming in like crazy and I think are 2
trillion a week is now going to become
three days a week if this watch is any
indication so that's how cloud messaging
will work very very simple very easy to
set up great so you're seeing a lot of
things in this session mainly three main
areas for growth hacking first
experimentation and you can use remote
conflict to do that then acquiring users
and you have dynamic links invites and
Adwords and then how to keep your users
engaged and coming back to your app with
notifications messaging and app indexing
so I hope you enjoy the session thank
you thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
