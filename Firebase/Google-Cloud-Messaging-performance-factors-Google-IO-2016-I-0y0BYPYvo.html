on Google Cloud messaging now called
firebase Cloud messaging I focus on
performance specifically reducing
battery consumption improving
reliability and reducing latency with me
on stage is Kiran hi I'm Karen and I
work with Todd on the cloud messaging
performance team today we're here to
discuss some of the details of Cloud
messaging performance including how we
measure it some typical latency numbers
that we see some of the factors that can
affect that performance and finally a
few of the cool projects we've been
working on lately to help make the
service even more robust especially in
the face of unreliable networks but
first we've had kind of a busy morning
Todd I haven't had a chance to talk to
you um I saw yesterday the firebase
Cloud messaging is the new google cloud
messaging does does that mean this whole
presentation is out of date no I'm glad
you asked so as you all heard yesterday
we launched a combined suite of services
called firebase firebase Cloud messaging
is the google cloud messaging under that
sweet the data that we're going to talk
about today applies to both services
before we get started I'd like to review
a couple basics real quick so we're on
the same page so first let's look at how
a downstream message flows from your
servers to the devices so when it flows
from your servers the first top is the
firebase Cloud messaging front end from
there it's time-stamped and persisted
the storage if the device is connected
it's sent immediately to the backend
server where it is then forwarded to the
device so let's take another closer look
at the interaction from back end to the
device it's not a simple arrow the first
top is that it leaves the fire blaze
firebase Cloud messaging back end and
goes through the internet towards your
wireless network or your carrier's
infrastructure within that point there's
going to be a network address
translation device not for short that
allows us to deal with the shortness of
ipv4 space and this is a carrier
provided
sure or a wireless network router
provided feature and from there would oh
okay from there it travels to the device
one of the key aspects of this network
address translation devices it keeps
track of connections and let's look more
closely at how that works so the
connection list is a list of connections
and the external IP in ports along with
a timeout when the timeout expires for
for the connection being inactive the
connection is removed and no more
communication can happen over that
connection so the devices must
reestablish the connection if that NAT
device is really busy we can run out of
space and we have T Vick the least
recently used entry before it times out
most snap devices are well behaved in
that they'll send a tcp reset when they
remove an entry from the NAT table and
that will allow the devices to know to
reconnect but some nap devices don't
send a tcp reset that leaves the
connection closed but the devices are
unaware we call that a silent closed in
this scenario the device must figure out
a way to detect that the connection is
broken and to reestablish it one
solution for this is to send heartbeats
over the connection from the device to
our servers we do this to keep the
connections active so that they don't
timeout and to detect more readily when
the connections fail another aspect I
wanted to review real quick was latency
percentiles as you all know 50
percentile latency is fifty percent of
latency less than fifty percent of users
experience late and see less than this
metric and fifty percent a user's
experience more latency than this metric
there's also the 80 percentile latency
this is useful for situations where we
have a long tailed distribution such as
if we're looking at the performance of
carrier Wi-Fi networks where the
performance of individual carries
carriers could vary significantly in
situations where we control more of the
infrastructure such as within our own
FCM infrastructure we can look at 95
percentile latency which is 19 out of 20
users experiencing less latency than
that
so enough review let's start with some
of the stats we'll start by looking at
latency first this is the same diagram
that you've seen before we're going to
look at in this next slide latency from
the fcm path so as the message flows
through the FCM servers for both mobile
and Wi-Fi so 50 percentile latency is a
small 64 milliseconds 95 percentile
latency is 161 milliseconds again we
chose 95 percentile latency here because
we control the infrastructure and so
we're provide we're able to provide
tighter latency bounds if we're careful
we can estimate the latency if we're
careful we can estimate the latency from
the FCM from the point the message
enters the FCM infrastructure to the
point that is delivered to the device to
do this we'll use Google Hangouts data
and we'll use the ACK traveling back
from the device to estimate the one-way
latency so 50 percentile latency from
the front end of FCM to the client is
160 milliseconds which is pretty low 80
percentile latency is 348 milliseconds
we chose 80 percentile here because
wireless and mobile networks tend to
have a long tip or tend to have a lot of
variability in performance and we felt
that 80 percentile latency was
representative of a well-behaved
networks performance oh sorry before I
hand off the data that we've talked
about now is for connected devices it
connectivity is an important factor in
currents going to talk about that right
so to give the audience some context
when the team started looking at these
numbers we obviously high-fived
ourselves gave ourselves a pat on the
back etc these are pretty good numbers
but then we took another look and we
realized like Todd just said that these
are only for devices that already have
an active connection with the FCM
servers but there's an entire category
of devices that don't have an active
connection and so then the next logical
question we asked ourselves was why why
don't these devices have an active
connection and is there anything that we
can do to make sure that that connection
stays open longer and is there more
often
and so we didn't really know the answer
to that question so we did what we
usually do when we're faced with a
question we don't know which is we
looked at the data and more specifically
we looked at the connection closed
events that we were seeing and we
roughly categorize them into one of two
buckets and the first bucket is
user-initiated connection closed events
so these are actions that the user has
taken that has influenced their
connectivity in some way so some typical
examples that we see here are if the
user is worried about their battery or
they're not going to see a charger for a
while they might turn off background
data another example is if the user is
going someplace that has poor or limited
network connectivity so that might be
the park the mountains my parents house
hi dad another example that we see is if
the user is turned off data by enabling
airplane mode and they could do this for
legal reasons like if they're actually
on an airplane they could also do it for
financial reasons or just because they
want the noises to stop so that's an
entire category of user influence defend
events that can affect somebody's
connectivity and there's a limit to what
we can do about those on the other hand
there's an entire category of external
factors that can affect connectivity now
the truly pedantic among you may note
that this category of external factors
is technically pretty close to infinity
right like there's a whole bunch of
things that can stop a connection
between your client and the fcm servers
but that's not really a useful paradigm
for us so instead we said decided to
subdivide it into two sections the first
is not device issues so as Todd pointed
out that means network address
translation and that's a device that
sits between the FCM client typically an
Android device and the FCM server and
doles out ipv4 addresses and maintains
an internal mapping and typically the
sort of issues that we see from that
devices are capacity issues or timeout
issues there's also another section here
which is random failures and these are
events that can happen anywhere in the
network infrastructure including power
surges and operator failures and these
are things that are difficult for us to
account for
there are some steps we can take but in
general we're pretty limited in what we
can do here so we decided to focus
specifically on network address
translation issues and see what sort of
changes that we could make to make the
experience better for more users but
first we wanted to see how often people
were actually affected by Nat issues so
we started to look at the sort of
connection closed events that we're
seeing out in the wild for real mobile
operators and so one of the operators
that we looked at had 98.6 percent of
their connection closed events being
explicit that is not silent another
operator that we looked at head 99.4
percent of their connection closed
events being explicit these are great
stats and we're really happy to see
these because it means that most users
their connections are staying open or if
they're actually being closed they're
being closed explicitly so both parties
know that the connection has been closed
and they can work to re-establish a new
one which means that your connectivity
is very high and you're very likely to
get messages very quickly on the other
hand not all operators are performing
the same at the same level so here's an
example of a small poor performing
operator that we saw that had almost
forty percent of their connection closes
being silent that's a huge difference
from the other two operators that we saw
so we wanted to kind of dig into what
was making this happen and what we could
do about it but first it may help to go
over what exactly a silent connection is
and why it's so harmful for us so here's
an example of an explicit closed or what
we call a polite disconnect in this
scenario the device on the left already
has an active connection to the FCM
servers so when a message is required to
be delivered to the device fcm sends the
message down it travels through the
network infrastructure the NAT device
and then arrives at the phone in the
timely manner then the NAT device
decides to close the connection but it
sends out an explicit TCP reset or fin
packet to both parties so now both
parties know that that connection has
been closed after a short duration the
Android device attempts to re-establish
that connection
it does so and there's a new connection
that is used to transfer data between
the Android device and the FCM servers
then later when the FCM servers need to
send a new notification down to the
device it does so on the new connection
just like before and the domestic is
delivered promptly this is a great
scenario because again the Android
device realizes that the network
connection has been closed so it can
re-establish a new one on the other hand
the silent closed events that we see are
pretty harmful so here's an example of
one again in this scenario the phone
already has an active connection with
the FCM servers when a network or when a
message is delivered to the device it
travels through the network
infrastructure just like before and
arrives at the device then when the
router or NAT device decides to close
the connection it does so silently it
doesn't send an explicit packet to
either party so now neither party knows
that that connection has been closed
later when FCM wants to send a
notification down to the phone it tries
to write to that connection and only
then does it realize that the connection
has been closed and is unusable a short
time later the phone will attempt to
send a heartbeat back up to fcm and it
will attempt to do so on the old now
dead connection when it does that then
it will realize that the connection has
been closed it will re-establish a new
connection and FCM will send any
messages that have been queued in the
meantime back down to the phone the key
takeaway here is that this scenario
causes a period of disconnection that
can range for up to a couple of minutes
until the phones between the point of
disconnects and until the phone sends a
new heartbeat this isn't a great
experience for our users because they
can be silently disconnected with no
awareness so if they receive an urgent
message it may not get to them for many
minutes so obviously this isn't a great
opportunity or this is a great
opportunity for us to make some changes
and see what we can do to fix this so
this is kind of a one weird trick sort
of thing here's the same poor performing
operator you've already seen this data
before almost 40% of their connection
closed events were silent after making
this small adjustment
almost over ninety percent of their
connection closed events were explicit
that's a huge reduction in the number of
silent closes that we were seeing so how
did we do this how do we make this
happen the answer is we reduce the
heartbeat interval to below what we
thought they're not timeout interval was
and so what that means is that when a
NAT device typically turn typically
closes a connection due to timeout
issues it's because it thinks that no
data is going to be passed on that
connection anymore an fcm connection on
the other hand is always active we're
always expecting to receive data on that
that's how you receive your messages so
quickly so the trick here was to make
sure that we were sending packets
frequently enough that the NAT device
realized that the connection was still
open and that it shouldn't close it so
here's that same data in a different
form as you can see for the first three
quarters of the graph the harp to silent
closes over time hover pretty steadily
between 1.5 million and just over 2
million on the other hand when we
initiated the heartbeat interval or when
we adjusted the heartbeat interval which
is that blue dotted line you see you see
the number of silent closes dropped
dramatically in fact they dropped
eighty-eight percent down to just around
250,000 that's a huge huge improvement
and we're very happy that we got to make
that now this approach of taking the
whole team and looking at mobile
operator data and coming up with a plan
and then implementing that plan is great
for mobile operators especially larger
ones where the amount of impact that we
can have is dramatic for just that small
amount of work on the other hand that
approach doesn't really scale well with
Wi-Fi networks it's not like I can go in
and record each Wi-Fi network and
whether or not it's a good quality one
so we had to come up with a different
solution and Todd I know you have a lot
of practice here can you give us an
example of what we did to make that
better yeah Wi-Fi adaptive heartbeat was
a really exciting project for me to work
on we started out with a constant
heartbeat interval of 15 minutes and it
was great for most operators or for most
Wi-Fi networks but there were a few that
would be disconnected because they had
shorter NAT
than that or more active devices a
simple solution could be to just reduce
the static heartbeat to four minutes but
we might consume a little bit more
battery as a result and so what we
really wanted was something to develop
an algorithm that would balance battery
consumption with connectivity and so we
brainstormed on that for a bit and came
up with a number of candidates we took
those candidate algorithms and we
simulated them against modeled mat
devices so here's an example the model
NAT device varies it's time out in the
yellow line and then the red line shows
the heartbeats as they adjust an
interval to match that and that's the
Wi-Fi adaptive heartbeat this simulation
here shows that the device was connected
over ninety seven percent of the time in
comparison if this same simulation was
run with a static heartbeat of 15
minutes the device only would have been
connected sixty-six percent of the time
after we refined our algorithm and came
up with a what we thought was a good
solution we took it to the lab there we
had for Nexus 6 devices we divided them
into two groups control group an
experiment group the control group kept
the 15 minute static heartbeat and the
experiment group got our new Wi-Fi
adaptive heartbeat algorithm we
connected them to monsoon parameters so
we can measure the current consumption
of all the devices and a Wi-Fi network
that we controlled this allowed us to
emulate the various snap behaviors that
we had experienced we also took a TCP
dump to verify that the algorithm was
operated expected from this lab
experiment we came up with some
interesting numbers I'd like to share
first we could compare the cost of doing
a heartbeat versus the cost of doing a
reconnect we found that a heartbeat
saved thirty eight thirty six percent
battery it could sorry a heartbeat
consumed thirty six percent less battery
than a reconnect in addition if we look
at a ten-minute nap time out device
again that's when we've talked about
before in the experiment group it would
simply have 29 minute heartbeats in the
control group it would have a 15-minute
heartbeat followed by a reconnect the
experiment group of course would achieve
the 97% connectivity that we had
simulated and the control group would
only get achieve sixty-six percent
connectivity but more interesting is the
experiment group would actually consumed
three percent less battery and so by
increasing the heartbeat interval in
certain situations were actually a
the save battery in addition to
improving connectivity we started
rolling this feature out and along the
way we collected data I'd love to share
with you some of the data we got when we
got to the fifty percent of production
users first we saw thirty-four percent
fewer silent closes and one percent more
TTL 0 msgs deliver if you remember the
GCM spec time-to-live zero messages or
messages that are delivered immediately
if the device is online but otherwise
they're discarded because they aren't
stored to be delivered later their time
to live a zero so by delivering more of
those messages that shows that we're
connected more of the time in addition
we improve battery for fifty-four
percent of users whoa we improved
battery for fifty-four percent of users
that's a huge yeah fifty-four percent
make and there's a small caveat to that
for a very small portion of users users
that we're only connected thirty-three
percent of the time or less we did spend
a little bit of battery point three
percent more battery consumed for an
idle device so you wouldn't even notice
it but it allowed us to improve the
connectivity for those for that small
subset of users three times so in the
end I feel like the battery numbers
really paid out and then the improved
connectivity we improve connectivity for
seventy two percent of users so as a
result this feature is live everybody's
phone should have it and we're
continuing to think about how to improve
it further in addition to look in your
own data when we rolled out we also felt
it was important to look at data from
services that depend on us so I'd like
to look at Google Hangouts 99 percentile
latency data the blue line represents my
Wi-Fi and mobile users combined so it's
the same it's this it's both sets of
users and one work in one line and the
Wi-Fi line is red so it's just the Wi-Fi
users so what we can see here is that at
the fifty percent rollout point the 99th
percentile latency for Wi-Fi usage
dropped when we got to 100% roll out the
Wi-Fi users continue to drop but also
the Wi-Fi plus mobile 99 percentile
users drop that means that we've changed
what
problem is causing the 99 percentile
latency for white Wi-Fi plus mobile
users in the end the reason remaining
late latency in the remaining latency
for the blue line was caused by 3g
mobile networks which we focused on
later but that's the talk for another
time if you look just at the Wi-Fi line
we reduced the 99 percentile latency for
hangouts fifty-five percent so we've
gone through and looked at how GC and
performs and we've looked at some
interesting projects that we really
enjoyed working on I want to take a
brief second to talk about what can we
learn about the users of GCM from the
data that we have so we're going to look
at user influenced disconnection events
so events where the users decided to be
disconnected for a sustained period of
time so we're going to look at events
where the users been disconnected for 30
minutes or more where they have made the
decision not to be reconnected this is a
heat map that I'm going to talk about
one thing I wanted to point out before I
started that though was that most
messages are delivered in well under 30
minutes but we're only talking about the
long tail here we're only talking about
messages that are delivered longer than
longer than 30 minutes virtual devices
have been offline for more than 30
minutes this heat map is color-coded so
red means that more higher percentage of
messages are delivered to devices that
been offline and green represents the
lower percentage of messages we will
post on the spaces app the full set of
data for this grid so you can check it
out online so for example four percent
of Indian users are seen their messages
delivered two devices they've been off
line between two and four hours in the
US that's only point eight percent as
you can see this varies from country to
country significantly let's take another
look at this data in a slightly
different representation this is a
cumulative graph so for example you can
see here that fifteen percent of users
in India or fifteen percent of messages
in India delivered to devices have been
offline two hours or more fifteen
percent so that means that if you're
developing an app for you know the world
you need to take into account that the
vice connectivity may not be a
ubiquitous thing and so you have to make
your app work in a situation where
connectivity may go away and we'll talk
more about that in a second one other
data set that I thought we could poll
that was
interesting is to look at day of the
week this is the global data so it's not
any particular country but you can
clearly see that Saturday and Sunday are
days in which the users are less likely
to be available on their devices maybe
they work on the weekdays or maybe they
have phone free saturdays sundays kiran
what are some things we can do for users
that are for apps that want to work in
an environment where connectivity is not
ubiquitous i am both glad you asked that
question and totally surprised by it no
I'm joking so we just released a new
open source library it's called the
firebase job dispatcher and this is a
library for scheduling job discrete
units of work on Android and coming soon
iOS that let you set constraints and
triggers for these jobs so you can say
something like I'd like to do this
download but only when the user has an
unmetered Wi-Fi network or I'd like to
run this task every week but only while
the device is charging this helps make
sure that your app remains a good ab
citizen on both iOS and Android and also
the mean ultimately it means that you're
respecting your user by making sure
you're only using the bandwidth when you
absolutely need to and you're waiting
for the most opportune time to initiate
downloads or do any maintenance taps
that you need to this is available right
now and you can check out those links
there the iOS version is absolutely
coming soon we also have a code lab for
you called removing dependencies on
background services and that's available
at the link there Chico / code lab / job
scheduler we encourage you to check it
out in there we go over a sample app and
we talk about removing dependencies on
background services and converting to
this new job centric world this is a
great way to make sure that your app is
more battery efficient and works even
better on newer versions of Android and
iOS so this is Ben us we've been talking
about GCM performance we'd love to hear
your comments and feedback please leave
us a note in the spaces up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
