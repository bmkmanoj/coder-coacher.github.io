devices in different ways that suit
their situation and lifestyle Michael
uses a phone to play games on the go
while Tony enjoys using a large tablet
as he relaxes on the sofa and Jen
carries a small tablet in her purse for
reading on the bus but they all want to
use your app on the devices they prefer
so you'll want to make sure they each
have a great experience regardless of
screen size OS version and the features
of the app they use the most it can be
taxing to test each one of these
situations so that all your users can be
happy we know you'd rather not have to
buy and store stacks of devices and test
your app in all these circumstances
that's why we built fire based test lab
for Android to make it easy and
affordable for you to test your app with
a variety of devices and be sure it
works great for all your users our
device lab hosted in the cloud offers a
variety of physical devices ready to
test your app the selection of devices
is always growing so your tests will
stay current with the latest hardware
and operating systems the easiest way to
use firebase test lab is to run a robo
test this is an intelligent automated
test that crawls your app to discover
and exercise its features you won't need
to write any additional code to make use
of a robo test for more advanced testing
you can also script the interactions
with your app to simulate specific use
cases and verify that everything works
as expected
test results include a detailed report
for each device used including
screenshots device logs and any crashes
that may have occurred during the test
this allows you to verify that your app
is working correctly on the variety of
devices and configurations you selected
it's easy to make fire based test lab a
part of your daily development routine
and we have multiple ways to help you
test regularly and spot errors early
first you can use the firebase console
to upload and test your app there is
also a command-line interface for
testing with continuous integration
servers so you can automatically test
every build during Android development
you can deploy your app directly to
firebase test lab using Android studio
to point
and finally in the Play Store developer
console
there is a special automated launch test
that will run for Android apps published
to an alpha or beta Channel to get
started using firebase test lab and
learn how to regularly test your app on
different devices and configurations you
can start with the documentation
available right here happy testing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
