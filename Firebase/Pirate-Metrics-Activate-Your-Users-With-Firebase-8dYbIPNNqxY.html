talking about pirate metrics again
pirate metrics is a framework for going
your business that's based on
acquisition activation retention
referral and revenue that's right in
this episode we'll be looking at the
second of these activation human beings
have a very short attention span in fact
some studies now show that they have
less than that of a goldfish wait does
that mean you have the attention span of
a goldfish is now a compliment yes it is
and one of the issues your product faces
after getting the user to install the
app is that they'll just probably forget
about it which means that the first
impression you cast is critical you want
to get your user to experience what's so
special about your application in as
soon a time as possible a game may want
them to go through some tutorial rounds
or a social app might want them to
follow some people and then check out
the newsfeed and this is called
activation quite an event from your app
to track when a user gets activated and
track the start like a hawk on fire
based analytics ideally you want to
create a funnel from the first app open
event to this activation event and see
what percentage of users are getting
activated over a period of time also you
can create an audience of activated
users and compare key metrics against
those who weren't activated to compare
behavior patterns between the two your
activated audience should show higher
levels of engagement and higher revenue
per user activation however involves a
lot of fingering your funnel is never
going to show a 100 percent completion
rate and even if it does it's very
likely that your hypotheses for what is
required to activate a user could be
imperfect so over a period of time you
want to experiment with your activation
strategy and the best way to do this is
using a/b testing firebase provides a
solution to do that
it's called remote config remote config
allows you to set key value pairs on the
firebase panel with different values
being shown to users in different random
percentiles if required running an a B
test for a small portion of your users
allows you to conform different
hypotheses and ensure your activating as
many of your acquired users as possible
and what's really cool about it is that
these variables are stored on your
server and their values can be driven by
analytics it totally decoupled your app
from its configuration data allowing you
to change things without shipping new
versions of the app remember the key to
good activation is constant tracking and
continuous experimentation learn about
other ways to improve your pirate
metrics by checking out these videos and

she's been waiting for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
