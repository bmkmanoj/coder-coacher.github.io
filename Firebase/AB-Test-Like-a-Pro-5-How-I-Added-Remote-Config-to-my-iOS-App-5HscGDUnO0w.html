SPEAKER: Hey there,
app developers.
So this episode of
&quot;A/B Test Like a Pro&quot;
is completely optional.
I know I've been showing
you the sample app that
makes use of Remote Config.
And some you want me to go
into more of the details
around how I got this working.
And so while I don't really want
to derail the series with kind
of detailed explanations
of how to implement Remote
Config because we've already
got docs and blog posts
and videos all about that, I
thought for those of you who
are curious about how I
got Remote Config working
on my app, I'd walk
you through the code.
So ready?
Let's start.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Now I do want to
preface this by saying,
this is one way you
can get your app up
and running with Remote Config.
It's not the only way, and it's
not necessarily the best way.
So if you think you've
got a better system set up
within your app, keep using it.
And maybe tell me about
it in the comments below.
All right, let's take
a look at my code.
So let's start off by taking
a look at my RC values
object, which is what I use
for accessing all of my Remote
Config values and abstracting
away some of the implementation
details.
Now it's a singleton
because I'm as
guilty as overusing singletons
as the next engineer.
But it does make life
awfully easy for me.
So the first thing
I want to point out
is that I'm storing all
of my Remote Config keys
here as a swift enum with
the backing type as a string.
Now this is nice
in that if I ask
for the raw value
of an enum, it will
be a string that's
equal to this value
here unless I specify otherwise.
So the raw value of
sloganText is actually
a string called sloganText.
And it turns out that if I do
need to override one of these,
like maybe because the
Android team already
shipped their version
of the app and they're
using a different term, I
can do that easily like this.
So when my singleton object
is first initialized,
which as you can see, I am
doing here in my AppDelegate,
I do two things.
First, I specify default values,
and then I fetch new values
from the cloud.
So first, let's take a look at
how I'm specifying my defaults.
The two things I want
to point out here
are that I'm grabbing the
raw value from my enum
as the key, which
as you recall, is
a string that usually has the
same name as the enum itself.
And then here, you can see that
I'm using my NSLocalizedString
to set my default
values for my strings
so that at runtime, I can make
sure my default values are
still appropriately
localized, even though I'm
going through Remote Config.
Now fetching values
from the cloud
should look pretty familiar.
I'm making a call and then
calling activateFetched here
in the completion Handler.
Although this bit
here might be new,
notice that I'm setting
fetchComplete to true,
and calling my
loadingDoneCallback
if it exists.
And that's because I'm
using a loading screen.
Now if you haven't watched
our video called Remote Config
Loading Strategies, I do
recommend taking a look at it.
I go over three
different strategies
for how to load and apply
Remote Config values.
And one solution I recommend
is creating a loading screen
that you can put up while you're
waiting for your Remote Config
values to finish loading.
And that's what I'm doing here.
So over here in my waiting
screen view controller,
I'm basically setting
our loadingDoneCallback
to this readyToGo method that
segueways to the next view
controller.
I'm also calling it right
away if fetchComplete is true,
just on the off chance that
Remote Config somehow completed
its fetch before
this view is loaded.
I don't know if that's
possible, but you know, better
safe than sorry.
And so you'll
notice this is why,
even if I get an error
fetching Remote Config,
I don't want to completely bail
out early from this function.
I still want to set
fetchComplete as true
and call my loadingDoneCallback
so that if I'm offline
or my app is throttled
or something,
I'm not stuck forever
on the loading screen.
Now once we get into my
main view controller,
you can see I have this
method, applyConfigValues,
where I'm setting a bunch
of values for my app
from what's in Remote Config.
And this is because I
need to set all this stuff
through code, and
I can't necessarily
rely on what I've set
in the storyboard.
Now you can see that instead
of accessing the Remote Config
Service directly, I'm
making calls like this
config.string(forKey) method.
Let's take a closer look
at some of these methods.
I think most of them are
pretty straightforward.
What I'm doing here is
simply taking my values
from Remote Config and calling
bool value, stream value,
number value, whatever on them.
If I do end up with a nil value,
I provide a simple default.
That way I don't have to
deal with these things
as optionals in the
rest of my code.
You'll notice that
color for key returns
a UI color based
on the string value
that I retrieved
from Remote Config.
Now this is not currently
a native UI color method.
I'm using the UI color
hex swift library,
which adds it onto the UI
color class as an extension.
Now the one place I am
getting a little tricky
is here in the Populate
Image View for Key Method.
Basically I wanted to find
an easy way to change images
through Remote Config,
and I decided to do that
through JSON object--
or I guess more
accurately, a string
that looks like a JSON
object, something like this.
Now the source here is
either local or remote.
If it's local, there
will be a name field
that's the name of
the local file to use.
And if it's remote, there will
be a URL field for the images
URL that I want to load.
And so in my code, the first
thing you can see I'm doing
is loading up a default image
just in case my JSON is broken
or something.
Next, I try to grab my
string from Remote Config
and parse it as JSON object.
I then look to see if
the source value is
equal to the string remote.
If it is, then I look for
a URL and try and load that
into my image.
Now if that fails for
any reason or I forget
to include a URL
parameter, I can go back
to using my default image.
Otherwise, I try to grab
the value of the name field
for my JSON, and then I'll
simply load the image locally
based on that name.
Note that I'm using both
the Swifty JSON library
to parse my JSON, and
the SDwebImage library
to take care of all the hey,
load this image from the web
work for me.
One note about the
Swifty JSON library
is that it doesn't
really rely on optionals.
So if my JSON is broken or it
doesn't include a source value,
it will give me an empty
string instead of nil.
And that's why you
don't see me doing
a whole bunch of guardlets in
most of my JSON interpreting
code here.
If my JSON doesn't have
a field called source,
this local or remote value
will just be an empty string.
As for this default
image, one option
could be to just
simply hard code
this to some
placeholder UI image.
But what I decide to do
instead is take a look
at what I specified within my
Remote Config defaults, which
makes sense, right?
That seems like a pretty
reasonable backup image
to use if my Remote
Config value is incorrect.
And so that's what
I'm doing here.
I'm calling this
Default Value for Key
to ask Remote Config
for the default value
instead of what's been
loaded from the cloud.
Note that by the time
you see this video,
you might not need
to make this call
with the namespace
argument, but I had to.
Then basically, all
I'm going to do here
is grab the contents
of my JSON's name field
and try to get a local
UI image from that value.
Now I am making two
assumptions here.
One is that it will have a
valid JSON object representing
images for my default
options in Remote Config.
And two is that
they'll all be local.
But at least for my app, I think
those are both safe assumptions
to make.
And in fact, that's why
I'm throwing an assertion
error here, because I
do want to make sure
I have good default
options to fall back on,
and I want to catch
that in development.
But of course, feel free to
change this logic if it's not
appropriate for your app.
And then well,
that's basically it.
I grabbed these values
from my RC values singleton
as I need them, using these
methods that either return
non-optional values
of the right type,
or this populateImageView
method that
loads the appropriate image
right into the correct view.
I used the same approach
when animating my views
and just as a fun
side note here,
I'm animating my slide-in
panel by changing
the constraint
constant here, which
is a neat way of being
able to animate my views
while still using
constraints within my app.
This really has nothing
to do with Remote Config.
I just thought it
was kind of cool.
And there you go.
So that's the app I
have set up in iOS.
If you do want any
more information
about any of this stuff, head
on over to the Remote Config
section of our documentation.
And be sure to check out the
samples and all the guides
and all the videos we've
got waiting for you there.
And yes, we even have stuff
there for you Android folks.
So in the meantime, if
you enjoyed this video,
please feel free to subscribe
to the Firebase YouTube channel,
and I will see you soon on
another exciting episode
of &quot;A/B Test Like a Pro.&quot;
Thanks for watching.
