manager on the developer relations team
and i'm in charge of top partner
outreach and so i've been working with a
lot of our top partners to onboard them
on to firebase and i'm super excited to
be here at the firebase developer summit
to support that we thought really hard
about which partners we wanted to invite
we launched we launched firebase at
Google i/o earlier this year in in
mountain view I'm and unfortunately not
a lot of our amia partners were able to
attend so we were super excited to bring
the firebase developer summit to Europe
here in Berlin and tried to focus on
inviting local partners across all
different verticals to come here more
about firebase meet our product and
engineering teams and get all their
questioning get all their questions
answered to help them launch it with
firebase I was just chatting with
Spotify chatted with a number of our top
partners are really excited to be here
and I think the highlight for them has
been getting a chance to talk with our
pm's or engineers and hear more about
what we're doing and got a lot of their
specific questions answered everybody
was super excited to hear our
announcement about real-time analytics
is a very important product that a lot
of top partners care about so a lot of
the ant events today we're really
exciting to hear more about how our top
partners are using firebase go to the
