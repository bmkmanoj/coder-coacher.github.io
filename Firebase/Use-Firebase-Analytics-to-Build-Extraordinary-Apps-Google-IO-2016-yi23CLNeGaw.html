product management for Google Analytics
for apps and now for firebase analytics
so I'm going to be joined on stage in a
few minutes by some of my team by Steve
and Fontaine and before we get to that I
wanted to take a minute and just kind of
have everybody think about experiences
that they have with Apps on an everyday
basis so we've all had those magical
experiences where you download an app
and almost from the minute you do you
open it up and you're in love it
immediately starts adding value to your
life the user experience is beautiful
you may even go on to make it you know a
permanent fixture on your home screen
and before long you can't imagine your
life without it so for me uber is an app
like that so I'm based in Southern
California Here I am in the Bay Area I
don't have a car or a rental car
worrying about cabs
I have uber when I'm at home waves is an
app like that for me but there's another
experience that we've all had with apps
and those are the apps that when you
install them you almost immediately
regret doing it the user experience
sucks that is if you can ever see the
user experience because the app just
keeps crashing then it starts spamming
you with notifications that you never
asked for that serve no purpose and
without fail right when you're is more
frustrating you could possibly be it has
the audacity to prompt you for a review
so as developers none of us want that
app to be our app especially when we
know how extraordinary apps can be but
of course you all know this better than
anyone else
because typically your app is your
business and every interaction with your
users matters now as developers there's
something else that you know about apps
and that's the building an app is really
really hard I mean think about it
there's so much going on so much you
have to get right and you built the app
but how are you gonna make it successful
how do you even measure success how do
you
understand the things that make an app
successful and not and so a big
challenge there is that apps are
generating just a mind-boggling amount
of data so people take their phones out
of their pockets and check them more
than 150 times a day I'm standing on
stage at i/o and I've already pulled my
phone out twice and that level of
interaction just generates a
mind-boggling amount of data and very
few tools are even capable of capturing
that amount of data especially if you're
not one of the big developers but let's
just assume for a minute that you could
collect all that data how would you go
about detecting the underlying factors
that are driving your success and
failure what causes your revenue to
increase one day and fall another day
what users are most valuable to you and
where are they coming from what are the
experiences in the app that they're
thoroughly enjoying you need a set of
powerful analysis tools that work fast
and are easy to use and you also need to
be able to very quickly put that data to
work for you it's not good enough to
simply look at your reporting you need
to put that data into action and so
without having to deal with all the the
complications of bundling in multiple
SDKs that make your app bloated and
result in this Frankenstein monster with
all these pieces that were never
designed to work together now
fortunately this is something that
Google can help with so let's talk about
the new firebase so we just heard a lot
about it if you're in the session before
this or if you heard pieces of the
keynote but we want to look at firebase
kind of from the perspective of
analytics what we used firebase for
internally at Google was as a unifying
force to bring all of our app developer
efforts together and the result is now
this single suite of tightly integrated
products all designed to help users or
help developers rather build their apps
grow their engagement or their user base
and ultimately to earn more money and
while we talk about these
as stages or steps like kind of in a
journey I think a better way to look at
them is like this so you can imagine
this as a virtuous cycle where each step
is constantly feeding back on itself
reinforcing the learnings from one stage
to benefit the other all to build a
better app and so that's exactly what
we're doing with firebase is we're
making it easy for you to tap in to that
virtuous cycle and succeed with your app
so we heard Francis and James a few
minutes ago talked about how firebase is
this tightly integrated set of tools we
have other sessions that go into really
all of the different features throughout
the week and of course over at the
firebase sandbox but at the core of
firebase is firebase analytics and now
this is an entirely new offering focused
specifically on the needs of mobile apps
but it benefits from our decade-long
experience running Google Analytics
which is the most popular analytic
service in the world so we think given
these learnings that firebase analytics
is going to be really exciting for
developers and here's why so first
firebase analytics is completely free
and completely unlimited even free right
completely free and completely unlimited
exactly so this is true even for the
largest of apps so now all developers
can understand all of their data and
without compromise it's free
there aren't hit limits there's not
sampling there's no quotas there's no
nothing it's free and unlimited next it
works automatically right out of the box
so what this means is when a developer
gets started with firebase and they add
it to their app for any reason even the
most basic implementation they're
already set up with firebase analytics
and it's already measuring things for
them automatically
now the automated measurement features
are just the starting point and Steve's
going to come up here in just a minute
and show us how easy it is to take that
further
firebase analytics is also seamlessly
integrated within firebase and across
many other Google products and this is
going to provide you as a
with a single source of truth as you
take action across all of Google and
Fontaine's gonna come up here in a
minute in a minute to show us what that
looks like and the thing I really really
want to stress is that firebase
analytics is cross-platform it works
just as well and is just as easy to use
on iOS and it is on Android and so with
that let's go ahead and get our hands
dirty and write some code actually I'm
not going to get my hands dirty Steve is
gonna get his two hands dirty and I will
hand it over and he's gonna show you how
easy it is to use firebase analytics as
you're building your app Steve alright
thank you thank you very much hi I'm
Steve Ganem and I'm a product manager on
firebase analytics and in just a minute
I'm gonna walk you through a real
example of how you can use firebase
analytics as you develop your app and
there will be a little bit of live
coding there as well and but just before
we do that I'm gonna let's take a step
back and see how you get started with
firebase in your app we getting started
with firebase very easy it's as easy as
one two three you take your app you add
the SDK to it and you add a
configuration file and you're up and
running more specifically you register
your app on the firebase console you
download the SDK for your target
platform and then you download a config
configuration file that has your unique
app ID in it and you drop those into
your project and build all that remains
at that point is to initialize the SDK
which is code lists on Android and two
lines of code on iOS as Francis showed
us and this is a one-time setup you
would need to do for any and all
firebase features and so the beauty is
regardless of what feature actually
attracted you to firebase in the first
place if you've come this far
you're already live with analytics in
your app now what does it mean to be
live with analytics well firebase
analytics works out of the box and so
just by initializing the SDK over a
dozen events are captured automatically
for you these are events that are
critical related to things such as
in-app purchases user engagement your
push notification campaign
and more this is all done for you now of
course you still need the ability to log
custom events and there's an API for you
to do that but what if you aren't sure
what you should be logging maybe you're
new to analytics or just want to make
sure you're passing by practicing using
best practices with firebase analytics
well that's where our API documentation
and our Help Center can help you get
started there in our Help Center you'll
find documentation on a list of
suggested events for various types of
apps so that you can map your experience
and your features to these events and
log them there's examples and suggested
events for things like retail apps
travel apps and of course games so
what's it like to log one of the events
and how much work is that well that's
what I'm going to show you in just a
minute and we'll do so in the context of
a real app Transworld endless skater is
an app that's live right now in the App
Store and on Google Play it's the
skateboarding take on the endless runner
genre where the players goal is to land
as many tricks and combos as possible to
keep their run going as long as possible
and the developers goal is to keep the
lights on as long as possible and they
do that by monetizing with in-app
purchases which are driven by a virtual
economy which is a very common pattern
in video games and so thinking back to
the list of suggested events that I
showed you on a previous slide the spend
virtual currency events going to be
important because we really want to
measure the trends and the popularity of
our various virtual goods so let's take
a look at what it's like to actually log
that event switch to the demo please
alright so here we are in Xcode this is
a function that's called when an item is
purchased from the shop so first thing
I'm going to do is get the firebase
analytics instance and I'm going to call
log event with named API and I'm going
to log this spend virtual currency event
so just having done that I'm flagging
every time that a user actually
purchases something but that's good and
that's has some value to it we want to
add context to it with parameters that
help us understand what's being
purchased and what the price was
so not only does firebase suggest
parameter or events for you to log but
it also prescribes certain parameters
for those events to help you get the
most out of your reporting and so for
this spend virtual currency event we see
that item named virtual currency name
and value are prescribed so we're going
to add those as well to the event
and there it is with one line of code
we're now tracking our virtual currency
spend in the app and now you can
actually log up to 500 distinct events
in your app and unlimited volume as
reste mentioned and even though I only
logged three parameters you can actually
supply up to 25 different parameters so
you get a sense of the breadth and the
depth to which you can actually measure
your application but what if you didn't
have time to do that what if you only
had 10 minutes and you asked your
developer to check out this firebase
Analytics thing how much value would you
actually get from just logging one event
well let's follow this through a bit so
we made this change to the code we make
a new build you archive it and send it
over to test flight you distribute that
to your testers they tell you that
everything's looking good you submit it
to Apple you breeze through because you
know what you're doing and then you
release it to the general public that's
waiting for your app now live with
firebase and firebase analytics in it
now let's head over to the firebase
console to see what that reporting would
look like so here I am in the Transworld
endless skater project in firebase the
changes we made with the iOS version so
I select that here and this takes me to
the analytics dashboard this is a
beautiful list of charts and graphs that
have all sorts of value and as was
mentioned before everything on here is
actually captured for you just by
initializing the SDK so this whole
dashboard lights up when the SDK is
inserted into the app and initialized so
let's go through each one of these carts
so you can understand what's here in
depth first of all I'm looking at the
last 30 days here so all the data that
I'm seeing is is daily for the last 30
days and is compared against the
previous 30 day period so dotted lines
represent the previous 30 days as well
as the percentage changes here this
first card is the active users report it
breaks down monthly weekly and daily
active users compared to the previous
period the one to the right is average
revenue so it breaks it down on average
revenue per user and preparer
revenue and firebase analytics is the
sum of your in-app purchase revenue
which is captured automatically and your
e-commerce revenue next we see first
open attribution this is a report on the
influx of new users from various
campaigns that you're running so you get
a sense of which campaigns are effective
in driving users to your app but also
looking at the lifetime value column
here which ones are most effective at
driving valuable users to your app so
you can double down on those over here
on the left is the retention cohorts
chart this helps you understand that for
a given set of users that started using
your app around the same time what was
their pattern and regularity of coming
back to your app how well did you retain
them
this one here user engagement is
particularly important for mobile apps
user engagement is the amount of time
that your app spends and focus on the
foreground of device so that's what we
really care about is developers how much
mindshare do I have how many eyeballs do
I own and so this chart that you see
here is that value plotted over time
over those 30 days as you're running
campaigns to acquire more users or
you're improving making optimizations on
your retention you should see this
moving up and to the right the next
metric here is daily engagement per user
so take that daily engagement metric
divide it by the number of users so that
you can calculations so if you're trying
to make your app more engaging have
users spend more time in it you come
here to verify that the changes you're
making it had the impact you expected or
if you have a utility app that's meant
to get users in and out very quickly and
accomplish some task you're gonna want
to see your daily user engagement go
down to the right we see that you net
purchases card which is pretty
self-explanatory and shows you which eye
a PR popular and then these you have the
app version card right here this is
particularly important because in our
scenario we just launched a new version
of the app so we want to measure how
quickly that's being adopted by our
users it could be that it rolled out and
has a hundred percent adoption and
that's great but typically there's some
users that are more stubborn for one
reason or another and they stick around
in the old version
that's really important to know because
you've just made some optimizations or
changes to your app your gameplay your
experience and if a lot of users aren't
adopting the new version that their data
won't reflect that next we have the
device model an OS version which are
pretty self-explanatory but there's some
insights there if you've optimized for
phone and you see have a lot of tablet
users or vice versa
you can verify assumptions and make sure
that you are putting in all the effort
necessary to get deliver the best
experience to your users the last three
locations demographic and interests
these are men I mentioned before that
all of this is populated automatically
by initializing the SDK and all of it
these three cards they tell you more
about who is using your app not so much
about what's going on in the app but
it's incredibly insightful and what's
more this is Google's data being
injected into your reporting this is
Google adding value to your reporting I
find the interest one to be particularly
interesting because it tells you more
about what other things your users are
into and these insights are great
because as you're producing more content
in your app or running campaigns to try
to attract more users like that now you
have an insight into what else they're
into so I've covered a lot here and
there's a lot of detail you don't really
need to memorize at all if you memorize
one thing remember that there's this
question mark up here in the upper right
corner that if you click on that on any
report throughout firebase analytics
brings up in product health so here on
the dashboard there are two videos that
can give you background on firebase
analytics and there's also information
about the reports and the controls
including links to our Help Center which
is rich with information about the
product so the dashboard as insightful
as it is as automatic as it is it
doesn't tell you much about how users
are actually using specific features
within your app which is what we're out
to measure here to do that you needed to
log events so let's head it over to the
events tab the events tab lists every
event that was logged by the SDK that
includes both the automatic ones and the
ones you logged manually for every one
of them a report will be generated so
that you can dig into it more deeply
in-app purchases one that's logged
automatically so this is what you can
expect from automatic events you'll see
a report over the last 30 days of the
event count so that's the frequency the
event occurred the number of users who
purchased in that purchases and the
count per user as well as the value now
value in the context of in-app purchase
is pretty obvious that's revenue but I
just want to spend a minute on this
because it's one of the most valuable
but subtle features of analytics value
can it's a context-sensitive parameter
so as I mentioned in the context of
in-app purchases its its revenue but if
you had a travel app and you logged a
flight event it could be that your value
is distance so that the cumulative value
is the total distance traveled by your
users or perhaps you have a music
streaming app and you have an event
that's listened to track then value
could be listening time so that the
cumulative value is the total amount of
time listened to in your app so whatever
makes sense for your events I really
encourage you to use that value to track
those things we also show event location
demographics and event procession for
every event report as well so you get a
sense of who's logging those events
finally we'll get around to looking at
our spend a virtual currency report this
is the one that we logged with one line
of code so now you're kind of getting a
sense of all the value could get just by
initializing the SDK and logging this in
addition to the standard metrics we saw
around event and user account you'll see
up here a report on virtual goods this
is what we were after and just by
logging that one event we get this table
rich with data about what items are the
most popular what prices they're going
for how many times they were purchased
and what's more that's actually broken
down by currency type transport endless
skater uses two types of currency cred
which are earned and bucks which are
purchased and so it's important to
understand not just what's being
purchased but what's being purchased
with each type of currency in order to
fully understand our economy so you can
apply either bucks or cred as a filter
to your report to get a sense of what
they're purchasing with each one of
those and now we're really getting
somewhere because now that we see what
pop what content is actually popular
that gives us a sense as we continue to
develop
and to iterate what new content we
should be making what maybe we should be
exposing or promoting some of the
content that's less popular that we
expect it to be more popular and so
forth but it also in actuality it's not
one-size-fits-all some users gravitate
towards certain types of content and
others towards other types of content so
it's really important that you drill
deeper to get business insights here and
that's what the filter up here allows
you to do this global filter control is
on all reports and firebase analytics
and that allows you to to drill any
reports and to filter them by different
user properties and audiences we saw
earlier the example of the Canadian
purchasers but user properties are
actually captured for you automatically
such as age gender device model app
version and more in addition to ones
that you can log yourself so if I want
to see what 18 to 24 year-olds are
buying in my app I can apply that filter
compare it to the 25 to 34 year-olds so
it's really quick it updates very fast
so you can go deep and drill and have
hypotheses and and try to discover new
things about your usage so it switched
back to the slides now
now as valuable as all this reporting is
some of you might have custom needs that
just can't be served by standardized
reporting and the good news for you is
that every prior based app can be linked
to bigquery which is Google's data
analytics data warehouse in the cloud so
you can perform custom analysis on it or
join it with external data or export it
to some external endpoint of yours to do
what you need with it so that
flexibility and power is there for you
as well so I feel like we've barely
scratched the surface we only looked at
two of the seven tabs but fontaine is
here to tell you more about how you can
grow your app using firebase analytics
so thank you
thanks Steve so while it's critical to
iterate on your core app experience as a
developer once you've got a strong
foundation it's worth thinking about
actually investing in driving engagement
with your users and that's why we built
firebase analytics to be a growth engine
for your app whether you consider
yourself a developer or a marketer so
we're creating opportunities for you to
boost engagement and grow usage with
your apps let's pick up with Transworld
endless skater where as Steve left off
and for the purpose of this presentation
you can go ahead and think of Steve as
the developer and me as the marketer and
while it's perfectly reasonable for
Steve as a developer to focus on growth
for his app firebase analytics also
works well for organizations where
there's a little bit more delineation
between roles so Steve talked to us
about how developers can measure events
but there's one type event of event that
he conveniently didn't mention and those
are conversion events or just
conversions think of conversions as the
key business drivers that you're really
trying to optimize your business around
optimize your app around so first opens
you can think of these like installs or
in-app purchases these are obviously
conversions so will automatically enable
those for you but different businesses
have different types of conversions and
so you can come in to firebase analytics
and mark any of your custom events to be
conversions in our UI you can do this
without writing any new code just by
coming over into the events tab and on
the far right column there's a section
that says enable conversion and you can
toggle it on for any of your events now
marking an event as a conversion this
unlocks a couple of features for that
particular event for example attribution
so you can start to understand which of
your channels are driving the most
those events for your conversions so
Steve instrumented spend the virtual
currency a couple minutes ago I know
that's a business driver so I'm gonna go
ahead and mark it as a conversion here
in the UI and when I mark it as a
conversion it gets added to the
attribution section of firebase
analytics this is another tab that
Steven didn't get to cover attribution
is really what I consider to be the home
base for the marketers that are going to
be using firebase analytics now on
Friday we're gonna be diving a lot
deeper into the attribution tab to
really understand how you can do cross
channel attribution so I'm not going to
go too deep on it now but the one thing
I do want to highlight is our lifetime
value reporting so our lifetime value
reporting or LTV reporting this is
exactly the type of thing that we're
trying to optimize for with conversions
so I really want to highlight this and
it's available on our dashboard and it's
available here in the attribution
section so let's talk about how we can
actually drive conversions rather than
focus on how we can do that with
Google's add products which of course we
can do I want to talk about how we can
actually reengage our existing users by
pairing firebase analytics with
notifications so firebase analytics and
notifications notifications are a really
powerful way of bringing your users back
into the app to drive a particular type
of engagement this is certainly true
with Transworld endless skater firebase
makes it incredibly easy to send
notifications on both Android and iOS
and like firebase analytics it's
completely free and unlimited and while
Steve didn't show this earlier it only
took him a couple of lines of code and a
couple of minutes to actually instrument
firebase notifications in his app and
just like that we're ready to send
notifications
but let's pause for a minute and think
about what that actually means in this
context with firebase we make it really
easy for you to engage in a conversation
directly with your users that's really
powerful but insert obligatory
comic-book reference here with great
power comes great responsibility
so we all know examples of apps who've
really just gone off the rails when it
comes to push notifications maybe
they're sending them way too frequently
and it starts to just feel spammy or I
can think of countless apps that just
send a one-size-fits-all notification it
really doesn't apply to me personally so
when you're a developer and you're using
notifications it's important that you
strike the right balance between
relevance and frequency and this is
exactly what you can do with firebase
analytics and notifications together so
let's look at how we can actually do
that in the context of Transworld
endless skater so first we're gonna want
to use those audiences that Steve
highlighted to actually craft a group of
our users so we can define certain
criteria will actually be walking
through this in a demo in a minute the
second is then going over to
notifications where we can craft the
content of the message figure out who
we're targeting what the copy is going
to be how often we're going to be
sending the message and then together
this allows you to tailor your messages
towards each of those groups
so back to transworld endless skater
Steve had instrumented that spend
virtual currency event earlier and the
great thing about it is that we're not
just capturing the fact that the event
happened we're capturing extra metadata
about that event as well so I can see
what the users are actually spending
their virtual currency on now this is
important because I want to be sending a
push notifications a push notification
to users who would actually be inclined
or interested in the content of this
message and specifically I'm interested
in adding a new level and one of the
things that you can spend your virtual
currency on in the game Transworld
endless skater is to unlock new levels
so when I'm sending my push notification
I really want to make sure it's targeted
at the right group my new level is going
to be called the rooftops and I'll be
sending a notification to a very
specific set of users to actually cover
this so I'm going to go ahead and dive
in at this point
all right so here we are on the events
section which is certainly one way to do
analysis but now I'm going to move over
to the audiences section first get this
filter up great
alright so now here I'm on the audiences
section you can think of audiences like
the way to slice and dice your users to
get certain segments of users you want
to focus on or analyze there's a couple
of different ways you can use audiences
one is to do reporting so I can see here
a list of all the audiences that I've
been creating over the last few weeks
and if I wanted to actually do reporting
and understand how they're behaving I
can just click on them to see a report
so here I'm gonna click on males 25 to
34 and I can immediately see a report on
them how many users are in that report
what's there are two demographics here I
can even see their interest like Steve
highlighted earlier so this particular
segment of users is interested in online
video and online games which is
reasonable considering this particular
filter that I added another way to use
audiences is to actually just apply it
as a filter Steve highlighted this
earlier but can be used across the
firebase analytics product and then the
final way that I want to highlight that
you can use audiences for is for highly
contextual targeting information and you
can target users across other fire-based
products but you can also target users
across across other Google products so
we're really trying to bring all these
products together with a single language
in firebase audiences so coming back to
transworld endless skater I said that I
wanted to add a new level and I want to
send a push notification to the relevant
users to actually encourage them to
spend their virtual currency to unlock
this level so I need to be thoughtful
about who my audience is actually going
to be so if I think that what's a
reasonable behavior that might indicate
that users could be interested
and unlocking levels in the future this
actually isn't a trick question it's
pretty pretty obvious right under eye
nose if users have spent to unlock
levels in the past it's probably pretty
reasonable that they'd be willing to do
that again so that's gonna be my target
audience that I'm gonna create right now
so if I come over into new audience pops
up this audience builder where I can
actually construct the conditions of my
audience now my audience name I'm gonna
say users who purchase level and then my
audience descriptions I'll say spent
virtual currency on a level now I'm
actually going to select the specific
criteria for this coming in to the
selector I can select either an event or
a user property we've seen a bunch of
user properties earlier and for my event
we just agreed upon that I'm gonna
select spend virtual currency then I
don't want to just target anybody who's
ever spent virtual currency I really
want to hone it down on that specific
set of users that spent virtual currency
to unlock a level and this is again
where those parameters come in right
Steve had added those three extra calls
those three extra parameters in the
actual event logging and when I add a
parameter you can see here are those
three parameter names that we saw Steve
instrument earlier so I'm gonna select
item name and my operator I'm gonna
leave this contains and I'll go ahead
and say level so I'm saying narrowing it
down to anyone who has spent on an item
name that contains level so at this
point I can hit create I actually
created this audience earlier so I'm
going to go ahead and use the audience I
created earlier this week so purchased
level two I'm piloting it right now this
is gonna be the audience that I'm
targeting so creating my audience that
was the first stage the next stage is
actually going in to create the
notification
so coming into notifications create a
new message and let's see get ready for
some fun
unlock level 3 now message label I'll
call it rooftops up cell since rooftops
is the name of this level and then in
terms of the delivery date I'm actually
launching this level tomorrow evening so
I'm gonna send this push notification
Friday so I'm scheduling it I can go
ahead and select Friday the 20th noon
seems like a reasonable time it might be
their lunch hour would be willing to
play games and I definitely want to
leave it on recipient time zone since I
don't want to hit somebody with a push
notification in the middle of the night
now I get to the targeting for app I
want this to be on my iOS app and then
I'll add one more criteria and here I'm
selecting audience and I can actually
see this list of audiences that we just
saw over in analytics because they're
the same so of all these audiences
let's see purchase level two at the
bottom here and I can see this
particular audience has between 1 and
10,000 users that seems right and I can
go ahead and add that target great a
couple of these things
let's see conversion events all right we
talked about this earlier this
particular widget is allowing me to
construct a funnel of these different
stages in the notifications process so
the first part of the funnel is going to
be whether or not the notifications are
sent then how many were opened and then
I get to define what that final action
is that the conversion should be so
we've already been talking about this
but of course it's going to be spend
virtually since that's the specific
action I'm trying to drive see and then
I don't have any advanced options so I'm
going to save this as a draft and let's
see
alright I'm just gonna go ahead and
schedule a message so I can see here
it's gonna get sent on Friday and it's
targeting that user segment scheduling
great so the message goes out how do I
know if anyone actually got the message
well analytics naturally can help here
as well so if I come back into my events
section see all my events I can see here
a couple of events notification
foreground and notification open though
those are among the automatic events
that Steve highlighted earlier I'm going
to click into notification open so this
is where I can see exactly how many
users actually opened my notifications
you can see I sent a notification last
week so you can actually see the spike
here as well as some of the ridge
residual opens that happened after that
so now I'm really looking at this
particular event but what's interesting
is over here I can see the relative
campaigns side-by-side one another so if
I wanted to click on this rooftops up
cell which is the message that I sent it
immediately applies this chip at the top
and now all of my dashboard is being
narrowed and and filtered down to this
specific group of users so it's cool to
be able to say all right let me see for
this particular event for this
particular notification how effective
was it and actually driving engagement
in my app so so far I've been talking a
lot about notification and analytics and
how they can be used together there's a
lot of cool places you could go with
that this is really just a beginning but
I'm going to step back for a minute and
talk about a couple other ways that you
can use some of the other firebase
growth tools for your app so let's move
back to the deck
Skyscanner a leading global travel
search business with over 50 million
monthly users put firebase in their app
and within their app you can do things
like book travel compare prices for
things like flights or hotels or even
car rentals and they decided to use
firebase invites to augment their growth
strategy they did this again in a couple
of different steps the first was
naturally identifying their most
valuable users with firebase audiences
and for them that was the users who have
actually made a booking through the app
before the second step was realizing
that those users were their target group
to actually target the firebase invites
with and then finally they used firebase
invites to allow those users to share
the app with their frequently contacted
folks using SMS or email so they did
this in a couple of different ways first
of all they asked their users to rate
the app and if the user rated it highly
they gave them the opportunity to share
the app via firebase invites the
recipients of these invites didn't just
receive a link to the app but when they
actually went on to download it and then
later open it they arrived at a specific
screen in the app they were deep linked
in after install so it was really able
to close the loop with the full
invitation experience and so users could
seamlessly share the app with their
friends and their most frequently
contacted peers
and within just two weeks Skyscanner saw
hundreds of personalized invites and we
already see them getting results they're
seeing strong adoption of the app from
the users who are coming from this
channel specifically so enough about
growth I'm gonna hand it back to Russ to
talk about how you can actually make
money with firebase
thanks Fontaine and thanks Steve for
showing us so much of what you can do
with firebase and firebase analytics so
I know I'd speak for the three of us
when I say that one of the things that
was the most fun about building firebase
was with collaborating with so many
expert teams across Google all focused
on the needs of app developers but when
it comes to making money with apps at
Google the team that you talk to is
AdMob so AdMob is synonymous with in-app
advertising and for good reason because
in-app ads are the number one
monetization mechanism for apps admins
a million apps monetizing with AdMob
today it's pretty impressive
but if you spend time with the AdMob
team and if you talk to experienced
publishers what you learn is that one
size fits all monetization is a thing of
the past different types of users
monetize differently which means the
more you understand about users and
users behavior the smarter you can be
about making money with your app and by
linking your firebase app to AdMob
you're paving the way to using both
products together to maximize your
earning potential so we're going to
return to to skate for just one more
minute and what we've seen is that Steve
showed us that skate monetizes using
in-app purchases but there's a lot of
industry data that says that only
between you know one and five percent of
users actually ever make an in-app
purchase that means that ninety-five
percent of these users are going
unmonitored now if this holds true for
skate that could mean there's a massive
monetization opportunity just waiting
for them now fortunately since skate
uses firebase analytics we don't have to
rely on a rule of thumb we can just look
at the data and so here I'm back on the
firebase analytics dashboard and I've
highlighted the monthly active users and
what I can do is basically apply a
filter here so Steve showed that in-app
purchase is one of those events that's
logged automatically on both iOS and
Android fontaine showed how easy it is
to use events to Bill
audience but since purchasers are so
important to so many developers firebase
goes ahead and creates a purchasers
audience for you and so when I apply
that as a filter
sure enough the number of purchasers
actually goes way down and that means
that there's a massive opportunity to
monetize so firebase can help us
introduce a targeted monetization
experience using remote config and to
tap that opportunity space particularly
when you bring firebase analytics and
firebase remote config together just a
quick example so we saw that skate uses
in-app purchase now we can go ahead and
use a remote config to control or and
set aside users to make sure that
purchasers never see ads next Steve was
called the developer earlier I'll stick
with it
Steve could add AdMob to the app he'd do
that by using the Google mobile ads SDK
which is part of the firebase SDK and
he'd build an ad placement say a banner
if he wanted to he could log another
custom event maybe in this case ad
clicks and then he'd wire up that ads
experience to be controlled with a
remote config so coming back he's
already set it up so his purchasers his
spenders are never gonna see ads now
Steve just needs to wire up the other
configuration target the group of users
that aren't his purchasers and now
they're experiencing ads and if that
feels a little aggressive maybe you
don't want to turn ads on all at once
you can control that too by adding a
percentage and just like that we have
multiple targeted monetization
experiences happening at the same time
and scape we hope you're excited so
firebase analytics is a really really
exciting thing for us we think it's
gonna be very powerful for developers we
I know we've covered a ton of ground and
we're just about out of time so just
want to leave you with a couple points
in summary firebase analytics is
completely free and completely unlimited
even for the largest of apps on iOS and
Android
it works out of the box with automatic
measurement that's easy to extend it's
seamlessly integrated within firebase
and
across Google all to help you develop
grow and earn so a couple of
housekeeping items we've got the sandbox
we have office hours we have another
firebase analytic session that fontaine
mentioned on growth scheduled for Friday
if you're looking for specific next
steps we would love for you to sign up
for firebase right now and start using
firebase analytics there's a lot of
great help center content and of course
we're ready to help you over in the
sandbox so on behalf of Steve and
Fontaine I just wanted to thank
everybody for coming out and enjoy the
rest of i/o</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
