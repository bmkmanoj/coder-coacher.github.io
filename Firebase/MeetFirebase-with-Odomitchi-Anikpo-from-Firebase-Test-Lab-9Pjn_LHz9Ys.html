I'd love to welcome you to the very
first episode of our show meet firebase
when you get to meet the people who make
firebase happen our first guest tonight
is with firebase test labs she's a
software engineer please welcome Oh
damici a nick PO hi Doug it's so great
to have you on the on the show it's my
pleasure to be here tell me o damici
what do you do with firebase test lab
well on test lab i'm a senior software
engineer and tech lead and i'm currently
working on providing even more insights
to developers who use test lab to test
applications in the cloud so there's you
know obviously you can test your
applications but it goes beyond that and
what do we really want developers to
take away from firebase test lab well
what we try to do is in part developers
to fully integrate testing within the
development process so allowing
developers while their coding in the
android studio ide to test their
application in a cloud too weak to our
web interface or also integrated with
the continuous integration process so
that they're aware of any regression
that may have been introduced with a new
build for instance sounds like it would
be really good for overall application
quality absolutely went to make use of
air base Tesla okay that's greatly so I
see you in the office all the time and
on video conferences but I don't think
I've ever got the chance to sit down and
talk to you about personal stuff so I'm
really curious where are you from I am
from Cote d'Ivoire also known as ivory
coast which is on the west coast of
Africa okay what's something interesting
about Ivory Coast that people don't know
well on an international level I because
is known for being the world first
producer of cocoa so if you had
chocolate today you very likely have had
the chocolate made out of cocoa
producing Ivory Coast oh and it's also
known for its incredible soccer team I'm
a soccer fan I oh I went to the World
Cup in 2010 too oh well it's we're 40
Mia Wow I don't really follow soccer I
follow hockey do they have a hockey team
any chance no probably not the right
place in the world for people to be
playing hockey so
I'll dash my hopes on that one so I also
understand it's a it's a french-speaking
nation right that's correct which
probably helps explain your accent which
i think is wonderful i love it thank you
what do you do when you're not working
on firebase test lab and when I'm not
working on the prior based test lab I
love hiking I love bicycle riding and
most of all I love to travel last year I
did a trip around the world so low that
was a very very amazing experience wow
wow so he went around the world solo
that's that's a very bold trip to take
isn't it very well because I don't know
if I could do that myself I'm kind of a
homebody I don't really travel a lot I
read a lot I travel for business and
that's about it so I'm kind of curious
what prompted you to want to take a trip
like this uh well sometimes a end of
2014 I had an opportunity to take some
time off work and you know and go travel
I was hesitant to do so but at one point
I recall thinking about a younger
version of myself and and that little
girl had really high expectations and
big dreams for what she would do when
she grows up and I thought if she was to
look at her you know future life future
life she would have been a little
disappointed and so that to me was
motivation to you know just get up and
go and just you know follow that dream
to to go on and discover the world wow
that's great you feel like you you sort
of met which you were you were trying to
go for there yes I felt like I did and
not only that I think it was just the
beginning I I really wanted to take away
and not just a motivation for the trip
was that I want to leave him you know my
life in a more Duchess manner and you
know leave bold easily yeah your blog
that you did is called travel live bold
comms oh that's correct yeah go check
that out a lot of beautiful pictures
both of the scenery and of you so i
would encourage people to to go check
that out if they're interested in some
of your destinations absolutely and i
will say i'll add you know for me it's
trouble but allergen you want to fill in
the blank for what it is their passion
is and you know and do it and follow it
in
continue to live pulled that's great
advice as much if you've traveled
certainly you have some connections back
home still all right yes yes absolutely
not too long ago just this past August I
I travel home to ivory coast and to a
beach and specifically specifically
which is my hometown and I got to meet
the google developer groups in in africa
so that was a very very nice encounter
to get to meet the developer community
in Ivory Coast who's extremely motivated
and you know asking about Google and
firebase and that was that was very nice
what kind of software development do
they do in the GDG they do primarily
Android development as you know Africa
is not just mobile first but it's pretty
much mobile only and employed is it's
primarily developed the development that
they do yeah I have a few more android
devices here I mean I can't sit on all
of them all the time so in fact I'm look
like I likes you a little bit
uncomfortable I'll put that one there as
well I know can I ask you why so many
devices what I'm doing this sighs well
you know there's your work device your
home device and then there's the one
that you keep in reserve in case
batteries get low because you can watch
videos good and then there's you know
the one that you know that has the
special you know camera in it that's
good for photos so I carry just a few
with me because you never know what you
might need right so oh yeah but you know
that's all I need for now speaking of
Android there was a big announcement
recently with firebase test lab what's
that tell me about that well hibiscus
lab is now available in firebase as park
plan which now allows developers to test
our application for free and without
having to provide a credit card or
having a billing account you're able to
test your application in the cloud 7th s
per day so this is great because you
said they don't need a credit card or a
billing account and that's been one of
the biggest at least my understanding
that's been one of the biggest barriers
to adoption is the moment you hit that
that paywall you're just you don't have
incentive to keep going right or correct
and and now you can pretty much go you
know go out there and try firebase test
lab right it's super easy and no need to
to sign up for you know for a book paid
plan and you're able to test your
application and what about people who
are already on a paid plan what happens
to their accounts nothing changes at all
people for people who are on a pay plan
okay okay so these are the existing
hourly rate for the fully played fully
paid plan stays the same correct you
know one of the things we talked about a
little bit was it firebase Tesla manages
all of your devices for you so for
testing if you have a bunch of devices
kind of like this you don't have to
worry about setting up that lab and
maintaining it or even just acquiring
all the devices could be its own
different problems so I'd like to play a
game to illustrate how that how that
ends up for some people so you want to
play that game with me sure tell me
what's okay so it's only playing it's a
bit of a physical challenge what I'm
gonna what I'm gonna get you to do here
is if you could let's see hold out your
hand on your knee so well like put it
out in front of you just one hand just
as one hand yeah yeah okay and hold it
flat I'm gonna give you a platform okay
and I trying to balance all these yeah
yeah so I'm gonna start giving you
devices and you if you could reach these
all right put as many of them on there
as you can okay and are we trying to
have as had a tower as possible yeah I
want to see how I'm gonna see how far
you get and these are like all different
Android devices I think well I have
normal is too yeah we're gonna have
quite a variety to deal with okay I'm
gonna switch hands yeah okay and I ended
lady has anyone tried this before I put
a few in a stack just to see how it
would look you're doing very good
already don't tell me they're more
device there's a couple more oh no I
have a couple here
I think I have I think I have a few more
yes hey good lookin out of bed Oh what I
love about Android is there are so many
different devices to choose from you can
get whatever you want whatever Hardware
you want whatever configuration you want
but it can't be kind of taxing for
developers to deal with all these
different device configurations and so
firebase test lab can make that testing
a whole lot easier so you don't have to
buy maintain and set up all these
different varieties so absolutely i hope
the game helped illustrate that a little
bit thank you so much for being on the
show it would make pleasure to be here
it was good having you as our first
guest good luck on your future travels
and for those of you at home be sure to
check out her blog on travel live bolcom
