photo sparks my favorite firebase
moments from 2016 hmm I think about that
one creating these videos ooh that's a
good one there were a lot this year one
of my favorite has to be presenting
firebase at the iOS dev UK conference in
Aberystwyth Wales everyone was super
friendly super positive they really
liked the talk which was nice because I
spent a lot of time on it and it was
just fine kind of being able to hang out
with everybody afterwards at i/o we
launched a new fire base and it was like
amazing we coded three apps on stage in
parallel that's something that I don't
think a lot of people had ever seen
before probably the best memory I have a
firebase was the big tent at i/o on
launch day just that swirl that was in
that tent was probably the best fire
guys moment top three moments for me
were probably joining Google Google i/o
and the firebase summit in Berlin my
absolute favorite moment from the entire
year was when I did the selfie in Berlin
I'm leaning back so far so I'm almost
falling down on my back and it becomes a
beautiful picture with all of the people
smiling in it my favorite memory is
presenting it and eMCON and showing the
room of developers how to implement FCM
from scratch in their client ups
everyone was just very surprised when I
worked the first time around they could
probably tell from my face that I was
even more surprised than me one of my
favorite parts about this year has been
launching the ask firebase show because
as soon as we launched that campaign we
saw this incredible reaction from the
community one of my favorite episodes
was David E's got a question from one of
the developers why he doesn't wear a
helmet when he skateboards he's been
following a lot so we were able to find
quite a lot of clips of him falling my
favorite part of releasing the firebase
course in partnership with Udacity was
just seeing those first enrollments come
in it was very exciting seeing something
come from just a small idea to a
full-fledged course the firebase
community is amazing these people are
passionate
about firebase as much as we are I think
what makes the firebase community really
special as the curiosity that you see in
it people are combining services in ways
that we never anticipated even even when
we were designing them sometimes they
are very vocal about things that we've
done that they don't like and at other
times they are the greatest advocates we
can have it's so great how supportive
everyone is of one another in the
firebase community these are really
dedicated fans whatever way they can try
and reach out to you they will in order
to give you feedback and that's very
unique to firebase I like to thank you
for being such an awesome developer
community holidays for my team debugging
loves being sung by a choir keep those
coding fingers warm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
