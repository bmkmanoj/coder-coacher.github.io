of meet firebase where you get to meet
the Googlers that make firebase hacker
my name is Doug Stephenson and on the
show with me today is the famous frank
van poppelen Frank hey Doc I'm good
thanks for joining me on the show
thanks for so what is you're wrong the
firebase team ooh
that's always interesting I often say
that I'm a firebase engineer at Google
officially I'm a developer programs
engineer which means that I have to
write code and libraries and things like
that but unofficially I do everything
else is everything else yeah so I go to
events I answer a lot of questions on
Stack Overflow and I also help organize
certain events you've been with the
firebase team for quite some time now
tell me about that well actually I
started using firebase five years ago
when it was in beta for the first time
then started answering some questions on
Stack Overflow about it and then someday
well andrew lee one of the founders was
like commenting on my my answer and said
great answer Frank and it's like yeah
right and then a few months later my
phone rang and James templum was like
hey we like what you're doing we think
you should do more of that how do you
feel about joining the team so and
that's right one thing led to another
and then I I joined the team it's an
interesting way to take it on board yeah
and it's right it shows that our area is
like also potential value in in
answering questions beyond just just
helping the people that you're helping I
mean you could make a career out of this
yeah you certainly could you've
mentioned that you love to help people
out there I actually I love to do the
same one of the places we go and you
mentioned this earlier is Stack Overflow
alright that's a great place to ask
programming questions both you and I do
this you probably more than myself doing
it longer you've been doing it longer
yeah I've been doing this for about a
couple years now I just crossed 21,000
points so that's not bad right not bad
well but what do you at now I mean
that's yes my number I think it's worse
in comparison to yours I think I was on
the hundreds of 64,000 for it okay but
I'm also one of those weird people right
I know my stego flow ID
I've memorized that one because I type
it so often
and I pretty much can tell you what
right when we were actually coming into
the studio we were chatting about an
answer on Stack Overflow right this is
that's what we are ya know it's
literally one of my favorite things to
do because right you see all the
diversity of developers using firebase
and right they all we all go to stack
overflow if we have a question same for
me and yes so that means that I also get
to see everyone I really like that yeah
you like it so much you have so many
points where does that put you in the
all time ranking on Stack Overflow so
they do a lot so it's very I would say
competitive but there's a lot of
incentive to do well right and part of
this that's a leaderboard and you can
see where everyone is on the week month
quarter and year at all time I'm not
sure why I'm on the all-time but for the
year I am somewhere in the top 20
overall so this is worldwide not just
firebase it's an any question right and
there's a lot of programming questions
out there oh yeah all are all of
computer science so it's kind of funny
you said you you you feel like you're
not very good at answering questions
which is funny because that's what you
do really well so why do you feel like
that what's what's what's going on in
your mind that makes you feel like you
don't you're not very good at it from
downtime
I do actually I think I'm pretty pretty
decent which is like a Dutch level of
compliment quite high praise for Adachi
but at answering a firebase questions or
technical questions in general it's
questions outside of technology where
I'm normally like I don't know why would
you care about that but I heard that you
might have prepared a few questions
outside of technology so we will see how
I just see we'll see but so if you if
you feel like you're not very good at
something how do you improve right
because you know you there's a certain
amount of humility and thing I'm not
very good but this on the other side it
you know like I when I started answering
questions on Stack Overflow I was I was
okay at it and I realized there's a
there's a way of phrasing things it's a
way of constructing an answer that's
better so a very very general sense how
do you feel like you improve yourself a
lot of data tech you repetition so right
I've been doing this for for firebase
about five years now I guess on Stack
Overflow and a lot of the problems that
developers encounter are still pretty
much the same right dealing with
asynchronous api's will never change it
will forever be a problem for people
that
new to it there's not a lot we can fix
about it in the product because if we
could that's what we would do so what
what you actually see is that I am
essentially constantly improving my
answer right so the first few answers
were probably like not very good but
then you find something where where a
developer actually is sort of like
understanding what you what you're what
you're explaining and then you just keep
optimizing over that now jumping out of
tech a little bit on an earlier show I
spoke with John birds with the
predictions team and I found out he's
into retro games I'm into retro games
obviously I talk about that a lot you
are too but in particular you are a huge
fan of pinball I am actually tell me
about that why pinball I have no idea I
think it started when probably I was a
kid like seven or eight maybe went on
vacation to to write France with my
parents and then found a pinball machine
right and just had my allowance and
essentially would throw that in pinball
machine every day and really learn to
enjoy the combination of the mechanical
into electrical and pure physics so it
was like slightly computer ish but not
really and of course that really changed
through the decades right pin balls have
evolved a lot oh yeah and and and just
growing along with those trying to
understand how things work but still
having the essentially constant fighting
gravity of a pinball machine that I
really like yeah so you've been playing
pinball for a long time but you've also
been working with technology for a long
time so I'm curious to know what was the
first computer you ever used to write a
line of code ooh
that's a tricky one I'm looking on your
shirt yeah it could be one of these
there's a variety of old classic home
computers it's likely one of the first
to so I think I wrote my first code on
the Commodore it might have been a
victim when T otherwise it was a 64 and
this was in the local mall right I would
go there on Saturdays yeah it used to be
that in for those of you don't know this
back in the 80s
home computers were treated sort of like
regular merchandise and they'd be
outfitted to play right and so you'd sit
there and type in a program in the
computer right there where they're being
sold I think I might still know some of
the poke locations with a Commodore 64
to change colors and things like that
yeah yeah the first one I owned was an
Atari an Atari 600 XL I have fond
memories of that I
wasn't necessarily a real developer back
then so I didn't know what he was know
so I was typing the games from these
magazine books and magazines but I
hardly made any like changes which is
really a shame because in hindsight I
wish and I recently started looking at
like are these books available online
and I found one and I've owned some of
these like long flights I've been trying
to make a basic interpreters for one of
these hmm it's surprisingly difficult so
I sort of write this this happens in
like two hour Sprint's that happen every
month or so so not a lot of progress but
it's really fun to do so so you're kind
of making an old and emulator
interpreter your basic you know what my
biggest problem has been handling
asynchronous inputs it's always always a
thorn in the side of developers for me
it was the Apple 2 I think is and then
my neighbors gave me a was a Texas
systems TI 99 for a I think it had like
like 4k of memory or something in the
cartridge and I saved my programs on
cassette well interesting you really see
the split here between your European and
an American teenager I guess yeah but we
had very similar experiences yes the
programs on books and magazines yeah
definitely something that I love yeah
things have changed a lot since then and
we've gotten to the point where now a
bunch of people can all type code into
different computers at the same time
sharing data in a firebase project all
projected on a big screen yeah or as you
like to say live coding mm-hmm so tell
me how did that come to be this whole
idea that you can do live coding on
multiple platforms and make a talk like
a session I don't know it's a good one
and so when I joined firebase right
before that I had been like an engineer
for 20-plus years and just working on on
codes had done public speaking but not
nothing big and then a firebase right
they told me that I was gonna be in
developer relations and I needed to
become like this speaker right
terrifying at first so I started looking
at what has everyone else been doing at
firebase and they all said oh we just
live code a web app it's it's easy and
they love it and it's like okay let's
see what they've been doing so I started
doing that right in the first time
you're terrified because you have to
really type something and it goes wrong
exactly it's embarrassing it turns out
actually it's actually one of the things
that that the developers in the room
actually loved right because it shows
that that it's not
necessary as rehearsed as as some other
talks might be now so I started doing
dance and then I very much remember I
was the first one in firebase to then do
an Android version of that talk it was
in droidcon Boston and right then
writing a complete app in like an hour
or something right that's what you have
and this is from file new project oh
really so you're starting with a clean
and blank slate like just the scaffold
they have a new project yeah and I love
doing that what they turned out is that
I was actually teaching people more
about Android development and about
firebase development at some point but
well that's helpful than Android exactly
so still not wrong and from that
actually then we write we got eye out
last year 2016 when we were launching
the write the new and improved firebase
and we had proposed to do a live coding
talk with a group of firebases
and then we were like yeah sitting in
room with Mike McDonald who some of you
might know it's like okay what are we
gonna do right and it's like well it's I
all we need to do some one better so
right we're gonna live code multiple
apps right for multiple platforms on
stage and we weren't really sure what to
do and then it's like write multiple
apps but yeah we can have like a time
problem and then we looked at each other
and it's like literally like we're gonna
write them at the same time so we
essentially got up walked out of the
room because we were done except that it
takes a lot of work and a lot of
practice to get that life that parallel
live coding working so that took a lot
of a lot of effort not necessary for the
story crafting was to be honest we had
been doing these types of live coding
demos for it for years with firebase but
for getting everything aligned across
the platforms there's a lot of work that
goes into that and also getting all the
speakers right to have the right pacing
that you want so it's it's really never
underestimate to work that it takes but
I love seeing the result I was really
proud because at the firebase from it
and I'm stem write was one of the first
times that I wasn't in in the zero to
app talk and I loved seeing what's what
the team did there it was a really good
job they did a great job well Kent Fang
was on the show earlier and she said it
was maybe one of her most viewed videos
ever yeah something like how many I
don't know oh those of you yes that is I
think it's probably the most watched
firebase video but it's also probably
the first
time that a lot of people saw this level
of life coding and I think actually it's
probably a really good explanation of a
few of the fire based products that we
have so still highly recommend that you
check it out yeah yeah so definitely do
that go to youtube we'll have a link in
the description below so you can get
right to that so definitely check that
out if you haven't already yeah
I'd like to thank you for being on the
show Frank it was great chatting with
you same here and be sure to stay tuned
right here to the firebase channel on
YouTube for more great video content we
have more episodes of meet firebase
coming with people who do things like
Frank and do additional thing so like we
have engineers coming we have other
folks in dev rel so definitely stay
tuned here subscribe if you haven't
already to get notified of new content
and I'll see you here next time thanks
