answer all sorts of firebase questions
on whatever medium us questions on we
take those questions we give you answers
it's a show let's get into it
hey folks my name is Abe Haskins I'm a
firebase engineer here in San Francisco
I'm here to talk to you about firebase
for unity if you haven't already seen it
at a getting started video for firebase
in unity it'll be linked below
but in the meantime I want to talk to
you about some of the great questions
we've gotten since we released the
firebase SDK into general availability a
few weeks ago also unrelated but if you
want to call me Abe that's great you
want to call me Abe a you want to call
me literally anything I'm ok with it as
long as it starts with an A and has some
letters after it we're all good let's
dive in that's not nice let's get
started with the first question from my
laptop battery's dead alright first
question on our last youtube video about
unity 7.1 asked can I use this to build
out WebGL games that I've developed in
unity and the answer is no you really
can't
since the firebase SDK for unity is
built on the Android SDK and the iOS SDK
we don't have the ability to build out
for WebGL or a Playstation 3 or some of
these other platforms at unity supports
you'll find that some of the features do
work and even in the editor they're
stubbed out so you'll be able to use
them and test your code and compile it
and everything like that but you won't
get the same functionality you would if
you built out the game for the device
thanks for your question next question
on the firebase mailing list deep pixel
asked why does my app report lib app dot
so cannot be found this is actually a
great question and it's related to
another issue we've gotten on github
from sakura 777 he said why is firebase
app not able to be found these issues
are both related to the timing of when
unity imports the dependencies it
requires to run the firebase SDK in some
environments you're just going to luck
out and you're not going to have to deal
with this but it just depends on your
specific game and your specific
operating system so what you can do is
one make sure you're on the latest
version of the unity plugin we've pushed
some changes that should help this for a
lot of people and two you can go in to
the assets folder and go to Play service
resolver Android resolver
and there's an enable Auto resolution
checkbox this is just gonna do some
extra things to help you get those
dependencies imported and help control
that timing so everything's gonna work
well for you right and if you do that
your issue should be solved thanks a ton
Sakura and deep pixel the next question
the next question is one we've been
getting a ton a lot of people want to
upload different assets for their game
into firebase cloud storage they want to
upload images and text you know all of
these great things movies etc etc all
those things you need for your game you
know you know the stuff they want to
upload those into cloud storage and then
retrieve them in their game and just you
don't use them in the easiest possible
way the firebase Unity SDK is really
good when you're dealing with these
storage assets because you have a lot of
control you can download them as streams
or you can download them as a byte array
but you don't have to really do all of
that if you're not interested in dealing
with those more complex flows the
absolute easiest way to get an asset out
of cloud storage rendered or consumed in
your game in some way it's used a triple
W package and they get download URL a
sync method that we offer with that
method you'll just get a normal URL it's
a public URL that you can consume and
hold down just like any other URL and
the triple W package in unity it makes
it really really simple to take that URL
download it and turn it into a material
turn it into an audio clip even a movie
so any of those assets you upload in
cloud storage or your users upload if
they're uploading profile icons or
anything like that you just pull them
down with triple W and you'll be good to
go if you want to find out more about
the triple W package or how it works
with the get download URL async method
you can check out our documentation or
the unity documentation both are great
resources for this thanks a ton for that
question
everyone who asked that I appreciate it
next question you guys have no idea how
much I spend on conditioner to get this
volume
and the final question the big one we
all want to hear about cloud functions
I'm sure you heard at Google next we
announced it's awesome think log
functions how does that work with unity
what can we do with these two things put
together and the answer is you can do
like anything if you check out the repo
we have we have a function sample repo
and this isn't specific to unity it's
just our general function sample repo it
has 26 different examples of things that
functions can do and every single one of
those you could do with the firebase SDK
in unity with cloud functions and that's
because cloud functions ties in to your
real time database it ties in to
analytics and storage and all these
other firebase services that are
supported in unity and it lets you
execute code and change things way back
on our cloud so you don't even have to
think about it so if you want a game
that interacts with an external API or
you want a game that has some custom
authentication that you've brewed up in
your awesome game development Shack you
can do this with cloud functions and you
don't have to worry about scaling or
anything like that so you can absolutely
use cloud functions with unity and it's
highly highly recommended to go check
out that repository it's got a ton of
different samples and every single one
work great with unity thanks for the
question
all right everyone thanks for watching
that's gonna wrap up this ask firebase
featuring unity if you have any more
questions obviously you can leave them
in the youtube comments below post them
on Stack Overflow tweet them on Twitter
with that hashtag ask firebase or
literally reach out to us in any way
tweet at me tweet a firebase shout it at
the top of your lungs near a Google
office we will hear it we will answer
your questions we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
