embody to join the summit as we know
alibaba.com is the leading wholesale
market place for global trade and the
connect buyers located more than 200
countries and regions around the world
to supplier milling based in China
Alibaba buyers and the sellers connect
around the world across the multiple
times own before we use the 5 based
Cloud messaging we find that many uses
who frequently experienced unstable
network connections did not receive
messages successfully that's why we need
a lotta fication solutions that could
library update users in multiple time
zones at a larger scale it's important
to our business that bias can state in
phone of critical updates including
messages inquiries planned for news and
promotions for example the 1111 festival
is coming soon in China this is the
biggest online shopping festival when
used when Paris can get amazing product
at a wonderful price so we need to find
a solution help us push the promotion
news to our buyers in other wives
luckily we find that FCM is the perfect
match for
alibaba to come the offer I push
notification of axiom is the solution f
them was easy to come by with the
existing system and we could completed
in only two days also seventeen percent
of our buyers are all Android so this is
a good solution and the skilled help us
develop or patrice more now with the fsm
token we are able to send a message to
user who are not resisted this is the
very important to us because most of the
new users come from google search are
not you just did but one to receive
notifications this is one of the use
case first could enable the
notifications after they log in here and
this enables case here by us are able to
choose to receive notifications when
after prior response
wait begin using GCM earlier this year
last month we were very excited to start
using FCM and feel very lucky to be one
of the first the users when we're using
GCM messages will send from our store to
GCM oh sorry to GCM and to enter plant
and then to our all our msgs database
before the notification was delivered
now using FCM we were able to enumerated
this message database so data messages
were standard director from officer to
fcm to andrew grant this FCM solution
was much more elaborate reliable more
secure and reduce our costs after
integrate after info integrating FZ my
alibaba com the notifications open rate
increased more than twenty percent
compared with before the engineer sorry
the engagement for user who received
notifications is four times higher than
user who visited website directory we
also improved user Japanese after using
FCM and the web believe this success is
because of FGM futures stable
performance and using deployment at last
