become firebase developers I'm Jim
person and today I'll show you how to
migrate from GCM to SCM Google Cloud
messaging or GCM has been a reliable
solution for sending billions of
messages a day that's right
billions firebase Cloud messaging is the
new version of GCM it inherits the
reliable and scalable GCM infrastructure
plus new features now if you're a
developer currently using GCM it can be
daunting to think about migrating to FCM
especially when you've already spent
time creating a great messaging solution
but I'll show you today that it takes a
little time and effort to get your
Android app up to speed and as Cloud
messaging continues to grow and improve
new features will only be available on
firebase Cloud messaging so why not
migrate today follow along as I migrate
an app from GCM to F Sam here's my app
that I'm going to migrate it displays a
schedule of sports ball games going on
each week as well as scores from
previous games on the back end it uses
an HTTP triggered function with a cron
job that is run once a day to send a
message to users reminding them about
the games to watch that evening and
summarizing the previous night's games
here's what the body of the function
looks like right now my function creates
an HTTP POST request sending a chosen
message to the given GCM token the
message is usually sports ball scores or
schedules which come from a database of
sports ball trivia now if you've seen
the guide for migrating from GCM to FCM
it may look like there's a lot to do but
when you break it down it's much more
manageable the migration process as I
see is threefold consul side
client side and server side so we're
going to tackle these one at a time now
as a side note if you're using this
video to help with the migration to FCM
I recommend you have the migration guide
open at the same time so you can copy
code snippets as needed this will be
much easier than trying to transcribe
the code I'll show you on screen you can
find a link to the
I blow okay let's get started first
console site in the fire base console
I'm going to select import Google
project I'll select my sports ball
scores from my list of projects and
select add fire base in the fire base
welcome screen I choose add fire base to
your Android app I'll provide the
package name and the sha-1 of my app and
then I'll add the app this downloads a
new Google services JSON file which I'll
add to the app and that's all I need to
do consul side to get my app up to speed
okay with the console ready to go let's
tackle the client-side changes this is
where we'll be making the bulk of our
changes well let's just dive in first I
import the Google services Jason I just
downloaded then I'll change the
dependency from GCM to SEM in my apps
build.gradle file next I'll remove
permissions required by GCM all
permissions required by FCM are added
automatically pretty cool I'll also
remove the receiver from the app
manifest again with FCM the broadcast
receiver is added automatically all
right get this those are the main code
changes required to use FCM in my
Android app that's it from here I can
just remove any other code that was once
required to use GCM but there are
several features of Cloud messaging your
app may be using that will require some
changes rather than just removing all
the code I'll show you how to make these
changes with my app sports ball scores I
currently use an extension of instance
IDs listener service now with FCM this
extension is only needed if I want to
access the FCM token and I need this
token if I want to let's say manage
tokens from a server so I can send
directly to a device or to subscribe
devices to topics from a server in my
case I do want to be able to send
specific devices so I want to extend
this service but you may not have to
depending on the needs of your app but
I'll show you what that
looks like now I'll update the instance
ID listener service code in my apps
androidmanifest
to use SEM and now I'll update my
instance ID listener service like this I
no longer need to explicitly initiate
the generation of a registration token
the SEM library does this automatically
for me so I can just remove this code
okay let's take a look at what else we
might have to change a service extending
the messaging listener service is now
required only if your app receives
messages with a notification payload
while the app is in the foreground
receives messages with a data payload
only or receives errors in case of
upstream message failures meaning if you
don't use any of these features you can
completely remove this service I'm going
to include this extension so that users
can get updates from sports ball scores
when the app is open so let's look at
that now so I'll make the necessary
changes to my Android manifest and
update my GCM listener service to my FCM
listener service extending firebase
messaging service r-right we're almost
done there's one more change that you
will want to make to your client app if
your app uses GCM pub/sub to send
messages to topics you'll want to update
this code as a side note for users who
are subscribed to topics on GCM I
recommend you subscribe them to those
topics on fcm while GCM tokens topic
subscriptions will continue to work in
most cases subscribing fcm tokens will
help to avoid any edge cases and
subscribing the FCM tokens will not
generate duplicate messages so you don't
have to worry about accidentally
spamming your users with double messages
I want users to be able to subscribe to
sports ball score notifications for
their favorite teams so I'll include
this in my app and when I update I can
take advantage of some features of that
Sam first of all sem subscribe to topic
method doesn't block the current thread
the operation is automatically performed
in a background thread meaning you won't
need to make
threads as you did it with GCM second of
all the operation is stored and
automatically retried in the case of
connectivity issues finally the token
that was required with GCM is now
automatically created in FCM
using the sender ID specified by the
firebase project and the changes I'll
make in my app are just a couple lines
of code here I'll show you in my GCM
pops-up function I'll change my
functions for subscribing to topics with
this function san francisco sports ball
fans can subscribe to updates about
their team all right now the console is
set up and my client app is ready to go
the final changes I need to make are
server side I'll need to update to a new
more secure server key which I can get
from the firebase console and change my
HTTP call to use the FCM endpoint let's
do it in the firebase console under
project settings Cloud messaging I'm
going to download the service account
credentials then I'll drag the JSON file
into my project this may seem like extra
work but it's worth it to get the
enhanced security that service account
credentials provide since the access
tokens are short-lived lasting about an
hour the risk posed by leaked access
token is much more limited then I'll
replace the GCM API key with this
service account key I'll update my HTTP
header to use this access token
I'll also update my HTTP endpoint to FCM
and then redeploy my function now I'll
run my app trigger the function and here
you can see the latest sports ball
scores now that I've upgraded my app to
use FCM I can take advantage of new
features like topic conditions and
platform overrides I can create topic
groups that send teams specific
notifications based on which games the
users care about there's so much more to
do the content could fill several fire
casts in fact that's not a bad idea
since you've migrated to FCM be sure to
subscribe to the firebase channel so you
can find out when there are new fire
castle on FCM and check out our other
great videos on firebase I'll see you on
a future episode of fire casts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
