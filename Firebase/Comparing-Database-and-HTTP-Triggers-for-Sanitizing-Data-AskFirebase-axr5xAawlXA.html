of hash tag ask firebase the show where
we answer your burning firebase
questions I'm Jenn person now let's get
started with Rob stabber
I would say for us the Bronx all right
cool so bra on Twitter wants to know how
can I learn firebase please give me a
link to some tutorials well the good
news is I know of a great tutorial made
by an awesome person it's called fire
baseman weekend and you can check it out
on you Daphne's website and we have the
link below thanks for your question
okay hit me with your next question
magnets on Twitter wants to know is
there a way to listen to a specific rap
and storage with cloud functions for
firebase thanks Magnus that's a great
question and the answer is no there
isn't a way to attach a listener just to
a file or folder within your storage
bucket but what you can do is set up
another storage bucket attach that to
your project and then listen to changes
in that bucket alone thanks for your
question it's just in the next question
now taro on twitter asked sometimes I
get an econ reset error when converting
an image using cloud functions I
returned the promises just like in the
example what should I do now that's a
good question taro this actually comes
up for a lot of developers because it
can be difficult to manage a whole bunch
of promises at once we have a couple
resources that you can check out we have
a youtube video talking about promises
and we also have a blog post and links
to those are below and those should help
you out thanks for your question
move it on to the next question now Eric
on Twitter would like to know how do I
remove a node from the database using
cloud function thanks for your question
now the answer really depends on what
kind of trigger you're using so if you
are using a database trigger the way you
can delete information is using event
data ref or event data admin rep if you
would like to delete data from a
different part of the database then
you're going to want to use the root
property of the ref and then build a
path from there now if you're using some
kind of other trigger then you're going
to want to use the firebase admin SDK to
access the database thanks for your
question another question this next
question comes to us from YouTube and it
says instead of using a database trigger
to sanitize incoming data why not use an
h2
TP trigger to handle and write the
sanitizing now the answer is there are
pros and cons to both methods let's take
a look at HTTP triggers if you're
already using an HTTP client library
that you're familiar with then it may
make sense just to stick with HTTP
triggers now a disadvantage of using
HTTP triggers in this way is that it's
difficult to handle retries so if that
connection gets cut off you really don't
know what information has been committed
and you don't know if you need to retry
again an advantage of using database
triggers is connection management is
taken care of you only have to write
once and you can be confident that it
will sync when the connection is good
thank you for your question
next question ah SIL see you on Twitter
asks how can I get the full URL of an
HTTP request in a cloud function trigger
an HTTP trigger contains a request
object and a response object the request
object contains the properties of the
request that was made by the clients the
response is where you send the results
back to the client so check out the
documentation on the request object to
see what properties are available on it
including the URL and of course the link
is below thanks for your question well
that's all we have time for for today
thank you so much for submitting your
questions and if you would like to see
maybe your questions answered here then
go ahead and submit them with the
hashtag ask firebase and I will see you
here next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
