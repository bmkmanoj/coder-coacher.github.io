when you get to meet the Googlers that
makes firebase happen my name is Doug
Stephenson and on the show with me today
is good a good car today thanks for
joining me on the show thanks for having
me what have you been working on lately
I've been working on the Android SDK of
firebase performance monitoring tool ok
firebase performance monitoring so
that's new right that's and it's also in
beta yes we just recently launched it in
Google i/o 2017
yeah and it's in beta right now ok and
so how does it help developers build
their apps it helps you monitor the
performance of your app as its name
suggests like if you just integrate the
SDK into your app you get to monitor how
your app is performing performing with
respect to the launch time the time it
takes to make a particular Network
request and what the size of the network
requires like was the payload size was
ridiculous size response size and
everything ok it sounds like this is
information that developers can use to
improve the perceived performance of
their apps that right yes so this SDK
lets you collect data from different
regions of the world how your app is
performance in different regions also on
different types of devices so you know
the Android world is fragmented right so
there are different set configurations
of the devices sorted out there in the
market so once your app is launched in
the market you don't have any idea how
its performing from performing on
different sections so this SDK gives you
a picture how it's doing all over the
world on different kind of devices ok it
sounds like you'll be able to track down
which devices or may be performing
poorly and then focus on those or maybe
even find out it sounds like maybe some
parts of the world your app might not be
performing very well and focus on that
experience as well ok we'll have a link
to that in the description below so you
can check that out so you are from India
right yeah at what part of India I'm
right from the centre of India not blur
not poor yeah I actually just got back
from India I was in Delhi and Pune for
some firebase events I discovered in
India it's very hot yeah
in fact neck what is one of the hardest
cities in India recently I think the max
temperature was about renovating the
user site that's
scorching I also discovered that
was really into Android there it seems
to be a very popular development
platform right on Android you can get
started with Windows Ubuntu Linux or Mac
whatever you have with you and then you
can just click circle bit how did you
even get into computer science
there's bit of a study actually started
with mechanical engineering in Pune
intensity but I flung the first year No
so to continue my education of the
delimited educational fund my dad has
set up for me I had to go back to Mac
port which is like less expensive than
Pune so I went back to Nagpur but not
putting city allowed only admissions to
information technology for students so I
had to take admission into information
technology I was kind of forced to
information technology right but then I
got introduced to programming and just
start with loving it okay so you're
forced into it but you ended up I ended
up liking it well well I'm glad that
worked out for you how did you get
involved with the firebase team after
that it's starting to wonder years ago
then they added a bunch of products into
power base family and I started
experimenting with different SDKs and
then picks couple of bugs onto their
Android UI SDK and then part it will be
interesting to work on this products day
in and day out so I reached out the
couple of teams in firebase came across
five ways performance monitoring tool it
was just getting started and then I
thought it's gonna be interesting to
work on well I'm glad you're on the team
I'm sure your efforts are greatly
appreciated also your father you have a
four year old son and I imagine he must
be a handful he is a handful yeah and
every day is getting tougher so it
sounds like you have a lot going on in
your life with working on firebase and
having a four year old son but you also
play musical instruments I'm curious to
know what you play I started with piano
role in Indian food and also harmonica
okay I have a harmonica here with me
right now
then.who show us how do you play
harmonica because I used to have one
when I was a kid and I never learned how
to play well so I'd be curious to know
how it works
just like
all right nice thanks for that
demonstration I always felt that
harmonic is kind of a unique instrument
it seems to be much simpler and you can
put in your pocket at the end of the day
yeah I was surprised to know that it
makes sound when you blow in and blow
out as well when I was killed I only
thought that you had just blow N but
then a friend of mine taught me that you
can blow out as well to make different
notes okay that's all right so that's
how you learn to play is through a
friend yeah oh I don't know how to find
a harmonic instructor so I guess a
friend would be you have one now
oh no ha well I'll get lessons from you
after the show thank you now that you've
been on the firebase team for a while
what do you feel makes it special or
different for you I hope other
developers to make great apps
that's what excites me every single day
because my core decides on millions of
devices and then I need to be extra
careful not to bake those devices every
single day right yeah it's pretty much
exciting yeah millions of devices and
you think about you know all those
devices on the planet it's it's running
your code and try it it is it's a lot of
pressure in one way but I imagine
appreciate the challenge exactly yeah
so that's exciting well thanks for
sharing that I have one more thing for
you today it's a game sometimes we do a
game with the people who I'm
interviewing and since you work in
firebase performance monitoring I
figured out asking some questions about
performance in computer science I have a
few questions we'll see how many you get
right and let's get started right now so
first question which is more efficient
inserting an element at the beginning of
an ArrayList or at the beginning of a
linked list I would say at the beginning
of the linked list the beginning of the
linked list yeah you just put that node
taking the center of interest right yeah
with an ArrayList you'd have to copy all
the elements to the back ok good job
it's like a question what is the Big O
complexity for finding an element in a
binary tree in the Biography yeah it's
log n log N and being being a little
fundament symmetry right
alright third question which sorting
algorithm has N squared algorithm
complexity in the average case your
choices are a quick sort bubble sort and
merge
our bubble size bubble sort yeah it
seems like N squared performance is
really not that great at least as far as
sorting algorithms are concerned as
available you know yeah yeah it's it's
it's easy to implement though but the
follow-up question to that is what's the
best-case complexity for a bubble sort
best-case we are with an order of N and
what's the situation there why would
that be order n well then that is it is
target okay yeah when the array is
already sorted you don't have to do so
many comparisons all right good job the
last question is which of the following
does not improve the runtime performance
of a hash table when your choices are
pre allocating its capacity to the
number of items that will contain or
using a hash algorithm with fewer
collisions or sorting the items ahead of
time this egg does not gray does not
improve that's right the third one third
one so yeah sorting the items ahead of
time doesn't actually give you any
benefits hash hash she was pretty random
right at least you hope it's random so
sorting doesn't actually help anything
good job today you got five out of five
I don't think anyone's ever bested one
of my quizzes there so good job with
that way congratulations and thank you
