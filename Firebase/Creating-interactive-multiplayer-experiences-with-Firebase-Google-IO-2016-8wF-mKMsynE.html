session of the day at least for this
room this is creating interactive
multiplayer experiences with firebase my
name is Mark Mandal or mark Mandal
depending on how much of my Australian
accent decides to come through at any
given moment first of all let me just
say thank you very much for standing in
such a long line for such a long period
to come see me speak I really appreciate
the effort but let's get going let's get
started talking about multiplayer games
with firebase let me get a little sort
of sense of the room about who you all
are before we get any further those
people here who have used firebase
firebase developers okay about Xavier
cool those people in the room who are
game developers main hobbyist game
developers that's okay I'm one of those
it's totally fine excellent all right
wonderful
okay so we're gonna talk about
multiplayer games with firebase before
we do that what I want to do is just
basically set up a very simple base line
around firebase to the world on the same
page it may well be information you may
have heard previously but that's okay
it means the world in the same place at
the same time so what is firebase as you
heard this morning it's a suite Avena
gated integrated products designed to
help you develop your app or in this
case game hope you grow a user base and
help you earn money what does that
really mean the way I like to look at
firebase is back-end as a service so
what does that mean that means when I
sit down when I use firebase it gives me
a variety of tools and services so that
when I interact with it the only thing I
need to worry about is writing
client-side code right I only need to
worry about writing code for my game and
I don't need to worry about how many
servers I need to spin up in the backend
for like a multiplayer system maybe I
need database replications I don't need
to worry about any of that sort of fun
stuff
with the new release of firebase we've
got now a
lighter and more varied group of tools
and it gives us some really cool
utilities that were able to take
advantage of in a gaming context so what
I'd like to do with you today is
basically build a game I want to build a
multiplayer game and use that game to
sort of show off some of the cool things
that you could do with firebase like
previously but also some of the cool
things you can do now within your
release sound good I got some notes
awesome so I thought to myself what is
like the simplest game that I could come
up with that I could turn into
multiplayer game and I turned around and
I was like okay rock-paper-scissors
that's a pretty simple game most people
should know this for most people will
know this I would expect rock beats
scissors scissors cuts paper paper
covers rock
which quite frankly never made any sense
to me and it's a very simple game that
you may well have played during your
childhood so we can turn this game into
a multiplayer game right but then I
thought that's kind of boring we can
probably do something a little bit more
fun now cloud vision API we sorry a
Google cloud platform we have this API
called cloud vision API I'm not going to
go too deeply on it but one of the
things that can do is take a photo or
you can send it a photo of somebody's
face you may have seen it in the murder
booth from the cloud vision demo in our
Google cloud platform booth but you can
send it a photo of someone's face and
it's able to say hey is this person sad
is this person happy are they surprised
what sort of emotion do they have so I
thought to myself rather than
rock-paper-scissors why don't we make
happy angry surprised wherein we can
have a multiplayer game where it takes a
photo of the user determines their
emotion and based on the rules are about
to outline they win or lose the game
sounds like fun cool so the rules are as
follows happy beats angry surprised
beats happy and angry beats surprised
did you follow that
okay in case you didn't let me go
through that again so happy beats
angry surprised beats happy and angry
beats surprised cool this is pretty much
the game that we're gonna build in a
multiplayer context I built it myself I
built a little web application because
that's kind of what I'm used to firebase
itself is you've heard supports iOS and
Android as well and to a lesser degree
unity if that's something you're into I
know a lot of people aren't but I built
it with HTML it's like really boring
JavaScript some of which I'm going to
show you which is a bit more interesting
the UI is all material design Lite I'm
able to use some of the user media
facilities within the browser to get the
webcam all that sort of stuff it's all
pretty straightforward so the basics of
the gamer like this up in the top
right-hand corner there is a login
logout - authentication functionality
over on the right hand side there is a
group chat so we can every good
multiplayer needs a good group chat in
the section that's entitled open games
we have some matchmaking functionality
there and over on the left what we have
is as you can see me playing this game
by myself because I live a sad state of
existence and have no friends but
hopefully we can change that today we're
in I'm able to play this game it will
give me a countdown and it will show me
the photo of my face that it is taken
sent off to cloud vision I determine the
emotion as well as the the picture that
it is taken of the other player who's at
the other side of the Internet
and then it will tell me whether I have
won or lost it's cool we've got a bit of
a good idea about how the game works
excellent so what I'm gonna take you
through now is basically some code to
show you how this all works how you use
firebase and how cool it is and how easy
it is to get this all up and running on
firebase without having to worry about
back-end infrastructure of any kind so
first thing first we need to be able to
access firebase right we need some kind
of credential to give us access this is
really straightforward quite literally
you go to the firebase admin you say hey
I want to
for web or iOS or Android in this case
this is the web version and it gives you
a snippet and you copy/paste it and you
put it in your code and you're done
so I put this in my in the JavaScript of
my game and now I'm good to go
I have access to all the things with
inside firebase I have to include the
SDKs and stuff as well on the page but
that's easy enough but this is all the
configuration all the security stuff I
need to get started and now I'm able to
access all those services that firebase
gives me so excellently I now have
access to firebase I can do some fun
stuff
okay multiplayer game time let's
actually build something so the first
part I think of just about any
multiplayer game is identity who is this
player we need some kind of
authentication mechanism so within this
game up in the top right hand corner you
saw there's a login button and so when I
thought to myself what sort of
authentication do I want I thought okay
I want a username and password just a
field that they can log in to manually
great but I also want them to be able to
log in by Google using OAuth
authentication those are the two things
I want how do I do that I don't have a
back-end I don't have anything like that
what's nice firebase has got this great
thing called firebase off what that
means is it's able to give you some
tools and utilities to make logging in
super super simple right if anyone's
done 200 stuff by hand no fun right out
of the box it gives me all thoth
indication for Google Facebook github
Twitter and it also gives me the
facilities to do username and password
as well as anonymous access and what's
really nice is it does all my session
management to write creating secure
tokens for my users and also doing
password recovery and e-mail
verification and this is all without
having to set up a back-end of any time
this is no custom code it just hands it
to me what's really nice in the new
version of firebase as well is you can
now also do federated login so if one
day I want to sign in with my Facebook
account and then the next day I want to
sign in with my Google account I can
write a small snippet of code to link
those two together and suddenly firebase
is like oh cool this is
the same user awesome so let's actually
have a look at some code to see how
simple this is to actually use so here
we have some code for creating a user
with a email and password and it is
basically exactly as you would expect it
to be the nice thing to kind of look at
here though is a user inside firebase is
not just a username and password there's
a bunch of extra data we're able to add
as well here we're adding the display
names or like first-name lastname to the
profile not just the username and
password which is great so we can add
extra information this also will
actually login the user when they when
they create the user which is just a
handy nice thing to have
so say they've already created a
username and password and they want to
log in well it's just as easy as calling
sign-in with you superhuman password no
backends no session management none of
that sort of fun stuff if I want them to
be able to log in with Google firebase
comes with a series of oath providers
this here is the Google auth provider
where it's able to take the canonical
way that you would log in with Google
from create essentially like an
abstraction over a credential and then
log in with that value and this way I'm
able to do all off really really nicely
so I'm able here now to log in with
either username and password Google or I
could easily add other services later on
as I so desire one nice thing that
firebase does that I want to mention
because it's a really good best practice
if you were a firebase user of old you
may recognize this as an auth is the
idea of an auth state change listener
basically this is ahead a little bit of
code that gets run whenever your
authentication state changes this is a
great best practice because this gets
run regardless of which fourth provider
you're using so if you've got common
operations as I do such as enabling chat
once a person's logged in or enabling
them to join a game I can do it in this
one particular place and then if down
the line I want to add Facebook or
something else
I don't have to change my code makes
things very very simple so it's a really
great thing to have a look at excellent
all right so I've set that up let's have
a little demo so here's my little game
oh I've got it just into Windows my left
one is a private one I'm gonna create
myself a new user I can look in I will
create an account I will do that again
apparently I click too hard I will call
my new user David because why not i will
use my domain so that no one gets spam
great excellent
and now we are logged in what is extra
specially nice is if I come over to the
new firebase console and i refresh this
here like excellent of course it did let
me refresh the page now let's go home
I can now see that David a compound
theory my new user is now set up again
no back-end this is something that
firebase it just gives me out of the box
without me having to worry about it
wonderful
okay so we have authentication perfect
everything is golden let's talk about
chat pretty much any multiplayer game I
have ever played has some sort of chat
component otherwise how would you make
fun of the people that you're playing
with so let's look at chat it's also a
really easy way of looking at how we do
real-time data within firebase so it's
pretty straightforward stuff within the
game it's exactly as you'd pretty much
expect it there is a display name
there's the information that the person
is sending along with the chat nothing
particularly special how do we do this
in firebase for those of you who have
used firebase before I'm guessing you
probably know the answer but firebase
has a thing called firebase real time
database it is super super super cool
probably one of my favorite features of
firebase it is a no sequel database if
you thought of it as a giant JSON blob
that you're able to interact with didn't
be pretty much on the money the cool
thing about the firebase real time
database though is you're able to turn
around to it and say hey this particular
part down the Jason tree whenever that
particularly popped that particular part
changes in some way could you let me
know and without having to worry about
WebSockets or some kind of socket
implementation or protocols or anything
like that firebase is able to tell you
that information in relative real time
normally I get asked like performance
like how quick is it I don't know them I
like to refer to it as none FPS real
time so yeah there's a little bit of
latency there if you're doing something
like card based or turn-based maybe some
kind of role-playing game it fits really
nicely we actually have a really nice
case study roll20 it's on the firebase
website where they do virtual board
games using firebase works really really
really well okay so let's have a look at
some code and see how this actually
works and you'll see how relatively easy
this
is so first place we start is we have a
reference in this particular case it's
what's called a database reference and
it is quite literally like we're in the
tree do we want to stick this stuff like
where do we care about from here here
we're gonna put everything under the
chat node from there we have some values
we want to be able to store in which
case it's the names of the display name
of the user and we want the message that
comes from an HTML message field and we
tell firebase push this in at this
particular point what that does is it
tells firebase hey could you append this
to the list of values that are at chat I
know so can you give it a unique
identifier at this point what's nice and
clever about the unique identifier is in
firebase is there automatically
chronologically ordered so you never
have to worry about sorting by timestamp
which is super super handy but that's it
that's all I need to do to get my chat
message into firebase that's important
cool so then how do we turn around a
firebase and say let me know when this
chat message comes in because I'd like
to display it on the screen right that's
also pretty straightforward so we have a
ref like we did before but what we have
as well is from that ref we say on on
basically signifies for this reference
point for where we are in the database
for there tell me something whenever
some of these particular changes and
there's a variety of different types of
changes you can look for here I'm
looking for child added which is as you
probably expect whenever a child gets
added to that list
tell me about it and we're gonna get a
snapshot of that value here in that
message you can see they're been through
some Dom manipulation were able to add
that to our screen and we can see it
right there
and that's all the work that we needed
to do to get that to display case you
don't believe me let's play so here I
have my fake user named David he is
gonna say hello we are gonna see it show
up on both sides at about the same time
excellent and we do we can see that chat
message goes in both places it'd be
dreadfully rude if we didn't
bond we can see that works pretty
quickly it's quite nuts excellent all
right so we have chat working that's
great
wonderful okay so we have some real-time
events sweet let's move on so this is
where we get slightly more complicated
let's do some matchmaking let's let a
couple of players find each other in
this crazy crazy world so that they can
play a game within this game I went with
very basic matchmaking one person
creates like an open game there's a list
of them and another person can join them
I'm not doing anything like bucketing on
skill level or anything like that but
that doesn't mean that you necessarily
could like not do that you can totally
do that
totally works but I just went really
simple just to show out show how it
works so before we get too deep into
that I'll show you the basic structure
of what a game looks like in my
implementation a game has several
properties it has a creator right the
person who originally created the game
we take their display name we take the
unique identifier for that user once a
person has joined that game there is a
joiner funnily enough with the same
details display name use a unique
identifier and we're also tracking a
state on the game if anyone's written
sort of messaging protocols or anything
like that this may look familiar here we
can specify whether it's opened
whether it's joined and we can also
we'll have some other states as we go
along so when we want to create a game
it's very similar to how we had it
before we had a ref but in this case I'm
just gonna put it in games we grab a
bunch of data from the user create
ourselves a game object and then we push
it in exactly like we did with in the
chat program now we have a game in that
in that game list we have somebody who's
gonna want to be able to join that game
we have a couple of interesting problems
that we're gonna have to solve before we
can jump straight into that first
problem we need to solve is
what happens when two players join at
the same time that's no good we could
run into all sorts of fun things data
could get corrupted one player thinks
they're playing but the other one is all
kinds of bad stuff this is a pretty
normal matchmaking type of problem what
we'd ideally like to have is make sure
that this can never actually happen what
we want to have instead is let's have an
atomic operation that no matter what one
person will join and then the next
person will join no matter how like
quickly two people can try and interact
with the same game object at the same
time what's nice is firebase has
something that allows us to do that so
first thing we do in this scenario is we
start with a reference but here I've
taken the unique key for that game and
created a reference from that
so basically we're saying every point
that we interact with from here on we
only care about this this decipi game
just this specific one it's all we care
about and firebase has this wonderful
thing called a transaction what that
essentially means is for that block of
code this is the only connection that is
going to be able to interact with that
particular game at that given moment so
we're able to do stuff like okay since
they're there one and then the other we
can say oh maybe someone tried to join
just before me so let's check for them
and if they're already there we'll
ignore it
maybe we'll do a pop-up saying oops
sorry come back again next time
something like that but if not then
we're able to add that join your
information we were looking at
previously move the state on to join and
then when we return that value out of
that transaction that's what eventually
gets stored in the database it makes it
a Tomic and it makes things like
matchmaking super super easy because now
we don't have to worry about two things
running into each other at the same time
there's one other fun thing that we need
to look at which is that this isn't
exactly like the chat application when
we want to actually display it on screen
and see what's happening in that we
don't want to show every game
within that list because some of them
might be in progress some of them might
be halfway done we don't want people to
be able to join games in between so we
need to be able to do some filtering on
that on reference that we were talking
about previously what's great is we're
able to do that so sweet
we're able to turn around to that ref
that we looked at with games previously
we do a order by child which basically
says take that state like child property
we want before and filter it to be equal
to State Open and what we get back there
is essentially a ref it's the same as it
was before from there we're able to do
pretty much exactly like we did
previously we add child added and then
we're able to do some fun stuff like say
hey if this is my game that I created
like let's ignore that but otherwise
just add it to the screen like you would
do normally with some Dom manipulation
so that someone can then click that
button and join that game they're able
to do some reasonably complicated things
with firebase right out of the gate
which is really nice from there
we also need to handle it when a game is
removed so maybe it moved from the open
state to the join state when somebody's
actually joined a game what's super nice
we have on we have a child removed on
Handler right so when we can get that
but what's great is it's not just if
like a child gets deleted because we've
got this filtering thing on it as well
if the state changes and it drops out of
that filter as far as this is concerned
it's been removed so it makes it really
simple to deal with state changes and
having like your dumb change or your UI
change based on that sort of thing cool
so that pretty much takes how we do
matchmaking I'm not going to demonstrate
that right now just because if I do that
then we'll actually start playing a game
and I want to save that for later but
using transactions and those features
like filtering we can build some pretty
complicated matchmaking programs quite
easily it's really nice and again no
back-end yeah
okay so let's talk about how I built the
more intricate pots of the game so we
talked a little bit about game state
before this is basically the entire game
state or the flow of it as it goes along
so a game gets created it is opened
somebody joins the game we move to
joined at that point a countdown happens
and we move to taking a picture and they
actually take a picture up from their
webcam that picture then gets uploaded
somewhere which we'll talk about in a
bit and we move to upload a picture we
send that off to cloud vision API so
that we can get an emotion back from it
and we that is face detected and then
finally once we've got the information
we compare it with our rules for our
game and then we are done we are
complete what does that actually look
like in code it actually comes out quite
nicely
I know I've kind of mugged it up on the
screen just to make it fit but it works
quite nicely within firebase
because what can we do there is we have
that game referee were talking about
like we want to look at this particular
game and we can do an on value and what
that means is hey firebase tell me
whenever this game changes that's all I
want to know I'm from there we can do a
basic switch statement to say depending
on the cam the state that comes back
from this game do this particular thing
we can treat it like some sort of
messaging protocol essentially so when
we've joined the game we run the join
cane function take a picture a countdown
uploaded we display the uploaded picture
as well as send it off to for detection
once the face has been detected we
display the emotion and determine who
the winner is and then when we move into
complete we show the winner and then
we're done so we're able to do some
pretty complicated reasonably
complicated game logic using just these
on handlers within firebase
so let's dig down into actually taking a
picture and what happens at that point
this isn't actually pot to fire back
part of firebase but this is just
actually kind of cool you can do this in
a web browser if you take your webcam
stream pointed at a video element what's
really cool about that and any video
element really is you can actually kind
of chuck it into a canvas
and it'll give you back a PNG but you
can do stuff with you'll see down the
bottom there's a function there called
canvas to blob it gives you a PNG in
binary format it's really sweet so what
we gonna need to do is take that blob
and we need to put that somewhere in the
cloud because hey I kind of need to do
that for cloud vision and B most
importantly I think is both players need
to be able to see each other's faces so
if I don't put it in the cloud somewhere
it kind of can't really get to it now
previously with the firebase this was a
bit of a problem like you actually had
to kind of decide a firebase to solve
the solution
the nice thing now is we have this
really cool thing called firebase
storage for solving this exact kind of
problem firebase storage is exactly what
you want it is the place to store binary
data in the cloud yay what's extra cool
about it is it's backed by Google cloud
platforms cloud storage so we can store
petabytes of data in there and we've got
heaps and heaps of room and you can do
whatever you like with but edge caching
all sorts of wonderful features what's
extra special I think as well is that
this is probably one of the simplest
ways of interacting with Google Cloud
storage I've ever used it is really
really really simple and just like it's
all client-side it's all absolutely
client-side it's an absolute dream to
use I love it
so let's look at that function that
takes that blob that binary blob that we
get in our JavaScript and we'll see how
relatively similar it is to all the
stuff we've been doing before so we
start with you guessed it a ref in this
case it's a storage reference rather
than a data-based reference here we're
just telling it hey this is where I want
to stick my stuff in this like bucket
directory structure I'm gonna put it
under games with the key for the game so
it's unique the user ID the youth their
unique ID and dot PNG and then I say hey
image ref just put this binary data up
there please and it doesn't that's
really it we can keep track of what's
going on with that upload with what you
guessed it and on we have an on state
changed so we can actually keep track of
like progressive upload and all sorts of
good stuff like that but
the bit I really care about at least for
today is this last function here which
is hey I'm done I'm all finished the
probably two bits of information here
that are probably most interesting is
yes we can get access to that Google
Cloud Storage information if that's
something we need in my case I do I need
it for cloud vision you could ignore it
but the most important part I think is
where we've got that upload task where
we can grab the download URL yeah that's
the public URL that you finally get once
you put this thing up here for storage
so now once we've got that we're able to
actually add that to our game data so
then we can display it on the page for
both users cool so storage is super
super handy
we're not have a look at add image to
game because it actually shows off
another really neat little feature that
I found within the new release of
firebase that I really really love so
one thing we'll want to do at this point
is we want to update our game now what's
nice at this point is we've actually got
properties that don't overlap with each
other so rather than having to do a
transaction we actually say hey can you
update and just do these particular
properties on our game this makes it a
little bit more performant a little bit
easier to manage but what's nice is
previously with in firebase you could
only do the top-level elements when you
did an update right so here we're
updating the state you can see in the
data across the top and that's all you
do normally with the new version of
firebase you can now update nesting
children
so here we've got creator slash GCS path
or creator slash a download URL or
joiner depending on which user I happen
to be within the game this makes this
sort of operation really really easy and
it's something I like to really take
advantage of so once we've added our
image to our game we can then set the
state to upload a picture and the game
continues very much in this point I'm
not going to dig into each and every
state here it's very similar
once that image is uploaded then we
display it super fusers much like we
talked about it goes off to cloud
storage we get into motion the state
continues on we step state step state
step state until we get to complete
we're able to reuse sorry he's back step
what we end up with here is
is a download URL and a GCSE path as
part of the creator' information here on
the game and the state here is uploaded
picture when we're finally done with
going through all these steps we're able
to say do some logic we use that
wonderful nested parameters that we
could use before which was really handy
I can't tell you how happy that makes me
one of those very small things makes me
very very happy and we can set our state
to complete and then we are done what
things look like once we are complete is
we end up with an emotion attached to
both our creator and joiner we get that
from our cloud vision API we can see
whether they're happy or they're angry
cloud vision API gives us a likelihood
as well where it says like how confident
am i this person is actually happy we
have a wins true or false if those two
are equal I consider that a draw and
then our state gets left at 6 because we
are actually complete should we play a
game so I need a volunteer from the
audience
Cruz feeling exceptionally keen and
wants to come up on stage there's a guy
in the back who is super keen
we're somebody there we go Amir Amir

gonna set you up with an account so we
will create an account for you oh sorry

the question is come on
alright alright one more time one more
time I'm not telling you all right one
more time yeah my demo works
yeah you've joined excellent what am I
going to pick
okay we got surprise I did something
different excellent
uploading uploading Wi-Fi work I'm up
wonderful and you win congratulations
nicely done okay excellent so we have a
multiplayer game with firebase it might
work wonderful okay before we finish
there's a couple of extra things I want
to mention within firebase that I think
are particularly relevant for game
developers so I just want to make sure
you're aware of them because there are
new features and I think they're
particularly exciting the first of those
features is a thing called remote config
remote configures a feature that is
supported on iOS and Android what is
particularly cool about this is it's a
way to store key value pairs within
firebase and manage them so if you're
building a game and you want somewhere
to store say some special numbers for
how a I works or maybe just something
simple like what color a label would be
or a button would be this is the place
to do this sort of thing what's pretty
cool about remote convict is you can
actually tailor it to particular say
like analytical audiences or geographic
regions you can roll it out to gradually
have test things out with particular
users so if you're doing say for example
freemium games where player retention or
analytics like when of people buying
products this is something you're gonna
want to do because you really want to
experiment to make sure you can get the
best the best bang out of your buck
essentially for a game or even just
simply how do I make the best game on
top of that we also had as was announced
earlier this morning firebase analytics
this goes hand-in-hand with remote
config again if you want to look at the
data and analytics of your game and be
able to see exactly what point in the
game people are getting stuck maybe that
boss is too hard
maybe people are getting through too
quickly and getting bored this is the
sort of tool that you want to be able to
use to be able to do that with inside
your game and it's free which is great
so in conclusion
next time you're like hey I'd like to
really build myself a nice multiplayer
game but I really don't want to deal
with any ops I don't want to build back
in infrastructure I don't want to deal
with any of that sort of pain I want
somebody else to do that for me consider
using firebase it's a really nice
platform where you really can just sit
down focus on the code for your game and
not worry about how your infrastructure
works if you're interested in the sort
of stuff
firebase doc Google comm is great
there's all the details there please
feel free to reach out to me at neurotic
on Twitter if you want to after this
event or I'll be around at this event
well thank you again so much for coming
to see me I really do appreciate it
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
