welcome to another episode of ask
firebase the show where we answer your
burning firebase questions so today I am
joined by Abe Haskins and Abe is a
developer programs engineer what does
that mean basically it means that I do
programming related to helping people
use firebase well perfect I got some
questions together that we can take a
look at and maybe answer together if you
want to do that absolutely so our first
question comes to us from Twitter from a
Vanderburgh and the question is if I use
the get function in a cloud fire source
Security Rule to retrieve the document
to validate against does this count
towards my fire store read operations or
any other quotas yep so first off
anything related to pricing always check
out our pricing page we have a very
detailed description of how every like
possible operation impacts what you will
be paying so this does change so you
know what I'm saying here applies today
but always check that for the source of
trades or anything related to pricing
right now the way it works is that if
you read from fire store from anywhere
it counts as a read operation so that
get is a read operation what it doesn't
count as though is any network bandwidth
it's not outgoing it's not incoming it's
happening within our infrastructure so
it is a read operation but it's not
outgoing requests or incoming requests
so it's a little cheaper but it is still
a read operation against our store ok
well that's good to know because I saw
the question and I was like yeah that's
actually very valid and we'll also link
to anything pricing really well we'll
link to that pricing part because
probably users have a lot of different
questions related to pricing yeah we put
a ton of effort into describing the
first our pricing in the most reasonable
way so that document is really good at
answering all sorts of pricing related
questions sweet thank you let's hit
another one shall we mm-hmm okay
um you're just laughing at how I have to
keep a Cheeto asks is there anything
special to watch out for when building
PD over UAS with firebase so maybe we
should just start with what's a PWA so a
PWA isn't actually anything it's kind of
a group of web standards that if you
were building things using these web
standards you're building a PWA so
people use this to mean a key a few
things in general which is a PW as a web
app that's bundled in a specific way
that can be used offline that can be
very fast preferably faster than a
normal web app would be and it can be
installed to the home screen of your
device so this is a bunch of a
progressive web app is supposed to
behave as much as possible like a in
need about yes exactly but instead of
being distributed through like the App
Store or the Play Store you go to the
website and says hey would you like to
add this to your home screen and when
you do it does some magic and it bundles
up that page and shows it like a native
app now why might someone want to do
that instead of a regular web page well
the big advantage is that it kind of
gives you a presence on the user's
device so you can have what feels like a
normal app without them having to go
hunt it out because it's very easy to
get someone to your website and then you
can easily pop up the dialog that ask
them if they want to add it to the home
screen so you're not going through the
whole burden of install of saying go to
the Play Store install this you can just
say oh now this web page you're already
using you already familiar with is now
there and if they say no that's fine
they can keep using it as a normal web
page and it's not going to hurt the
experience at all okay so that being
said if I want to use firebase to make a
progressive web app what do I need to
watch out for yeah so there's one big
thing that catches everybody in about
ten different ways and that is that a
PWA is really based on this idea of a
service worker and a service worker is a
client-side proxy that all of your web
requests go through so when you request
that index.html page it doesn't go
straight to the server it goes to your
service worker and your service worker
looks in a cache and it says all right
do I have a version of this and in that
service worker you write just normal
JavaScript but it
to influence what's returned from the
cache and the reason you do this is
because to get really good offline you
need a ton of control over what gets
cached you want your images to be cached
but not your dynamic API calls and
things like that so if you're using a
service worker and you're building it
from scratch by default when you go and
write like the simplest Service Worker
it caches everything mmm and you're
probably just gonna like throw it in a
cache and retrieve it later and if you
do that you were gonna end up with a
bunch of crazy behavior and this is true
not only if you're writing one from
scratch but if you're using like the
angular boilerplate it by default caches
things very aggressively so that's going
to end up with behavior where you deploy
a firebase hosting and you think okay
great
my app is there you make some change
deploy again you'll go and you'll see
the old version of the app because the
Service Worker is sitting there having
aggressively cached everything and
you're gonna be like why is this not
here and if you don't understand all the
intricacies of service workers it's not
gonna be clear why so with firebase that
can generally be an issue but with
firebase it's particularly bad because
we make a ton of API calls on your
behalf so if your service worker is
sitting there caching those API calls
things get really crazy so for example
it will cache by default the read
requests from firebase database so you
can read data from firebase it'll cache
some of that and then later you'll come
back and you'll have new data in your
firebase and you'll be getting back old
data because the serviceworker is
caching that so you need to be really
really careful about this and this
happens across basically all the
firebase services everything that uses
client-side web requests which is all of
them and so you need to go through and
you need to explicitly say google api's
should not be cached by your
serviceworker most of the time let
firebase do its job and don't let your
serviceworker start messing up those
interactions between our clients and our
servers because for the most part we've
already thought of the offline
interactions for our databases and stuff
like that great well that was really fun
I'm so glad to have you on of course
thanks for having me thanks for watching
and remember if you have any questions
post them on social media Twitter
spoke put them on stackoverflow with the
hashtag inspired isn't it
thanks for watching see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
