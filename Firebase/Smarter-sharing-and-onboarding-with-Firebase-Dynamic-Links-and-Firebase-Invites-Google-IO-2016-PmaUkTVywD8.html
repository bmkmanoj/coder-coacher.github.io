product leader on firebase I'm Todd
Kerpelman I am a developer advocate also
on firebase now I'm going to sit down in
this stops we're going to cover dynamic
links so as you know by now these are
part of firebase and firebase is a suite
of products that help you develop your
app grow your user base and earn money
and in this talk we're gonna help you
use dynamic links to make your marketing
URLs much more effective so dynamic
links are mobile deep links that work
like you always want them to so once
upon a times URLs used to be really easy
right you click on them and you'd go to
a web page but then people began using
deep links which link directly into an
app and and they actually enabled some
very nice experiences you could click on
a link on a mobile web page and it could
take you directly into an app where for
example you could make a reservation
right there from the app without losing
any context which was really nice
but here's the problem if you want to
provide the best experience when a link
is clicked
well that depended on on quite a few
things for example if the link was
clicked was the app installed and if the
app was installed how the app gets
opened depends on which platform and
which OS version it is if it is iOS 9
and if it's Android M you know you could
open it using HTTP deep links but if it
happened to be clicked on an older
platform well you got to use a custom
scheme or something else and if the and
even if it was a new a platform like an
iOS 9 if the link was clicked in a
webview
well web views don't open Universal
links it depends on the containing
containing app that contains it and if
the app was not installed well you have
to make a choice do I install the app or
do I take them to a mobile web view and
even that depends on where the user is
coming from and what they're doing so
this can get a little complicated even
worse sometimes you create a link and
that takes the user to the App Store to
install the app and when they install
the app and open it the app you have
lost all context the app does not know
where you came from or why you're here
so we created dynamic links to solve
some of these issues so let's have Todd
come on up and explain how to build
smarter links for your apps all right
thanks Raghavan for delivering all the
sad depressing news now I get to deliver
all the happy news which is that we have
dynamic links and these are basically
links that behave the way you want them
to by intelligently changing their
behavior based on what's going on on
your users device so including things
like what platform there are and whether
they have the app installed or not and
most importantly they can retain that
link information through the app store
installation process so that when users
open your app for the first time you
could still get information about the
link that brought the user to your app
in the first place and to demonstrate
why that's important let's show you a
little example here this is this is John
and Mary and they have a recipe app
recipe Wrangler it makes cooking kind of
sort of fun and they've decided that
they're excited about their app and they
want to promote it to some of the users
of their current apps through an email
campaign so they decide they're gonna
run a little email campaign looks like
this they got some lovely pictures and
then they want to add some try out our
app buttons and so they you know add a
couple write in their email for hey
check it out on Android and check it out
on iOS so great idea they have a few
issues slash concerns for starters you
know we need these two buttons one to
get people to the App Store one to get
people to the Play Store you know it's
sort of twice the ugliness and you also
have the issue of what happens if your
iOS user accidentally clicks that green
button and goes to the Play Store you
know what's going to happen they're
gonna get confused and probably not
follow through on an email there's
issues you know issues around analytics
and measuring like how many people are
actually clicking on these links and are
the people that are getting into your
app through this email campaign are they
actually valuable users are they more
valuable than perhaps people who found
the app organically are the are the
vegetarian users more or less valuable
than the dessert people how could you
measure this sort of all the typical
analytics stuff that you
want to know for these types of things
and then issue number three the Welcome
process for the app right now is you
know it's going to be the same for all
users whether they went to the app
either through the vegetarian vittles
email blasts or they got there through
the the keiki concoctions that's what we
called it that email and you know it'd
be kind of a crappy experience for your
vegetarian user who says oh this looks
like a fun app and they go into recipe
Wrangler and they open it up and the
very first thing they get are like
recipes for you know steak dinners and
pork chops and stuff and they might just
say well I guess this app isn't for me
and close it and never come back to it
so luckily for our presentation this is
the kind of thing dynamic links are good
for so let's look at how we would
construct one of these if we feel like
building our URL by hand for starters
all dynamic links are gonna start off
with this kind of domain you've got a
little sub domain um you know set ABCDE
is a unique code that will be associated
with your app on that gets created for
you when you create a project new
firebase then you've got app to GL after
that this is the link parameter and this
is essentially the URL that contains the
information that your app will read in
when its first opened and we'll talk a
little more later about how you actually
get this information but if the court to
know that this is sort of the the
important information that your app is
going to read in it also kind of plays
double duty if a user opens this dynamic
link on an unsupported platform such as
a desktop web browser or perhaps a non
Android or iOS phone they will also go
to this link next up we're gonna add the
package name this is basically so that
we can direct your Android users to the
entry for your app on the Play Store
similarly we will add in the app store
ID so that we know where to send your
iOS users who do not have the app
installed and then we're gonna add in
all our campaign tracking using UTM tags
now if you've done any kind of Play
Store tracking or Google Analytics
tracking maybe maybe this looks familiar
to you if you don't know what this is
essentially you can think of it as like
a hierarchical way of representing your
marketing campaigns so you sort of have
like this uber campaign and then within
that you'll have mediums that sort of
represent different places where these
campaigns exist like in
email or in a QR code or what have you
and then you know sort of you can you
can drill down from there so that ends
up with a an awfully large link luckily
we do have a URL shortener that can
shorten this for you although both of
these I suppose are fine if you just are
putting them in the href tag of an email
and we also have a place on the firebase
console where you can create these links
yourself if there are non-technical
members of your team who aren't super
excited about you know URL escaping and
stuff so you can always kind of add this
in yourself you know select your apps
from the drop-down list and it will
generate the the large dynamic link or
the shortened version for you but you
can always use that expanded format if
you want to create these links
dynamically for instance you might want
to create links on you know process or
create these links dynamically on your
client and you can do that just by sort
of building up these URLs like we showed
earlier so what happens when a user
clicks on this link well if they have
the app installed they'll be taken right
into the app right on fire and then at
that point the dynamic link will be
passed into your app firebase analytics
will automatically read in all of those
UTM tracking codes and make sure it gets
recorded properly and then that link
parameter will get passed into your app
for it to kind of process and do
whatever it wants to with it if you the
user does not have the app installed
then we will take your user to either
the Play Store or the App Store you know
depending on on what platform they're on
when they're when they click on that
link and then when the first time your
user opens up the app fire based dynamic
links will go out and and we'll look and
see if there are any pending deep links
for this user for this application if it
finds any it will then deliver it to
your app at this point again firebase
Analytics will automatically process any
UTM tracking tags you had associated
with it and then that link parameter
will once again get passed into your
client app that it can deal with however
it seems fit so what does this get us
after creating this giant link well for
starters we only need one button so that
kind of deals with issue number one we
don't have to worry about our user
clicking on the wrong version or
anything like that and
it looks a little nicer you know spite
of my crappy art skills but what about
tracking where users are coming from so
fire based dynamic links will
automatically let you know how many
users clicked on any individual link so
we can certainly see you know the number
of times all of our various email
campaign links got trick'd
that got clicked but is this getting us
quality users is this getting us users
that actually are going to do things
like sign up for our newsletter from
within the app or by and you know make
an in-app purchase or subscribe to the
premium version or whatever it is that
we want them to do probably to make some
money and that's where that's what you
can find out with these attribution tags
so basically firebase analytics lets you
define certain important events in your
app like making an in-app purchase or
signing up for a newsletter or sharing
the app with their friends as these sort
of important conversion events and then
you can look at any of these conversion
events and break it out by all of the
UTM parameters that get passed in
campaign medium type and so on this is
all done automatically for you so you
can see are these email campaigns are
they more or less effective not just in
getting us users but say users that then
share the app with their friends and you
know how does this compare vs users who
find your app organically or through
other means you can find all that out
using firebase analytics similarly if
you want to find out gosh our dessert
fans spending more or less money in our
app than our vegetarians
that's also something you know you can
break out using firebase analytics and
then you can decide which group of your
users maybe is a little more important
for your app and you can kind of focus
your attention on them so that really
helps us deal with issue number two and
so how do we customize that warm welcome
so that's what that link parameter that
we pass in through these dynamic links
and you'll notice here you know we have
this URL that basically kind of looks
like it's saying hey let's show the user
a welcome and maybe we want to feature
cakes or you know feature vegetarian
recipes assuming that we have logic on
our app to read that in and and you know
customize that initial set of recipes
that we show to our user we can then
make sure that users who went into our
app by clicking on that link in our
vegetarian Biddle's email now get
vegetarian recipes I know in the
screenshot there it looks like a
hamburger on the bottom left but it's a
veggie burger trust me
and so this is the sort of thing that
can really increase retention for your
app users when they open up your app and
they immediately get content that is
important and relevant to them right you
know that whatever app they clicked on
was probably important it was enough to
drive them to install your app in the
first place so you can kind of double
down on that information and make sure
that you present your users with content
that they care about right away so that
they don't have to go digging through
your app to actually find whatever
content is relevant to them and so
that's the sort of thing that can really
kind of increase retention and get
people coming back to your app so how do
those how does that link parameter get
actually passed in to your code how can
you kind of deal with it we'll go into a
few implementation details on iOS you'll
be reading in a dynamic link through one
of two different ways depending on your
situation you Ladda to get this through
a custom URL scheme and if you've never
implemented custom URL schemes before
it's not too bad
basically what you do is over in your
info section you're gonna create a new
URL type and you're gonna have your URL
type set to your bundle ID if you've
added Google sign-in in an iOS app
before this should probably look
familiar to you
and then within your application open
URL options method you're gonna get
passed in that full dynamic link you're
gonna pass that off to the firebase
dynamic links library and basically ask
it hey can you take this URL and turn it
into a dynamic link object you'll either
get back nil in which case maybe it's a
URL that's intended for Google sign-in
or Facebook sign-in or so on or you'll
get back an actual dynamic link object
at which point you can get that link
parameter by looking at the URL property
and and then your app can actually
process it in whatever way makes sense
for your app the other way you'll get it
is through Universal links to get that
working you're gonna need to turn on the
associated domains capability within
your Xcode project and make sure that
the you know app goo GL domain is listed
as an associated domain that's your way
of saying it's okay to send Universal
links to me through these dynamic links
and then once again you're basically
going to take that URL that comes in
pass it off to the dynamic links library
the only difference here is you'll
actually get back that final
object in a completion handler just in
case we have to make that one Network
call to expand the short link into a
long link and then you know once we have
that we have our link parameter and we
can pass it into our app and and do
whatever we want to analyze it and
figure out what content we should be
displaying to our users by the way don't
freak out about Universal links if
you're like I haven't set this up for my
site yet it's on my to-do list somewhere
but I haven't done it yet you don't need
to set up Universal links for your own
website to get firebase dynamic links
working basically you just have to set
it up on the client because we're
sending you Universal links from our own
little website that we've created that
just serves your dynamic link and if you
want more information about this I am
doing a whole presentation on firebase
for iOS developers at one o'clock today
so you can go and check that out for
more information it's a shameless plug
on the Android side of things there are
a few ways you can implement this this
is one strategy which takes advantage of
Apple Inc and now i'm gonna preface this
section by saying i'm the iOS guy
probably most of you in this audience
will understand this part better than me
but you know what here we go I'm gonna
try it anyway so first off you're going
to set up app links or if you're on
earlier versions of Android intent
filters for the URLs that your app can
handle and this is basically your way of
telling Android that to automatically
redirect certain URLs to certain
activities within your app it says you
know what these various web URLs my app
can handle those when you do this Google
Play services is smart enough to look at
any of these incoming firebase dynamic
links and it will realize that if that
link parameter equals an app link for
which your app is already registered
well it'll sort of do the work for you
it'll open up your app to the
appropriate activity based on this this
link parameter you do still need to do a
little bit of work on your client first
off you're going to need to call get
invitation in the oncreate part of your
your app this basically looks for any
pending dynamic links that might not
have been passed into your app possibly
because your app wasn't installed so if
your user installs your app because of a
dynamic link then they opened it up then
that you would call get invitation to
then read in the dynamic link that third
argument of true that's highlighted
there basically says you know go ahead
and automatically go to whatever part of
my app whatever activity that link
parameter would
normally sent me too and so basically in
this callback you don't actually need to
do anything we're just kind of bringing
out some debug information on the other
hand if your app is running and Google
Play Services has already directed them
to the appropriate activity in your app
that's great but you are gonna want to
call get invitation in that deep link
activity to essentially kind of consume
that invitation from Google Play
services and just make sure it doesn't
get called again in the future and by
the way don't freak out about app links
either if you don't have a plink set up
for your app that is totally fine as
well you'll just need to do the work
yourself to kind of take in that link
parameter and parse it and not leave it
up to Google Play services to figure it
out for you so uh Android people did
that make sense that sound like alright
I'm getting a thumbs up good so um thank
you so my only question is what's the
manifest file just kidding I know that
much so this is going great right we got
some successful email campaigns going in
fact now one one of our favorite
bloggers grilling with Jill has decided
that she wants include links to recipe
Wrangler from right within her blog and
well gosh that seems like a great idea
for dynamic links too right imagine you
kind of click on the link for recipe and
firebase dynamic link sends you directly
to that recipe within the app well that
is awesome and gosh if they don't have
the rest or they don't have the app
installed then we can also send them the
Play Store the App Store and isn't this
fantastic this is you know gonna send us
all these new users and this could be
the beginning of their beautiful
referral program so they send all these
dynamic links off to Grillin with Jill
she adds them in some of her various
posts and imagine everyone shocked when
the next day people aren't quite happy
with the experience right so here's the
deal if you have a some kind of obvious
why not try this in our app sort of
button it's fine for that to take people
directly to the App Store the Play Store
right that is a that is a perfectly fine
experience people are generally
expecting that to happen when they click
on a button like that but people are
probably not expecting this kind of
experience if they're clicking on
something that looks like it should just
be taking them to another website you've
probably surprised them in a bad way and
you get the be not quite happy emoji guy
so one way you can address this is by
adding fallback parameters to your
dynamic links and
this basically tells the device that
instead of going to the Play Store the
App Store why not take the user to
another webpage that you have specified
so it basically looks like this when
you're constructing the the giant
dynamic link you can add you know one
fallback URL for Android another one for
iOS devices note that these right now
are the same but they don't have to be
right we can direct them to different
fallback pages that might have different
marketing material with different
screenshots and different device shots
which is always nice maybe in the future
if you know recipe Wrangler has instant
app support on Android which still looks
like magic to me
maybe we only have the fallback page for
iOS it kind of kind of depends
so for users who by using these fallback
Pages users who still have recipe
Wrangler installed will directly go
there which is great but for those that
don't well it can go to whatever
fallback page they specify and maybe if
all of their material is also available
on their website then great we can kind
of show you know the the web page
directly within within the device but we
could also maybe send them to a
marketing page that tells them a little
bit more about recipe Wrangler and how
awesome it is and you should go and
install it and that sort of thing and
then of course within this button which
now definitely looks like it should be
taking you to the App Store the Play
Store we can add in another firebase
dynamic link where we don't have those
fall back pages specified and this will
definitely take our users to the App
Store or the Play Store so they can go
ahead and install the app we give these
to our Grillin with Jill blogger and
we're back in action we still get the
benefit by the way of using dynamic
links by seeing how many people are
clicking on these various links in the
firebase console we still get sort of
different behavior based on the platform
that people are using but we also now
have a much better experience because
now we're doing what our users are
probably expecting when they click on
the link that that looks like a web page
or one that looks like it takes them to
the app so now this might shock you but
recipe Wrangler not an actual app but we
have a few situations where dynamic
links are being used in the real world
by some actual companies that really
exist and I'm gonna ask Raghavan to come
back on up and walk you through some of
those hey Thank You Todd
so that was great so let's see how
people are actually using dynamic links
in the real world so these links are
great if you want to provide a great
experience as we taught explained and
one of the big use cases is to actually
take people through an app install and
coming out on the other side make sure
the context is propagated and so will CL
some apps are doing that so this is
should it this is a Korean app for
couples and you can see there is a
descendant has shared something on their
anniversary and the developer wants this
particular shared item to be open in the
air because this app does not actually
have a website they only have an app so
you have to always take them to an app
install if they want to see it so then
I'm making a great for that that
particular link is actually a dynamic
link and it if the app is not installed
it takes them to the app install flow
and when the app opens for the first
time it actually shows the item in this
case Adam was the photograph that's also
great to be used as a background so this
is the case where dynamic links are
being used to to set up a peer
relationship in your app and it's also
great for similar use cases to set up
group relationships so one person in
that group or the pair has the app and
you want to onboard the others in that
group dynamic links are great to be used
for in wives in the first person invite
the others and all the others get
personalized warm welcomes to invite
them get into the app this is a second
use case where before dynamic links this
particular flow starts off with an email
saying hey you know check this thing out
in the app and user that to actually go
through the app install process and the
app doesn't know they came for this
particular content so it takes them
through its default onboarding screen
and at the end of that the user has to
go back and find the search option in
the app and then search for the content
and they might have forgotten what it
was so they got to go back to the email
get the content and come back and search
for it so it takes there more than a
dozen clicks to actually get to their
content so with dynamic links this makes
it very very nice and clean the app and
it opens knows what they came here for
and they see the content right away so
it goes down to just four clicks in this
case so what is the benefit of doing
something like this so one of our
partners actually has been using this in
exactly the scenario and what they found
is that dynamic links increase their
attention after four weeks by 92% for
users who came in from these links so
this has a big impact on attention this
is a third use case which is if your
product actually has a desktop service
this is Google Maps right and you can
use dynamic links to effectively convert
desktop users to app users if you think
the app can provide them with a better
experience so so here once the user has
searched for some content something they
actually care about you can give them
the option in this case to email it to
yourselves and so this email comes to
the floor
email it or text it to themselves and
email or the message it comes to their
phone when they click on it if the app
is present correctly opens they are not
present go through the install slow and
then they come on the other side they
have the content right there and if the
link or the message is open on a
platform where there is no app for the
service that's totally fine because you
can configure the link to be open in
that case - this is this use case can
works mobile web users to app users this
is actually Shazam and they are doing a
promotion with a very unique marketing
campaign where you can actually scan a
particular logo on coke bottles and that
will lead you to a very unique lip sync
experience where you can record a lip
sync video and share it on social media
and here it's been shared on Facebook
and so when somebody actually clicks on
their friends shared lip sync video it
takes you to a mobile web page where
they can play it and at this on this
page this is an opportunity for them to
actually convert this user to an app
user it is a call to action that says
make your own lipstick video and share
it
social media and here if you did not
have dynamic links they would need to
have two buttons there one that says if
you have the app you know click here
don't have it downloaded and hopefully
you can figure out it's in the air how
you can come back to this place right so
dynamic links is perfect here it's one
button that works in what cases and in
both cases leads you the right place so
so we look at a few cases where after
using this dynamic links for onboarding
users converting mobile to a mobile to
app and desktop app one of the most
common case is actually sharing so let's
see how this can be used for sharing so
going back to Todd's example it turns
out our food blogger isn't the only one
who wants to share recipes our users for
that app also want to share us a piece
too and this is very easy all you have
to do is in restangular for each recipe
you know allow them to make a dynamic
link for that particular recipe which
they can now post and share on social
media by email and so everybody can pass
the recipes around and as a recipe gets
passed around all over a sphere angular
or food app gets more users so that's
great and all about it and since they
use dynamic links they get all the
benefits if you have talked about it
works on both app install uninstall
cases on both iOS and Android in all
these scenarios all you have to do is to
add some boilerplate code you know just
create the deep link and find the email
contact and then you know find the SMS
contact and maybe if you want to be
really good you know have a
recommendation engine that can suggest
who you should share this with because
they may not want to scroll through 200
people in the contact list to find the
people they want to share with and then
you know how pretty email that's pre
formatted
which they can modify so that they can
customize it and then ideally send the
emails from the app itself without
having to go into an email client so it
does take a little bit of work but
dynamic links are great in this kind of
flow now if only this could be a little
easier that would be really great but
this shows your dynamic links can be
used so thank you very much for coming
and wait we're not done yet
via not know we got
more feature oh you know you forgot
about that god likes my gosh don't and
yet see we recognize that the whole
process of kind of creating all these
you know links and shedding sending them
off through email and SMS it's kind of
valuable also kind of a pain to do and
so we decided to standardize the process
for you in white a nice little package
now you're still more than welcome to go
ahead and generate your own dynamic
links and serve them however you want
you know you can still do that but for
SMS and email which tends to be two of
the most common situations we have a
solution that that you can use right
away so generally this is how it would
work on iOS you're basically going to
create an invite builder and you're
gonna give it a bunch of parameters that
sort of change its initial behavior what
the deep link info is going to be for
people that receive this invite that
that's the important one as well as
maybe you know what you want the default
outbound message to be from that user
and you know if you want to kind of
customize the call to action button or
that sort of thing
once you do that you're going to open up
the dialog and it will appear or sort of
as a view controller right on top of
your current app on Android almost the
same process you're gonna kind of create
an intent you're gonna set all the
various parameters around what you want
the default message to be for your user
what you want the deep link info to be
and so on and then you're gonna launch
it to get the UI and what you get on iOS
anyway is something that looks a little
like this a few notes about this invite
dialog you'll note that we are mixing in
SMS and email and that's fine in fact
that's good it turns out a lot of users
they only have either the email address
or the phone number of their recipients
right they don't have both and sort of
having them in one convenient location
is awfully nice also you'll notice that
we have some suggestions from Google
folks are from Google based on folks
that we think you might want to talk to
based on sort of who you know we yeah
who we think your your your best friends
are or at least who you want to
communicate with and so that can be very
useful if your best friends happen to be
you know William and xena and you don't
want to scroll through you know 300
contacts to get to those people so it's
kind of nice what your recipients will
see by default is a message that looks a
little something like this
so you'll notice the subject line
is the is the the customized user
message that your user has sent to
people and then the actual content of
the email is what we have automatically
grabbed from the App Store or the Play
Store for you so you kind of you know
can see the the description which is
directly from the App Store and the
screenshots and so on and this is you
know pretty good for delivering a
nice-looking email with eight lines of
code but if you do want to do a little
more and have a little more control on
what this invitation looks like you can
add in an email content parameter and so
this is a parameter where you would
generate a whole bunch of HTML or you
would supply in a whole bunch of HTML
and that would control what the email
invitation looks like to those
recipients so this not only lets you
design your invitation exactly the way
you'd like but it also means because
it's happening right there in your app
you can customize that invitation as
you're sending it so you can really kind
of have custom invites based on the
content that that your user wants to
share for example this is what youngly
did they decided instead of just kind of
sharing a you know if you want to share
recipe instead of the email just kind of
containing some generic info about the
youngly app they said well gosh we have
all this recipe info right here let's
put that into the email and so what you
get is a little bit more about the
recipe you get to see you know your the
picture of the chocolate peppermint
cookies which look delicious
maybe because it's lunch time and you
know a little bit of a snippet of the
recipe to get you interested and then
you know you're a little more inspired
to click on that link that says why yes
I would like to install the only app oh
man these guys really have a good recipe
app already looks like it's back to the
drawing board for John and Mary so oh
alright that's good they got a back-up
plan so the process for receiving
invites it's almost the same as for
receiving a deep link on iOS instead of
passing the URL you get into the
firebase dynamic links library you're
gonna pass it in to the firebase invites
library and you know then you'll get
back an object that looks like an invite
and you can then sort of parse it as you
need on Android you actually don't need
to do anything if you have already
implemented firebase dynamic links the
code is exactly the same for for dealing
with incoming firebase invites so that's
kind of nice
so now let's move on to the one bit of
bummer news so on Android you don't need
to be signed in at all to send or
receive an invite anybody is free to
send any invitations they want anybody's
free to accept any invitations and
that's all great on iOS you also don't
need to be signed in to receive an
invite you get an invite coming in you
know go ahead and you know you can kind
of click on that in your email take you
to your app and so on and so maybe you
can see where we're going here you do
however have to be signed in with Google
to send invitations on iOS now maybe for
some of you that's not a problem right
your app already uses sign-in and Google
is one of your preferred sign-in
providers and you're like oh this is
fine most of my users are signing in
with Google anyway but maybe it is a
problem right maybe your app doesn't
have sign-in at all or maybe you're not
adding Google sign-in to your app and so
you say well ok that's that's still not
a big deal I'm just gonna put firebase
invites in my Android app so my Android
users can still share with each other
and that's fine and you know my iOS
users they won't be sharing but you know
I'll still kind of get some some viral
effects from sending off all these
invites so here's the one problem with
that it turns out that Android users and
iOS users sometimes still talk to each
other in fact frequently they're they're
often friends that's all kind of whole
montagues and capulets thing and so the
problem is that your Android users are
going to send these invitations not only
to other Android users but also to iOS
users as well the iOS users are going to
click on that annotation they will at
least go through the process of
installing your app but then if you
haven't implemented any kind of firebase
invites logic on the app it's not going
to know what to do with that invitation
and it's just going to kind of give your
users the generic homescreen instead of
that great recipe that your users are
trying to share and they're going to be
kind of sad and confused so what I
recommend is at the very least if you're
adding firebase invites on Android make
sure that you add the ability to receive
invites on iOS like you saw the code is
very nearly identical to the deep link
parsing we did earlier and this will
make sure that your Android users can
still send invites to whoever they want
and they will get accepted and your iOS
users you know won't be confused and
then you know again totally up to you
whether you want to add in
sending invitations on iOS so there you
go that is firebase invites in a
nutshell
Raghavan you want to take us home Thank
You Todd
that was great so so let's recap so in
this talk we cover dynamic links and so
now you know how to use them to make
create marketing URLs for your app and
your product and we also looked at in
white which is an out of the box in
white flow for very effective sharing
and in lights on SMS and email for more
information please head over to our docs
and support and we also have a
playground set up for you to create
dynamic links and play with it and
that's at FTL - links good appspot.com
just go there and it's valid during i/o
and you can go and create some dynamic
links and play with them and see and try
all the parameters out this is all the
remaining talks going on so we will be
around here after this talk and happy
dance any questions off the stage thank
you thank you
