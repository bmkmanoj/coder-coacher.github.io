of the day talk it's like 5:30 and you
have another talk to go to after this
but how about we just think it's that
going to give a round of applause for
everyone who shows up for a 5:30 p.m.
talk pretty good see I am a father of
two like really small children so doing
anything past 5:30 is typically crazy so
I really appreciate the troll here so my
name is David East I'm a front-end
engineer on the firebase team and by the
look of the Hulk you probably thought oh
hey look another web performance talk or
I can learn about shipping less code and
optimizing my images now while those
things are all very important to do
that's not what I'm here to talk about
today I'm here to talk more about the
behind the scenes of web performance you
see I'm the kind of web developer who
likes to take my files put them on the
server and not really think about much
after that and that doesn't mean I don't
care about performance I work really
hard to make sure all my server code
executes as quickly as possible and I
also want to make sure that my files are
really small so they get transmitted
quickly but what I really want is this
fast button all I have to do is go and
then all my files go on to some awesome
performant infrastructure and I don't
have to think anymore and that is
firebase hosting firebase hosting is
your fast button bar besos thing gives
you the tools to maximize your page load
performance so today let's talk about
simplifying our hosting infrastructure
so one of the things that firebase does
for you just like right out of the box
is HTTP its 2017 it's HIVs is pretty
much a standard now and so if you want
to go from HTTP to HTTPS there is two so
two steps to that you first have to go
out and get a search and then you have
to go out and install it it's not very
difficult but it's not something I want
to do every single time I deploy a
website what I want to do is deploy a
website and then have it have HTTPS and
I don't
think about it that's exactly what
firebase hosting does for you and after
you deploy site over and over again to
hosting you start to take this for
granted which is cool so that's what we
want you to do but probably the coolest
thing firebase hosting does for you out
of the box is our content delivery
network so who here has seen or used a
URL like this one before so good friend
Roboto so this link right here is from
the Google Fonts CDN and we tend to not
think of these as web sites we tend to
think of these as files placeholders for
files on a server and that makes sense
because this is content and it's
delivered over a network but if you're
not familiar with C diems you might
think that Network stands for the
Internet and not it's actually a
different kind of network so this is how
the Google Fonts this is a Google Fonts
would be if it wasn't on a CDN or at
least I think it would be so rather than
just like one or rather than a bunch of
servers we'd have one or two servers and
we have some device out in Europe saying
hey I need robot oh so it sends the
request it goes all the way over the
Atlantic Ocean to this server server
goes I have robot oh let me just send
that back to you as fast as I can over
the Atlantic Ocean back to this user in
Europe now another user in Europe says
hey I need Roboto as well and maybe
they're just like down the street from
you and so they send a request that goes
across the Atlantic Ocean down to the
server the server goes then I just send
someone in Europe Roboto okay it doesn't
matter I'm going to send it back to them
as fast as I can
now the problem with this set up is that
there's a lot of latency and latency is
how long does it take to send one packet
of information from a source to the
destination so if you're trying to send
one packet from San Francisco to New
York that's about 40 milliseconds and
you might be thinking well 40
milliseconds for a round-trip doesn't
sound too bad for me but this is like
literally your best-case scenario this
is like you're the only person on the
internet sending packets you'll get this
San Francisco to LA though is a lot
better it's six milliseconds
again this isn't realistic it's going to
you're going to have a lot more latency
than this but six milliseconds compared
to 40 milliseconds is a huge difference
and I'd rather pay six milliseconds for
a roundtrip
than I would for 48 so the CDN flips the
equation it says rather than trying to
send files as fast as we can across the
world why don't we just send files as
fast as we can across the street so in
this case we have a user in Europe
saying hey I need Roboto so it sends a
request but it doesn't go all the way
across the Atlantic Ocean just goes to a
server in Europe so a CDN is a network
of servers and we call these servers
edges so what if we put more than just
fonts or jQuery and a CDN what if we put
our entire website in a CDN and that is
firebase static hosting but far away
static hosting you can deploy static
files and then we'll put them on a CDN
so by static it's HTML Javascript CSS
and images so let's see how the CDN
works so we have a user and let's say
they're in Tokyo and then this user says
all right I'm going to make a request
for an asset on your web site I don't
know where that lines there okay now
it's going to first stop go back it's
going to first stop not at your I'd say
the first stop at this at the local edge
and then this edge is going to say I've
never seen this request before let's
call out to the firebase hosting origin
now the origin is like the HQ of
firebase hosting it knows where all the
edges are knows that where all your
files are so it goes as okay I got this
I know where the file is so it sends it
right back to the edge and then the edge
it caches it and sends it back to device
now let's say another user in Tokyo
makes a request the edge goes wait I got
this I'm going to send it right back to
the device so rather than going all the
way across the ocean all we do is just
go right across the street
and it's amazing the network effect that
this has because every single user in
this area only has to go to a local edge
server there they get a low of latency
response so if you pull up the chrome
dev tools and this is just a firebase
hosting website it doesn't really matter
what website because we're going to
inspect an individual file so we're
going to click on the waterfall of a
document and that's probably pretty tiny
so we can make you a little bigger and
we see all these great requests in
response metrics about this one file and
we can see that it took about seven
milliseconds to queue it stalled and
negotiated for about a millisecond and a
half our request was sent in like a
quarter of a millisecond that's fast but
almost 300 milliseconds was spent
waiting and this is known as time to
first byte now time to first byte is
kind of like one of those black box
metrics so there's a lot of things that
could influence it but when it comes to
static hosting time to first byte is
usually a is a large factor of it is how
far you are away from the server so if
you are further away it's going to take
longer for a file to get to you so 300
milliseconds is it's okay for time to
first byte but this response it's not
coming from an edge it's coming from
firebase hosting origins and this is not
the response that most users are going
to get
it's nearly going nearly always going to
be coming from the edge so we know that
we sent a request so this should now
live in the edge cache so when I do a
hard refresh in chrome this is now my
time to first byte instead of almost 300
milliseconds it's five milliseconds and
just FYI it takes 86 milliseconds for
the human eye to blink so that's pretty
fast so you might be so what about if
your content changes and so you go and
you deploy it you wanted to play a new
version of your website or you want to
update a file
so how do we synchronize to all of these
edge servers that our content has
changed well it's all baked into
deployments so the point on a firebase
hosting is pretty easy you install a CLI
so MPI you install CoA from NPM and then
you just write firebase deploy and
directory we take your files we upload
them to the server and then when we
deploy them we also take it into all the
files you deployed into one atomic
deployment and this is kind of like a
commit and then the origin says all
right we have this new version and it
tells the caches get rid of everything
you have
purge everything because there's a new
version of your website ready to view so
the next time your user goes out to your
website they're not going to see the old
stuff they're going to see your new
version and the amazing thing about this
is is when you have these atomic
deployments if you want to roll back you
can view your entire deployment history
in the firebase console and then you can
just click a button and almost instantly
roll back to that version so one of the
more interesting developments and web
performances with HTTP 2 and if you're
not familiar HTTP 2 is the new standard
of HTTP and that's probably not that
helpful so to see why ocy hv2 is the new
standard let's take a look at an h2 b1
waterfall so right here you can see that
we're making about 30 requests or so and
what you can see is this waterfalls
fairly staggered and that's because when
we make a request with HTTP we can only
open up one connection per asset so we
get one connection download one asset so
the browser is smart and it says all
right I'm going to give you six
connections so you can do six things at
a time so that's why we see kind of like
some files stagger some files stagger
and what I really want to do is I want
to take this and I want to like you know
I want to put it together I want to be
in one line I want to wait to load
everything so we used to do this thing
called domain sharding
and the reason why is because we got six
we have six connections but they're per
domain so someone thought hey what if I
just have more domains that way I can
have more requests in parallel so the
thing about the main charting is let's
say you have four domains and if you
have six connections each that's like
you take the four the twos my phone it's
24 2014 connections and so with that
each TCP connection is going to incur
its own latency and this is just going
to drain your users battery so HTTP two
fixes this problem with HTTP two we get
one connection that we can send multiple
assets on so now rather than seeing that
staggered waterfall all in one nice line
and in case you are wondering yes this
is 17 different versions of jQuery and
yes I need all of them so one of the
great things about HTTP 2 is not just
such as pipelining
it also gives you tools for performance
so like if you think your website is not
like a 10 well there's some things we
can do just like crank it up and maybe
get it to an 11 when you request the
website you don't request all the assets
you request just the documents and then
the document it has references to your
assets and the browser parses it and
goes through this discovery phase and
then it initiates requests for these
assets and we're the developer of this
page we know what assets are needed so
why do we have to wait for this extra
round trip why don't we just take these
files and send them all down with the
original response well as a feature
actually called h db2 server push so a
server push we can use link headers and
we can say when you send this document
let's send all these other assets to the
firebase hosting we give you this
firebase JSON file which is how you can
do more advanced configuration so if you
need to do any redirects any rewrites or
in this case set some headers so I can
say at the source of my home route
I want to specify these headers so I'm
going to say give me a link header and I
want to send back I want to push my main
CSS so now with this file pushed our
network timeline looks a little
different
the initiator for our document is not
our initiative our stylesheet isn't our
documents it's pushed slash other and if
we click on the waterfall tab we get a
whole new set of metrics so zoom in on
you can see there's nothing about time
to first byte or network it's all about
reading the push and that's because by
the time the browser realizes it needs
this asset it's already been downloaded
over the network and what this does for
us is it saves us one less round-trip
for this asset but before you start
thinking like that's great I'm going to
push everything on my website that's
probably not going to work out the way
you want pushing too many things is
called over push and it has some
problems
the first is bandwidth when you push an
asset you don't know what's going on in
the browser's cache and the browser has
this great caching system it pretty much
keeps us from making requests from items
that we've recently downloaded but with
H to push we're pretty much saying like
I'm going to ignore that cache and I'm
going to send it down every single time
so it's a waste of bandwidth and also
there's a problem with priority so if
you go into the performance section of
Chrome and you hover over all your
assets they're going to give you these
labels like high highest and low because
the browser is great at knowing what the
priority of your assets are and when you
push something you tell the browser know
I know what I'm doing my assets are
super high priority and you take these
first and the problem with that is not
every asset is high priority like images
if you push an image which the browser
sees is a low priority you're probably
going to make your website slower so HD
push is kind of like this new world
where everyone's still figuring things
out so there's no like solid rules or
like you know laws I can give you but
there are two guidelines so if you're
going to push something make sure that
it's a critical rendering as
so that's your JavaScript that does
rendering or any CSS and if you are
going to push make sure that you use a
serviceworker to cache these assets
because that way it's going to prevent
any future unneeded pushes in the future
any of this sounds familiar to you it's
because the polymer team actually has a
whole system on top of this called
purple and not so coincidentally there
is actually a firebase hosting in purple
code lab that you should totally check
out so at this point I've shown you the
CDN I've talked to you about HD - an
HTTP server push and these are all just
amazing tools that firebase hosting
gives you out of the box or it's just a
little bit of configuration but
everything I've talked to you about
today is all through the lens of static
hosting but sometimes our content
frequently changes and then also we
might want to make our own API on our
domain or we want to get meta tags for
Facebook and Twitter and in that case
you probably want dynamic hosting so
dynamic hosting we can deploy not just
static assets but also server code that
helps us generate new content per
request and this is really powerful
because if our data is constantly
changing we can keep our content
changing with that data so there are
things you can do for dynamic content
with firebase there's cloud functions
and if you're not familiar cloud
functions it allows you to run server
code in response to firebase events and
one of them is an HTTP function and it
says here take a request you can handle
it and send a response now if you look
at this this kind of looks like a
dynamic hosting provider but there's
some problems with it the first is this
is the URL it gives you now like this is
a totally fine URL if this is your if
you're building a web hook but you spawn
up the URL you want on your business
card and also actually go back also if
you look at that URL it says US central
one so what that means is is that this
URL is I mean that this server is in the
central of the United States
so what that means is that when we send
a request we can do something dynamic
and send that response or back to where
we were before we don't have a CDN
anymore we're sending Roboto to people
all over the world again and that's not
what we want we want the best of both
worlds we want to be able to dynamically
generate content but we also want that
low latency response through a CDN so
yesterday we announced that now cloud
functions in firebase hosting give you
the best of these worlds so if god
functions in firebase hosting you can
dynamically create content and then you
can store that content in a CDN and
what's great is is that you don't have
to use this URL you could use a you can
use a default firebase app subdomains or
better yet map your own URL and the most
amazing part about this feature is is
that you get control over the CDN cache
you get to tell it how long you want to
cache your dynamic content and we can do
that through a cache control header so a
cache control header has three parts the
first part is this public part and what
public says is that this file is
cashable we can cache it on a CDN the
second part is how long it will live in
the browser cache those last parts this
is how we set the CDN we can tell it
that for 600 seconds we want it that we
set at 600 seconds before it expires and
this is known as the time to live or TTL
so let's see how this works
we got a user again in Tokyo user makes
a request to the edge the edge says I
have never seen this request before
let's call out the firebase hosting
origin origin goes oh I recognizes this
matches a cloud function so it kicks out
the cloud functions which runs your
server code and generates your dynamic
content and then sends it back to
firebase tensing's origin which then
sends it back to the edge which then now
caches this content and then sends it
back to your user
now another user in the same area makes
the same request now the edge cast goes
wait I have this and sends it back so we
set a TTL of 600 seconds and 400 seconds
gone had gone by so we hadn't expired
from the cache but now 9 second 900
seconds has gone by so we send a request
and then the CDN goes this is expired so
let's kick out the firebase those things
origin and then let's kick out the cloud
functions and then we're going to send
it all the way back cache it and then
back to the user so that's dynamic
content that is being cached back in
your CDN edge so the way you set this up
with firebase firebase hosting is with
your firebase JSON file and you can
specify it as a rewrite so you say
whenever you see this source so this
route of questions let's map it to this
cloud function of questions and then we
can write our actual cloud function now
pop functions is ran on nodejs
and so I'm going to be reusing es next
syntax but if you can use whichever
flavor of JavaScript you like so I'm
going to import from the firebase
functions and then I'm going to import
from firebase admin because I'm going to
be reading from a database and then now
I'm going to name my function I'm going
to say export let questions if you're
using common jeaious you would say
exports dot function exports dot
questions and then now I'll create my
client function so what I'll do is I'll
go out to my database and I'm going to
get a list of questions from here I'm
going to set the cache control header so
600 seconds in the CDN cache and then
now I'm going to send back a response as
HTML with how many items are in my list
and then now all I have to do is a
firebase deploy and that means that my
static assets will go on to firebase
hosting and then my dynamic server code
goes on to cloud functions
and that's just one route how do I
handle multiple routes how do I get a
more dynamic back-end well we can write
our function we can say let's import
from firebase functions again in admin
but now we're going to import from
Express so if you're not familiar with
Express it's an open source node
framework and it's really easy to work
with the first thing we're going to do
is we're going to create an Express app
because this will allow us to attach
multiple routes so say app that get and
we'll say whenever a user does a get
request at my home route I can handle
the response and send this request and
now I'm going to attach another route I
can attach my questions route that I
made earlier and then I can just get the
data set the cache control header and
then send the response and then lastly I
have to name my function so export let
I'm going to name it FN create my cloud
function and then now I take my Express
app and I just pass it through as the
parameter then in firebase saw Jason I
need to make a rewrite but instead of
mapping it to just one path I'm actually
going to use a star star glob which says
match all paths and then call this call
the function FN and what this does is it
gives us a huge hall host of new
performance improvements so now we can
dynamically render HTML and then we can
defer all of our Java scripts so we can
still get a fast first paint but then we
can also get our dynamic behavior our
dynamic behavior our app needs and if
you're using any frameworks you can take
advantage of server-side rendering so
frameworks like angular Universal and
reacts they have these first-class tools
for doing server-side rendering so you
can take your same client-side code pass
it through these tools and generate out
HTML and then just send that down to the
browser and then the framework takes
over after that and what's amazing is is
that we're not asking you to be static
or dynamic you can be both static and
dynamic
because its feature is more like a
slider you can be you can be a lot more
static you can set a very high TC l or
deploy only static files but if you want
to be more dynamic you just set a lower
TTL and that way your content will
regenerate faster so dynamic hosting is
just another tool in the firebase
hosting tool sets it's just another tool
we have to build fast websites on an
easy infrastructure so if you want to
learn more please go to the
documentation at firebase google.com
slash Doc's slash hosting and also
there's an amazing cloud functions in ml
talk tomorrow at 9:30 in the morning
recommend you go to and also we have a
YouTube channel all these socks are
going to be on and we do lots of amazing
videos so give that give that a look if
you want to learn more about everything
we've talked about this week so that's
all thank you all for coming at 5:30 and
I will see you all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
