I'm Fontaine Foxworth I'm one of the
product managers working on firebase
analytics here at Google and I was
actually supposed to be doing this
presentation with a colleague of mine
but two days ago he told me he wasn't
gonna be able to do it because his wife
is having a baby the next day or so and
he felt like one big launch this week
wasn't enough so I'll be flying solo so
you have to bear with me so we're gonna
be talking about firebase analytics and
we'll be talking it in the context of
growth so actually growing your user
base trying to get more users into your
app and then keeping them there and I'm
going to talk about firebase analytics
in three sections first I'll give a
quick overview of firebase analytics
hopefully some of you guys who stopped
by our sandbox or attended some of the
other sessions so it might not be new
but I'll go ahead and give a quick recap
and then I'll be talking about using
analytics to actually track your paid
acquisition campaigns so look at looking
at advertising and tracking advertising
with firebase analytics and then finally
we're going to touch on organic growth
so actually a couple of tools that you
can use firebase use with firebase and
track using firebase analytics since we
know that as a marketer advertising is
only one of the tools that you're using
and when we're actually going through
this I'll be using a hypothetical
marketer named Mike now let's start with
the reason why so many of us are here
we've got consumers spending a lot of
time in mobile apps when they're on
their phones so between Google Play and
the App Store we've got millions of apps
that are generating north of 150 or
north of 50 billion dollars annually so
that is a lot of value coming from a lot
of users so how do we actually reach
those users how do we present
opportunities for those users to
discover our apps
we know that on average a user is
unlocking their phone 150 times a day
they're usually doing specific tasks
like calling an uber or maybe looking
for a nearby coffee shop looking for a
game to download when they're waiting
for the bus I like to think of these as
a hundred and fifty opportunities for us
as marketers different chances that we
can get in front of our users and show
them content that they could be
interested in but even though we have
these 150 opportunities a day the
ecosystem has created a lot of
challenges for us as marketers so a
couple quick highlights first of all it
can be hard to actually find the right
user in your app so figuring out who
that target audience should be making
sure it's a relevant market making sure
you're finding them on the correct
devices at the right time etc that's
always an issue secondly mobile
technology is just hard you know people
who are new to marketing on apps I feel
like are always surprised when they
realize there aren't cookies on apps
you've got advertising identifier Zhai
DFAS they don't work well with cookies
on mobile web so the the technology that
was designed to help us connect with
their users often actually ends up
getting in the way and not to mention of
course the app stores right Google Play
on the app store they add a step in
between giving our users an ad or
something like that and actually
discovering the app so it's one step or
three depending on how you look at it so
this creates a clouding marketing
picture at best and then finally I feel
like we're drowning in tools so when I
every time I meet a developer I always
ask them what analytics tools are they
using and almost certainly they rattle
off four or five different analytics
tools they're using and they're using
all of them they're just using them for
different things right so they could
have an SDK for trash for tracking crash
reporting or one for tracking push
notifications or behavioral in-app
analytics or
version tracking so each one of these
SDKs in and of themself aren't that big
not that much work to add but when you
start adding them all together you know
that's four or five SDKs for different
types of analytics that you're using in
your app when you look at them all
together they could add bloat to your
app and certainly as developers I know
that we don't like adding extra code
every time a marketer asked for another
tool and that's just looking on the
development side but when you're
actually consuming that data in the UI
you've got different databases different
systems and these different data silos
don't speak well together they were
never designed to work together so you
end up making your decisions in a couple
of different disparate places and that's
why we are bringing to you firebase
analytics and firebase because we're
really trying to do something different
by offering this platform so unless
you've been living under a rock for the
last few days you should know that
firebase is a suite of integrated
products that we're introducing to help
you develop your app grow your user base
and earn money and firebase analytics is
really at the core of this platform I
thought it was pretty impressive the way
that this designer designed this graphic
quite literally analytics is at the core
of this image but not only is it
connecting all of the different products
with in firebase analytics but it helps
you understand each phase of the
customer journey so you can really get
an end-to-end picture of what's going on
in your app now adding firebase your app
is as simple as one two three one is
registering your app on firebase com
so you can actually create that instance
within our system secondly you're given
a configuration file which you'll be
adding to the app and third you add two
lines of code on iOS and you just adjust
your configuration file on Android and
just like that you're up and running
with firebase and this is a one-time
task that you would do to instrument any
of the
features in firebase but no matter which
feature you're implementing you will get
firebase analytics by default so it's a
pretty easy way to get up and running to
immediately start asking questions of
your data now I see firebase analytics
being particularly helpful in three
different ways first of all it's
completely free and unlimited when we
sent out a while ago to completely
redesign an app analytics product from
the ground up
free and unlimited was one of our
founding tenets we wanted to make sure
that us developers had access to all of
your data without compromise so no hit
limits no sampling and it's your data
and this was built by the knowledge of
the developers and product managers of
Google Analytics for apps so we were
able to take learnings from several
years and hundreds of thousands of apps
to take what we have and the feedback
that we've been getting from our users
to truly build an app analytics product
that is built for app developers and
then we have automatic event reporting
so with firebase analytics immediately
after plugging on the SDK you're getting
over 12 analytics events captured
automatically so you can log in to your
dashboard you'll see a bunch of
information without logging any
additional information but if you're new
to analytics maybe you don't know
exactly how to instrument your app we
also give you guides for different
verticals about what we recommend to
instrument in your app different events
that we suggest you capture and this can
be used of course as a guide if you're
new to analytics but it is also helpful
because we give you a dedicated event
recording for those specific events so
if you have a specific retail event
we'll give you a report for that or if a
specific game event again we'll give you
a dedicated report for that since we
understand the contacts the syntax of
that event those parameters we'll make
sure to give you a report that makes
sense in the context of that event and
then finally firebase analytics is
seamlessly integrated with the rest of
firebase and it's not just seamlessly
integrated with the rest of firebase
it's also integrated across Google again
integration was one of our founding
tenants of firebase analytics since we
knew that developers are instrumenting
you know they could have 14 different
developer tools in their app again they
don't speak to each other and what we
wanted to do with firebase was have a
single platform where you can come to
one place to do all the developer tasks
you need so integration is a key point
that I'm going to be diving into it a
little bit more later and of course
firebase analytics works on both iOS and
Android since we know that successful
app developers are building on both
platforms and we're committed to being
platform agnostic now if you attended
our session on Wednesday you saw that
firebase analytics can be used to help
develop your app grow your user base and
earn money and this is really it's not a
linear path right it's a cycle so you'll
be taking each one of these actions over
and over rinse repeat
but right now in this session we'll be
talking about firebase analytics in the
context of growth and how you can
actually use it to augment your
marketing strategy all right we're gonna
look at it in the context of a real app
so we've got this app Transworld endless
skater it's available on both iOS and
Android and it allows users to skate try
to attempt the longest runs in the game
and they can select from five different
Pro skaters that have different skills
and tricks that they have access to and
another thing that you can do in this in
this game is you can spend on in-app
purchases to purchase virtual currency
in the game and then once you're in the
game you can spend that virtual currency
on other tricks unlock new levels or
whatever but the important part to note
is that skates in game economy works so
if we can find more users bring them
into the app
then Transworld endless caterers should
make more money and that's why we hired
Mike this marketer now Mike decides
Mike's responsible for growing
Transworld endless skater and he decides
that now is the right time to get the
app in the hands of his users it's right
around finals time maybe he's looking to
take advantage of some some folks who
are just getting off school and looking
to find a new game for this summer or
maybe they just need something to
procrastinate while they're studying but
he he thinks now's the time and he sets
a pretty ambitious goal of 300 thousand
installs that he's trying to drive
she's starting at around 10,000 installs
so he definitely has a lot of work cut
out for him and he thinks firebase
analytics can help so he logs into the
firebase console and immediately when he
gets here and he notices a ton of data
is already available for him and this is
because Mike's developer named Andy had
actually already been using the firebase
product for a series of other features
so Mike never had to ask Andy to add any
new SDK because it was already there for
him the analytics it's already available
to him so he logs in he sees a ton of
rich data a bunch of events are being
captured automatically you can see his
monthly active users he can see his
revenue numbers etc now he navigates to
the events section of the app I like to
think of events as like the currency
that firebase analytics actually runs on
these are also what I like to describe
as the verbs or the action words in the
app so things like level up or in-app
purchase whatever these are and he
notices a lot of the events that have
been logged automatically by just
plugging in the SDK so he can see app
update he can see OS update session
start etc even in-app purchase since
this is a game and firebase analytics
captures in-app purchase data
automatically on both iOS and Android
and he also notices a couple of events
that were captured by Andy that are
specific to games so you can see at the
bottom there spend a virtual currency
and unlock achievement these are two
games that are specific to games that
Andy had registered logged in the code
with just a line or two of code these
actually contain pretty rich information
about games specifically I highlighted
those different vertical specific events
earlier these are some examples of those
so if you were to click into them we'd
actually see some reporting around them
and then Mike navigates to the
attribution tab so in the attribution
tab he can see his conversions his
conversions are the things the business
drivers in his app that he's really
looking to optimize his business around
so first open an in-app purchase we know
these are really common conversion
events so we'll enable those for him
automatically but Mike also has the
opportunity to enable any of the events
that he has access to to be conversions
and he can do this in the events tab on
the far right column there's an enable
conversion toggle by turning those on
that will get they will add those events
the attribution table now marking
something as a conversion that basically
unlocks some features and functionality
for that event so you can do attribution
reporting so you can see cross-channel
campaign performance for your different
conversions now we talked about Mike had
automatically gotten in app purchase and
first open but he decides to go ahead
and indicate spend virtual currency to
also be one of the conversions that he
wants to optimize towards so I want to
step back really quickly and talk about
we've talked about the attribution
section and generally what you can do
with in firebase analytics but now I
want to talk about the paid part of
marketing look at how you can integrate
firebase analytics with your advertising
efforts
so Mike knows that he's gonna be driving
300,000 installs if he's gonna be
spending that much money then he really
needs to make sure he understands the
tools that he has access to and so that
is why he wants to basically understand
what firebase analytics can actually do
for him now a key part of our
integration with firebase analytics has
been being able to integrate across
other Google products and with firebase
analytics one of our most important
integrations from day one has been our
integration with Adwords we know that if
you've run marketing campaigns with
AdWords in the past it can be sometimes
difficult to actually track your
conversions so we know that you've had
to keep track of your conversion ID your
conversion labels it can be a headache
oftentimes you had to make code changes
to run a marketing campaign this can be
you can often sometimes create friction
between the marketers and the developers
in a product org so we've been very
deliberate about actually shaping our
integration between average and firebase
so it comes in a couple of different
parts the first part is you establish a
link between your firebase app and your
AdWords account by establishing that
link that handshake a bunch of features
get unlocked for example you get
conversion tracking and you can import
any of the conversions that you had
access to in firebase you can track your
AdWords campaigns against them and then
secondly you can also target the
audiences that you've created using your
firebase analytics data in Adwords so a
really powerful way that shouldn't
require any code changes from the
marketing perspective you should be able
to do everything you need as a marketer
directly from the UI all right so Mike
decides to run some universal app
campaigns and universal app campaigns
are an AdWords feature that were
launched last year to basically make
your life as an art app mark
a lot easier so Google has access to all
of these touch points when users are on
their mobile phones right there's Google
comm and users searching for Apps and
Google com
of course there's Google Play and
actually discovering those apps in the
Play Store we have the mobile Display
Network so both on mobile web and across
other apps and add an inventory and
AdMob and then finally of course YouTube
right so we have all these different
touch points and instead of asking you
as a marketer to continue to maintain
each one of these channels and have
individual strategies for each one of
these you can book a campaign once with
universal app campaigns campaigns and
then we will deploy those campaigns
across all these different touch points
to remove some of the burden on you as a
marketer so from past experience Mike
knows that universal app campaigns are
pretty effective at running
cost-efficient CPI's but basically he
knows this could be a good approach to
actually acquiring some of those 300
thousand users that he has as a goal and
so the first thing that he's going to do
as we talked about earlier login to
Adwords he's gonna link his adwords
campaign with his firebase he's gonna
link his adwords account with his
firebase project this is a one-time task
and then the rest of his campaigns and
data will flow seamlessly he's gonna
select which conversions to import into
Adwords and as we highlighted on the
attribution tab we're gonna have the
first open which is basically like
installs driving installs secondly he's
going to be importing his in-app
purchases so it's the items that are
being purchased in the app and then
finally it's that third conversion the
spend virtual currency conversion even
though he's focused on driving installs
those were like first opens he still
wants to import all of the conversions
that he has access to since those are
good signs of engagement and he'd like
to measure the performance of his ad
campaigns across those in-app events as
well as
his first opens so he's linked his
AdWords account
he's imported the conversions he cares
about and then finally later on we'll
look at an example of him actually using
remarketing campaigns for the audience's
that he has access to all right but Mike
also knows that he doesn't want to put
all of his eggs in one basket
he thinks that AdWords will be powerful
but he doesn't want to battle not
entirely so that's why he's also running
campaigns with a couple of other
networks so with in firebase analytics
on the attribution section which is
going to be the home page basically for
any marketer using the product he can go
into the network settings tab and access
over 20 major ad networks to run
campaigns with so they don't have to be
Google Networks these are other networks
that we as firebase are partnering with
and he goes ahead and sets up a campaign
for advice now advises a hypothetical AB
Network but he knows or he thinks it
could be successful and there's a couple
of different steps first of all he's
going to generate a tracking URL that's
available to him within the firebase UI
and this tracking URL he'll be able to
send over to advise it will include a
lot of the metadata that we need to do a
click tracking with advice now if you've
ever tried to track acquisition
campaigns before especially if you tried
to do with Google Analytics this was a
lot harder to do but now we've embedded
this URL builder
into the product and we've explicitly
developed these integrations with a
whole bunch of different networks so
from your perspective all you have to do
is copy and paste this URL put it in
your ad network when you're actually
running two campaigns and this will be
the destination will do the rest of the
processing from here so this is for
attribution tracking and if he ran the
campaign with this when he logs into his
attribution section later he would be
able to see for his install campaigns
basically all the advise installs that
he's brought in but if he's doing this
then he's not putting the advice SDK in
his app which is of course one of the
main reasons why he's using firebase
analytics but he knows that in order to
best work with advise it usually helps
if he's
the data back to advise some of its
conversion data so they can actually do
optimization in their systems
so this is where post fax comes in post
box is the ability for an advertiser to
send their conversion data back to the
ad networks they work with this is one
of the main reasons while you can
replace all these specific ad network UI
SDKs with a single firebase SDK so in
firebase you're collecting all the data
but with postbox you're sending it back
to the networks that you're working with
and so here in the post back section at
the bottom he selects that the
conversions that he actually wants to
send back so he's gonna select all three
conversions first open spend virtual
currency and in-app purchase and then
also he has the option just to send just
the conversions that advise is
responsible for bringing him or all the
conversions that he's gotten with his
app and Mike's feeling pretty generous
so he's going to go ahead and select to
send all the conversions that he's
gotten with his app because he knows
that advisors gonna do the best job
optimising when they have more
information all right another thing I
didn't tell you when he was setting up
the universal app campaign was that he
when he set up his app campaign he
decided to target the US and Australia
and the reason why he did that was
because last week when Mike was on
Twitter he saw a couple of folks in
Australia mentioning Transworld endless
skater when he clicked around he was
exploring turns out that there is a
pretty engaged developer community or
pretty engaged gaming community in
Australia that had discovered Transworld
endless skater and was pretty excited
about it
however when he looked at the
performance of the app in Australia he
noticed that only less than 10% of his
users are actually coming from Australia
and so this basically led him to believe
that maybe there's this untapped market
in Australia but maybe he should
actually be running more campaigns there
hence why he had targeted his universal
app campaign at Australia specifically
so to
this hypothesis he goes into the
audiences section of firebase analytics
and creates an audience of users who are
in Australia so because he wants to
continue to analyze this particular
segment of users and see if in fact he
was right that this could be potentially
high-value segments so you can see here
we have the list of the audiences he has
access to he just recently created this
Australian users one and next time he
comes into the experience he can see if
his hypothesis was in fact correct all
right
so at this point I want to talk about
moving the needle or moving the bottom
line so up until this point I've just
been talking about more installs but
something you haven't been talking about
is around monetization and currently
with firebase analytics we track revenue
for you for the in-app purchase event
and the e-commerce event purchase event
so these are the transactional events
that we know are revenue based and so
that's what's factoring into our ARPU or
into our LTV metrics so Mike here has
two additional goals beyond the installs
goals that I talked about earlier we had
that three hundred thousand installs
goals but he also has an engagement
metric that he's trying to drive of
moving the daily average engagement up
from 15 minutes to 20 minutes and then
secondly he has a monetization goal of
moving his art proof from what was
originally 90 cents to three dollars and
when he checks in after he's been
running these ad campaigns he did he was
able to move it up to at least a dollar
50 so it's somewhere it's made some
movement but between a dollar fifty and
three dollars he has a lot of work to do
so to actually dig into how to figure
out how he would better move the needle
and figure out how he could drive up
that ARPU he clicks into the funnel
section of firebase analytics and in
funnels you can create basically a
visualization of different events in
your app and how they relate to one
another see how users are actually
moving through different parts of your
user journey he creates a pretty simple
funnel this one's called purchasers
has only two steps the first step is
users who basically ever launched the
app its users who had first open and
then the second step is users who
actually went on to make an in-app
purchase when he creates this funnel he
realizes his conversion rate is a very
measly 0.3 percent so not many people
are actually tracing purchases so
definitely room for improvement he's
trying to figure out basically how he
could make a difference on this front
and to do this he comes back to the
attribution tab he's looking at all the
relative campaign performance next to
each other and he sees that there's one
network I'm calling stomp Network here
that is performing much lower than some
of the other ones so it is bringing in a
couple hundred installs so good volume
but when he looks at the lifetime value
value metric for this particular network
he realizes at zero so they're bringing
in installs but it's not really the
installs he's looking for so he decides
to go ahead and reallocate his funds
away from stomp Network and invest him
in another place all right so that's one
thing he did to actually hopefully bump
up that are poun umber we're going to
talk about a couple more in a few
minutes now another thing he notices is
he had run that AdWords campaign and
over the last week he has seen over 50%
of the new users he's been acquiring
have been from Australia so that's
comforting it looks like maybe in fact
that hypothesis was a reasonable
hypothesis that Australia could be an
untapped market for him all right and
then there's a couple more ways that
he's gonna try to move that our coup
metric up a little bit more the first is
when he came into the audience's section
he found there was an audience named
purchasers so this is basically any of
the users that were purchasing his in
his app when we clicked in he realized
that there was actually a pretty high
distribution of his purchasers who were
in Japan now this is interesting because
a the app is not localized in Japan he's
not trying to do anything to drive users
in Japan specifically and then when he
looks at just his plain usage numbers
the
distribution of users in Japan wasn't
particularly high but for some reason it
seems like the users who are in Japan
are more inclined to actually purchase
so he decides to go ahead and run a
campaign and acquisition campaign with
creative localized and Japanese so even
though the app isn't localized in
Japanese he wants to see if potentially
localizing his creative and Japanese and
his ad campaigns might make a difference
to actually bring in more Japanese users
and the second thing that he does is he
creates a reengagement campaign using
his purchasers audience so in AdWords he
sets a brewery engagement campaign and
he targets those that he already know
knows have actually purchased in the so
they're known purchasers their users he
wants to continue to foster a
relationship with and so he sets up a
retargeting campaign for these users
specifically so there's a those are two
additional things beyond taking funds
away from stock network that he's trying
to do to optimize his art poo all right
and now it's at the end of the month so
I'm happy to report that mike has
succeeded in many of his goals so first
of all he was able to exceed the 300,000
installs goal that he that we set out at
the beginning of the session who's also
to able to move the needle on the daily
average engagement metric so it had
started off at 15 minutes and now we're
at 23 minutes and then finally for the
art Pooh metric where we listed out
those couple of different things that we
did to try to move the needle on that
front he was able to move it up to 3
dollars and 30 cents when his initial
goal was three dollars so how did it
happy to report then Mike and history
team will be able to celebrate with
drinks tonight much like I hope that me
and my team will be able to celebrate
with drinks tonight after this week all
right we talked a lot about advertising
and how firebase analytics can be used
for advertising but I also want to
highlight a couple of ways that it can
be used in conjunction with some of your
organic tools since we know that as a
marketer you're probably not just
running ad campaigns that's just one of
the tools that you're using in your
toolbox but you've got a couple other
channels as well so first of all I want
to touch on firebase notifications so
notifications are a great way to engage
in a conversation with your users
directly and on firebase analytics
they're supported on both iOS and
Android and like firebase analytics
they're totally free and unlimited so a
really powerful way to engage in a
conversation with your users directly
free engagement purposes and there's two
particular integrations with analytics
that I want to highlight so first of all
similar to AdWords you can target the
audiences that you've created in
firebase analytics within notifications
so you can be serving them experiences
that make sense in that context and then
also you can use firebase analytics to
actually understand how your campaigns
performed so how many notification opens
did you get how many opens did you
actually drive with a particular push
notification or four users that came in
on a particular chip campaign what did
their behavior look like once they
entered the app you can apply that as a
filter throughout the firebase
experience that's throughout the
firebase analytics experience to
actually see how users who came from a
particular notification then went on to
navigate your app you can also measure
it against your conversion so how many
in-app purchases did a particular
campaign drive a second type of organic
Channel I want to highlight is the app
invites so app invites are a great way
to facilitate the relationship between
your users and their contacts so it's
not just about you and your users in
that relationship but actually
facilitating a bigger network so again
you can use firebase analytics to notify
identified groups that you would want to
actually notify reach out to you target
those users and then serve give them the
opportunity to share the app using SMS
or email to bring in their most
frequently contacted users
of course you can pair this with dynamic
links which I know there's been a couple
other sessions for where you could
actually take users to a specific screen
in the app once they've clicked through
on a download and then finally we have
app indexing so Google has indexed over
a hundred billion deep links and 40% of
all Android queries returned app links
so basically this is an incredible
opportunity for exposure for marketers
to actually help users find content
within their apps so you can imagine
initially when apps were created apps
were very much walled gardens and in
some cases they still can be but with
features like app indexing we're really
looking to help our users discover the
content within the app without actually
having to navigate through the full app
to experience that and this is
particularly powerful when it comes to
reengagement and trying to get your
known users back into the app now
there's a couple of different companies
that I think have done this really well
that I want to highlight so these are
three different examples of apps and
these are all search engine results page
so you can imagine this is basically
what a user would see and here are these
blue dots are where the user would
actually be clicking so first up on the
left here we've got the realtor.com app
and the query in Google here is I think
homes for sale and Sunnyvale and so when
I click on that line item which is at
the top here I get taken inside at the
realtor.com app to a map focused on
Sunnyvale able to see all of the homes
for sale so pretty cool that I as a user
had to do no additional work beyond
clicking and I'm in the app it's a much
more rich experience and it's exactly
what I set out to look for in the first
place all right here in the middle I've
got an example of me searching for the
restaurant cookery in San Francisco and
when I click on the TripAdvisor link I'm
taken directly to that list
in the TripAdvisor app I can see the
reviews for that particular restaurant
and then finally on the right I've got
the Expedia app I'm looking at hotels in
Tokyo and similar to the homes in
Mountain View or homes in Sunnyvale that
I saw a minute ago I'm taken into the
app I can see a map with all of the
available hotels it's a pretty powerful
way to get our users exactly what they
want with a ton of context while making
them do very little work all right so
enough from the p.m. on firebase
analytics about Wi-Fi race is so great I
want to let you hear from a couple of
our app developers who have been using
some of the tools as well so I think
actually Joe is here in the audience
he's from spark people she was right
over here and so Joe shared with us the
ability to sink his AdWords data to
firebase analytics has simplified his
daily management and optimization from
hours to minutes so he can spend more
time building an app that his users will
love I would love to have ours back in
my day so where somebody would do this
for my job but pretty cool to see how
building these types of tools can make
basically create more time for our app
developers to do the thing that they
actually want to do instead of the thing
that they need to do because tools are
making them do it and then we also had
recruit which is a Japanese company
using the integration between Adwords
and firebase and and one of the
marketing managers over on that front
had emailed us that Adwords and firebase
analytics just work better together
so we built firebase analytics to be a
growth engine for you guys as marketers
so you can develop and grow your user
base whether you consider yourself a
developer or a marketer as a quick recap
of this conversation a couple of it
covered a couple of different things
first I highlighted firebase analytics
in general then we talked about how you
could actually use it to track your
advertising or paid channels and then
finally we wrapped up by talking about
some of the organic or non-vertical that
you can use firebase analytics with so
as we've been crossed
crafting firebase analytics we've been
very deliberate about building a tool
that would work well not just for
developers also for marketers so we're
really excited to see what you guys will
do with this thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
