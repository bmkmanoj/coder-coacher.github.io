from the firebase team and this be
barrels away from the Google developer
relations team and today we're going to
talk with you about pirate metrics so
what are pirate metrics
it's a term coined by dave McClure of
500 startups they simplify and breakdown
a product users lifecycle explaining the
right parameters to track the first
element in any user lifecycle is the
acquisition of that user meaning the
users install your app or visit your
site now users are required in many
different ways either organically such
as through social media communications
App Store optimization search news
content marketing or it can also be in
organically which is usually advertising
congratulations you have acquired a user
however your job is less than half done
what you really need to do is show them
the true value of your product you want
to get them hooked or in other words you
want to activate them so if you have a
game where pirates compete with each
other you want to ensure that a user may
be at least completes a few levels to
see the awesome graphics the twists and
turns in storyline the gameplay and all
those other things that make the game so
special the apps and game industry is a
rough sea and even if you activate users
you're going to face challenges to keep
them coming back a typical person only
uses about 26% of the installed apps
daily a ton of users either
uninstall or simply forget about the
application in the first few days so the
goal for any healthy product is to find
a strategy to get them to retain their
users if you're churning a lot of your
users the money that you're spending on
acquiring them it's kind of getting
wasted you also want your users to be
the biggest advocates no acquisition
strategy is as powerful as organic
word-of-mouth campaign like if users
love your product they genuinely want
your friends to try it out as well they
want to make it easy for your users to
refer your product and the Seabiscuit's
delicious you want to try some I of
course you see your products should be
just as easy to share as this sea
biscuit was and ultimately you want to
collect some treasure in other words you
want to monetize your users you want to
identify which users bring in more
revenue and understand what makes them
doofy and with this knowledge you can
aim to monetize more of your users and
also maybe get those who are ready using
your application to stick around a bit
longer so they can enjoy it more so
let's summarize the user lifecycle we
have the following five stages
acquisition activation retention
referral and revenue these five stages
are together called pirate metrics still
wondering why well take the first letter
of each of the elements and you get in
the coming videos we're going to look at
each metric individually and also show
you how you can use firebase to track
and improve them to watch the next
