heard something about firebase so far at
this Google i/o yes a little bit well if
you haven't heard firebase is Google's
mobile platform that helps you build
applications quickly and grow your
business and I lead part of the firebase
engineering team that's at the
intersection of firebase and cloud on
the server side and I'm really excited
that on this stage with me is the person
who introduced me to firebase long
before firebase and Google were things
and long before I ever worked at Google
Judy
hello my name is Judy Swan and I
currently do advocacy with tech workers
coalition in San Francisco five years
ago in fact just over five years ago we
looked it up this morning it was May 3rd
I had this idea to go to a hackathon and
I wanted to build the accelerometer was
new at the time and I wanted to build a
paintbrush with your phone and then
you'd like waving around in 3-space and
then look at the thing that you just
drew so Sarah and I went to this
hackathon and it's just so happen to be
flyer bases first-ever public launch so
originally it was going to be local to a
single phone but with firebase we could
really easily like shove the data onto a
webview and that made our demo much more
impactful and it was super fun and like
as a result
Sarah and I our firebase developers 22
and 23 and it's like extra exciting that
um at the keynote they said that
firebase now has the community of
firebase developers is now 1 million
strong so I never imagined that I'd be
up here
I never imagined that I'd be up here
sharing this with you so in preparation
for this Google i/o in recognition that
firebase has grown to be many many
things I thought about what could we put
together that could illustrate how we
build server applications client-server
applications in this new world and I
thought about who do I know who is
really good with development patterns in
general has been developing a really
long time and jen-mei was doing we were
doing servers client server software
with when we used to call them just like
virtual machines like the for cloud was
really a thing and so I'm really excited
to have Jen Mae here on the stage with
me as well yeah thanks Sara
my name is Jen May I work at IndieGoGo
which is a crowdfunding platform and
also in early products launch pad we're
based in San Francisco and we're hiring
so if you're interested please come and
talk to me later in addition to McGill
go I also work with a bunch of nonprofit
organizations in activist groups
including liberating ourselves locally
which is a people of color LED
makerspace and hacker space in East
Oakland and I would love to if you want
to find out more you can check out my
Twitter feed there is an interesting
couple interesting articles from
autostrada land KQED about us working
with the open community loss fund to
preserve that space for the community
but the reason I mention lol is because
our community is mostly people not
techies but people who are activists
people who are artists some of whom have
technical black backgrounds that many of
whom do not and because of my
involvement in this space we often get I
often get requests from people to write
applications for them a lot of people
think that you can just write an app
hand it to someone and you're good but
as we all know you need if it's a
network app you need to have some
infrastructure that that runs on
and so the Eastern Meditation Center
which is another organization in Oakland
asked for a user registration system for
their events and and I ended up building
this on the desktop because the idea of
putting of writing an application and
putting it on the internet would require
a whole lot of work that would mean that
90% of the work would be going into
something they don't care about as
opposed to user registration which is
the one thing that they do care about so
when my friend Sarah started working
with the firebase team and asked me if
I'd be interested in working on a
project by base I thought this is kind
of awesome because this is the
technology which is serverless and so it
should take care of those authentication
issues and security issues and
deployment issues without having to have
a nonprofit like a PMC being responsible
for it which maybe would be really easy
so in this talk we're really going to
dig into some of the challenges across
client and server and I'm really excited
to hear about the work that Jen Mayo is
talking about where this technology
enables small organizations to leverage
technology in ways that they couldn't
before right because they don't have
many developers their developers might
be there intermittently they don't have
an ops team but what this technology is
also really good for which is the main
topic of our talk is creating an
application that is going to scale
phenomenally with your business and
these kinds of applications are
frequently called serverless
applications and it's not because you're
not writing server code it's because
you're not managing servers but we have
some of the same issues that we've
always had writing client-server
software and we'll talk to you about how
we're dealing with those in a specific
application that we developed as an open
source team so you all probably know if
you develop mobile applications that
those applications are running on a wide
variety of operating systems a whole
bunch of different devices different
screen sizes
we have to write code to deal with that
not only that but your app is running
far far away it might have low bandwidth
intermittent connectivity you have to
deal with that and usually these days
it's a lot easier to avoid crashes but
if your app does crash your user is very
aware that that's going on whereas on
the server side we have code that's
running in the cloud and paradoxically
out in the cloud it's actually very
close to us we can instrument it easily
we can deploy new versions we can look
at our log files and when it crashes
it's very different behavior and it
might not actually crash because of our
bug right it might your data center
might be hit by a tornado and your code
chooses to execute randomly in the
middle of execution and we have to write
code differently knowing that that's a
possibility and of course if this if
those unusual but expected events happen
then you you need to do things to make
sure that your user actually has a good
experience at the other end of the line
so we'll be talking about a few of these
challenges and specific solutions how we
often want to keep some of the logic on
the server side in order to protect our
algorithms and make them run resilient
in a resilient way how to deal with
authentication and access control and
how to simplify your UI through real
time data binding the technologies that
we're using are specific Google and
firebase technologies that I think these
applications transcend the specific
technologies we're using the firebase
real-time database cloud functions for
firebase cloud datastore on the server
side and then to connect client and
server we are using firebase
authentication and we have clients in
web
iOS and Android and then incidentally
because it was convenient we're hosting
using firebase hosting and we use
firebase remote config for a kill switch
for making old versions go away when we
no longer want to support them and you
can see the code at github.com slash all
the hubbub so now I'd like to invite
Judy to tell us a little bit about the
app so you have some context for the
presentation Inc you Sara okay so before
going over common patterns that you can
use for a typical application I'll
define what we mean by typical in this
context so here are some characteristics
that are common in many apps almost
everything we're building these days
connects to cloud services to store data
and shows the status to a user via a
client UI and often you'll have a user
profile perhaps connecting multiple
social platforms but the reason you're
doing all of this and the reason we're
all here is that your application will
do something special it's got to have
some kind of secret sauce and hopefully
you'll be presenting something useful to
people so how about this athlete's
dreamed up is an example of an app that
uses these patterns so we'll go through
the user interactions first so you'll
have context for the technical patterns
we're going to show you in the rest of
the talk so on with the whirlwind tour
first you log in with github we
automatically create a hub of profiling
for you in the background invisibly to
you using public information from your
github profile you press the material
plus button to add events which brings
you to an events list so here you can
pick which events to join and you go
back to your home screen where you've
seen the events that you've signed up
for after you unless people have joined
a particular event it's up to us as hub
of admins to assign lunch groups and we
do that via a web interface so here is
our admin console on the web after
you've all signed up for lunch
we'll make group assignments so we hit
the button secret awesomesauce happens
and when you look at your home
on your device you will see that you can
assign to a group and since we're using
real time you'll see it immediately so
you're assigned a topic it's got all of
the information about where to go and
when and when you report to the
community area to meet fellow lungers
you'll tap on find your group which will
bring out what we're calling the beacon
screen you'll hold up your phone and
find people with the same bub and that's
how you'll match with your group so then
you don't have to yell or hold up a big
sign or ever feel lonely again
so now I'll hand it off to Jen Mae who
will dive into how the app is built Jim
so I'm going to talk about what's inside
the app so first you start with as Judy
said awesomesauce your awesome class
could be a user interface or it could be
a special algorithm that you want to put
in front of your users but before you
can put it in front of your users you
have to build up that extra code that I
mentioned before for example on the
clients you have your API client that
needs to talk to the server get some
data back update the UI state in the
client that then gets rendered back into
the UI for the user on the server side
you're going to have to have first of
all a server and you're going to have to
have an API use service that responds to
those requests from the clients and it
talks to your business logic including
your secret sauce algorithm which then
may talk to you a database or some other
services before sending data back that
goes back to the client and that just
describes the simple case of a situation
where you have an application that you
want to be able to make queries of a
server if you also want the information
flow to go the other way for example
with real-time updates then you need to
do a bit more work and that doesn't even
get into all the other things that you
have to do like thinking about scaling
or thinking about the server maintenance
like your network card goes bad and you
need to switch out a server or dealing
with multiple clients so here we're just
showing one
clients but as we mentioned we have a
web client an android client and an iOS
client for that web project and of
course we haven't talked about the
security issues that you might have as
well so this is sort of talks about
using firebase technologies to make all
of this easier so as you can see all
those parts that you would normally have
to build yourself are provided for you
by firebase on the client side we're
using firebase the real-time database to
take care of both the saint's management
and also communication with the server
we are also using the authentication
features as Sarah had mentioned earlier
but we don't have to write that
ourselves on the server side everything
is in the cloud no servers I mean no
servers that we care about there's
totally servers and our algorithm is
running in firebase cloud functions and
it is communicating to the client
through the firebase real time database
and it is also using cloud datastore to
store some information and so putting it
all together we have several different
applications a web app and iOS app and
Android app they communicate to the
real-time database this causes cloud
functions to run which do things like
call to github API and process
information put stuff in the cloud
datastore puts us back into the real
time API which the real time database
which then pushes information back to
the client
additionally the clients are triggering
some cloud functions using HTTP and the
reason that we did that is because it
was very straightforward for error
handling we could get an immediate
response back from the server once we
knew what that was and we could handle
it if something unexpected were to take
place and I want to mention real quick
the reason we're using cloud datastore
on the backend is because we hope that
hub of will become a very popular
application as many people do when they
make apps
and cloud datastore unlike the real-time
database is horizontally scalable if you
have a query that returns ten results
and your database size is 10 megabytes
that'll take the same amount of time as
if your database size with 10 beta bytes
which is really amazing and you don't
have to take care of any of that
scalability yourself you don't have to
provision servers if I'll handle
automatically because it's the cloud so
on to our special sauce so firebase
makes it really easy for us to focus on
our special sauce instead of all that
infrastructure that we had mentioned and
there's two parts to our special sauce
one is the profile generation and the
other part is the matching process so
for a profile generation and this is as
Judy mentioned we're on a device like
let's say an iPhone you run the app and
you're prompted to sign in with github
when you sign in with github all we get
back isn't a lot silk'n and that's our
little hubbub icon saying we because
it's dropping the OAuth token onto the
real time database and something really
exciting is going to happen ABB's
exploring from your local state doesn't
have any information about the user
besides Allah spoken so if we were to
display the profile it would be empty
which you might do for performance
reasons but in our case we actually show
a loading indicator and then when the
information comes back from the real
time database we then display the
profile so once the OAuth token ends up
in the real time database it triggers a
cloud function in this case one to
update the profile this calls out the
github get some information and passes
it back to the real time database in a
format that we want for for the client
application which can then display it to
users and just a real quick note the way
that we're using the real time database
as our API we've been very careful to
kind of sequester the information that's
being used for transport versus data
that's being used for other purposes
that we might want to use on the backend
for example and with those bits of data
it's going to be really important for us
to make sure that if we make schema
changes that those changes are
compatible
with various versions of our application
because we can't always guarantee that
people update when we think that they're
going to so the next thing the next
secret sauce is our matching process and
and the first part of that actually
happens during profile generation so
after sending that information to the
real-time database the cloud function
actually does a potentially long-running
process of calling into github and
getting information about you like your
strap Azza Tory's depending on how much
information that is it can take a
significant amount of time and we don't
want to do that on a client device
because you could lose in network
connectivity and also battery use so we
do all that in the cloud and we process
all that information we put it into
cloud datastore again because it is
horizontally scalable and then that's it
we don't put anything into the real time
database because the user doesn't need
to know about it next after a whole
bunch of people have done that we have a
lot of data in the database and we at
one point in time before the event we
closed reservations so that we don't end
up anybody end up with anybody in a
topic by themselves we want everyone to
be able to be able to talk to people who
have common interests and we recreate
the groups and the topics and then we
announce the groups and then you can
show you can you can have them on your
beacon screen so you can find other hubs
now I want to take a moment to talk
about cloud function triggers which is
what we're using to make all this magic
happen as I mentioned before we are
using real time database right and we
are using HTTP there are also some other
triggers which I'll mention in a little
bit but first I want to show you about
the entry point to cloud functions so
cloud functions is the functions
directory in a web app repo and index
ijs is the entry point and for firebase
cloud functions as opposed to regular
cloud functions you don't have to worry
about routing for your HTTP
since I'm going to show you that soon
and but you do need to set up your your
admin SDK so you have access to the
database the admin SDK differs from the
client SDK which we're using in the
client app because it has privileged
access the client SDK you only have
access to what that login user has
access to which Sarah will talk about
later about how we narrowed that down to
a small set of data but the admin SDK
allows us access anything and you can
only initialize the admin SDK once so we
actually pass our initialize admin SDK
instance to these other classes that we
have put into other files because we
want to develop our code modular lis and
so we have a very small index @jf with
most of our code extracted to other
files so here's an example of the update
profile function you can see in the
slide that we are listening for a change
to the github token for a given user ID
which is embraces because we care about
that and we'll want to use it in our
cloud function in the accounts
collection when whence the a changes
happens which could be the creation of a
github token the deletion of a github
token or a change the github token then
our cloud function gets triggered and
were passed an event and this event
includes the user ID which we can use
the query to get the users information
from the real-time database and make our
connections to github and so on we also
have some functions triggered by HTTP
calls so here's an example of that this
is our time slot where as I mentioned
before you don't need to declare a route
it's done for you automatically based on
the function name that you are exporting
and this is the difference between
firebase cloud functions and regular
cloud functions but you still get your
request and response objects similar to
what you would use for it
and there are a few other triggers as
well for example you can have an
authentication trigger when us
indicating creating accounts that
configure a cloud function as well
there are analytics events that you can
listen to so if something happens you
can trigger a cloud function to take
care of that and cloud storage which is
an example of which would be if a file
gets uploaded and pub sub and sub-sub is
very notable because many services that
Google has support pub/sub so for
example gmail has some events that you
can subscribe to and you could take your
cloud functions to be triggered based on
those events and for testing when you're
in development you can also use the
command line interface and with that I'm
gonna pass it back to Sarah to talk
about pub safety so we're developing
software for people and we want to make
sure that we keep those people safe and
we keep their data private when it needs
to be private and so I'm going to talk a
little bit about authentication and and
then spend a little more time talking
about how we authorize clients to access
different parts of database using
security rules so first I'm just going
to give a quick overview of Olas which
we're using in this application to
identify the user and also to make
back-end calls with to the github API so
in this case we have our user hubbub
ducky who logs in to the hubbub app the
hubbub app redirects or shows a web view
of the github authentication screen so
when people are using OAuth they're
entering their credentials to their o
auth provider your app it doesn't get
the username and password and so that's
a key security measure so that the user
could always revoke that privilege so
then you we're then allowing the user to
access our app so the the revocation
it's important to note is really about
our access
to that data so but then you can also
use OAuth simply to identify the user
and then under the hood here we're using
firebase authentication so what that
does is it manages a lot of these
details for you and also allows you to
have an identity and an authentication
system that could support federated
identity so we could add Twitter or
Facebook to this and allow people to log
in with multiple identities and that
would be managed by firebase
authentication so right now it's a
fairly simple system but knowing a
little bit of what's going on under the
hood kind of helps us think about how to
develop this app so knowing that the
client needs to present the OAuth
provider login screen then helps you
remember that the the token for that
OAuth provider the github token in our
case is only available on the client and
also if it were to expire the client
really needs to control the reallocation
so what we do in that case is we save
that github token in the real-time
database which makes it available as Jen
may point it out to to the server side
for accessing the github API and then if
there's to be an error with that token
expires we set the real time database to
null for that value that automatically
syncs to the client and then the client
can cause the user to log in so that
this whole authentication piece is of
course important when we want to make
sure that a specific user is accessing
their data and allowing allowing reads
and writes according to user information
so when we're developing client server
software as we are with mobile
applications it's important to remember
that even though we might be doing
client-side validation which is a good
user experience
all the server is getting is ones and
zeroes it doesn't really know that our
code is on the other side so we always
need to make sure that from a security
perspective things are locked down on
the server side and with firebase we can
do that with security rules so here's a
quick overview of the data model of our
application we're going to start with
accounts and profiles which is how we
model the user data so under accounts
for examples the github token which is
something that's private to the
individual user in profile those are
things that are shared with other people
in the community in our case it's just
public data so that the way we've locked
this down is that we've grouped every
under account we have user nodes are
identified by their UID and then this
expression shows that for if we have a
matching UID for this node well then the
request needs to be authenticated and
that user ID needs to match
whereas profiles are readable by anybody
that's of course a business choice we
decided profiles can be used by anybody
and not a common thing to do is to say
well we want people to log in to use our
app therefore profiles will require
authentication and they can be expressed
with weather office no so our app
evolves and it turns out that we wanted
to do some additional things which are
available to the client like whether
they're an admin but you don't want the
client to be able to say yes I'm an
admin I'm just going to independently
decide that it set that to be true so
the we modified our server rules so that
the client can read anything but then we
whitelist specific fields that have
higher privilege so the client writes
the github token but everything else is
read-only and so this is generally a
good pattern those of you who do
security stuff know that you want to
give the most lockdown privileges by
default and then select higher access
for specific things
so then we have this other set of data
that is used by the client server to do
the business of the app so events are
written by the design was it be written
by the admin tool in reality they're
written by a script so right now they're
just readable by everyone by default as
Jenny mentioned as soon they mentioned
they are the admin SDK can access
anything and so that they can be written
by it from the backend requests these
are just a bookkeeping done by the
server side the the request to join an
event is done by an HTTP trigger that
cloud function stores some information
here later another cloud function pulls
together the request from it to assign
people to groups so that doesn't need
any rules because by default the client
doesn't have access to anything for the
assignments this is the grouping this is
a little fancier we have events and
under those we have topics that are
grouped by ID and under that we have
lists of members so we decided to do is
make it so that if you can see any
member of your group and on iOS we
actually designed a screen which you saw
earlier which shows you the other people
on your in your group and that's
generally a good idea that you want your
privacy model to be transparent in your
interface if the user's data can be seen
by other people it's nice to show that
so that they can reason about the
privacy of their experience the way that
we express this in security rules is
that we can write a slightly more
complex expression here that says that
ok if the members has any child that
matches this authenticated user well
then they can read that whole node and
so you can see how you these concise
expressions I mean that our whole rules
take place in a lot of page and it can
be very easy to audit that our privacy
settings are what we want them to be so
use firebase rules to keep your
community safe using a simple
declarative syntax
I want to hand this back to duty to talk
about real time ok so now that we've
heard about secret class and cloud
functions and keeping bubs safe with
security rules it's time to get into
some client code so let's look at one
tiny part of the app the profile view
and I'll show you our implementations
across three clients platforms iOS
Android and web so keeping up with the
theme of simplifying development
firebase real time database has many
SDKs so you can code all the things so
data binding is a user interface pattern
to deal with data that changes stuff
changing in one place means it also
changes in the other place and it's
magical data flows both this way and
that way
so in our apps we've got a client
talking through a real time database and
back again we've also got cloud
functions and our admin app passing data
back and forth so for this profile
example we're just looking at data going
from the database to the client so the
data is only going in one way so in
these next three code examples look for
two things how we're watching for data
and the callback which is what to do
when you have observed that data has
changed so in our app we're using the
observable pattern observables are an
implementation of data binding we used
to use simple callbacks before
observables were adopted by common
frameworks we keep the connection open
to the database by observing part of it
and receive events in a stream and
whenever receive it we receive an event
we do stuff so this bit of Swiss code
renders the profile on an iPhone and
here's a visual reference from hub Zemke
so you can see that we're watching the
database with the observe and through
the callback that gets called when the
profile changes
when when it gets called it sets the
data on the view which causes changes on
the view to render so moving on to
Android here's an example using the
firebase Android SDK so in this case
we're watching for data with add
listener for single value event so as an
aside this listener which is in an
observable grab the first piece of data
that comes in through the stream and
closes the connection afterward because
we're not expecting profile data to
change a lot during this user session
and then the callback as you can see
that's the profile data moving on to web
here we have some type script again
making the profile our app uses angular
4 and this code works for angular 2 plus
so you can find the place we're watching
for data at observable data not
subscribed so observable data has the
database reference in it when you
subscribe to the observable by calling
thought subscribe
that opens up a database connection if
there wasn't a connection open already
so the key point here is you can listen
to an observable in multiple locations
in your code which is nice because if
you've got a bunch of subscriptions to
the same piece of data all of them can
use the same single connection to the
database and of course we've got the
callback setting the profile data that
we just got and this leaves in an
angular service that leaves the world so
of course we have situations where the
client needs to talk to the server too
so now let's talk about data flowing
both ways one reason data binding is
convenient for developers is that you
can use the same code to do the initial
display of data to the user as well as
render dynamic data that comes in during
the user session so to illustrate let's
look at how the user selects events to
join on the admin console on the right a
web app we have defined some events and
sent them to the database the client on
the Left gets this data from the
database the person uses the app to
select some events and the client sends
back hey I'd like to
sign up for lunch on Friday so this is
where observables are really handy so
here we have some more client code
here's how we present the view of events
with checkboxes in the web app so
harkening back to what Sarah said
earlier about organizing your models we
keep the list of possible events
separate from the ones that the user has
signed up for so they're in different
parts of the database and as Sarah
mentioned we're using security rules
that are easy to reason about and
Express so the list of possible events
is writable only by admins and the users
event signups are only writable by that
particular user so when it comes time to
combine this data we're doing it on the
client so the interesting thing to look
at in this bit of code is how we are
chaining observables so we've got full
slot lists watching the list of possible
events and user slot lists watching this
particular person sign up so for event
for like which events to display we're
using real time for configuration so um
just yeah so just for a little note
about configuration there's many ways to
do this um in our apps we use like three
ways of configuring things so first
we've got a live configuration which is
how we configure the kill switch or the
iOS app to tell youth
and we've got app build config which is
like staging and production URLs token
secrets and of course the real time
database to tell us what events we're
showing so we use real time for
configuring events because we wanted to
be able to create events live and assign
groups dynamically so with the real time
database user state syncs across web and
mobile staying visible and up to date on
each so we can also imagine a
multi-party interaction maybe there are
many people looking at their pending
events and at that moment and
I mean one of us assigns groups this
triggers a cloud function rights new
abate data back to the real-time
database and users will see their update
get or their event get updated in real
time so who wants to see this magic
happen let's have lunch tomorrow so go
to hub of dot live and download the app
sign yourself up for the timeslot for
tomorrow and at noon we're going to meet
at the gray Android which is near this
stage on the lawn this is what it looks
like and will hold up our phones and
find each other so apologies to the live
stream audience we've built a hyperlocal
real-time app so many many thanks to our
fellow hubs who works on all of this
please stand up and give us a hub of
wave and thank you all for coming come
hang out with us at the firebase down
box which is in that direction all the
hubs and the firebase team will be
available to answer questions thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
