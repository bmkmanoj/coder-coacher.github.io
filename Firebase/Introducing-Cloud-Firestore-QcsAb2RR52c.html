developing these days there's a good
chance you'll want to store your data in
the cloud maybe that's because your
users want to share their data with
their friends for some exciting in-app
collaboration or maybe it's just because
they'll want to access their data from
more than one device but storing data in
the cloud is that quite as easy as it
first looks you have to set up your own
servers to host the data and keep them
up and running day and night you got to
spend a lot of time on the client
dealing with networking issues including
making sure everything still works when
your user goes offline you need to stay
up all night wondering if you've gotten
your security exactly right and spoiler
alert you probably have it and then you
need to make sure your service can scale
no matter how many millions of users you
might have all of which is time you
don't get to spend on building your app
this is where cloud firestore comes in
cloud firestore lets you store your data
in the cloud so you can sync it across
all your devices or share them among
multiple users and it comes with all the
conveniences you'd expect from a
firebase product like robust client
libraries full support for offline mode
so your app will continue to work just
fine whether you're connected or not
even on the web a comprehensive set of
security rules to help you manage access
and sleep at night and an easy to use
data browsing tool it also lets you
structure your data in ways that make
sense to you thanks to its powerful
querying and fetching capabilities cloud
firestore works in near real-time
automatically fetching changes from your
database as they happen or you can
request and fetch data manually it's
completely up to you cloud firestore
brings you the best of Google cloud
platforms powerful database
infrastructure with features like multi
regional data replication for extra
reliability strong consistency to make
sure everybody's on the same page and
multi document transactions you can
perform complex operations on your data
and we've designed it to handle the
toughest workloads from the world's most
popular apps so it can scale
automatically to support yours
but it still integrates with other
firebase products including firebase
authentication for easy sign-in and
cloud functions which lets you run all
sorts of server-side logic in response
to changes in your database all of which
means you get a truly service
development experience and that means
you can spend less time on
for structure issues and more time
building your app so give cloud
firestore try today you can find all
their documentation here try a sampler
too and start building something great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
