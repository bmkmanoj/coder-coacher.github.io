person and I'm going to show you how to
generate auth tokens using the firebase
admin SDK firebase authentication has
some great built-in options for getting
your users logged into your app such as
email and password and Google
authentication but you also have the
option to use your own custom
authentication scheme you may already be
using an authentication scheme you like
or it may be a requirement of your
application to use some specific form of
authentication firebase gives you
complete control over authentication by
allowing you to authenticate users or
devices using secure JSON web tokens
pronounced John
jobs enable you to sign in with custom
authentication methods beyond those
currently supported by default in
firebase one way to use jots is to
generate them on a secure server that
you manage pass them back to the client
device and then use them to authenticate
via sign and custom token method to
achieve this you must create a server
endpoint that accepts signing
credentials such as a username and
password and if the credentials are
valid returns a custom jots the custom
job returned from your server can then
be used by a client device to
authenticate with firebase on iOS
Android or web once authenticated the
token can be used for accessing other
firebase services such as firebase
real-time database and cloud storage
today I'll show you how to create a job
using the admin SDK for go but you can
also create a jot using the admin SDK
for Java nodejs and Python let's get
started by adding and initializing the
SDK first I need service account
credentials which I can download from
the firebase console under the firebase
admin SDK tab I'll select generate new
private key
this downloads a JSON file containing
the service account credentials I'll add
this to my projects directory then I'll
use the go get utility to install the go
admin SDK once that's in place I'll
import the required packages to Maine
dot go
then I can initialize the SDK using my
downloaded service account key file if
the initialization is successful I can
use the app object if an error is
returned I'll handle it here the
firebase admin SDK provides a mechanism
for creating custom tokens these tokens
expire after one hour but once you sign
any user using sign-in with custom token
they will remain signed into the device
until their session is invalidated or
the user signs out tokens expire to
prevent someone from authenticating
forever to the app once they logged in
at least once you need to provide a UID
which can be any string that uniquely
identifies the user or device you are
authenticating once the token is
returned to the client if the
authentication succeeds your user will
be now signed into your client app with
the account specified in the UID
included in the custom token if a
firebase account with the given UID did
not previously exist a record for that
user will be created with the UID
provided by the token you can also
include claims which can customize what
data the client can access I'll show you
what that looks like to using an iOS app
I made that displays a special photo or
message to users who upgrade to premium
content let's get going on the code to
create custom tokens using my
initialized app object I can call app
dot off to get an instance of off client
or an error if there's an error I'll
print it and return client is the
interface for the firebase off service
it facilitates generating custom shots
for firebase clients and verifying ID
tokens issued by firebase back-end
services so I'll now use client to
generate a custom token since the UID
can be any string I'll just make it some
UID for now if an error is returned I'll
handle it
for the sake of this example I'll just
print the error in return finally I'll
print the custom token this token is
signed with a private key present in the
service account credentials now you also
have the option to include claims to the
custom token here
I'm adding premium account to the custom
token which will be available in the
auth object in my database security
rules and my request off object in my
storage security rules say I have some
content in my database that I want to
restrict to only premium accounts I can
allow access to that data by checking
the premium account claim in the
security rules like this I can store
data in the database under a child
called premium content and enable read
access to this child for any user whose
token allows it I can do something
similar with cloud storage here I'm
using the premium account claim to
configure rules like this one
restricting some files in cloud storage
to users with a premium account claim
I've included some content in my
database and cloud storage that is only
accessible if the auth tokens premium
account claim is set to true so first
let's run the function without the claim
and then with it to see how access of
content changes for the client to test
my function I'm going to run it generate
a UID and then use the resulting token
to authenticate in this simple iOS app I
made and you can see a new user was
created in the database I can also
create a custom token from an existing
UID and sign in from the client I'll
copy the UID paste it into my code where
I had some UID now I'm signed in as this
test user I made earlier but as you can
see I get a message saying I need to
sign up for a premium account to see
custom content if I go back to my code
and include the claim premium account
and run my code again I can use this
custom token to sign in and you can see
content only visible to a premium
account there you have it
now you can create custom tokens that
the client can use to sign in and access
