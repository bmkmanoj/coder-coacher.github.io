firebase I'm James Tamplin a co-founder
and product manager on firebase a fun
fact about me is I so started
programming at the age of 12
using a ti-83 basic in math class
needless to say my math teacher wasn't
pleased our first question comes from
mr. pan for how did you meet firebase
co-founder and early so Andrew and I
actually went to high school together
we've known each other now for about 17
years after we both finished University
Andrew gave me a ring and we had dinner
at a small Midwestern diner and nine
years later we're still working on
making lives easier for developers with
firebase
this next question comes from Harold
wising up and Harold asks is there a way
to run my cloud functions once every
hour
great question Harold unfortunately
currently there isn't however it's our
number one most requested feature for
cloud functions which we launched last
month stay tuned for more news on our
Twitter Facebook and YouTube channels
thanks for the question Harold the next
question
TJ asks can you check the progress on a
database request to know when it's
finished well TJ we have a couple of
ways you can kind of get at this first
of all when you write into the firebase
real time database you can attach an on
complete call back with your set request
this will let you know when the Wright
is completed to disk alternatively you
can check out our firebase real time
database profiler that we released just
a couple of weeks ago this will give you
granularity at a path level into both
the latency and the bandwidth usage this
way you can get a little bit more
insight into what's going on with the
firebase real time database thanks for
the question TJ and check the links in
the description for more information
next question our next question comes
from Steve Chun Kim what's the limit of
fire based projects that can be created
wealth each one it depends we don't
actually publish your document the limit
of projects that can be created since
that number actually depends on inputs
from our spam and abuse teams however a
couple of things to note first billing
accounts or paid accounts don't count
towards this limit so if you're having
trouble you can upgrade to either our
flame which is our $25 a month plan or
our blaze pay-as-you-go plan also
if you're still running into trouble
please reach out to our support team and
they can help you raise that limit check
out that link in the description below
next question
child asks where do you see firebase in
five years well Charles in five years
time we're still going to be creating
great tools that make developers lives
easier
software is playing a bigger and bigger
role in society at large and we want to
help the people creating that software
will do this by allowing them to focus
on solving their customers problems by
letting them not focus on low-level
infrastructure by not making them stitch
together a myriad of growth tools while
I can't comment on specifics I can give
you a few general areas of where we'll
be focusing the first of which is more
deeply integrating with Google cloud
platform this lets developers start with
firebase and then move seamlessly into
Google's public cloud offering second of
all is focus on machine learning and
integrations there it's no secret that
this is a big focus for Google with
integrations we can intelligently
provide recommendations to developers
about next steps they can take to grow
their app or how they can better improve
their app quality it's going to be a
great next five years for firebase and
we're excited to serve you our
developers as best we can thanks for the
question Charles our last question comes
from Gabe who asks how has the culture
of the 5s team changed from joining
Google well Gabe we were 23 people when
we joined Google and now we're more than
10 times the size so things have
certainly changed a little bit however I
would like to think that we've changed
Google more than we've changed ourselves
specifically we've changed Google's
processes towards building developer
products trying to bring a focus on
developers around the globe rather than
just Google engineers we've done this
through things like one-on-one
developers feedback sessions through a
lot of meetups and through introspecting
and dogfooding by preserving this
culture we'll try and make developer
offerings across Google better for you
our developers - thanks for the question
that's all we have time for today but
thanks for all of your questions do keep
them coming on Twitter YouTube Stack
Overflow and more with the hashtag Clio
base i'm james Tamblyn come we'll see
you next time stay tuned
I'm not sure what I'm saying now yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
