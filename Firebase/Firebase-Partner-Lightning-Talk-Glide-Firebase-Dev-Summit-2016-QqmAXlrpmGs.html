developer Clyde and I'm Roy a CTO and
I'm thrilled to be here the firebase
talked about our experience with
firebase how it helps us some of the
things that Steve just talked about how
we use them and how it affects our life
as a company so we're gonna talk briefly
about quality and all of you have
experience with QA engineers labs you
probably have a few devices maybe you're
using cloud the cloud service we have
hundreds of devices in labs but we learn
something that most of you know it
doesn't matter how much testing you do
internally how much testing you do with
some crowd testing or better groups you
will never be able to get to this
specific device specific network
condition in that specific use case that
one device and one user had which is
just one out of millions before we dig
any further and just briefly introduce
Glyde glad is a messaging platform and
we our goal is to have to create a
platform for authentic communication
between human beings we believe that a
smile is much better than a smiley and
for that the best way we believe is a
synchronous live video communication
we're available on multiple platforms
and we're very excited about the
wrist-worn new platforms or relatively
new it's the right place to actually
communicate more accessible we've been
working with Google word team for quite
a while and already now you can
download GLAAD and use it on your we're
device and you'll be able to see live
video of your colleagues friends and
families and be able to respond with
live audio or text obviously we're
missing just one thing which is a camera
and I'm happy to say that last Wednesday
GLAAD has announced to the world cmr a
camera which is the basically adding the
camera functionality to the wearable
device initially just for the Apple
watch 2 HD cameras one front facing one
outward facing that allows you to
quickly communicate with your friends by
the way it's going to be open so any
developer will be able to use the camera
for its own app so we talked about
quality and obviously we want to find
out things sooner than later we're going
to sure that in our case it it's not
always true well one of the first things
the application does upon connection to
the server is sync all the relevant and
new information in order to display it
to the user as fast as possible so part
of that is receiving chat IDs of chats
that I'm part of and then requesting
relevant information about them among
them is the last messages now what
happens if an application requests
information about a chat that it's not
part of well thankfully for that we have
security measures and those security
measures will return a negative answer
to the user to the application saying
you cannot have this information you're
not part of this chat so a few years
back we had not many just a few devices
that as a mistake got chat IDs of chats
that they were not part of so they
requested
nation and requested the last few
messages from those chats and received
an answer that was no unfortunately
those clients did not have known as an
answer and kept on requesting again and
again and again as fast as they could
every time a negative answer came back a
new request came in as a result from
that our servers crashed and a few
alarms were raised yeah it was probably
one of those days that we were trying to
fix the server to make them not crash in
those repeated events hack around it at
the same time try to locate the problem
on the client-side and fix it that image
is very reflective of that day anyway
that is not as a song that is not the
only problem when maintaining a big
application there's one it's I think
it's obvious that the sooner you find a
problem the better it is and our purpose
in life is to make user experience best
and we face challenges in finding those
problem soon and as we all know Android
has some Oasis that are live at the same
time if you support multiple platforms
you will have a few application files
live at the same time if you support
multiple platforms you will have that on
different stores simultaneously and if
you have different hardware's if you
deal with video streaming which is what
we do then you have also vendor issues
now the problem is that once you have so
much information it becomes a bit hard
to understand and analyze that you have
a large array of analytics platforms and
crash logging platforms and it takes
time and resources and people to gather
all this information into one place and
then analyze it and if a bug happens you
need to understand
and what the impact is on the end-user
if it's destroying your current app or
is it the bug that you're currently
fixing and that is something that you
have to know as fast as possible we
encountered a lot of issues because
there was a lot of data and a lot of
places and we didn't have enough time to
analyze it and this is basically where
firebase comes in as you can see here
we've filtered by an application version
as we are releasing it we have all the
relevant information about the health
status of the current release and we
know how many users are using it so if
we actually find the crash which
occasionally happens we can actually
know if it's a bad one or if it's okay
and generally try and fix it as fast as
possible but we prioritize according to
the impact on the end-user
yeah so what you can see here is how
firebase actually affected our rollout
release typically we start with low
percentages and try to understand what's
the impact of users on users what kind
of issues they face and as I said are
those critical etc etc on an average
release firebase analytics that you seen
Steve used have reduced our rollout from
data testing to 100% from approximately
10 days to 7 days but it's even way
stronger when we're using that for pet
release when we have something that is a
fire or close to a fire something that
we want to release quickly we're able to
typically release in a very safe way
within 48 hours that slow release is
typically affected also by the fact that
we live in a different time zone than
most of our users and that's probably
common for many of you here most of our
users are in the States that means that
when we want to test things and see the
events if we don't wait for the
late night hours it's going to take a
day for a cycle integrating firebase has
been very easy literally three lines of
code we added into our configuration
files and this I think is not even
needed anymore because it happens
automatically we tell firebase crash
reporting we had a crash again I think
this already happens automatically now
so basically it's two lines of code we
got everything back we sped up all of
our release cycles and life is much much
better now thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
