about what's possible with cloud
functions for firebase I'm Michael Bly
the engineering lead of firebase hosting
and the firebase command line interface
and I'm Thomas Bolden I'm the
engineering lead for cloud functions for
firebase so Michael and I come from a
background in startups and we noticed
that we had the same rules for how to
build a product and it's carried it
through both startups and corporate life
so we thought we'd share them with you
the first part is the most fun you come
up with an idea that's going to make you
rich and famous you know this is when
you get to daydream about how you're
going to change the world and the second
part is coming back down to reality
because it's going to take a lot of time
and work and you have two choices for
how you want to proceed the first part
or first option is to focus on
engineering and this can be a lot of fun
to build something rock-solid you get to
implement all those cool algorithms you
read about in school and if you're doing
this project as a learning experience
that's that's a fine idea if you're
doing this project for impact it doesn't
tend to end so well so alternatively you
can focus on the user and your market
fit who are your users what do they want
how can you quickly and efficiently
build something that they're willing to
pay for if you can answer these
questions you're on your way to a
successful business and a top post and
hacker news so you should focus on your
market fit instead of engineering but at
the same time you can't actually screw
up that engineering you don't want your
product to collapse as soon as it starts
becoming popular otherwise your best
outlook may be forever fighting this
mountain of technical debt and this is
why we love firebase we took a break
from start-up life to work with firebase
because we think that developers should
be able to enjoy their work
build a scalable product and do it
quickly enough they can focus on what's
really important so before we dive in I
want to talk a little bit about the
history of app development for a really
long time the dominant way to build
software was based on request and
response I had a client that could be a
desktop app a mobile app of web browser
and that made requests to a server and
then the server sent some kind of
response back and that was how I built a
connected application now of course it
wasn't actually quite that simple
because in reality the server needed to
get its data from somewhere else
so in reality I had a client that sent
across request to the server a server
that sent a request to the database the
database responded to the server the
server responded to the clients and
that's how I built my application and of
course if I have many clients I'm making
many many requests and every time I want
to see has something changed is there
new data that I need to be aware of
that's a new request so this model
worked but it only works because we did
a lot of work to make it happen the
firebase real time database took a new
approach rather than having a client
talk to the server the server talk to
the database the client talks directly
to the database writing data and
listening to changes the database then
updates every connected client when that
change happens instantly instead of
making a request and getting a response
now developers could set up handlers and
just listen for the events they're
interested in events provide built in
meaning rather than having to create my
own representation of well okay a new
record was added to this list so you
probably want to update it somewhere
instead I can just listen to the
real-time database for a child added
event so this let me do more with less
code and I don't have to run my own
servers so that's why the firebase
real-time database is so great
and at this point you may be wondering
wait isn't this supposed to be a cloud
function stock so the real-time database
is great at synchronizing data between
clients that connect to it but what
happens if I want to synchronize data
from another source that's outside the
database what happens if I want events
in the database to trigger side effects
like sending an email or push
notification something that happens
outside of the database world well to
make this work I'm right back to running
servers so I run a server that listens
to the real-time database and
communicates with external api's then
writes back to the real-time database
which then syncs with all the connected
clients this is still easier to manage
than the old model because you kind of
have the real-time database in the
center but I have to do all the work of
setting up the infrastructure to bridge
the gap between my server the third
party API firebase and the client
application and this is where we get to
cloud functions cloud functions for
firebase bring the event model that
worked so well for the real time
database to your entire application
cloud functions are the computational
glue that bind your app firebase and the
rest of the development world together
thanks Michael so what our cloud
functions and how do they work with
firebase the no conference is complete
without a few buzzwords so let's get
them out of the way cloud functions is
Google's new service environment see
there's no servers okay so obviously
there's actually server somewhere so
what do we mean we talk about server
list well cloud functions are back in
code but they typically take the form of
lots of back end pieces
well sometimes hear the term
microservices because the program model
breaks your back-end into individually
managed components but in the old world
you had to set up a set of machines to
run a back-end so this idea of micro
services many backends sounds really
intimidating but it's not with cloud
functions because your code is you're in
structure as we'll see later the
firebase command-line tool can look at
your code and create all of these micro
services and manage them for you now
because you've broken up your back-end
into these small pieces Google can do
some great heavy lifting for you
automatically a cloud function will be
able to scale up automatically under
increased load when that load dies down
cloud functions will scale down those
instances all the way to zero which
means you pay no bill just for being
available with cloud functions you only
pay for the time that your cloud
function is actually handling a request
not just for the time you want to be
available to handle a request now
because the Internet speaks HTTP HTTPS
we've designed cloud functions to let
you build very powerful HTTP endpoints
or if you like the event model that
Michael talked about you can directly
handle events in firebase and Google
cloud platform with your cloud functions
so this is the simplest cloud function
that we have with just a few lines of
code we've written a fully functional
auto-scaling web back-end let's break it
down and first we'll check out this
export hello world cloud functions are
written in JavaScript for the node.js
environments in nodejs
every file is called a module and
everything inside a module is private
unless it's publicly exported by
attaching it to the global exports
object well export a cloud functions
that Google can find and run it and the
firebase command-line tool we'll name
our cloud function hello world just like
it is in the code to define our cloud
functions will use the firebase
functions SDK this is an open source sdk
we've written to help make it easier to
build a cloud function here we say that
we're creating a cloud function that
should be accessible over HTTP cloud
functions are built on Express jf a very
popular node web serving framework
and in our product we let you have
access to the raw request and response
objects this will let you build very
powerful and freeform backends very
easily since our demo is trivial we'll
just send a static response back every
time now back to that code is
infrastructure idea to deploy our cloud
functions all we need to do is run the
command firebase deploy with the
firebase command line tools the command
line tool will notice that we have
functions in our projects will load our
code analyze what's been exported notice
this hello world function compare it to
production and create update or delete
functions to match production with your
code now here's a more complicated
example let's say we have a message
board we're going to add a feature to
our message boards that whenever a user
creates or modifies a message we update
the messages timestamp on the server so
the functions SDK has a common pattern
first we pick the service that we want
to integrate with here's the firebase
real-time database next we pick which
objects we want to observe now we've
given a pattern for the references
inside the database that we want to
observe and finally we pick the events
we want to observe here we've said we
want to observe all right events to any
reference that matches this matches this
pattern in the firebase real-time
database our function will be called
when an event object which is very
powerful event data is just like a delta
snapshot or it sorry a data snapshot in
the firebase SDK but with some features
that are exclusive to cloud functions
for example event data ref would have
given you a reference to the database
that acts as the original user but here
we've lost down that timestamp field so
we use admin ref to make write to the
database that are normally prohibited by
end-users
so we'll update the database and return
the operation back to cloud functions so
it knows to stay alive while there's
work happening in the background so
we've shown you two quick demos that
integrate with HTTP end points or the
firebase real time database but we
support so much more you can have a
cloud function run to handle every
message in a topic for Google cloud
pub/sub or you can have a function run
on every creation or deletion of a user
and firebase off you can integrate with
cloud storage for firebase or even have
custom code run in response to a
conversion event in Google Analytics for
firebase in case you haven't caught the
news yesterday cloud functions now
integrates directly with firebase
hosting and we're always at work to
bring you more providers of events so
you can use cloud functions to connect
to firebase features for example you can
send a push notification in response to
any change in the firebase real time
database or you can integrate firebase
with third party API what if instead you
wanted to send an email you can just
sign up for an email provider and call
their API inside your cloud function and
you can do some really cool stuff when
you flip this around if you connect an
API to firebase imagine if you're
building a product and you maintain your
documentation as markdown in github you
can have a cloud function that listens
to a github push then use that cloud
function to compile the markdown and
then deploy it to your product page with
firebase hosting
so today we're going to show off some
cloud function demos I want you to think
about how you can use cloud functions to
build your products to automate your
workflow and to grow your business so we
wanted to think about cloud functions as
if we were developers you know building
a start-up from scratch so Thomas and I
decided that we're going to have a fire
sale app fire sale is a simple concept
it's an online store that sells one
thing per day who needs shopping carts
or category pages we're just going to
sell one thing and you either buy it or
you don't
so rather than explain more I'm just
going to jump right in can we switch
over to the left up so this is fire sale
and as you can see today's deal is the
Google known now the Google Nome is
pretty cool it sits outside you might
have heard this announced in early April
of this year
it sits outside it can tell you the
weather it has this cool red hat so I
come to the page and I'm immediately
interested you know I got to have this
thing so I'm actually on Thomas's
computer here so I'm going to sign in
and that's using firebase off to sign in
using Google authentication and I scroll
down to the bottom here and oh no
there's only 40 of these left I need to
act now so let's say I'll just click the
Cart button and it pulls up a form since
I'm already a user I've got the address
filled in but I need to fill in my
credit card so I will enter a totally
real and legitimate credit card number
and let's buy it so it took a couple
seconds and now I've placed my order and
you can see it says that we're
processing your payment and in the
background what we're doing is we have
sent this to the payment processor who
is now processing it out and you can see
it's updated and the payment has been
received so in just a couple seconds I
bought a product on fire sale but of
course I haven't told you anything about
how I built this can we switch back to
the slides
so what went into making fire sale first
as is everything we tried to focus on
the user we thought about the ideal
experience that we wanted fire sale to
have and then work backwards to figure
out how we needed to build the app for
this app the most important thing was to
remove friction everywhere we could if I
come to fire sale there should be as
little time as possible between seeing
the deal for today deciding I absolutely
have to have it and making that purchase
every moment of friction every roadblock
between me and that purchase is a chance
that I might decide hey you know maybe I
don't actually need a smart gnome to sit
outside my house so we don't want that
so we designed our app experience around
being fast focus and free of
distractions that led us to a few dishes
decisions right away first we built fire
sale as a progressive web app web apps
are the fastest way to get someone's
eyeballs on the content you want them to
see there's no install no booting up and
no friction plus your app is instantly
shareable via a link for e-commerce
sites like fire sale in particular web
apps are a great choice and a natural
one second we realized that with the
simplicity of our store this is actually
a great fit for the Google assistant
what if someone could shop fire sale
just by speaking to the Google assistant
Thomas will tell you more about that in
just a little bit most importantly
because we're a start-up or more
accurately because we're too Google
engineers who have deadlines on a talk
and we're pretending to be a start-up we
wanted to offload as much work as
possible so we wanted to use firebase
and third-party ap is everywhere we
could so that we are doing as little
work as possible so let's talk a little
bit about building your app with
firebase and cloud functions when
building an applicants one thing I would
encourage you to do is think small don't
worry about the thousand foot view and
how every piece fits with every other
piece all the time firebase gives you a
hub for your application with products
like the real time
database at any given time you should
just be figuring out how to connect a
single new thing whether that's a new
type of user interface a third party
integration or whatever else to that hub
you don't need to be thinking about oh I
have this massive application and it
does all of these things cloud functions
lets you break those apart into smaller
problems that you can solve one at a
time so the first thing that we needed
when we were building this app is the
deal page that you see when you first
comes fire-sale so we needed that first
load experience to be as fast as
possible so I built a cloud function to
render the pages HTML and connected it
to firebase hosting using the brand-new
integrations that we launched yesterday
now I'm not going to get into all the
details of how I built that here but
David East will be doing a deep dive
into performant Web Apps on firebase
hosting on this stage at 5:30 and if
you're interested I'd really encourage
you to check that out so now I've
painted my deal page everyone can see
the deal read about it find out what it
is but of course they also need to be
able to buy it so now we needed
interactivity but here I had a little
bit more breathing room no one is going
to come to the page and within half a
second decides they need to click to buy
they're going to read things for a few
seconds and decide hey do I want this or
not so for the interactive parts of the
app I use the firebase web SDKs I use
firebase off as you saw to assign the
user in using Google credentials so that
I can remember who they are and I use
the real time database to synchronize
the order status so that as it updated
it would instantly come to the web app
now one of the most important pieces of
this flow was the sorry one of the most
important pieces of this flow was
placing the order itself now Thomas and
I tend to agree on those things so it
was a little bit surprising when we
started arguing a bit about how this
should be implemented I wanted to write
new orders directly into the real time
database but Thomas thought it might be
a better idea to use the HTTP API with
cloud functions to build it as a JSON
REST API after we discussed it for a
little while we realized that there are
good situations for each and
we thought that it was worth sharing
with the real-time database you're
writing directly to your permanent data
store you don't have to worry about
translating requests or responses from a
certain format you are just deciding
what your data model is and then you're
writing that into the database
additionally firebases security rules
can be used to manage authorization and
access control at the data level so you
don't need complex authorization systems
that you build yourself instead you can
just rely on fire based rules to take
care of that for you and all of this is
accessible directly from the client
finally the real time database SDK has
some great features for reliability so
your data will be synced even if you
have a spotty network connection while
you're using it now HTTP functions have
their own advantages as well for one
there is no data buildup there's no
stored request when you make a request
to an HTTP function so for ephemeral
requests or things that aren't going to
permanently alter your data models you
might prefer an HTTP function because
then you don't have to first write for
the database and then later clean that
up once you finish the task in addition
with HTTP functions you have full
control over the API the firebase
real-time database speaks in JSON
objects but with an HTTP function you
can speak in whatever language you want
whether that's JSON or XML or HTML or
even if you just want to actually
generate an image on the fly and send
that back as the response any of that is
possible with an HTTP function
finally HTTP functions can be connected
to firebase hosting and expensive or
high traffic operations can be cached in
firebase hosting as global CDN to reduce
load executions and burdens on your
cloud functions so after we talk through
all that we decided that since we are
creating a new order in our system and
that's permanently affecting the data
model that we were going to go with a
database trigger for this so I built the
cloud function that listen for new
orders that were created in the real
time database and as soon as that
happened it would instantly send out to
the payment processor and say hey we
have a new order the user needs to pay
for it here's all the
that you need then the payment processor
would process that and send the data
back to us that says okay the orders
paid and that's what you saw in the
demonstration right there so that's the
web app interface for fire sale but
while I was busy building that Thomas
was doing some really interesting work
of his own
Thomas thanks Michael so Google
assistant is a great way to build an
immersive experience that follows your
users around and it's a great match for
fire sale sorry fire sale because we
targeted users who like cool gadgets now
if you've never programmed for the
Google assistant before it has a unique
feel because your code doesn't actually
run on the customers device first you
register a series of actions that your
agent supports with the Google
assistants the Google assistant will
invoke these actions on behalf of the
user either if the user directly asked
to speak to your agent or if the Google
assistant thinks that your action can
fulfill the user's more generic requests
now this means that every agent needs a
back-end that the Google assistant can
call and of course we're talking about
it today because that back-end can be a
cloud function so the Google assistant
is a very rich topic we're not going to
go into the SDK and a lot of detail if
you want to get started building
assistant apps in nodejs check out the
actions on Google SDK this e sdk lets
you program in an intent based model
that might feel familiar to enter
developers and it will expose an HTTP
endpoint that you can then use or that
you can then host with a cloud function
if you're building an assistant app from
scratch you might make one monolithic
cloud function that serves your whole
app but this could lead to a more rigid
system than you actually want so here's
what happened when I first started
hacking on the project I like to create
a class so I can test each method
separately and then I decided to create
the handler for the main intent
well okay I want to get today's daily
deal so first I'm going to get the
string ID for today's deal uh some you
know time zone fiddling and things like
that then I'm going to fetch it from the
database and my actual model has a
normalization and this is all some
really awkward boilerplate before I get
to the fun stuff so I started writing
this I stuff happens I seen this whole
boilerplate before didn't Michael just
give a demo about how he wrote this for
the web app it felt like I was
reinventing the wheel so I decided to
look at the whole app together with an
eye for how I could refactor and reuse
some of this code so this is my second
pass oh sorry the web function has a web
app has to function we should look out
the first is exports dot web this is an
HTV HTTP function that integrates with
firebase hosting this is a full website
HTML so I can't use that to serve my
assistant API but I could probably reuse
some the code inside of it so after
refactoring here is my second attempt I
refactored that deal code into its own
interface for handling the deal model
then I construct my bot class with an
instance of that model now it's only one
line to get this and that line is shared
in both my code and Michael's code in my
index J F I'll create a concrete
instance of this model access ER I'll
pass it to my nice testable controllers
and then I'll bind them to different
cloud functions if you want to see why I
write my cloud code this way you can
check out cloud functions testability
and open source tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. on
this stage so we can think of cloud
functions as either exposing a front-end
or enforcing consistency in the backend
with our new design both our assistants
and web interface
are a cloud function that the ports or
build a front-end we keep these small
and use code reuse wherever is possible
now because we know we're using the same
model exports that an order can be
shared with a zero side effects because
this function is in the second category
they will automatically respond to the
event that we created an order and then
make sure a side-effect happens so let's
see it now action and switch to the demo
screen so I am going to ask fire sale
for today's deal
sure here is the test version of fire
sale today we have a sale on Google done
that's cool
I know more about this tell me more
Google Nome is like having a tiny little
meteorologist at your beck and call
how much does it cost the Google gnome
costs $130 Oh ma'am how many are left
there are 37 google gnomes left okay
well it's a good thing Michel is using
my account and I already have one on
order so now all we need to do is switch
back to Michael so he can build an admin
panel and actually fulfill that order we
switch back to slides
okay so now we have built up the
interfaces that our users are going to
be using when they interact with fire
sale but we also need to handle the back
office of our store so we needed to
build an admin panel wait I'm sorry this
looks like it's the wrong slide we
needed to build an admin panel don't get
me wrong building tools for your team to
use is very important but if I'm
spending all of my time fiddling with an
admin panel that only myself and Thomas
are going to use I'm not really focusing
on the user so I got to thinking what if
I just didn't build an admin panel as it
turned out our payment processor had
already built a pretty sophisticated
product and order management interface
of its own so instead of building an
admin interface I built three webhook
functions using cloud functions that
sync data from the payment processor
back to the real time database I built
one that would think anytime a product
in our payment processor change another
that would sync every time an order
change and a third that would think
every time the daily deal then which
days had which feels changed in the
profit in the payment processor and so I
got to have my admin interface without
having to build it which I was really
happy about because I just saved a lot
of work so let's take a look at how that
look works can we switch over to the
demo so here you can see I still have
the web up web app up on this side with
the order I just placed and on this side
I have my stripe interface for my
payment processor which has the products
that I'm offering
so today's deal was the Google gnome I'm
going to click through to that so you
can see that all of the data that was
populating the initial page when I
loaded it all of that stuff is right
here and if I made changes here that
would automatically make changes that
updated the page when it was rendered
but what I'm talking about today is
order fulfillment so since Thomas and I
are just pretending to have a start up
we have a bunch of pretend Ubel gnomes
just laying around the office and we're
going to manual
managed fulfillment because we haven't
figured out a process to have a third
party do that or anything yet so you can
see that I have a new order here that is
paid and I'm going to click through to
that so this is the order that I just
placed a little bit earlier and so now
from stripe I'm going to say well you
know what I've actually shipped this out
so I've used the Postal Service and a
fake tracking number here that looks
pretty good so I'm going to click update
here set whirl in the password right now
there we go
so I fulfilled the order but what
happens now well stripe luckily
integrates really well with web hooks
and so any second now
all right the demo gods are not
necessarily on my side right now let me
take look at this may be a fulfilled the
wrong order I'm not sure let's try this
one as well just for be sure
tell you what sometimes the demo gods
are just not on your side so anyway what
happened every other time I ever tried
this is that the web app on the left
immediately updated with the order
tracking information for my order and
everything happened without me having to
make any changes in the application side
or with my application code all right
I'll give I'll try the third one maybe I
I think when we were prepping our demo
we forgot the cleanouts
the data from our last version so okay
that might be the thing let's try the
third one here we go oh good nevermind
all right I gave up too early thank you
whoever shouted out you know to keep me
going all right so that's fire sale back
to you Thomas
Wow it's a good thing it worked because
I gave him cool guy stays in the what
the next slide we switch the slide okay
so so Michael found some great shortcuts
that do actually work when building the
atom admin panel so this leaves me with
the ops work ah so people know the ops
personnel tend to handle emergencies at
night they're less often known for
handling all the chores during the day
the talk I mentioned earlier will cover
some of the monitoring and alerting
tools you can use a cloud function up
but like Michael I'm going to use cloud
functions to handle some automation so I
can get out of my chores too Michael
decided that we should make sure that
production reflected master as soon as
possible
and I said okay I can take care of that
with a cloud function after I made that
that assertion I started to worry
because yes github has Web books but a
web hook should be responsive and this
might not be a good fit because a github
webhook will have metadata about the
commits you know I'm going to need to
actually download that tarball I'm going
to need to untie it I'm going to need to
download all my dependencies we don't
check those in we write our our
functions and type scripts
compiled that code and then do a final
deploy it probably wouldn't be a good
idea to do that in just a standard HTTP
request but then I had an idea I don't
actually have to do that instead I want
to have a way where I can have a quick
end point that would respond to github
before any timeouts which would then
kick off and I think in this process
that could do all that heavy lifting in
the background so to do this I split my
cloud function into two pieces and
connected them with Google cloud pub/sub
my first cloud function would receive
push notifications from github
it would then compare the information
about that git push to decide whether or
not the commit matched the filters for
which branches should be deployed to
which projects if it matched the filter
they would then in queue a deployed job
over pub/sub the next function could
then wake up in the background and run
with a much larger timeout or much
larger memory requirements in fact I now
had so much extra time that for some
extra pizazz I added a new API call to
announce the start and stop of every
deploy inside of our chat room so and
that's not all I can automate more of my
workflow I can create web hooks that
will check whether I remembered to do my
chores and then hook them up to a cron
type service so that I will have a
safety net that periodically checks a
might for example remind me that it's 8
p.m. and I haven't chewed up tomorrow's
daily deal now with this my
opportunities are automated and I can
pretend to be the cool guy to
so at this point our app is in pretty
good shape
we have a working app on two platforms
we can manage inventory and fulfillment
and our development process is stable
and automated what's less to do well we
could connect user signups to a business
intelligence API like clear bid this
would let us turn our users email
addresses into rich data about the user
the company they work for their social
media accounts so once we do that what
happens if the customer reaches out to
customer support now we have all kinds
of data about the user that we can use
to help them out faster or maybe I want
to take all of the orders that are
created within fire-sale and put those
into bigquery Google cloud platforms big
data analysis tools this would let us do
rich querying over our order history to
find purchase patterns or other things
or we could build great sales dashboards
with data studio or maybe instead we'd
rather focus on re-engaging users when
new deals come out so we could build a
scheduler that will call a webhook every
time a new deal comes out and when that
happens trigger push notifications or
emails every time a new deal goes live
of course these are all just examples
that I came up with off the top of my
head but the really powerful thing about
cloud functions is that you can hook
just about anything up to just about
anything else and of course this doesn't
just work for fire sale but for any app
you're building or even apps that you've
already built so I would really
encourage you to dive into cloud
functions think small think about the
little pieces that you could fit
together with cloud functions to
accomplish something big we're really
excited to see what you build that's all
we've got for you today if you want to
learn more about cloud functions there
are some awesome sessions coming up I've
listed a few of them on the screen here
also if you want to talk to either of us
we're both going to be heading over to
the firebase sandbox area right now feel
free to hit us up with all of your
questions about cloud functions firebase
life in general I don't know anyway
