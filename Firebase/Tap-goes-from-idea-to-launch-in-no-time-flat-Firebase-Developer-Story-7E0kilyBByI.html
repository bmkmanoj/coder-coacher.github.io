storytelling experience called tap which
is all about stories told through text
messages through chats the tap team
started very small didn't have a lot of
resources to test out a lot of libraries
to help us grow very quickly fibers gave
us the ability to take what we would
have done in many different places and
integrate from many different services
all in one place in one convenient
package and it allowed us to integrate
that package and just get going with our
development almost immediately the
real-time database allows us to have
cumulus storage which means we can ever
change the schema whenever you want we
wanted to have the tab counters
increment on the stories as the users
were browsing tourism so you could kind
of get a sense in real time what people
were doing and what they were reading
and with firebase this is a trivial
thing to implement you to basically just
add a watcher onto the count nodes and
it comes back to you in real time since
our app is supporting both Android and
iOS platforms cloud functions come in
really handy when the user mix and
publishes a story the cloud function
gets triggered and we send a
notification to all the friends of the
user so that they know that they've made
a story and published it there are times
where we don't know whether or not to
build a feature to roll out a feature
and so we would use remote config and
test it out with a smaller group of
users first and then we would look at
the analytics dashboard and when we see
that you know the feature is actually
performing really well we would deploy
it at a larger scale remote config
really made it fast and easy for us to
make these really really important
product decisions we've reduced our
typical app deployment schedule by more
than half that allowed us to go from
effectively zero to a working product in
production and that time spent was was
just phenomenally fast for us
the app has been really really
well-received in both Google Play and
the iOS App Store we've had over 1
billion taps in tap so far through tap
stories we've had in the first weekend
that we launched our story writer 25,000
people wrote stories firebase gives us
the ability to focus on what we know
best
that's storytelling and that's giving
our users the ability to immerse
themselves to interact and to
participate with stories in ways that
were not available before
