episode of fire our cast I'm going to
show you how react and firebase work
really well together and just as a
reminder this is one episode an entire
series on firebase on the web so if you
want to stay up to date make sure you
subscribe but today we're going to talk
about how react in firebase work super
well together so with react it does
state management really well it's just
simple you call one method and it rear
Enders your entire application and with
firebase it does real-time data
synchronization really well you
subscribe to an event and then it gives
you the new set of data and as you might
be thinking hey those two might work
really well together and they do so
let's see how that works
react is really good at managing state
in your applications and it does this
with just two methods that are linked
together the first is set state and with
set state you provided your new state
and then it goes andrey renders your
application with the render method so
every time you call set state it's going
to call render which we renders your
application with your new state and this
works really really well with the
real-time database so right here we are
creating a reference out to this data
location and all we're doing is creating
a real time listener so every single
time of value updates at the data
location we're going to call the set
state method and this will rerender our
application so what this means is we can
manage all of our state synchronization
in just one place in our application so
to demonstrate this I'm going to go
build a sample app so this is an
application I created using the create
react app command line tool and if you
want to see how you can get started with
that and firebase check out our video
right here that will get you up and
running so to set State the first thing
you have to do is create a constructor
and in
sigh the constructor we are going to
initialize the state property so this
that state and we're going to set it to
an empty object and so whatever is
contained inside of this object is the
state for our components so in this case
I'm going to create an app that tracks
speed the speed of what well it doesn't
really matter but we're going to be
tracking speed which is a number so
we'll give it a property of speed and
say the speed is 10 now I'm going to
just display the speed in my template so
this dot state dot speed now I'm going
to load up this app to the left and you
can see right here we have 10 which is
our speed so now I want to go and change
the state of my app and to do that I'm
going to use a method called component
did mouths so component did mount is a
lifecycle method of the component and
it's called only once and that's right
after it's been rendered to the Dom so
inside of this method I'm going to
change the state so I'm going to say
this that's set State and I'm going to
pass in a new state for the speed so
I'll provide speed and set it to 25 so
what's going on at this point is is that
the constructor is initialized and it's
going to have the speed of 10 and then
what's going to happen is it's going to
render this to the Dom with the speed of
10 but then after the initial rendering
to the Dom it's going to call component
in mount which will update us to 25 so I
want to refresh the page we see 25
because it happened so fast that we
didn't see 10 components in mount is a
great place for the real-time database
if we set up our listeners and
components in mount it allows us to set
an initial set of data and then a secret
ously download our data from the real
time database and then render it out to
the Dom so I'm going to go and copy this
right now and then
going to create a route reference to my
real-time database so firebase database
ref child of react so I'm treating the
child of react as my route database so
this isn't really the root of my
database but for the sake of this demo
I'm going to pretend that it is and now
I'm going to create a reference out to
the speed so route ref child of speed
and so since I have the speed reference
I can go and create my realtime listener
so I'm going to say speed ref on value
return a callback function that returns
me a snapshot so for those of you who
might not know or have forgotten the on
method is what allows us to synchronize
data in real time and we always attach
it onto a reference that points at a
spot in our database so essentially what
we're saying right here is every time
data changes at the location of speed
provide this callback function that
returns to us the new set of data so
inside of this real time listener is
where we can actually call set State so
I'm going to paste that back in and so
instead of calling speed with 25 I'm
going to call it with snapshot dot value
so what's happening here is every single
time the data is updated at the location
of speed will get this update in the
callback function and we can take that
data and call set state which will go
and rerender our app so let's see it in
action I'm going to refresh the page we
see 10 then we see nothing and why is
that let's go check out our database and
what you can see right here is that
underneath the node of react
we have nothing so essentially there is
no location of speed so what's going to
render out null so let's go and create a
record to change that so I'll create the
child of speed give it a value of 16 and
then if we go back to our app you can
see that we have 16 rendered to the page
and just to prove to you that it updates
in real time I'm going to change 16 to
20
and 20 to 100 and it updates in real
time in both tabs
so to recap react is really good at
managing state and it does that through
two methods set States and render and
set state is where we can provide react
with our newly updated state and when we
call set state with this new state it
calls the render method which can take
this state and then template it out to
our application and this is a really
good fit for the real-time database
because the real-time database is great
at synchronizing data across different
devices so we can create a reference out
to a specific location and then a
real-time listener and every single time
we get a new set of data from the
real-time database we call this dot set
state with that new data which we know
will call the render method and that's
why I react in the real-time database
fit really well together so as you can
see now react has great state management
in firebase database has really great
real time data synchronization and
together it makes building apps really
easy so that's all for this time but
before I go I have a question for you
are you out there building reactant for
our base apps and if so what are you
building so that's it and I will see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
