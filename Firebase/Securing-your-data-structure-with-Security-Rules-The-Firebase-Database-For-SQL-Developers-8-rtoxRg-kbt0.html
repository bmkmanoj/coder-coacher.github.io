I don't know let's make this one count
everyone welcome to the eighth lesson in
the firebase database for sequel
developer series and today we're going
to learn all about protecting your data
structure with security rules so let's
dive right down into the laptop and
begin to insert data into a sequel
database you first need to create a
table and this table must have a schema
in a schema is made up of a column and
then a series of constraints so this
column of ID has a not no constraint and
we're also constraining the data type to
be an integer so we can also specify
other columns and they can also have
constraints and we must provide a
primary key constraint which is the
unique identifier for every record in
this table the firebase database doesn't
have tables and it doesn't have schemas
instead of tables with rows and columns
it has JSON with keys and values so at
the root we can create a key of users
and then below we can create child keys
that have values for our users so we can
insert whatever we want so that means
for this user we can create properties
of name bio and profile image and then
we can insert another user that has name
bio profile image and favorite color and
you also notice that profile image in
this case is actually a number and
there's nothing that stops us from doing
this and also there's nothing that stops
someone from just deleting your data
unless you specify security rules so
there's three things to learn when
you're starting with security rules and
the first is paths and rules security
rules are written in a JSON file and
this is totally separate from the
database and every security rules file
starts with a rules key and then below
there we can map our rules to our data
structure in the database so since we
have a path of users in the database
we'll create a path of users in our
security rules and then once we have our
paths we can specify our rules and there
are three rules you can use there's read
which determines who can read the data
at this path there's write which
determines who can write data to this
path and lastly validate which
determines what the data structure is at
this path and all these rules must
evaluate out to an expression so it's
either true or false if it's true the
write to the database or the read will
be accepted but if it's false it will be
rejected so right now this is not really
a useful rule we're essentially saying
that anyone can read or write data users
and we can use any data structure that
we like and also with not very useful is
is that we're not actually writing rules
for any child users we're writing a rule
for specifically the users key so we
want to be able to dynamically apply
these rules to any child users and to do
that we can use wildcards so right now
we're only applying this rule to the
users key but if we specify a wild-card
which starts with a dollar sign we're
essentially creating a variable and
we're saying that this rule applies to
any children underneath the users key
and we can specify what the key is with
the dollar wildcard in this case we're
calling it dollar UID but since it's a
variable you can really call it whatever
you want and dollar UID will hold the
child key value that we're trying to
access so if you're trying to access
slash user slash one dollar UID we'll
represent one but if you try to access
slash user slash two dollar UID will
hold the value of two we can see how
this actually looks like in code so if
we create a root reference to the
database and then nest down to users and
then we can create a variable of UID and
then from this variable we can create a
reference to a specific user and this is
exactly what the dollar UID wildcard is
doing in our security rules so now that
we have the ability to write this rule
for any child we actually won
to do something useful rather than just
say true for all of our rules you should
write a useful expression we need to use
server variables there are six server
variables that the firebase database
provides you with there's auth which is
the currently authenticated user there
is data which is the data that exists at
that path there is new data which is the
newly posted data at that path and this
is only available in dot write and dot
validate because those are the only
times where you'll actually have new
data being posted there's now which is a
server timestamp of the current time on
the server and route which will bring
you to the root of your database and
also the dollar wildcards which we
created with dollar UID so now that we
have access to these server variables we
can write useful rules for dot read and
dot write we can create rules that say
only users can access their own data by
saying auth dot u ID is equal to the
dollar UID wildcard we're essentially
saying that if the currently
authenticated users you ID is equal to
the UID that we're trying to access that
person can read or write data
so if slash users slash one and the
currently authenticated user has the ID
of one we can allow that read or write
but if the currently authenticated user
is two and we're trying to access slash
users slash one that will fail because
you know one is not equal to two and
with validate we're looking at the newly
posted data and we're just checking to
see that exists that no one is posting
null but we actually can use other
methods to check the data by calling dot
child on new data we can pass in a
string and see if a child property
exists and we can even check its
datatype by calling the a string method
and there's also other methods for other
data types and since this is just an
expression we can actually tack on other
conditions so in this case we can check
for the bio and see if it's a string and
then we can even check the bio string
length and make sure that it's less than
500 and then also check the profile
image and ensure that it's a string
previously when we try to add the
user of Alice we were able to even
though profile image was a number but
now with these security rules applied
this would fail so if we went and
changed the profile image from a number
to a string it would pass another thing
that you can do with security rules is
you can create foreign key like
constructs
so in our database we have our list of
users and we can have a property called
location and this is where the user
lives so David lives in SF and we can
also provide a lookup which contains all
the valid locations that we support in
the database and if we want to make sure
that we are only adding valid locations
we can write a validate rule that takes
us to the roots then goes to the child
of locations so now we have access to
all of the locations that exist in the
database and then from there we can go
into the newly posted data set and call
that child of location to get back the
new location that's attempting to be
added to the database we can get its
value and then after that we can call
exists and what this will do is it will
make sure that the newly added location
exists in the database and if it does it
the right will be rejected so securing
and protecting your data structure is
really important so you probably want to
be able to test out that what you're
doing is actually working and to do that
you can use the simulator so right here
we have a firebase database opened up in
the firebase console you can see that
we're using similar data structures that
we've created in this series we have our
user's data structure and you can see
that we're storing a user that named
Margaret that lives in San Francisco and
then we also have a locations lookup for
all the valid locations we can accept so
now if we tap over to the rules tab we
can write some security rules you can
see to the left that we have this
simulator panel and if this isn't
already opened up you can just click the
button and it slides right in and then
now we want to write a rule for our
users so let's delete read true write
true because that's basically saying do
whatever you want with my database and
that is not very safe so we'll start out
by writing a rule for our users path
and we have to make sure to use the
dollar UID wild card because that way
these are rules for any child underneath
users and we'll set our read rules and
our write rules I'm going to set read to
true because I want the users profile
data to be public information but I only
want users to be able to write their own
information so to do that I'll say auth
dot UID
so the currently authenticated users you
ID is equal to the wild card so dollar
UID and now I can actually go and
simulate this so I'll go and simulate a
read so I'll make sure that slash users
and then this is slash the key for
Margaret and we can even simulate
authentication for now I'm going to turn
this off and then I'm going to run and
you can see that a read was allowed
because reads are public and now if I
try to do a write and run the right was
denied because you have to be
authenticated to read your own data so
now if I turn on authentication and I
use the same key that I'm trying to
access and I run you can see that the
rule was allowed because the user is
allowed to modify their own data so now
let's write a rule to establish the
foreign key light construct all right a
rule for a dot validates and we'll start
to go to the root of our database and we
will read the existing locations by
calling dot child of locations so now I
want to make sure that the newly added
location for the user exists in the
database so to do that I'll call dot
child and then from here I'll say new
data dot child of location because this
is the newly posted location data and
then I'll get its value and then lastly
at the end I'll call dot exists so this
record currently exists in our lookup
and so right here I'm saying location of
LA which does not exist
and then when I
run you can see that the simulate right
was denied even though we were
authenticated because we are making sure
that only the existing locations exists
in our database but if I move it to an
existing location of SF and hit run
they both are allowed security rules are
how you secure your data against
unauthorized users and protect your data
structure and since security roles can
read data from the database you can do
really powerful things like establish
foreign key like constructs so this is
