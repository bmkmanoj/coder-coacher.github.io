things now that firebase 2015 one fish
market hey everyone welcome to another
episode of hash tag ask firebase the
show where we answer your firebase
related questions I'm Jenn person
training specialist here at Google I'm
going to be answering your questions
about cloud functions for firebase let's
get started our first question comes
from a salon on stackoverflow I'm
looking for a way to schedule five
functions for firebase to occur in a
specific time that's a great question we
actually have a couple of options for
that check out our examples on a github
we have a sample that shows how to use
third-party scheduling tools to set up
your functions to trigger at a specific
time the second option that you have is
to set up an app engine instance if
you'd like to know more about that Abe
Haskins has already created a blog post
about it and you can check out both of
those in a links below thanks for your
question moving on to the next question
our next question comes from shiz on
Twitter and she would like to know can I
use this is a long question can I use
Google speech and vision api's from
cloud functions for firebase when a file
is uploaded to my storage bucket if
you'd like to see an example of this you
can check out our github samples which
has one on moderating images using
google cloud vision API to look at an
image determine if it is violent or
inappropriate content and then blur it
out using image magic if you'd like to
see that sample of course check out the
links below I said thanks for the
question at the beginning thank you for
your question
and moving on to the next question
our next question comes from Paris on
Twitter and pirate says hi that Jen
person I wanted to know how to use cloud
functions using angularfire 2 now cloud
functions runs on the backend using
nodejs and not in the client so whether
you have an Android app or an iOS app or
a web app all of the code is going to be
the same to get started on cloud
functions for firebase on any platform
check out my fire cast video and you can
follow along there links are in the
description below great question
let's go next question this next
question comes up a lot a lot of you
have been wondering in class functions
database triggers what's the difference
between events data RS and event data
admin graph event dot ref works with the
same permissions as the user who trigger
the change so whatever that user has
access to ref has access to event data
that admin ref has full unrestricted
access to anything in the database now
as you can imagine there are certain
reasons to use either of these I'm going
to have to look at the specific needs of
your app to determine which works best
for you if you use the admin SDK it's
the same thing as using admin rest great
question everyone move it on to the next
question this next question comes to us
from tackle on YouTube cloud functions
is really cool feature for firebase what
languages are planned to be supported in
later updates now we will be supporting
more languages in the future but it's
too soon to tell what those will be
but we would love to know what you think
go ahead and share your input in the
comments below thanks for your question
scram alright that's all the questions
we have today on this episode of hash
tags ask firebase if you have some
firebase questions you would like to see
answered go ahead and post them on Stack
Overflow or Twitter or right here on
YouTube with the hashtag ask firebase be
sure to LIKE and subscribe to the
firebase Channel and we'll see you next
time
