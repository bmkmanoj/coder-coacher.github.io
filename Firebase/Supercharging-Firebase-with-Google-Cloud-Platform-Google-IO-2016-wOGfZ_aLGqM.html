is Sandeep it's always some deep and I'm
a developer advocate on the Google cloud
platform my name is Brett nagao i'm also
a developer advocate at Google for the
Google cloud platform and today we will
talk about supercharging firebase with
Google cloud platform so how many of you
guys have had a chance to play with
firebase either doing I oh maybe
previously okay a good number so you
guys know the firebase is an integrated
suite of products to help you develop
your app grow your user base and earn
money and as a developer my favorite
part of that is how quickly you can
build amazing applications without
writing a single line of server-side
code but when you do need some server
side code google cloud platform comes to
the rescue at Google Cloud is a full
suite of cloud tools from VMs big data
machine learning you name it and it
makes supercharging your app really easy
so today we're going to talk about how
firebase and Google cloud platform our
best friends how they can work together
to help you build amazing applications
in record time that's scale so you know
when we like started brainstorming what
we're going to do we said what are all
the crazy ideas we have I'm just like
started throwing them on the board we
said we're gonna build an app that does
all of these things exactly we're gonna
wait all of these things as all of these
things okay we don't have that much time
can we maybe pick like a handful let's
not get crazy okay let's not get too
crazy they don't want crazy they want
boring easy demo that works right well
let's pick a few things so we're gonna
build an app that does a few of these
crazy things uh you know Brett cop told
me down a little bit but what we wanted
to do was build a real-time
crowd-sourced live-streamed gaming
platform
that was a lot of buzz words a lot of us
weren't so what does that mean so what
that means is instead of a normal game
set up where each player has their own
character everyone is going to be
playing the same character at the same
time you might have seen twitch plays
Pokemon is popular a couple of years ago
I'll but here's how it works every
player who's logged in we've got someone
on tablet mobile desktop they're all
sending commands up down left right
right left and the character was
responding to every single one of them
sounds a little bit chaotic but a lot of
fun so of course the firebase real-time
database is perfect for this whenever
any client sends up data it's
automatically synchronized with all the
other clients this makes making
real-time crowd-sourced applications
very simple let's take a look so I built
a simple chat app and every time I send
a chat message with my phone you can see
the chat messages showing up in both
browsers you can also see the chats
coming in the firebase dashboard and
what is this data it's just JSON so of
course it makes it really easy to
integrate into any application are you
said JSON so let's talk a little bit
about code so how do you connect a
firebase when you create a firebase
project you're going to get three pieces
of information you're going to get an
API key database URL he's following
along and a project ID you'll use these
three things to connect to firebase and
you'll also use the API key and the
project ID to connect to Google cloud
platform so that makes it super easy so
you'll take this configuration you'll
pass it into firebase get a reference to
your database and then we're going to
get a reference to our chat node so
firebase is basically just a tree of
data so we've got a node called chat and
we're going to be inserting chat
messages under that node so each chat
message will be a child of the chat node
so how do we get the data into firebase
super easy firebase provides a method
called push and push will automatically
append your data to this list it'll
create a new child and we'll create a
unique ID for you this is really nice in
our multiplayer environment because you
don't have a lot of messages coming in
at the same time and you want to worry
about stepping on each other getting
conflicting IDs or creating some sort of
times
on your own firebase does that for you
so you passing whatever day do you want
in this case we're going to do a JSON
blob it's a name value pair named Brett
and then text hello google i/o so just
like that it instantly goes up in a
firebase so how do we listen to the
events as they come in so Firebrace
provides a few event listeners one of
which is called child added so if you're
listening to the chat node anytime a
message comes under that it's going to
be a child node you're going to get
notified almost instantaneously and so
you can do whatever you want in this
case we're just going to console
dialogue and write it out to the browser
so of course the real-time database with
firebase is what we all know and love
but firebase gives you a ton of features
as well from static hosting the cloud
test lab push notifications user auth
remote config and of course real-time
database but my favorite part about
firebase is you can pick and choose what
services you want you don't have to use
all of them so we're going to use static
hosting user auth and the real-time
database and we're going to use these
with the Google cloud platform so let's
look at our mop yes let's load our
mock-up um I think it's pretty clear
where developers not designers I mean I
think it's beautiful in the way that my
mother thinks I'm beautiful so we just
knock this out in HTML we've got a login
button and using firebase authentication
you click it and you can login using
Twitter github Facebook Google fire
based authentication makes it super easy
right below that we're going to actually
embed a YouTube live stream of the game
so you can see it as it's playing on
below that if you've ever played a video
game before you're familiar with the
concept of the d-pad up down left right
clicking on these buttons will send
those commands to firebase and of course
what would gain be without a little
trash talk so we're going to add a chat
box at the bottom you type your message
hopefully something nice and everyone
else will send it when you submit cool
so taking a look at our application
architecture right now it's pretty
simple we have all of our clients
directly talking to firebase no
server-side code this makes us do the
commands are all being pushed up to the
cloud as well as a chat messages but
simple is not crazy and you promised me
crazy maybe a little bit of crazy we we
need crazies it's not crazy enough for
us I mean that was fun it's fun okay
it's not crazy let's do
something crazy let's run the game in
one location right so normally in a
firebase world each client is connected
to firebase it's sending up data it's
receiving data but it's responsible for
rendering the game either on your
android device or iOS device or mobile
device your desktop web but the client
is responsible for getting the data and
rendering it and handling the game logic
we wanted to do something a little
different we're going to run the game in
one location so all the command commands
come it's rendered in one place and you
can see how everyone is collaborating
together it's important to note that
we're also not building a game like this
this session is not building a game
using firebase game is just what we
happen to choose because we thought it
would be fun and interesting and kind of
easy to follow along but you can imagine
the sort of collaborative environment
where people are sending in signals
constantly to do edit data whatever you
have would be applicable to a wide
variety of platforms and we're going to
run this in something called google
compute engine so Google compute engine
is our virtual machine offering and we
chose windows as our flavor of virtual
machine so Google compute engine is
pretty cool we have data centers around
the world where you can run your VMs and
you can have custom machine types this
means that you're not locked into 246
sorry 248 16 right powers of 2 you can
pick 14 CPU so you can pick 10 CPUs and
the same thing with memory we're also
very proud of our billing so we do sub
our building which means if you use 25
minutes of time you pay for 25 minutes
we don't round up to an hour we also
give you sustained use discount so
there's no reserved instances or things
like that it makes everything
complicated you use it you get a
discount which is nice but my favorite
part is just how consistently fast they
are you can spin up like a thousand
Linux VMs in like five minutes and
because of our isolation in our data
centers you don't have that noisy
neighbor problem that you have in a lot
of clouds so let's take a look at how
you would create a virtual machine on
Google compute engine so first you're
going to navigate to our UI you're going
to go to compute engine which has the
virtual machine functionality will click
create instance so this will bring up a
dialog with information we can fill out
about our vm for example name i'll name
mine my windows vm and then below that
we've got different geographic zones in
regions so we've got
and regions in Europe Asia and the
United States i'll choose the u.s. i
want to cpu seven and a half gigs of ram
and then I'll choose my operating system
so we've got a wide variety of operating
systems you can choose from in this case
I'll choose windows server 2012 data
center edition because why not now
thanks to the power of sped up video our
virtual machine is almost instantly
created it's not quite that fast in real
life but this is our DP button over here
which I feel like I should mention you
click it and we actually have a Chrome
browser extension that lets you remote
desktop into your Windows virtual
machine without having to install any
software or set up any configuration and
look at that immediately we're in our
virtual machine and we also have an ssh
into browser functionality for your
linux distributions one other thing i
want to point out about the UI is this
link at the bottom this is equivalent
rest or command line so it's really nice
to use the UI to click around and say I
want this OS and drag and slide I want
this much RAM in this much CPU but if
you need to do that in a repeatable
programmatic manner so say you have an
application that spinning up servers or
spinning down servers or you've got a
script clicking that will actually give
you an HTTP POST request that you can
send into the Google cloud platform api
and it's pre-configured with all the
settings that you just used in the UI
and the same thing with the g-cloud
command line command so of course Google
compute engine is not the only place we
have to run your code we have something
we like to call the computing continuum
annuum so on the far left we have course
infrastructure as a service now this is
compute engine raw linux and windows VMS
right so you can ssh in you can already
p in you get full access you can run
anything you want this is what you
traditionally think about as you think
VMS but as you move up that spectrum you
get container engine now how many people
here are playing with docker or docker
containers fair amount so container
engine is very similar to how we run
everything at Google right containers so
instead of having to SSH into the
Machine and manually manage it you get a
cooper Nettie's api for a cluster and
cooper notice is an open-source
container management system so this lets
you manage docker applications on your
cluster you can say how many you want
scale them up it'll keep them up things
like that so you're managing
applications and microservices
microservices in
set of actually the raw infrastructure
itself and as we move up that spectrum
we get app engine so with App Engine you
just write your code upload it and boom
right we worry about all that
infrastructure stuff we scale it for you
we do security patches we make sure it's
up and running so again this lets you
focus on your application logic and
building a great app and without having
to worry about all the operations stuff
underneath and then finally we have
cloud functions which are currently in
alpha so these what we like to call
event-driven programming models right so
something happens in the cloud and it
triggers a function to run again server
less computing so something in firebase
triggers a function or like pub/sub
cloud storage what have you right so
these can trigger little functions to
run and do something without you having
to worry about the infrastructure so now
that we've got our code running on the
server how do we connect it to firebase
you're probably familiar with the
firebase client SDKs for Android for iOS
for web and if you use a technology
stack such as Java or JavaScript on the
server you can use the same SDKs to
connect a firebase but if you have a
tech stack or a language that's not one
of those we have some third-party SDKs
we've got Python PHP Ruby Clojure pearl
go and see sharp so these are
third-party SDKs they're not supported
by google officially so your mileage may
vary I'll but I encourage you to check
them out but if you're not happy with
one of those or you've got a tech stack
that's not represented here firebase is
a REST API so anything that can make an
HTTPS rest request post you can use to
access firebase functionality which is
awesome so in our case we're going to be
using nodejs and we're going to be using
something called robot j/s which is
pretty cool so it lets you take no j/s
code and translate it into keyboard
commands right so in this case we're
going to connect a firebase we're going
to use the same type of connection that
we use on the client and go to the
command subtree and every time you're
going to up down left or right all we're
going to do is send a keyboard command
to our game right so our game can be any
game off the shelf we're just going to
send it keyboard commands and it's
already fire-based enabled pretty cool
and we're going to live stream
everything to youtube so youtube live
gives us the ability to encode our
windows desktop the entire desktop so
whatever is happening on it we can
actually live stream
to youtube so that's what we'll use to
show our game and as a bonus we can
actually embed this YouTube video in our
game so as you're playing it and you're
seeing the character respond to your
commands you see it respond to everyone
else's commands they're all watching the
same YouTube stream and as a bonus free
bandwidth from google cloud platform to
youtube it's all happening within the
Google Network so you don't pay for
ingress or egress charges which is
really nice so if you take a look at our
architecture we have the clients again
speaking directly to firebase pushing up
those chat and those command messages
and then we have our node.js process
running on our windows vm and now this
is going to be taking those commands and
relaying it to the game right and then
we're gonna take the whole screen and
encode it and send it up to youtube live
pretty cool cool but cool is not crazy I
mean it's pretty crazy a huge
multiplayer simultaneous livestream game
it's not crazy enough for you ok I need
more let me think you know what I've
always thought typing is boring so what
if we get rid of the keyboard what if we
get rid of buttons what if you could
control this game with the power of your
mind wait wait what just kidding we
don't have a reminder eating API but we
have the next best thing which is cloud
speech API you've probably seen similar
technology in Android and in Chrome
whereas you talk it's transcribing your
spoken word into text we talked a lot
yesterday during the keynote about
Google assists so this is the same text
speech to text technology that you that
powers all of that at Google using
machine learning and it's just an API
request an HTTP POST request so any
technology stack server client browser
what have you can take advantage of
cloud speech API so like brett said it's
a simple post request in this case we're
going to just base64 encode or audio and
then send it up right that's pretty much
all you have to do and you get back the
transcript in this case how old is a
broken bridge ninety-eight percent
confident how old is the book are you
asking me how all the broken bridges am
I asking you I don't know it's a hundred
and forty-six years old thank you no not
need to know that so it's looking a lot
better we didn't magically become
designers but we took advantage of
material designed to kind of relay out
and reorganize our
colors look better the design looks
better you'll notice there's no d-pad at
all there's no way to control this
except by clicking that button and
speaking the commands so instead of
pressing up pressing down pressing left
pressing right you'll actually say out
loud up down left right and the game
will respond and send those commands of
do firebase so looking at our
architecture we again don't use any
servers for the cloud speech API our
clients talk directly to the cloud
speech API get that transcript send it
up to firebase and then again our nodejs
application running on Windows is going
to relay those commands to our game and
then live stream everything to youtube
but come on that's like a little bit
more crazy like voice you can't be
satisfied can't be satisfied so how do
we make this even crazier um what if
what if our game got so popular it was
played around the world what do you mean
what if I'm sorry yes when our game gets
so popular it is played around the world
well not everyone speaks English so
let's introduce a multilingual support
for our App it would be awesome if I
could verbally speak in my native tongue
and it would instantly be translated
into the native tongue of everyone else
who is playing this game in real time
and conversely as they spoke in their
native tongue it would show up on my
screen in my language I think that's
pretty crazy so for that we use the
google translate API you probably use
the Google Translate app or been to
translate google com and the web we can
type texts so Spanish will get translate
it to english i can paste in some french
translated to japanese super easy super
convenient and now we've made that
available through the google cloud
platform as an api for you to use that
same machine learning technology in your
applications so again it's a simple HTTP
request in this case we just send up the
string and the target language which is
espanol and we get back the translated
text and we can automatically detect the
source language for you which is really
nice awesome so we have a lot more
machine learning ap is one I'd like to
talk about is the cloud vision API with
this you get the same power that Google
photos has right so you send up a photo
and you can get very detailed
information like what's motion detection
object detection oh
er a all these kind of cool stuff again
of the simple REST API call and of
course if you're using tensorflow today
you can use cloud machine learning to
train on our clusters right so you can
get the power of cpus cpus and gpus that
we have in Google Cloud to train your
big your machine learning models and
believe me when I say there's more
coming soon sounds exciting so here's
our architecture as it stands now again
we've got clients we've got tablets
desktop mobile they are transcribing
your spoken word and then translating it
if necessary using the translate API
syncing both chat and commands using
firebase both to our server which is
running nodejs but also potentially
every other client that's logged in
using firebase it's live streamed
everything to youtube so people around
the world can watch it cool so yeah why
don't we do a little demo let's show you
this game that we built so you can see
these api is in action i'm going to be
playing on my desktop and Sandeep will
be playing on his phone so first I'll
demonstrate the chat portion so let's
see hello and welcome to google i/o and
look at that almost instantaneously on
the screen you can see hello and welcome
to google i/o almost as soon as I was
finished talking let's see it how fast
it seems to firebase send a if you want
to reply sure everyone here is so cool
well you're just pandering now but you
can see almost instantaneously it showed
up on my chat box everyone here is so
cool now let's try a different language
let me switch from English down to
espanol and you can see again almost
instantaneously it translated all into
Spanish and if I click on it I can see
it in the original I'm not that great at
Spanish so let me switch back to english
wait I took Spanish in high school so
you're the resident expert oh yeah all
right ready donde esta la biblioteca
and you can see it translate the classic
Spanish 101 phrase where is the library
on my screen in real time using firebase
pretty cool nice so you won't play the
game let's play the game I'm going to go
ahead and start it this is my windows
remote desktop on the left so I'll click
start and then explain the game so the
point of the game is we're trying to get
the red dot which is in the bottom left
corner to the finish line which is the
blue dot in the top right corner and
we're going to do this by verbally
issuing commands just to the game
simultaneously to control the character
and we have five minutes in which to do
that so let's give it a whirl do it up
right up right right up up up up up up
right right here we go up up up left
left last what are you doing I don't
know up up up right right right ah uh up
oh my god we will eat suck it we really
are not good at this oh my that's all
right i think that was fine
but you know fun is not crazy oh yeah um
I don't like where this is headed oh you
like with the Senate we're gonna make it
crazy all right ladies and gentlemen get
out your phone and play this includes
you on the live stream it's going to ask
for geolocation just hit yes I'll get
into why later of course if you're not
comfortable you can hit no but got your
phone come on let's all get it out we're
gonna make it loud in here this is not
going to work but it's gonna be fun this
is definitely going to be crazy all
right so we're gonna restart the game
and give the whole world five minutes to
get mr. red dot to mrs. blue dot five
minutes all right all right we're going
to give every 11 seconds is anyone on
raise your hand if anyone at all is on
these o people right have noticed that
the UI looks a little bit different we
have a whole to speak button you press
it down you speak let it go it'll
transcribe your text some devices don't
allow browser support for the microphone
so we have a d-pad but uh yeah we can't
build a native app in time and push it
into the App Store I know what so
unfortunately PR said no live chat blame
POS because I was swearing a lot in
rehearsals and they thought you know
yeah yeah they didn't trust us all right
so I think most people are ready to go
we're gonna give every 15 minutes 3 2 1
what is this oh my god Wow amazing holy
haha come on you're so close love it
there's trolls in every crowd all right
who's trolling with last come on it's
beautiful you still have four minutes
chaos this is chaos all right come on
you
do it oh we're never gonna get out of
this little oh come on use a speech API
so these people hitting left this is
amazing it is Oh remember hold down and
let go oh so close this is intense oh my
god Oh almost almost haha oh wait oh god
it's in the quarter that even happen so
close hahaha oh it's right there it's
all my god Oh are we r vm is being
overwhelmed you should i use a bigger
one I know right oh this is amazing I
already know what's going on I'm like
lost who have any tips for them okay
everyone stop except one person he'll
love that hahahaha yeah that will never
work oh we're so far down now oh my god
this is crazy I don't even know what's
going on like who I was using the speech
API her who got it to work I think we
just overwhelmed the Wi-Fi why don't you
audio files I do we just give up look it
just like stopped so I wrote this game
at dobie flash let's blame flash yeah
alright that was ridiculously crazy ho
my god round of applause for everyone
that was amazing that was crazy that was
crazy
awesome but but what come on one more
thing just for me old times sake just a
little bit little bit more crazy little
bit more crazy okay so we'll do
something a little bit more crazy and
we're gonna talk about big data so at
Google we love big data it's in our DNA
we've been doing it since day one we
have a ton of tools to let you interact
with process and analyze big data I'm
gonna talk about bigquery so big
bigquery is our data analytics warehouse
tool well what does that mean what that
means is you can upload gigabytes
terabytes and petabytes of data into
bigquery and query it just using
essentially sequel the same sequel you
already know and it's a managed service
so you don't have to worry about scaling
your infrastructure you don't have to
worry about replicating the data you
don't have to worry about backups you
don't have to worry about how much RAM
or CPU we take care of it all for you
you just upload your data and as soon as
it's ingested it is immediately ready to
query so queries that used to take hours
in days can now be done literally in
seconds pretty cool so again thank you
guys for enabling that metadata the
geolocation so basically we collected
some metadata from the client we used
google maps to do some reverse geocoding
to get your city in your state and then
we collected like browser type and
device type right simple metadata of
course in your applications you might do
like IOT data like temperature sensors
coming in or like maybe like how many
people click the red button versus the
green button things like that so again
thank you guys for enabling that and all
right so here's the code how we got into
big table I bigquery so it's pretty
straightforward first we require the
g-cloud client library so g-cloud is a
client library that wraps a lot of the
Google cloud platform functions in a
nice sort of node friendly style we've
got these available for Ruby Python Java
and go so rather than having to make all
the HTTP requests yourself you can use
this library in a manner that's familiar
with to you in those languages after we
require g-cloud we're gonna reference
bigquery and then off of big hoary are
going to reference our data set name and
our data set name is just our date
basename essentially and then we're
friends reference the table specifically
so we've got this child added listener
this is the same child added listener we
saw earlier this is the app that's
running on the windows vm so as the
commands are coming in it's getting a
notified through child added it's going
to relay those keystrokes into the game
as you saw and then after that it's just
going to do a table that insert into
bigquery and it's going to use snapshot
vowel that's directly the JSON payload
that comes in from firebase so this is
the payload that has the command and
then for example city-state of where you
of where you executed the command now
we'd have to transform that firebase
data at all yes is very useful and then
after that you can do any sort of
post-processing that you want so once
it's in bigquery just looks like any old
IP database you have you know columns
and rows and you can write some sequel
so this is the web UI and of course we
have an API so you can programmatically
interact with it as well all right
speaking of interacting let's take a
look at the data that we just inserted
into bigquery so as y'all were playing
we're actually putting that data into
bigquery so as i type this out it's live
data so I'm gonna do a select star I
know it's bad form but it's less typing
on stage and then let's say let's do
order by timestamp descending whoops and
then let's run that and see what kind of
data we get all right so we see okay so
we've got a lot in mountain view but
then also in califon utah out all right
good job utah playing along awesome um
and again it's just sequel so let's see
what were the most common commands that
people issued so I'm just gonna do a
count okay if left wins I'm like lost
faith in humanity right there's a troll
in every crowd so I'm just going to
group by command run that and you can
see that wow so you can see that number
one was right and the number two is up
which actually sort of make sense in the
context of the game right like we're
starting in the bottom left corner of
the game we're trying to get to the top
right so most commands would either be
right or up you can ask these roles of
course down and left come on guys who is
on Team left come on yeah this guy here
left
huh alright um let's see I have a couple
of other saved queries so we can take a
look at that data again as soon as you
ingest the data into bigquery it is
immediately available to query so let's
see what kind of devices were people
using let's see let's run this another
queries whoops all right there we go
okay so most people were on their phone
we got about twelve hundred klicks from
desktop and then a few people on tablet
so it's pretty cool come on let's go
topless my own team tablet I don't have
a tablet and then let's see by city so
I'm just gonna do just another group by
city and see what see where we got let's
look laughs 246 wow look at all these
cities let's like go through them wow
that's awesome sit next and like this
yeah so we are my bros eligible cities
Kalamazoo Wow Seattle that thanks to
everyone on the live stream for playing
a wrong by the way that's awesome we got
a really good international audience is
really cool yeah that's awesome so you
can see that data came in live right
like we couldn't make this up if we
tried auckland we probably could though
but we didn't yeah but yeah that's Wow
shoutout to all the guys in the
livestream thank you so much and of
course everyone here as well so one
thing I want to point out you might be
looking at this query and you see it
says 1.9 seconds elapsed and you might
be thinking you know for a few hundred
or a few thousand rows it's actually not
that fast and you're right it's not so
big Cory is not designed to be super
performant over small data sets it's
designed to be super fast over huge data
sets so like on the gigabyte scale so
don't use it as your sequel database but
if you want to dump a lot of data into
it in query it so for example logs data
so people will sometimes take their web
server logs stream into bigquery you can
query massive amounts of data in just a
few seconds really really easily in fact
where this product came from at Google
is we needed to analyze all of our ads
data right and as you can imagine ads
data and adds log data at Google as
tremendous data set humongous and it was
taking hours and hours and hours just to
run simple queries so we developed a
technology that eventually became
bigquery and is now available for you to
use yep so you can really query
terabytes of data in seconds literally
in seconds and you can imagine this game
you know we played for like two minutes
and we
already generated all that data now this
game was running for like 24 hours a day
like in up seven days a week you can
imagine how much data we're going to be
generating right and a normal database
is going to be overwhelmed with that
amount of data so bigquery is definitely
where you want to store this type of
data so of course that's not the only
big data tool we have at Google we have
cloud data proc and this is our manage
spark and Hadoop cluster offering right
so you can get a fully bootstrap cluster
in about 90 seconds so if you're already
running spark or Hadoop and you want to
move to the cloud this is exactly built
for you and then we have cloud dataflow
and this is what we consider our next
generation of MapReduce so with one API
you can do batch streaming and etl we've
open sources as Apache beam and when you
run on our cloud we do all the
operations for you right the auto
scaling the instances things like that
which is really nice and for all the
data analysts out there we have cloud
data lab this lets you do exploration
visual analysis with up I Python or
Jupiter open source notebooks and it's
tied directly into our machine learning
and big data tools so here's our final
architecture we've got our web browsers
again running on tablets as you saw
desktop mobile they're all listening to
verbal speech using the cloud speech API
translating back and forth from multiple
languages if necessary syncing
everything in real time through firebase
to every other client and to our server
which is running our game and our node
app live streaming everything to youtube
and inserting all that data into
bigquery where does a V immediately
available for you to query and see what
your users are up to but you know what's
really crazy what's really good it was
really crazy the whole thing went crazy
well yeah but we built that whole thing
in like a week this actually was pretty
right that was pretty crazy just show
the power a firebase and Google Cloud
and how it makes building amazing
applications that much easier so if you
want to learn a little bit more please
check out firebase at its new home
firebase out google com and of course
Google cloud platform at cloud google
com we also have two really cool YouTube
channels the Google Developers Channel
how many of you are subscribed to the
google developers channel already
awesome and of course the Google cloud
platform channel we're we had a ton of
cloud content coming out all the
time thank you thank you all so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
