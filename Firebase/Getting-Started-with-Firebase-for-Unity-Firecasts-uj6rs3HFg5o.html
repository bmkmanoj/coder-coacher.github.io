game which has detailed user based
analytics a game which you can tweak and
run experiments on remotely a game which
is social and shareable from the start
well you've come to the right place
let's get started with firebase in unity
on this episode of fire cast we're going
to cover five steps to go from an empty
Unity game to again that's ready to be
shipped on iOS and Android first we'll
open up a unity project second will
download the firebase SDK third we'll
install that firebase SDK into unity
fourth we'll configure a new firebase
project to be used in our unity game and
fifth or compile our game for iOS and
Android are you ready let's get started
first open up the unity editor in our
case we'll be making a new game but
don't worry if you already have an
existing game which you want to add
firebase to the process is going to be
exactly the same just open up your
existing game instead of making a new
one like I'm doing once we've opened our
project we'll see the editor with the
inspector scene view and everything else
you'd expect note the empty inspector on
the right side this is where our
firebase panel will live once the SDK is
installed but the for firebase can start
adding cool features to unity we need to
install a firebase let's hop over to the
firebase box and download the latest
firebase SDK for unity at this point you
probably already know if you want to
make an iOS game or an Android game or
bolt but the great part about unity is
that we can make a game that works for
both these platforms with only one code
base
this means that regardless of the mobile
platform you want to build for you'll
download just the one SDK the firebase
SDK for unity this download comes as a
zip and when you extract it you'll see a
bunch of files with a dot unity package
extension let's take a second to talk
about unity asset packages these
packages a standard way in the Unity
world to distribute reusable code if
you're familiar with other programming
tools you probably included an external
library into a project unity asset
packages are a lot like this it's a way
to distribute things for other
developers to use it's worth
understanding that the unity asset
package can contain lots of different
stuff it's not just code like a normal
library as the packages can contain
images
choose 3d models examples and yes code
service has a lot of features and you
don't need to use all of them in your
game each verb base feature has its own
asset package so if you only want to use
firebase analytics or you only want to
use firebase database you can include
just that package let's go with the
simplest feature to implement firebase
analytics in the unity editor go to
assets import package custom package
then browse where you're extracted the
firebase SDK and select the firebase
analytics unity package file unity will
take a moment to extract the package
then you'll be prompted to select which
files from the package you want to
import we can see this asset package
taking advantage of the fact that asset
packages can contain non code assets the
first thing to show up in this package
are a bunch of icons which are used for
the unity editor plugin we don't need to
pick and choose what to import here so
just click import and let unity do its
magic after another second you'll be
back in the unity editor but it'll have
a few key changes first your assets
folder will now contain some new folders
and second your editor now has the
firebase plug-in enabled once the
spinner and the bottom right is stopped
you'll be able to start using firebase
if you haven't already it's a good time
to save your unity scene if you're
working off a new project this won't be
done automatically so just go to file
save scene this will save the scene in
your project and if you don't know what
the college is called something exciting
an original like game once we have a set
of scene we can bring out the firebase
pain in our editor in your menu go to
window and click on firebase now
depending on your editor setup the
firebase pain may show up as a floating
window or may show up near the inspector
tab just find it wherever it is the
firebase plugin will help you get
started with any firebase feature by
linking you to setup guides code samples
and the API reference you'll notice the
very first thing the plug-in shows is
advice on connecting your game to your
firebase projects Android or iOS app
like I talked about before unity has the
ability to build games for iOS and
Android firebase and unity both work
great on these platforms but there is
some minor work needed to set up both of
these platforms for your firebase and
unity project let's start by making a
new project on the firebase console at
firebase Google
calm once you've created a project
you'll be greeted with the screen asking
you if you'd like to make an iOS up and
Android app or a web app a firebase
project may contain many apps which
means you'll only need one firebase
project even if you're building both an
Android and iOS version of the same game
I'll be showing you how to build a
cross-platform game but if you're only
interested in iOS or Android you can
just do that one let's click on the add
firebase to your iOS app button we'll
enter a few basic details and then on
step 2 it'll download a Google services
dot plist file this is the configuration
file that will tell the firebase Unity
SDK what project to connect to back in
unity we'll drag this plist file into
the root of our assets folder and the
firebase SDK will automatically detect
it when we build our app for iOS this is
another situation when you need to watch
that spinner in the bottom right and
make sure it's completed if you want to
do the same thing on Android then click
on the add firebase to your Android app
button and enter a same basic
information and the second step you'll
be given a Google services dot JSON file
and just like with the plist we'll drag
this file into the root of our assets
folder in unity once you've gotten your
configurations in place you'll be able
to go into your file build and run menu
and build your game switching between
platforms is as easy as selecting the
switch platform buttons in the build
settings menu once we have deployed our
game the debug messages will show us
that firebase analytics is enabled and
reporting back to your console Congrats
you've gotten your first firebase
library up and running inside of your
unity game but this is really just the
start there's a lot more firebase can do
inside of unity like saving your users
data to the cloud with the real-time
database tweaking gameplay settings on
the fly with firebase remote config
adding notification support with
firebase Cloud messaging and a whole lot
more if you want to learn more about
what firebase and unity can do together

description below and subscribe to the
firebase YouTube channel in the meantime
thanks for watching I'm heading back to
the arcade
