yellow one or the round
hey everybody welcome to meet firebase
you get to meet the Googlers that make
firebase happen I need to snug Stevenson
I'm a developer advocate on the firebase
team and with me today is Kato
Richardson
Hado hi Doug
thanks for being on the show to see you
now tell me what do you do with the
firebase team
yeah so I'm similar a role to yours Doug
I work with developers but I mostly work
on support quality so I train the
support team teach them how to use the
product teach them how to talk to
customers and just really try to make
the incoming experiences as great as
possible so basically when the
documentation and the product fails I
get to step in and make it a great
experience for customers okay and so you
would then so if the product and the
documentation do fail what do you do to
help correct that yeah so I don't
actually have to do anything which is
the amazingly awesome fight right so I
train the support team and teach them
how to interact with the development
community and develop processes for them
and then when they need help with an
issue like an issue is particularly hard
they raise it to me and I help I get
some engineers involved and then I also
streamline the process as much as
possible by trying to find new ways to
make it faster and easier and then I
take all the feedback we get from the
community when we're working in support
and I go back to the engineers so we can
make fixes to the product and fix this
of the documentation to make sure we
don't encounter those ok so what you do
is figure out what what goes wrong and
then that becomes feedback so we can go
and fix things that might might have
gone wrong yep okay well that's very
helpful because you know sometimes
things do go wrong and we do have a
system in place and Cato sounds like
you're sort of in charge of making sure
that system that goes smoothly yeah now
you are also very involved with firebase
communities tell me about what is what
does the firebase community like what
can you expect I the firebase community
is one of the most amazing things about
firebase to me I really love just the
way that our developers treat us and the
way they think about firebase and the
feedback we get from them is what really
shapes firebase as a product in my mind
I was originally dug firebase user
before I became a a firebase you know
developer I was building my own app on
firebase but
was doing so much work for the fire
based community that they eventually
said like why don't we just start paying
you for that and then I became a fire
baser so I really understand the
community like what it's like to
actually be a member using the software
and being a part of that community is
one of the reasons that I love coming to
work every day for everyone out there
who might be interested in joining the
community what kind of channels do we
have for people to interact with each
other yeah so we have a support of
course which is email based support that
you can get to from our website firebase
Google comm there's also a place under
fire based on Google comm where you can
go to the support area and we have a
whole list of community channels there
we have a slack channel where you can do
live chat with our community and some of
the people like myself and some of our
engineers hang out on that live chat as
well no one there sometimes see you on
there all the time in test labs yeah
yeah we also have Google Groups which is
our it's our mailing list and a lot of
people come on to Google Groups and
discuss things that you can't talk about
on Stack Overflow Stack Overflow is
great for coding questions and like
getting specific help but their criteria
for what you can post there is really
specific so the group fills a niche
where you just want to come on and say
like hey what's the best way to go about
this and we also have been participating
in Cora a bit lately and I know that
I've seen some posts on there get
answered as well so Cora's another great
place for again like sort of in depth
topics that don't really fit into they
like how do i code this sort of question
so yeah if you have questions be sure to
check those out
we have a lot of firebase staff that are
waiting to answer your questions yep for
sure one thing I also know you do you
practice martial arts yeah I've taken
part in martial arts since I was a
little kid I started about the time I
was six so pretty much all of my life
I've been involved Wow so what kind of
martial arts like this is yeah I started
in kung fu and I did probably 20 years
at kung fu I'm actually a 13th degree
black belt okay I'm gonna stay away from
you then if there's conflict lately I've
been into Brazilian jiu-jitsu because my
body's getting older and I need
something that's less impact on my
joints okay in years ago I practiced
with the professional MMA fighters I was
never into the competitive fighting
aspect of it I was always into the chess
match and the strategy and the deeper
Eastern philosophies you know the the
just Zen lifestyle and the and the
positive impact it has on the way you
speak and interact with other people
which is really my true love of martial
arts is the
communications aspect of it how you
learned to speak to other people and
communicate with people and you learned
that violence is not the answer to
problems you can really de-escalate
situations and take a take a hard
situation and have a hard conversation
with somebody without being worried
about the outcome I'm told you do magic
tricks
I do there's no better way to get a kids
attention than with a few magic tricks
or just just some sort of a performance
it is hard to get a child's attention
yes yes you have any tricks to show us
today Wow me well do you know how to
spot a magician who's walking down the
road spot a magician the hat in the cave
not a wizard a magician so if you see a
magician walking down the road they'll
be carrying one of these little purses
okay this is a little magicians purse
now I bet you're wondering what all the
stuff in here is because these things
are huge and they're full of things
right okay but in in reality if I open
one up for you you'll see that it's
actually kind of empty there's really
nothing in it but when a magician gets
one out and opens it up you will find
that he's got all kinds of useful toys
in a lake like these little guys here
all right and these are one of my
favorite tricks because which one would
you like do you want the yellow one or
the round one they both look kind of
yellow and around I would pick one for
me help me out okay I'll take the one in
your right okay the round one the round
one it is then okay so here's what we're
gonna do hold your hand out for me okay
and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
take this one I'm gonna put it in this
hand okay now we're gonna take yours and
we're gonna put it in your hand like
this okay
now close your hand up for me okay now
here's what we're gonna do blow into
your hand all right now if you open it
up it should have changed colors for you
okay so what you'll see is go ahead and
open your hand I have two white
what do you hold on to say wait how did
you get my ball I don't know no this is
this is you're not supposed to have mine
wait what happened here Duggar you

I think you're playing I don't think I
have any tricks let's try this again
let's try this one more time okay
here's what I want you to do we're gonna
take this I'm gonna put it in your hand
I'll close up your hand for me okay I'll
turn your hand over
okay I want you to blow into your hand
blow up your hand this time like this
okay now I want you to open up your hand
for me
and we should have gotten it to change
cut oh my god what happened this is uh
it's kind of crazy now well they they
did change colors but where did you get
these ones fry I have no idea I can only
assume as part of the trick Wow all
right well good job Doug well thank you
that was well done that was that's
better than most of the kids do they
don't usually have that much followed
instructions yeah thanks for sharing
that yeah if you have any other tricks I
thought I saw you walking with the deck
of cards I I do have a deck of cards
today it's a pretty cool deck we'd
probably have to get up to do some
tricks with that okay you want to do
that yeah all right what you got
actually got this wonderful deck of
cards it's firebase themed you know
pretty much everything in my home now is
firebase themed oh really I don't I
don't have any clothing anymore that's
not firebase in fact it's gotten so bad
at my house that now some of my kids are
wearing firebase okay so they have the
fever we even have a firebase onesie
check out this cool deck of cards
okay that's neat yeah cards all right
all right so what I want to do is uh
this is called the ambitious card where
it rises to the top repeatedly so I want
to try this out with you would you mind
picking a card for me from the deck here
something close to the center choose
this one yeah Ace of Hearts oh the ace
of hearts in fact would you hold these
for me for a second would I take this
off all right these sleeves out of the
way
I gotta get nimble you can't be weighed
down by that jacket what I want to do is
I want to take it and I'm gonna put a
little bend in your card here okay so
you can tell apart from the other ones
in the deck so I'm gonna take it like
this and I'm just gonna bend it over
okay just like that now I'm gonna take
it and I'm gonna put it right into the
center of the deck oh can you see your
card right here here let me get the been
doing I see the bend okay so you got
your bend right there that's your card
in the middle okay so you know it's in
there okay now I'm stuffing it down to
the middle of the deck now what I want
you to do is snap your fingers for me
three times three snaps
did you see it pop up there you little
pop there okay yeah why don't you flip
that guy over and see what you got all
right oh it's pretty amazing yeah so
that's called the ambitious card routine
