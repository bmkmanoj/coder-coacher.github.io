these were pretty straightforward you
clicked on one and nine times out of ten
you went to a web page then things
changed people started using their
mobile devices for well everything and
these devices in turn start supporting
the idea of deep links click on one of
these deep links and it could take you
not just anywhere on the web but
anywhere in an app as well so you could
use a deep link to point directly to a
specific restaurant inside a reservation
app or give your new customers a
personalized welcome based on the link
that brought them to your app in the
first place at least that's how they
worked in theory and practice deep
linking had issues the same link
wouldn't necessarily work on an iOS or
Android device and they behave very
differently or didn't work at all for
users who didn't have your app installed
and for people who did install your app
through a deep link all of that great
link info was typically lost during the
installation process leaving your
personalized warm welcome out in the
cold so while deep links were great in
theory their uses were a little more
limited in practice enter firebase
dynamic links firebase dynamic links are
deep links that work the way you want
them to so you can create one single
link that behaves one way on iOS another
on Android and even a third on a desktop
browser and it will take you to a place
that's appropriate to that platform you
can also set up dynamic links to change
their behavior depending on whether or
not your user has your app installed for
users who don't have your app installed
maybe you send them to your website
maybe you take them to the Play Store or
maybe you show them an interstitial
describing the benefits of your app
before you take them to the App Store
first in your transition
more importantly these links can survive
the AppStore installation process so if
your user installs your app when
clicking on a dynamic link all of that
information is still available to you
when your user opens up your app for the
first time so what does this mean it
means you can use dynamic links the way
you've always wanted to use deep links
you can use them in marketing campaigns
from email to social media to banner ads
- heck even QR codes and in addition to
install attribution tracking you know
the kind that lets you know which
campaigns are getting you the highest
quality users you can also give your
users a customized first-time experience
have based on the campaign that brought
them there so if a user installs your
music app because you showed them an ad
for classical music you can make sure
your app takes them right to Chopin's
latest hits when they first open it up
dynamic links are great for sharing to
your users can use them to share recipes
links to their favorite level in your
game or even coupon codes in fact
dynamic links are the technology that
powers firebase invites and because
dynamic links are a fire based product
you can see their stats directly through
the firebase console find out how many
people clicked on a link or use firebase
analytics to find out which of you users
first opened your app through a
particular link to find out more about
dynamic links check out the
documentation here and give them a try
and deep link away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
