product manager at firebase test lab and
I'm joined with my amazing colleagues
here fergus early on the Google Play
Developer console team ally I'm a
product manager on firebase crash
reporting michael bailey android
engineer at american express and I'm
eurozone is from Shazam hi and we will
be talking to you about that different
tools that Google provides you to be
able to ensure the quality of your apps
during testing and monitoring now we all
know that quality is really important
for us we're going to be hearing this
plea throughout the conference today we
want you to be able to build the best
possible apps build a great user base
and be able to monetize your apps and to
ensure you build the best possible apps
you need to ensure your quality to be
able to make your apps successful in
fact more than 51 percent of the
one-story views that we saw on the
reviews on Google Play that we were able
to classify are related to quality
issues they are bugs and crashes data is
clearly showing us that we need to make
sure that these quality issues are
resolved and in this talk will be
talking to you about the different tools
that Google Offers to be able to manage
your quality throughout the lifecycle of
your application development starting
with firebase test lab which allows you
to manage the quality of your
application during development to the
play launch report which was announced
today and it's gonna be it's going to
allow you to manage the quality of your
app during the release process and then
finally firebase crash reporting which
was also announced today which is a
cross-platform product that allows you
to collect your crashes on Android and
iOS prioritize the most important and
most impactful crashes and resolve them
really quickly so that they don't affect
your users now many of you probably
heard about cloud test lab which was
announced last year at Google i/o we're
now proud to say that we're part of the
firebase family it has all heard of
firebase today this is the most amazing
google developers product that was ever
released it's basically all of you
amazing Google tools in one convenient
location and firebase test lab is now
part of that suite of tools
so firebase test lab is your first stop
to manage your quality during the
development process with firebase test
lab we want you to make sure that your
app works well on devices that your
users have and that's why the first part
to get started is the infrastructure
this is an actual photo from our device
lab this is devices running in our data
centers that we're hosting them from
different manufacturers different API
levels different form factors our goal
is to make it easy for you to access any
of these devices at any time so that you
don't worry about building your own
infrastructure or don't worry about
building just buying more devices we got
that covered for you you just build your
app and we run it on this amazing
infrastructure and then the second part
of the firebase test lab is how it
easily integrate with your development
workflow all you need to get started is
a web browser and your app and you can
upload your app to the browser start
your test and go from there we also
built an integration with android studio
so they can you can run your tests
during development in Android studio and
then finally we built a command-line
interface that you can use from your
continuous integration environment if
you use Jenkins you can see the
instructions on our developers
documentation and then also our amazing
community built for us instructions on
how to use it using circle CI and
teamcity so all these dogs are available
and we're adding more and more and then
we all acknowledge that many of us
developers think that writing code
writing test code is something we don't
want to invest in from the very
beginning and this is why we built this
amazing robo crawler this crawler
launches your app and clicks on buttons
and navigates through it as if a normal
user would do it builds an activity map
that visualizes all the passes in your
app that lead to a crash now look at
this the Robo is actually able to
navigate through the i/o 16 add that you
guys have it's logging in using google
right now and it's by passing a login
screen you log in using google and then
it was actually able to find a crash
near the end and it gives you the full
path leading to the crash so that you
can resolve all of all these issues now
no matter how smart this roadway
it probably won't be able to guess your
custom login credentials so so that's
why we're building the espresso test
recorder in Android studio so that all
you need to do to write your first test
using espresso is launch the app on your
phone use it as if you use it on a
regular basis we capture all the
interactions that you do and we build a
fully reusable espresso test script for
you this is that the fastest way to get
started with like covering the most
important scenarios you need to worry
about in your application the most
impactful user user journey cover them
with test cases and then every new
change that you at your code make sure
that these scenarios don't break these
are the most important scenarios in your
app you shouldn't break them in at by
any change and then finally firebase
test lab provides you with a full report
that contains logs screenshots stack
traces and a video that allow you to fix
any issues in your app and resolve them
and go back to a green state basically
so I mentioned that firebase test lab is
basically cloud test lab which was
announced last year at i/o but it's
basically now it's part of the firebase
family and we're proud to say that we
worked really closely with our partners
with our developers and they helped us
shape the product we ran over 1 million
tests on our devices infrastructure and
we believe we can add more much more
than that here's foursquare they are
telling us how it was easy for them to
integrate firebase test lab into their
workflow they didn't need to build their
own device infrastructure they just use
firebase test lab also our friends from
kkbox they were able to just with the
robo just by crawling their application
they were able to resolve issues on
launch on their devices that would have
never they would have never captured it
otherwise and it would have affected
their users and now I want to introduce
Michael Bailey from American Express
Michael and I did a talk previously a
droid cone SF two months ago and I'm
really proud to be doing my second talk
in a row with him michael is a very very
respectful and highly influential in the
android community so I'm gonna leave it
up to him yeah oh thank Simon
so we we have an American Express
Android app we wanted it to be high
quality when tools like espresso came
out we started writing UI tests to
verify that the app did what we wanted
to do to make sure that those tests were
always passing we set up a physical
device farm it started on my desk with a
bunch of devices connected to a mac mini
so that we can run Jenkins and we can
run all of our tests for every branch
and every pull request we ran all the
tests to make sure we didn't introduce
any defects well that was fine when we
had a small number of tests and we
didn't have that big of an Android team
but espresso made it easy to write tests
so we wrote more of them because they
helped us increase our quality but then
we needed more devices and we had
problems hooking so many devices to a
mac mini so we had to buy more mac minis
for more jinkin slaves this grew and
grew and grew and we got more engineers
which means more pull requests which
means more tests to run on our
infrastructure a constant refrain at our
daily stand-ups was I can't merge my
change because the builds aren't passing
because this device is giving me
problems can you go unplug it and replug
it and with USB to get the tests to run
so it was becoming a maintenance burden
for us and it was just a daily refrain
and a daily pain in our process to run
these tests and make sure that they were
always passing so we were it was taking
a lot of engineer time it was taking a
lot of hardware to run all these tests
well last year at Google i/o I heard
about what was called cloud test lab no
fire test fire based test lab for
Android about how I could run my tests
on devices provided by google so I
contacted them I asked them for early
access last July Amadan team came to our
office that got a set up with cloud test
lab and then in by August we had d
calmed our own physical device farm and
we were running all our tests on
firebase test lab this no more did we
have our daily stand-ups
the complaints about running all of your
tests and then getting to that last one
it just fails and you have to start the
job all over again we were able to add
more engineers and add more tests
without having to worry about how are we
going to get more devices is just going
to slow down our whole process so by
switching to this we got more
productivity we were able to get early
access to this tool and we have a lot
less maintenance we can actually focus
ourselves on writing the tests and with
making a high-quality app that our
cardmembers expect so now I'm going to
turn it over to ficus from sorry Fergus
from the Play team thanks bye oh I'm
very excited to be here today to
announce the pre-launch report as part
of the Play Developer console so as ama
talked about when you're in the
development lifecycle of building your
app you should be testing it using
firebase test lab for Android using
android studio integrations jenkins
plugins and the command line but then
when you're just about to release your
app to the 1.2 billion monthly active
play users you want that one last sanity
check did I fix all those issues is my
appt ready to be shown to that many
users how does my look across all these
devices and that's where the pre-launch
report comes in and shines so before i
go into what is actually included in the
pre-launch board hands up if you have an
app on play today all right awesome keep
your hand up if you tested that latest
version that you push to all your users
on more than 10 devices hi I'm impressed
I keep your hand up if you were able to
get those results within an hour okay
well very impressive guy over here and
I'm going to show you how you can all
keep your hand up when you ask that
question in the future as a result of
the pre-launch report so the pre-launch
report is powered by fire based test lab
and it includes three parts today
crashes screenshots and security in the
crashes section we show you the results
of the robo that i'ma described
interacting where you're at for about
five minutes across 10 plus physical
Android
devices and we show you if there was a
crash we show you the stack trace the
log cash the device spec and as video of
the robot interacting with the
application and so this really helps you
be able to get to the problem that the
app has and be able to solve that crash
as you can see with this app developer
their first version they uploaded as
part of the pre-launch port had a lot of
issues then as they kept in releasing
new versions they fix the issue and then
they with their final version they've
just pushed to the alpha and beta
channel they've identified two new
crashes they can be able to solve those
so we know that no developer in this
room would ever have in a crash happened
in their apps so we've decided to launch
the screenshot section which helps you
with the usability issues you your app
and this is really powerful when you
have green results as part of your
pre-launch report so it's part of this
you can see what your app looks like
across the different Android devices
different Android versions different
screen resolutions screen sizes and even
languages so you can see what your app
looks like in right left language arabic
in the emerging markets hindi are in
languages that have long strings so for
example here you see that in german
there's a issue with the layout of the
text and it really helps your design
team be able to catch those issues
before it's pushed all your users great
the last part of the report thing i tell
you about today is the Security section
this is where we push google security
team to work for you this is where we
have the known vulnerabilities that we
detect in your application identified
and we give you the information to be
able to help you solve that issue before
you release it to all users in play so
how do you get access to this pre-launch
report you just go to the Google Play
Developer console click on the
pre-launch report tab which replaces the
cloud test lab tab that used to be part
of the Play Developer console and you
will then have it when you click on that
tab and opt in that the next APK you
upload to the alpha and beta channel
will have this report generated within
one hour we've already found it
sixty percent of the top housing apps on
Google Play already used alfa beta
channel if you didn't have a reason to
use it before now you do so we really
encourage you to do that great thank you
very much I'm going to hand over to
Ali's talk about faraway scratch
boarding alright thank you for you
thanks everybody we have also launched
firebase crash reporting today and we're
super excited about it so thanks so much
for being here along with dust lab and
the pre-launch report we really think
that crash reporting completes our
vision for our quality while test lab
focuses on the development stage and
while the pre-launch report box is in
the release stage crash reporting
focuses on production it focuses on that
stage or you have actual users coming
into your app interacting with your app
and the objective here is to give them
the best possible user experience and
this is not exactly the easiest thing
right when you think about the mobile
ecosystem we live in there's many
variables at play we have multiple
operating systems we have many different
or west levels API levels different
device manufacturers different device
models the list of variables just goes
on and on and the combination of all
these things can be too much to handle
with in testing alone but you need to
have something in production because
losing users that happen to be on a
device that wasn't tested or happened to
go through a user fat that wasn't
accounted for is just not acceptable
every single user as employees of them
is as important as every other user and
that's exactly why entry introduced
firebase crash reporting so what is it
exactly crash reporting is an SDK that
support both iOS and Android you get it
packaged into your app you push it to
production and it detects information
about the errors that your users see it
aggregates this data and using the
firebase console you get to see details
about it so that you can be on your way
to fixing these issues faster than ever
setting up is really easy if you're on
Android you grab the cradle plug in if
you're on iOS install the pods at one
line of code initial
firebase and off you go you have arrows
running and when you actually push the
production and you start seeing errors
coming in when they first come in they
start looking something like this right
they're all over the place some errors
come from some devices but not the
others some errors come from specific
user paths that weren't accounted for
and the first thing we do with this data
is we cluster it so it looks something
like this we group these errors by
having them in buckets of similar stack
traces and what that that's what that
does for you is a couple of things first
of all it allows you to get a sense of
how many unique issues you have in your
app and the other thing is that you get
a sense of prioritization you understand
for each cluster of errors is it a fatal
error or non fatal error you get a user
count and you get a number of
occurrences so you understand the
severity of that issue our friends in
Skyscanner have been using this for a
little while and using clustering they
were able to identify a couple of out of
memory issues and they cut down their
crashes by thirty percent so think about
this when you work on your own app the
amount of gain that you can have with
such a simple action okay so now you've
identified through clustering what you
need to work on the best part now is
actually fixing the issue right so this
is where the firebase console comes in
we give you a lot of data a lot of
information basically everything that
you need to identify the root cause of
the issue and get it done in no time the
first thing you see is a top-level
breakdown of metrics so will tell you
obvious things like the exception name
in android or the crashing seen on iOS
but we also tell you things like a
breakdown of the app version so that you
can understand if your latest app
version and production is doing better
or worse than the previous ones will
also give you a breakdown of the
operating systems or operating system
levels a breakdown of the devices and so
on and the idea here is that you're
quickly able to attribute the errors to
some factors and eliminate other factors
the next thing we give you is the stack
trace which is probably the most
important thing we support symbolic
ation on iOS and the application on
Android which means that you get to see
everything down to the line number we
even highlight that frame in the stack
place that belongs in your app so that
you can jump in the problem right away
and whatnot and not waste any time
additionally you get comprehensive
device diagnostics and this is important
for a couple of things but let me first
tell you what you get some of the things
that we give you our the amount of RAM
and this space that are available on
your device you get things like was the
device in landscape or portrait you get
the timestamp of the actual error API
levels basically everything you can
think of that is set on a device and you
get to actually go through instances and
see what the device of that user was
like at the moment here took place and
this is pretty important not just
because you get to fix the issue faster
but you also get the save time on
customer support because you don't have
to go do that back in forth where users
so that you understand what the device
was like at the time of the error
everything I've talked about so far is
about creating a snapshot an accurate
snapshot of the issue but what happens
when you have multiple ways that can
lead you the same point in the code
which happens often for that we have an
API that allows you to catalog custom
Ares sorry custom events we out of the
box lock some events for you such as
when it when the crash actually takes
place but then you get to interlace your
own custom events with it so that you
can get to read your errors kind of like
a story so I called my backend API I got
some data back and I populated miui
model and then boom a crash happens so
reproducing that crash becomes that much
easier over the last couple of months
we've had the great pleasure of working
with our friends in Shazam they've been
kind enough to test our product and give
us great feedback and make it much
better and
today I'm really really happy to have my
friend the orders from Shazam who leads
android development and he's gonna tell
us a little bit about it so you're
Dennis thank you no points for
pronouncing my name correctly that's
good yeah I've seen a lot of excited
butola about firebase today for Saddam
that excitement started a couple of
months ago when were first contacted by
the firebase team a chasm we deeply care
about how users perceive the quality of
the app and we know that it's hugely
correlated to the stability of the app
so because insulation was so easy we
decided in some of the features that I
just described were so compelling we
decided to integrate with cross
reporting first after a couple of months
of having it out in production it turns
out to be a quite valuable addition to
our current tool chain and that's for
those three reasons so Tom gets a very
large number of users per day and even
if just a tiny percentage of those users
experience is a crash it adds up so the
number of grasses are actually quite a
lot in our previous system couldn't
handle all of that traffic so we know we
knew we're not getting the whole picture
we know that's not going to be an issue
with Google with firebase because it's
powered by Google's massively scalable
infrastructure we know we always have a
very accurate view of how many classes
we get we just describe the level of
details you get with firebase class
reporting and I'll give an example of
how that helped us currently we are also
getting the number of users and the
distribution of users where the crash
occurs which we didn't have before a
couple of releases ago we saw two issues
doing new issues that were appearing
with the same kind of frequency but with
very different distributions of users so
the first one was very spread out very
high distribution so we knew that wasn't
going to be a device-specific bug and it
was going to be quite occasional the
other one on the other hand was very
specific very limited number of users so
when we went to the firebase console we
saw exactly the manufacturers the models
that were affected in the US versions
and that's how we managed to fix the
issues
and the bread the firebase I said we
integrated with rush reporting we also
used analytics we know it's all going to
be part of the same unifies decay and
console so very recently we also started
using dynamic links which as you may
have seen helps you maintain the the
context of a user through the
installation of your app it's been
amazing to be an early a user of crash
reporting and we're looking forward to
do more and more integrations I'll leave
that to you alright thanks pal I want to
touch on a point that you're done is
just mentioned at the end one of the
main principles that guide us as we
think about app quality is that it's not
just about metrics that you show in a
dashboard it's what you do with this
data and it's about putting your users
first by having timely action and
winning them we think that firebase can
be a key ingredient to that let me give
you an example let's say you have an
e-commerce app and you're about to push
this new feature that you think is going
to have a great effect on you curvature
conversion rates okay and you want to
keep an eye on quality of course so you
jump into the parvis console and the
first thing you do is go to analytics in
analytics you build an audience of users
that see errors you get to do this
because we have this integration out of
the box so every time crash reporting
actually catches an error that user gets
added to an audience and we'll see how
important this is in a bit the second
thing you do is you go to remote config
which allows you to control things
remotely and you wired that your feature
so you can use it as an on-off switch so
you get the pull the plug on it anytime
you want to without actually having to
push an update okay so you do these two
things you push your new version out
with the feature and then you take a
look at the crash reporting console and
all the sudden there's a spike in errors
obviously that's not a good thing so you
drill a bit more into it you take a look
at the stack trace and you quickly
realize this has something to do with
the feature that you just pushed you
jump back into remote config you turn
the feature off and then going to
firebase notifications you can actually
send a push notification tone
and analytics well you just created an
audience of people that see errors so
now you can automatically send them a
push notification tell them sorry that
you're working on this and maybe send
them a discount to reengage the back to
the app so within minutes you get to do
things that would otherwise take you
days of coding and that's not even
counting the time that alter it would
have taken your users to pick up an
update so it's really powerful stuff and
of course at the end when you fix the
issue you go back to test lab you build
a test case for it and you make sure
that any possible regression that might
happen in the future never actually
makes it to your users this is what's so
cool about firebase it is 14 powerful
features that you get access to using
one sdk in one console and you mix and
match whatever features you need there
are cross-platform the vast majority of
features we have today are already
supporting iOS and Android and it's only
going to get better as we cross
integrate them more and more so we hope
that this gives you a different
perspective on app quality and get you
to think about it throughout the stages
of your app when you develop use test
lab to make sure that you catch all the
bugs that you can catch and development
when you're about to release keep your
eye on the alpha and beta channels and
make sure that your release is looking
good and then in production use cross
reporting to catch everything out there
we really think that using this
combination will go a long way and we'll
get you those five star reviews we're
hoping we hope you're excited we already
have an amazing community of app
developers that you can see on this
slide and we would love nothing more
than for you guys to join us some last
knowing our notes here we have a booth
set up right outside of this room where
the test lab team actually set up a raft
with actual device senate it's really
cool you're reading to check this out so
drop is a visit over there we're gonna
be around as well for Q&amp;amp;A for about an
hour so we'd love to talk to you and
finally all the products we talked about
today our life today so go to the
council's start hacking away enjoy it
and please keep thinking about app
quality it really matters thank you so
much and we'll talk to you in a bit
so so we'll do QA and there's mics here
if you want to ask questions right now
actually yeah yeah first question hi how
does the automated espresso testing work
with asynchronous code specifically
something that's in a bent bus or
something like RX Java that's not using
async tasks or something that has the
idling resources yeah so this is
definitely a this is a great question so
this is one of the sonars that were
still considering to support like one
thing we're considering to do is add
delays for that we know this isn't the
optimal way but the idea here is like we
generated at least a boilerplate of a
fully functional espresso code for you
and then you can either hack at the ID
links resource part of it or use it as
is so that's basically the idea yeah
thank you thanks thanks i dig questions
for they just come to the mic if you
want to go ask question yeah next
question Oh Lyon with harvest Tesla
maybe the gentleman at American Express
hope is the idea that you use it as part
of your continuous integration process
or is it more just when you're ready to
release you're going to go and send a
bill up there like it there is there a
quick enough performance to be able to
go run this and then be able to have
your check-in stage based on that
innocence yeah so I think I mean both
are valid use cases I think I mean it if
you want to if you have changes on a
branch and you want to make sure that
all your tests are passing before that
branch gets merged then a CI is a great
place to do that of course you want to
make sure you do the regression before
you launch and then also you get the
additional protection of the play launch
report so for chicken we we run every
branch before it gets merged so whatever
the latest check in when the CI picks it
up if you do couple check-ins in a row
it may miss one but it's always the
latest check in on every old request oh
thank you hey so I'm
you said was one single s decayed having
made a name thoughts I'm how to avoid
making one massive monolithic SDK over
like smaller bite-sized pieces like
comparing the google play services I'm
sure people are worried about that
concerns you the question is about the
firebase has a que right yeah like I are
gonna provide like a Vegas and services
to gay and bright so the document asians
are actually live and you do get sort of
cut day as he came to pieces of anyone
what you want so in the case of iOS for
example you can include individual
thoughts but we have some configuration
parts that grab a bunch of products for
you as a base package so there's a
flexibility there urban and a lot of
amazing announcements thanks thank you
hi I was wondering how this new
mechanism is different from the old
crash reporting mechanism where the user
gets to select what send details
screenshots of the report and is the are
the end-users aware of this change and
you have control different yeah so I on
the Google Play Developer console you
see crashes that are reported by users
for the platform so these are crashes on
a indoors like fatal exceptions and
whereas the SDK is you can where you
control your own custom exceptions as
well so the SDK will catch all the
exceptions that you troll and and I then
if you link your account with play you
can have the a and ors from google play
show up in the firebase crash reporting
as well so we recommend people to use
firebase crash reporting as the crash
reporting tool moving forward to be able
to improve your iOS and Android
applications thank you thank you hello I
have two questions actually the first
one there's a lot of firebase branding
can we use it without firebase as a
back-end is what can you use firebase
crash boring without use firebase back
end yes yeah definitely okay perfect you
can pick and choose which pieces of the
offering you want to use so no matter
what back n do you use you can use
firebase crash boarding cool and this
next question is can we use firebase
test reporting also as a feedback tool
so clients can enter feedback not just
arrows
alright what sort of feedback you let's
say somebody you know it's not
necessarily a crash or an issue but it's
something that's behaving erratically
are they able to somehow manually bring
up an interface I can say hey by the way
why does this keep happening that's not
something that supported today we're
definitely a great feature request and
something that could be linked into
trolling your own custom exception
fantastic thanks guys thank you very
much yeah hello I just want to know
about custom exceptions can I put some
custom fields like user ID or something
and filter by Z i'm not sure i got the
question ok so can you put custom
identifiers with your crash so can you
send user ids year so um we don't have
this at the moment it's one of our top
requests so we're definitely going to be
working on it the problem with this
feature is that it has some implications
on privacy of course so we want to make
sure that we do it the right way in a
way that protects end user privacy but
we're aware of this request and you know
we're working on it as a priority ok
thanks thank you thank you hi hi um our
app uses the camera and it's always been
hard to test multiple devices will racks
like the lab offers when we have like
this proprietary technology that has to
to take frames and understand what
they're filming you have any suggestions
how we can test something like that sure
so one way to test scenarios like these
is to mock the input to the camera and
then do the processing so that's kind of
if you do the instrumentation testing
that's one way to do it and then the
thing is like you can still use the
cameras these are actual phone so you
can still access the devices the fact is
we tape the back of the camera because
we don't want like any privacy concerns
from people looking at other peoples
apps at the same time so that's what we
do but you can still get like a set of
frames that you can do any processing
for you can like do the actual capturing
of the screen and then mark the expected
response and do the processing
afterwards and that is one of the big
advantages of using the physical devices
that test lab has to offer versus using
devices that sounds like a good idea
thanks but if if I want to test the
output of the camera itself so there's
no possibility today on the lab right
yeah but the idea is like the camera
itself is you really it's it's depending
on the manufacturer like you should
expect yeah you should expect a video at
the end and your app is will perform as
well as it will be able to process that
video right so you can still make sure
that the camera launches it fires up it
records something and then separate the
video processing from that basically
like in testing in general you try to
break down every part like you don't
want to put as much dependencies that so
many dependencies in your testing you
want to break it down as much as
possible and that's not one way to do it
is basically break them down that's like
recording versus processing thanks thank
you I had two questions for the
gentleman from amex how big was your
test suite how long does it take for you
to run it during a PR value 5 plus a
busy so we I mean it's grown over time
we're well over a thousand tests now
instrumentation tests and we break them
up and we shard them meaning we run we
don't run them in one continuous single
invocation we run them in multiple
invocations to CTL so it will depend on
exactly how you run them like if you
divide them up and how you do that it
depended it'll depend also on the
queuing time on CTL but and I would say
that if you have a hung in a typical PL
verify process how long does it take ah
we could seep 20 to 30 minutes which
usually we also do code review so the
code review usually takes longer than
that but there's a lot of factors and
did you think about any cross platform
solutions are you using this for
cross-platform for both iOS and Android
are you just using pure Android just for
Android so has so this is a question for
the rest of the panel do we have
successful
examples of folks who've done it for
cross-platform basically for both iOS as
well as ever so yeah definitely firebase
is a cross-platform product it works
across Android and iOS but for now
Firebrace test lab for android is still
Android only and we're still evaluating
the iOS support when you said firebase
was cross-platform it was everything
else yeah exactly except for test lab
yeah but and if you have do you have
plans for doing it doing that cross
pendant yeah that's a great question so
it took us like some significant effort
to be able to bring this infrastructure
up and running so we're still evaluating
the iOS offering so just stay tuned for
updates but yeah nothing to announce for
now thank you thank you thank you I we
use appium to drive tests is that
supported in test lab or and if not what
is supported yeah a PM is not supported
on test labs right now we support the
Android instrumentation testing
frameworks espresso UI Automator 2.0 and
robot iam and right now with the
espresso test recorder like yeah go
ahead and give it a try and start
hacking with espresso okay thank you
thank you hello I have a question about
the pre-release testing our apt has a
login screen when you can't get past it
without logging in and our issue that
we've had with testing currently on the
console if you just get a login screen
it presses around a little bit and then
finishes the testing is there any plans
to give like simple login information
yeah so one of the gifts that I am a
demonstrated was handling a login screen
for Google+ or google any Google account
really and so that's already supported
today if you use a Google login flow in
your application and we are working on
other login flows but today the real
value is if you don't have a login are
you have a Google login with your
application all right thank you thank
you very much I have a question about
scalability for test labs specifically
two dimensions so our app is quite
popular in
yeah and we've seen some pretty unique
devices and OS versions on it and so if
that device is not in test labs how
would we request that and to since the
announcement today I assume a lot of
developers are going to be trying to
trying it out and so how do you foresee
scaling it to Google scale as all these
developers want to run their tests
across all of the devices in your test
lab that's a great question i think like
what test lab is trying to help you with
is this exact two points that you
mentioned it's something like we're
taking care of the infrastructure so
that you don't have to and we're taking
care of getting all the devices that you
need so that so that you don't have to
and it's growing with Google scale so
we're building our infrastructure right
now with Google scale like you should
expect to get started and run it right
now and in terms of devices diversity
this is like our top priority where are
we just adding more devices now so just
keep looking hopefully that devices that
are popular in kenya will be available
soon and then you yeah you'll get more
and more value over time well thanks a
lot guys thank you hi everyone I have a
question director to one of the person
Michael who works at amex so how do you
guys just a feature called remote check
deposit like anything that is a remote
check deposit anything that is related
to the camera taking a picture yeah we
haven't we haven't done any camera
testing so the app that we use on cloud
test lab has no camera features in it so
we have a good character it isn't
supported you're using espresso right
because the third party you mean like
you can't deposit a check in the test
mm-hmm yeah so so I think as I mentioned
so one way to do it is break it down
into two parts so you want to make sure
that the camera fires that's one test
you need to account for and then the
other part is you need to make sure
that's when it gets an image it's able
to process it right so yeah this is kind
of that recommended approach to do it
thank you Thanks how do we get those
screenshots in
the developer console are those going to
be kind of automatic or do we need to
put in some test code that tells you
where to take the screenshots yeah so
today the way it works is you just
upload your apk to the Play Developer
console and the robo that i'ma described
will interact with the app for about
five minutes and there will be screen
shots taken about every second and that
the robot is interacting we're adjusting
it to be able to make sure we capture
the biggest if in screen differences so
its most valuable to you I'm
investigating other ways we can be able
to enhance that we're showing you to
state the app is in but yeah you should
be able to get it today and you
shouldn't have to do any work really and
you just need to upload your apk and the
report is generated for free so yeah
courage you start using send us feedback
thanks one thing to add to what Fergus
mentioned as well is if you're using it
to run your instrumentation tests if
you're doing espresso then we have a
library that's available in our
documentation that you can use and as
you mentioned like you have to take
screenshots at the locations you want
using that library yep um so how does
firebase analytics compared to Google
Analytics I think that that's something
they said there's another session on the
analytic side of things and maybe that
would be the right forum for that
question unfortunately word the session
actually was a CPM but I can connect you
with a PM for ya um so I work for a
client that's very concerned about
confidentiality so when you do capture
the screenshots in the crash reporting
do you store that like do you guys store
that or so there's no screenshots
captured in crash reporting right so it
never touches your end user ok the
screenshots are in the pre-release
report and test lab and these are
usually dummy accounts ok thank you sure
hi I know um phys lab is a developer
oriented platform what is the role of a
QE or a tester in all this environment
yes so I think that's one of the things
you see is they think at QA teams I
spent a lot of time actually setting up
the devices and like configuring the
cables which is an inefficient use of
their time and a lot of
whereas now they can be able to go and
run all the tests and be able to work on
the automation of the test and be able
to go through the results and be able to
actually then generate the reports and
the bows of water shoes are happening so
it's more about sort of enhancing they
add QA teams ability to be able to make
a dress that seemed aware of the issues
and that are being uncovered yeah thank
you i'm a-doin yeah sure so yeah for the
for the QA team question so yeah
basically as Fergus mentioned like the
QA team can build your infrastructure
and then another use case that is great
here for the QA team as well is
previously from our research what we
notice is that people will have a device
closet and before releasing a new
version of the app you just grab a phone
from the closet run a certain scenario
you put it back and grab another phone
so right now with the espresso test
recorder is exactly what we want to make
it easier for you you just record your
all your script once and then run it in
the cloud so you ensure that your app
performs on all of these devices with
just one trial of your app yeah thank
you two questions first what is the
average crash rate of the most popular
popular application second quality is
more than crash and features and
performance such as IPS and something
like that to have an implant to to test
this and improve the performance yeah
performance testing is definitely
something where we've heard so many like
ideas and feedback about from developers
so it's something we we will probably
start thinking about so yeah stay tuned
for that the first question is what is
average yeah so in terms of the previous
question about the confidentiality of
app developers and that is something
that we definitely respect so we
wouldn't be able to tell you which apps
are the classiest ones unfortunately um
sorry with that oh it was a
publishers standard or something for a
bad patch red or good credit yeah
definitely something that we could
investigate is being able to show you
how you compare with your peers in a way
where it is anonymized for your the rest
of the group thanks to that feedback I
think we have time for one last question
so maybe the person behind you can do
say so do you have a way to test the
look and feel of the application rather
than like the functionality yes so as
part of the pre-launch report we show
you the screenshots and today you
actually I can look through the
screenshots and bail to identify the
issues yourself but definitely things
that we are investigating is
accessibility and other identification
of the issues that are appearing on
those screens yeah ok and then so the
app has to be hosted in firebase for it
to be like tested are no separate I
don't say any Android app can work yeah
got it you can choose to just use one
firebase offering got it yeah yeah thank
you so I think we're out of time now but
thanks everyone for joining and
encourage you to use a quality goals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
