authentication in addition to logging in
with email and password or identity
providers like Facebook and Google a
phone number is validated using a
one-time SMS message and firebase
provides all of the infrastructure to
handle this I'm Laurence Moroney and in
this fire cast I'll show you how this
works typically when using firebase off
you'll provide a number of sign-in
methods such as signing up or signing in
with Google Facebook or email well now
there's a new option as you can see here
sign-in with phone to be able to do this
you'll first need to enter your phone
number which you can do from a standard
dialog when doing it from the web you'll
also be able to validate this with a
recapture once you have a valid phone
number you can verify it
firebase will send an SMS to your device
containing a code you simply enter this
code and it will be verified with
firebase if it's a correct code you'll
be good to go otherwise you'll have to
re-enter or we send once a user is
signed up with phone off you'll also see
them in the firebase console it's a
pretty simple lightweight process it's
also easy to build it using the
open-source firebase UI libraries
there's a link to them in the
description below also check out the
firebase developer site for more
information on building 4 firebase off
and don't forget to subscribe to the
firebase channel on YouTube for more
videos including more on how to use
phone off on iOS Android and the web
I'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
