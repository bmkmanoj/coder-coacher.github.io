eyes I can't fully see hello everybody
and welcome to ask firebase the show
where we answer your questions about
firebase I'm Laurence Moroney a
developer advocate here at Google and we
couldn't think about any interesting
facts about me so we're just going to
get straight on to the show first of all
before we get to your questions I just
want an announcement to make and that's
we have this upcoming summit in Berlin
called a firebase summit on November 7th
and have lots of great stuff there lots
of great announcements watch this link
for more details this just in a question
our first question is from Jason on
Stack Overflow it's a really good one
and the question is what's the
difference between firebase cloud
messaging and Google Cloud messaging
well here's the answer firebase cloud
messaging is really the new version of
Google Cloud messaging it's actually
inherited all of the infrastructure from
Google Cloud messaging it inherited a
lot of the api's and a lot of the
features and what we've been doing is
we're moving forward with firebase cloud
messaging so we've provided this
handy-dandy guide that will allow you to
migrate any existing Google Cloud
messaging apps over to firebase cloud
messaging
there's a lot of great stuff in firebase
cloud messaging and really looking
forward to what you're gonna build with
firebase cloud messaging and of course
firebase notifications so thanks for
that great question so let's take a look
at the next question so on the ask for
our base hashtag on Twitter
folks like Ellie Koenig and Nino russ
rodriguez have asked this really
interesting question when will we be
able to do fcm or FN on the web with
JavaScript libraries well
don't tell them I told you but it's
coming real soon keep your eye on this
channel great question and for the next
question
Gustavo boson on Twitter has asked the
question is there any way to do an a/b
test with notifications well that's a
really great question and the answer is
yes and no my recommendation to do a/b
testing with firebase is not to use
notifications to do it but to use remote
config to do it now remote configures a
technology and firebase that allows you
to store variables on the server-side
and the contents of these variables can
be driven off of analytics or you can
just change them manually and the neat
thing about this is that if you're
having data stored server side in these
variables then you can use them to
change the behavior of your application
on the client side and use this to do
a/b testing it's a perfect technology
for that take a look at it it's really
cool and some details of the links here
and thanks for the great question
Gustavo
next question Gary on Twitter has asked
is it possible to integrate fcm with AWS
and you know it's a really great
question and how I would typically do
FCM type applications and what I
recommend everybody does is you really
need to build an app server for FCM you
can build an app server in any
technology that you like I personally
like to build my app servers in PHP and
there's no reason why you couldn't run
these app servers on AWS yourself so in
that way you could integrate FCN with
AWS by running your app server on there
and what your app server does generally
is it collects registration IDs from
your client applications and then based
on how you want to do messaging between
your clients it does a post I just use a
curl to do a post to the FCM api's and
then the messages will get dispatched by
FCM to your clients on your behalf it's
pretty straightforward pretty easy to do
and it's really neat that it can run on
just about any web server and if you
want to learn more about how to build an
app server for FCM just take a look at
the documentation here so thanks for the
great question Gary and I look forward
to seeing what you build with FCM
oh this is an interesting one next
question what Berkman's and twitter has
asked this question
does actually am work on all browsers or
does it only work on Chrome well like
the earlier answer keep watching
we've got some great news coming very
very soon for you thanks for the
question Ward so a question that we've
had from lots and lots of people is how
do I do
device to device notifications using
firebase cloud messaging
well there are a number of ways you can
do this but the best way I believe is to
build an application server to use fcm
on your behalf and the idea is that your
application can then get a registration
ID from firebase it will post this to
your application server so your
application server knows the firebase
registration IDs the messaging
registration IDs for all of your client
applications that are connecting to it
and then if you want to send a message
from device a to device B you would send
a message to your server saying please
send this message to this registration
ID and then your application server
would post to the FCM api's and we're
just post to say send this message to
this device and you would end up having
the effect of sending a message from
device a to device B firebase Cloud
messaging does support upstream messages
so you can do this type of thing take a
look at it we got some great
documentation on this here if you have
any follow-up questions or any further
questions about this we'd love to
address them in a future show so thanks
for all these wonderful questions and if
you have any more don't forget to reach
out on social media using the ask for
our base hashtag I've put a whole bunch
of links in the description below for
some of the stuff that we spoke about in
this show don't forget to hit that
subscribe button because we've got new
content coming on the channel all the
time thanks again
