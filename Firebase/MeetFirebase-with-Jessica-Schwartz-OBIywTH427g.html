where you get to meet the Googlers that
make firebase hack my name is Doug
Stephenson and on the show with me today
is Jessica Szohr Jessica thanks for
being on the show
now what do you do with the firebase
team I am a program manager I split my
time between the UX team which is
between San Francisco and New York and
overall firebase operations and
communications which is about 600 people
okay so it sounds like you travel a bit
and you have a fairly like diverse team
of people to work oh yes it's wonderful
I get to work with basically everyone in
firebase yeah so I'm curious to know
where are you from I'm from
Mechanicsburg Pennsylvania okay how did
that city get its name
Mechanicsburg sounds very significant it
is apparently like in the early 1800s
there was a significant population which
could have been a dozen people who were
mechanics for Conestoga wagons
mechanicsburg was a bit of a
transportation hub in its heyday that's
right yeah that's where all they came
and we even drop a wrench on New Year's
Eve to commemorate I'm not talking about
like we drop like a small wrench it's
like some Boy Scouts built this giant
wrench and they lower in the town square
Oh so you say there's all kinds of
interesting things what was life like in
central Pennsylvania it's I I understand
you've lived on a rather large plot of
land yes I grew up on about 70 acres and
I served called the middle of nowhere
certainly between Pittsburgh and
Philadelphia there's not that much going
on I'm very close with my sister so we
spent a lot of our childhood just like
running around the forest in the fields
and start flexing our imaginations that
we were also like super academic so
we're always also playing school my MA
she ah sees like vintage school desks
they reply from like the early 1900s
feet attached to it was a Sita and like
the the flip-top desk and that like my
parents like installed chalkboards
we were very into playing school and my
sister's older than me so she was always
a teacher and I was always a student
when we weren't doing that we were
running around like it's sounding like
little magazines in the neighborhood and
charging our neighbors we're putting on
like little television shows what the
neighbors it would
sort of like kids version of SNL we were
just always like making things and
whether it was magazines or shows or
lesson plans and always doing that yeah
that I mean like we was in the middle of
nowhere so what we gonna do right yeah
yeah I know we became very creative
because of that which is great actually
you were also involved in something
called Technology Student Association it
doesn't exist here in California but it
is kind of like a tech oriented science
fair for high schoolers and middle
schoolers that it's very
interdisciplinary and it runs the gamut
from like robotics to manufacturing
challenges to public speakings and serve
the mission of TSA was to inspire
students to be more tech literate I
participated in at CERN middle school
and high school and loved it so you had
these regional state and national
competitions which were a blast because
you got to meet kids from all over who
are interested in these same like things
and they would geek out oh yeah you whip
it I wish I had that I didn't have
enough geeking out as a child so I
understand it you have a closet full of
trophies from this that's true it is
yeah that my parents home yes there are
these like ridiculous photos of me like
holding is like my little arms like
holding this trophy is just like an
armful of them so I was very competitive
at some point you left and you went to
college right so I'm kind of curious
what did you what did you study what was
your area of expertise the technical
name for manager was growth and
structure of cities and structures these
try telling your parents that when you
come home for Thanksgiving
I like more casually or other places it
would probably called urban studies but
essentially it's what I've come to
appreciate it's just a specialized field
of design so specifically you're looking
at like how and where people live
because it could rain certain like
talking about like a rural population in
the geography there to like the city of
San Francisco it's really like the
intersection of architecture and
political science and economics and
anthropology I was very specifically
interested in what it means to call
place home and how do you have a
thriving community know heard of like
urban planning right yeah and Google was
involved in that to some degree as well
but I never really heard of some of the
your aspect of it I think Thanks it's
very cool well so now I'm kind of
curious how did you end up at Google
given your
occasional background sure so the first
thing I started on at Google was Adwords
and specifically I was working with
small businesses so how that ends up
tying back to like my Urban Studies
degree is like ultimately I went to a
liberal arts college and one of the like
awesome things that you learned at a
liberal arts school is that you're very
very focused on communication personally
that means something to me because on
both sides of my family I come from like
a long line of small business owners but
having like that liberal arts education
the framework for actually being able to
be a strong writer and those types of
things that's that serves me to this day
so you went to college he majored in
urban studies but what college did you
go to
I went to Bryn Mawr College which is a
liberal arts college and also in all
women's college that's outside of
Philadelphia
what's what's unique about Bryn Mawr
well Bryn Mawr being in all women's
college is very unique in that there's
only about 40 women's colleges left in
the u.s. they used to be over 200 the
type of experience that you get there is
very different in particular all of the
people who you see around you in
leadership positions or women and that's
really empowering I volunteer with Ben
where I go back several times a year and
talking with the current students and
actually sharing with them my experience
of being a woman in tech it's really
lovely to be able to inspire them and to
also hear about how they don't think
it's nearly as daunting as I did and
when you're going to a women's college
it's really often that you also get this
like network of women who are these
leadership positions that you have
immediate access to and so at Google I
really try to recreate that by working
like with women colleagues you don't
think they should go in leadership
positions and encouraging them to just
because that's something that I'm really
used to so how did you end up then on
the firebase team because it sounds like
you were with AdWords and now you're
with firebase oh that seems also like an
unusual yes so I stayed in the Ann Arbor
office for a couple years and Ann I did
a stint in Beijing doing project
management for our customers in China
live them I did yeah for three months
yeah which was awesome China is a very
different environment obviously for
Google specifically expired base it's
definitely super different so then I
moved out to California and after being
more immersed in the tech culture I felt
really guilty for being a woman in text
we didn't really have technical skills
I took a technical sabbatical and I did
in all women's coding boot camp in San
Francisco it was a very back-end
focus program so we were primarily doing
Python so one of the things that was
great about it is that every week we
want to visit a different tech company
mostly different startups and I wasn't
in the market for a job I was intending
to return to Google but serendipitously
one of the companies we visited was
firebase before we before the equity
before we acquired them so it was funny
of the day that I started I didn't like
personally know anyone at that point but
we were like he looks very familiar
like that's because I visited your old
office and they were very excited that I
had that context at the end of the
coding bootcamp
I decided that I really wasn't
necessarily super keen on like going and
doing software engineering full-time but
it really cemented the fact that I
really wanted to be focused on products
that's really what I loved about working
on Adwords and Google search and Google
Drive and all those things I've been
doing in the four and a half years since
then so I decided to make the switch to
being on the engineering side of Google
and switching to be a program manager
okay so maybe the guests on the show and
those of you watch at home know this a
lot of the people who sit in the seat
that you're sitting in right now would
like to talk about travel and I
understand you have a fair amount of
experience with travel so you had a
milestone recently I did last March I
hit my seventh continent seven
continents yes Antarctica so what's
going on in Antarctica what do you do
there
what do you do in Antarctica mostly
you're looking at stuff specifically
you're looking at icebergs which it's
funny because when you see pictures of
icebergs like you think of them as
something that's static but the truth is
is they move a lot um yeah they move a
ton you ought to be I did kayaking when
I was on the trip which was amazing
because you get to be a lot closer but
the distance that you should stay from
an iceberg is like a multiply what's on
the top by like eight to ten because if
it turns which I saw an iceberg turn it
will like knock you over they also
causes giant waves like you don't get
that from a picture the other thing
that's cool about the icebergs is
they're it's like every shade of blue
like every shade of blue and so you're
sort of just floating in like world's
biggest sculpture garden we passed one
on the way down that it looked like a
Cathedral it was it had these like
beautiful almost windows so it's I was
very interested by the icebergs clearly
the other thing that you're looking at
our animals mostly seals
penguins and whales I've never been like
super into animals but by the end of it
it was really fun seeing
like all the personalities play out like
penguins will like come up like right to
you because they treat you and interpret
you to be a giant penguin solo kind of
like wacky with their lowlife wings a
little violence no they and they also
like pack at your shoes and they're just
they're very very curious like once one
lifetime experience highly recommend it
yeah I'm also curious what do you do in
your spare time what did i do Meister
yeah I'm I spend most of my spare time
doing art and that takes a variety of
forms I'll tell you about one projects I
actually started on the way to
Antarctica because like I was saying you
can't do much so I start doing iPad
paintings which I never really liked the
idea that much of doing like art on a
computer despite like working intact in
some ways I like very much so a lot I
like I like my paint or like my
watercolor I like brushes and exactly
but when you're stuck on like a boat and
like you're literally like moving two
feet forward and two feet back on your
bed like and that's going on 40 days
you've got like audiobooks and then I
started doing these I pad paintings
they're very abstract and it was kind of
a strange experience because I was sort
of living in this like vacuum since then
I only do them on airplane so when I'm
traveling for work I'm just doing these
abstraction or abstract paintings on my
iPad but it's interesting because
normally there's some sort of like
residues that like comes out like
mentally from like a color I've been
looking at so they're often it's
interesting I can like look through my
portfolio and see which ones I did in
different seasons sometimes I'll like
put up like a movie while I'm watching
it and it comes out that like I ended up
painting the palette of a movie we have
a website for this don't you I do yeah
it just Schwartz dr. Schwartz coms yeah
yeah well thanks Jess for being on the
show it's great chatting with you for
everyone at home be sure to go to Jess's
