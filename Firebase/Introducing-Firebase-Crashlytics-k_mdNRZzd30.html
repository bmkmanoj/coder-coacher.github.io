of even the best apps buggy apps make
your users unhappy and they might
uninstall your app leave a bad App Store
review or write negative social media
apps can generate a lot of different
crashes and manually tracking them is
time-consuming even if you're able to
collect all this data it's difficult to
figure out which crashes to troubleshoot
and fix first
firebase crashlytics helps by
automatically collecting analyzing and
organizing your crash reports it also
helps you understand which issues are
most important so you can prioritize
those first and keep your users happy it
combines a real-time dashboard and
alerts to keep you aware of your newest
issues and any sudden changes in
stability the dashboard shows crashes
ranked by overall impact on your users
giving you the information you need at a
glance crashes are intelligently grouped
across versions of your app with
individual stack traces easily explored
in the dashboard sometimes you might
hear about crashes from users that you
can't reproduce with the help of logs
and key value pairs and crashlytics you
can add some context to each stack trace
and see what your app was doing before
the crash when the crash is reported
this extra information is sent to
crashlytics becomes visible in the
dashboard and gives you the context you
need to help pinpoint the exact cause of
the crash non fatal errors can be
reported in the dashboard too so when
your code fails but doesn't crash your
app you can still get full reports in
the dashboard if your app is built with
the NDK on Android crashlytics will
capture native stack traces as well
crashlytics is easy to integrate with
zero lines of code required on android
with iOS just use cocoapods for simple
integration you can count on crashlytics
to help stay on top of the stability of
your app spend less time troubleshooting
issues and more time doing what you love
with crashlytics and to learn more and
