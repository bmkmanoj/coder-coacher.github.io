today because I can finally share with
you what we've been up to at firebase
because a day more than ever
firebase has the tools you need to build
a successful app I'm also excited
because I kind of came to i/o this year
the long way around see I actually left
a great job at Google four years ago I
wanted to dive into this app development
thing and change the world with a small
startup this small startup had a unique
vision we thought that we could empower
developers by letting them focus on the
user experience they wanted to create
and not the back end that needed to
support that and that startup of course
was parce so before I rejoined Google
and teamed up with the firebase team
last year I spent three years in the
parse team I'm most commonly known there
as the lead developer for parse push and
also the type of person who was called
in when there was reliability or
scalability issues that tended to hit
only the largest customers I worked a
lot between the back-end developers and
the operations team and so I've been
around the block a while and have done a
number of backend services now to be a
little bit more somber for a second as a
former parse team member hearing about
that shutdown hurt me physically and to
anybody who is a parse customer in this
room I want to express my sincerest
apologies nobody in parse nor firebase
is happy with what's happening here
today we are not happy with the pain
you've gone through and to my former
teammates and parse I want to express
how proud I am that they have
responsibly handled this tragic event
because firebase gave a year notice that
they're doing a shutdown they gave an
open source implementation of their
back-end and they have dedicated
themselves to spend the next year
helping customers migrate and I think we
should all say thank you
for setting the bar for responsibility
so the advice I'm going to give today is
generic you don't have to have been a
parse customer to benefit from it but
I've decided to lay out the content to
help people who are like me coming from
a parse back-end understand all of the
new features that are available in
firebase we're going to start today by
looking at how firebase fits in the
Google ecosystem and why firebase can
help you even if you already have a
back-end next we're going to look at the
set of proper products within firebase
that can help cover the feature gap
between parse comm and parse server then
we're going to cover some novel features
unique to firebase that have no parcel
parse alternative and finally dig deep
into the internals of how you build your
application to see how firebase is
approach gives you some novel new tools
so we welcome you to Google no matter
where you are no matter what you might
already be running your application on
even if it's parse server because of
Google you can build just about anything
you know when we look at it backend
service we typically compare it to one
of four altitudes at the very bottom we
have an infrastructure as a service
these give us the raw building blocks
that we can use to build any back-end as
long as we have the time and the
expertise in Google this traditionally
means Google compute engine where you
have access to raw virtual machines or
Google container engine where you can
scale up and down docker instances if
you'd like you can go up the stack you
can trade off some of the operational
responsibilities by using a platform as
a service like Google App Engine or the
up and coming Google cloud functions
these types of products let you
continue developing back-end code while
not needing to worry about which servers
your back-end runs on now just like you
handed off some of the operational
responsibilities to build a platform as
a service you can go the next layer up
and use a back-end as a service like
firebase to handoff some of the
developmental responsibilities because a
back-end is a service provide a suite of
integrated features that allow you to
spend most or even all of your time
focus on the client code and we're not
going to spend time today covering the
last level software as a service but I
list it here today to remind you that
Google is fairly unique because we have
powerful and successful products at all
layers of the stack which means when you
choose to develop with Google you are
not stuck at only one altitude you can
branch out imagine if you have a
back-end today that's written on Google
compute engine odds are if you are
distributing files you're using Google
Cloud storage to do so now traditionally
if you wanted to give some of those
users access to files you'd have to
create your own API server to control
who has access to which files but
starting today you can use firebase
storage but back in as a service layer
on top of the infrastructure of Google
Cloud storage this will let you use a
simple rules file to describe for your
entire bucket who should have access and
it saves you the need of needing to
manage and scale a service between your
storage and your users similarly you'll
also be able to go down the stack today
I'm announcing that the upcoming Google
cloud functions will fully integrate
with firebase and you'll be able to
react to change that happen in the
firebase ecosystem as well so this means
that if you already have a back-end
that's fine and if it's at a different
altitude from firebase that's also fine
if you've migrated from parse calm to
parse server you've gone from a back
into the service to an infrastructure or
platform as a service and if that's the
right choice for your team that I
encourage you to stick with it because
firebase can help you no matter what
your existing solution is today almost
about what first we have a series of
features that cover the product gaps
between parse comm and parse server
these are parse crash reporting parse
analytics parse hosting and parse config
firebase has products in all of these
areas so let's take a quick look at how
you can recover these product areas and
do more than you ever could before first
and foremost you should check out
firebase analytics this is the crown
jewel of the new firebase product line
and it's a great place to start because
you don't actually need to add any code
to start using it and there's no charge
no matter how many API requests you send
if you have complex analysis needs
firebase analytics will integrate with
Google bigquery which will let you slice
and dice your data as you see fit and
analytics sets the stage for many other
integrations with firebase products so
this is our new analytics dashboard as
you'll see the most important feature is
right up at the top how many people are
using your application we've sliced that
down into the daily weekly and monthly
active users in your app so you can
understand the depth of engagement next
you can scroll down and see retention
cohorts this is a fancy word for do your
users keep using your app or they get
bored with it retention cohorts lines up
your user base based on which week they
started using your app so you can look
vertically down the line and see when
did people stop using my app now you'll
also notice that this
dashboard is showing results for users
aged 25 to 34 now this application
wasn't actually providing that
information to firebase because with
firebase you automatically get powerful
information without adding any code you
understand where your new users are
coming from how many of them are coming
back how long they're using your app
when they do and even demographic
information like their gender age
country and interests all in a free
product and if you would like you can
add extra information for analytics as
well you can describe custom attributes
about your users or provide up to 500
custom types of events that you would
like to send and you can use this
information to dive deeper into your
groups but if you need to compose that
you can do so in audiences audiences let
you describe a collection of users who
meet certain characteristics and who
have seen certain events you can use
that audience to dive deep into a
demographic in your app and understand
how they use it or you can also use
audiences to re-engage customers in your
application using firebase notifications
or remote config and like I said you
don't need to add any code to use
firebase analytics it's part of the core
SDK but if you'd like to add additional
properties you can say set user property
string or you can log additional events
with log event with name parameters it's
that easy so if you are like me you
occasionally write in perfect software
and one of the biggest problems I always
face is tracking down what went wrong in
the field because the first time you get
a bug report it's hard to translate what
your users describing to an actual crash
zone and the second time you get a bug
report you need to triage is this a new
issue or should I save my
sell the time and not debug this because
it's already known when you get the
third crash report if it seems familiar
eenie you need to figure out whether or
not this is a known issue that's already
been fixed or whether that bug has
regressed and crash reporting can help
you solve all three of these important
problems so in the crash reporting
dashboard you can see at a glance how
many crashes are happening in your
application and there's three important
metrics here you can see the raw numbers
of errors that we're managing
but we've grouped them together into
clusters clusters are errors with
similar stack traces and likely have the
same root cause this can greatly help
you triage and dive into the individual
reports that you see you can also triage
by how many users are impacted by these
crashes now when we scroll down into
clusters you can see that we have
detailed information we see the stack
trace the latest version that this app
is crashed for but you can also dive
into every single error that was
reported and these reports have detailed
information you can understand what
device was running this app you can
understand whether that device was
jailbroken you can understand how much
memory was available in the app or what
country the app was in in case you're
debugging maybe network issues you can
understand whether it's on Wi-Fi or
cellular and one great feature for
Android is that you can report non-fatal
errors as well so you don't have to wait
for a crash to start improving your your
stability of your app so crash reporting
also comes without code by default it's
part of the core SDK on Android and in
iOS you just have to add the crash
reporting pod however you can make your
life easier if you'd like to add a
little bit of code first firebase crash
log will add a log line that only shows
up in a crash report it doesn't show up
in logcat if you want it to show up in
both places you can do that with
vase crash log cats and to report a non
fatal error
firebase crash dot report now if you
have an existing back-end odds are you
already have a server that is able to
host web content I still recommend you
check out a dedicated hosting service
because it can make your life much
easier with the firebase hosting product
you can use a simple command line tool
which is firebase deploy you deploy an
entire copy of your static website if
you screwed up and there's an issue you
can safely get back to a well-known
version using firebase rollback but you
can deploy with more confidence because
the firebase command line tool lets you
host your website on the same or locally
with the same software that we use in
our infrastructure and firebase hosting
is fast because it automatically
integrates with content delivery
networks to make sure your website is
delivered quickly across the globe and
it's secure we are as a cell first we
manage all of the certificates that you
need to handle to serve secure content
you just give us files and we give you a
fast secure Network firebase hosting is
so easy to use I actually struggled to
come up with the follow up slide here so
instead I decided to give an
announcement starting today firebase
hosting supports custom domains
absolutely free
now our final product gap between parse
comm and parse server was parse config
and firebase remote config is such a
powerful product that I'm really happy
to share it with you today because
sometimes you need dynamic content in
your application but the database isn't
really the right place to put it far B's
remote config lets you store dynamic
content just like parse config did
except you have the ability to target
what you are sending according to the
demographics of your user you can send
different configs to different people so
imagine you've written a newspaper app
newspapers of old had headlines and so
we're going to add one into our
application
well that headline is meant to drive
engagement and we'll do so with
relevance with firebase remote config
you can target national breaking news to
users who are in a particular country if
you have multiple headlines you can do a
tested rollout and use % rollout to do a
B testing to see whether or not the new
headline is driving the engagement you
expect if you're a multilingual product
you can add translations your remote
config by providing a different config
based on the language of the device that
is accessing it and if you have
particular interest groups within your
newspaper those will probably be in
analytics you'll probably have an
audience for people who love
snowboarding or who love Google so you
can post all of your i/o news headlines
to people who are in the Google lovers
audience and firebase analytics and
using remote config is very easy there's
three things you do need to do to get
started first you want to provide
offline defaults these will be used
either before your initial request or
any time the cache value is too old to
be usable next
you can tell remote can take to fetch or
fetch with expiration duration and this
will make sure you get a fresh
be remote config if it has expired now
finally once remote config has accessed
the newest copy it doesn't automatically
make it available because it would be
pretty bad if u started configuring your
app with one set of config file use and
then continued without knowing there was
an update in between the line activate
fetched helps you coordinate copies of
remote config with how your application
flows once you have the latest copy
remote config you can use that same
object just like you would a dictionary
use brackets and tax and access any
property by name and you'll get a
wrapper object back where you can get
strings ants fools whatever you'd like
so these features helped us gain parody
from parse server back to what we used
to have in parse comm now before we go
on to the things that are the core of
your app where you might need to choose
between one back-end or another I want
to give a brief shout out to some very
novel features that are unique to
firebase first we have dynamic links
dynamic links are like URLs for your
application they can share the location
of content deep within your app they
work even for users who don't have the
app installed yet Shazam has been
investing in diamond dynamic links
recently by partnering with coca-cola to
print them on their bottle so you can
get a warm welcome for users who want to
try out the application now in case you
are not fortunate enough to be
partnering with coca-cola we have
another product for you with firebase
invites your users can send these
dynamic links to their friends
regardless of whether or not they're
using your app and then you can improve
organic growth in your application with
app indexing app indexing allows the
google search engine to crawl the
dynamic links in your app and provide
deep links into your apps content in
Google search results
now since like I said I am fallible and
many of you are probably as well we have
fire based test lab for Android this
will let you automate your app on many
physical devices owned by Google so you
can get much broader test coverage
without having to buy every Android
device that comes out you can increase
paid growth in your application by using
the new integrations with Google AdWords
so that once you've identified a group
in firebase analytics that is more
likely to engage in your application you
can target your ads to that demographic
and you can earn money in your
application by using Google AdMob which
will host advertisements in your
application so now the meat of the talk
the more the remaining products are more
central to the way that you build an
application notifications authentication
and data so they deserve a deeper look
first and foremost as I said
notifications have a special place in my
heart and firebase has two products in
this sort of area Google Cloud messaging
is now firebase cloud messaging this is
the product that provides a low level
service for sending content directly to
an app for pushing data to it it is
still freely available accessible from
the same api's and is the platform that
other providers like parse or urban
airship already use a day to reach your
devices for their push platforms nothing
in firebase Cloud messaging requires you
to use other firebase services on top of
that we've built firebase notifications
this is the set of products that will
help you use the information you've
gained from firebase to more accurately
target your users and to create
notifications for those users so let's
look at the new dashboard obviously an
etiquette notification composer
should let you type in a notification
you can also schedule that notification
to be sent now or later you can schedule
it either to be now an exact time in the
future or a time relative to the user's
device if you have that news application
you can schedule the push to be sent
every morning at 8:30 at the users time
zone but the real power of firebase
notifications comes from its targeting
framework with firebase notifications
you can use all of that rich knowledge
you've learned in firebase analytics to
target your users however you'd like you
can target your users with the
audience's you've created if you're more
of a parse push to channel person then I
recommend checking out topics there's a
same general concept you up you
subscribe to a topic and then you'll
receive pushes sent to that topic the
main difference between push to channel
and using topics is that topics is about
50 times faster and then finally if
you're testing an individual device you
can use this console to target just your
device so that you can be confident you
haven't just sent hello world to your
entire user base I have seen that happen
actually it's not the greatest page to
get also firebase notifications
integrates with firebase analytics in
both directions you can use analytics to
decide who you want to engage and you
can use analytics to measure whether or
not you successfully engage the audience
we automatically measure how many pushes
were sent and how many were opened but
we will also be able to measure a
conversion event if you apply one this
you know in this example we have asked
the users to look at a new talk our goal
here is that they will star that session
that they will add the talk to their
favorites and if you do so it will show
up in our analytics funnel
to understand more about firebase
notifications and firebase cloud
messaging
check out these two talks we have GCM is
now fcm which covers that foundational
technology and on top of it we have
firebase notifications everything you
need to know in 45 minutes now I'm gonna
give a lot of shout outs the different
talks I will post them all in the spaces
afterwards so don't you don't need to go
take pictures of every single slide
firebase off describes who's using your
app something we're very familiar with
but firebase off gives you the ability
connect with all the same authentication
providers you're used to and expect and
more more importantly firebase off
allows you to provide your own back-end
service to control your own
authentication and it will be treated as
a peer to our providers this means with
firebase off it is so powerful that you
can actually implement login where you
log in into firebase using a parse
session token' now for any service if
you have our server which is gonna stay
around that might be a fine strategy if
you are on parse comm I recommend that
you use a migration from the clients
site when someone tries to log in you'll
try to log in against firebase if that
doesn't succeed but does succeed against
parse you now use those credentials that
you still have in your app to create a
new user in firebase and then migrate
the record from parse user over to your
firebase database now firebase sessions
have the same power of par sessions
except we've used cryptography instead
of a database because the session token'
in firebase includes all the things that
you would have had in your PS session
object except it's encoded and signed by
your apps private key this means you can
know for sure that the session is valid
which user it applies to
when it's supposed to expire and any
custom claims you have from your
personal off service rules like this
particular session is from an IOT device
and therefore should have restricted
access these can all be verified
directly on the session token' without
having to make an extra API request for
every call that you make and firebase
off integrates with firebase rules see
in a system like parse every every
object describes its own access control
and as an app administrator this can
lead to uncertainty because you can't
actually audit the access control in
your system unless you read through your
entire app's contents even worse if you
need to update information or security
in your application if you need to give
admins access you would have to do a
full data migration of your entire
application for this to work instead
firebase off and firebase security rules
allow you to describe in one file the
rules that should be applied to entire
systems your entire firebase database or
your entire firebase storage bucket and
you can know with confidence that these
rules are applied everywhere so you can
learn more about identity and
authorization in firebase with three key
talks first there's the key to firebase
security this will go over the languages
that you'll use to secure the real-time
database and firebase storage next to
focus on the actual login experience we
have best practices for a great sign and
experience and one talk I'll pitch a few
times is 0-2 app develop with firebase
this talk combines off the database and
storage to create three apps with live
coding we'll have someone live coding at
all times for iOS Android and web so
nobody is left out in the talk
now next if we there we go if you have
large blobs of data a database is not
the right place to put it so four blobs
of rich data we have firebase storage
the firebase layer on top of the
petabyte scale Google Cloud Storage
products now if you look at our
dashboard the first thing you'll see the
first thing you'll see in our dashboard
is that firebase storage is actually a
standalone product you can look at your
files here you can modify them upload
them and you don't need to wrap your
files inside other objects also you'll
notice that we have a rules tab firebase
files are secured themselves not just
objects that point to them this means
that this data you store is secure even
if the urls leak out and you can delete
files directly there's no more garbage
collection required and there's no more
10 megabyte limit for the files that you
use and firebase storage because
firebase allows you to do download and
opera's upload resuming easily now parse
has not yet decided the migration
strategy for parse calm and parse files
but there is a github Wikipedia page
which I'll post in the spaces after this
talk on the other hand there's very good
news for parse server users because
parse server already has a plug-and-play
adapter for parse files and you can use
Google Cloud storage there's an official
node module and since firebase is built
on Google Cloud Storage it's reverse
compatible with all of those same api's
which means you can use one back-end to
have data that is both a parse file and
firebase storage now they say you save
the best for last so let's cover the
firebase real time database this is the
original fire based product it's why
470,000 developers trust us to do
the firebase database started years ago
by letting go of preconceptions of how a
database needs to work we don't need to
have unstructured data just thrown in
some collection we can lay out our data
to match the way we plan to present it
in our application and we don't need to
restrict ourselves or just some restful
interface rest is nice because it's easy
to think about so firebase does support
rest for the real-time database however
we believe that being a drag to refresh
just doesn't cut it
dragging to refresh is going to be is
old tomorrow as clicking refresh to
check your email is today so while on
other systems you might have to save an
object have a cloud code trigger send a
push notification have that show up in
your device issue a new query update
your UI realize that not everybody has
pushing of occasions enabled so then
also have a pull loop which damages your
battery life and is it very responsive
so add extra UI that allows you to
override it with pulled refresh we
thought we had a better idea at firebase
let's just make the data sink describe
the data you want and it's pushed the
devices in milliseconds so the way we've
done this is by restructuring how we
show data data in a firebase database is
built like a giant share JSON document
or a giant tree and you can point to any
node in that tree and say I care about
this once you've said you like to listen
to a point in the firebase database any
changes to that will be intelligently
streamed down to your device now this
requires to have an unfamiliar structure
but you can see some familiar concepts
show up if we look at the first
top-level keys here their presentations
and presenters now these are the names
of collections which is sound familiar
your first concept in most databases
your table
or your class it's the same way in
firebase so next underneath the
presentations collection will see some
gibberish some numbers more commonly
you'll see random strings this is how
you have a list of objects in firebase
we have a tool called a push ID which
will generate a random string based on
the server's timestamp this allows you
to insert data into firebase and insert
data into a list while avoiding
collisions with this type of layout
though you can consider these to be the
object IDs in our collection and
underneath these object IDs you'll see
that all the next keys have the same
structure these are our objects in our
document object model now some of these
keys make sense location title and time
are just strings this last one is a
little bit curious it's a bit nested
it's structured what is this the first
key is that title presenters because if
you remember that was the name of our
other namespace and remember how I said
that lists of numbers or garbage strings
are arrays this is the name of a
namespace being mapped to a key or to an
array of enlight well if we scrolled
down
well notice that presenters has a child
name in line this is how we can
structure relational data in firebase we
have the name or value of one key
pointing to basically a template
parameter or the location inside the
database somewhere else and that's how
you can use that one reference to have a
list of objects or lists of pointers to
objects elsewhere in the firebase
database so this is a new and novel
approach I know it might seem a little
intimidating at first so I wanted to
share a case study from Skyscanner
Skyscanner is a very popular travel app
in Europe they have over 5 million
monthly active customers and they had
built a modern web app or sorry a web
mobile app and they wanted to know how
they were doing so they had this feature
here where they would ask the customer
how happy are you that the customer was
happy they'd invite the user to share
their feedback on the App Store or would
share the app with their friends if the
feedback was negative they asked for
feedback directly so this was on another
back-end and they decided to try out
firebase they said it took them 10 hours
to rewrite this whole feature using
firebase it took them two days to test
all of their integrations with the new
firebase products and it took them two
weeks to fully roll out their entire new
codebase what they say about it it was
easy to switch from the legacy solution
the Web API is pretty mature for the
real time database and it's incredibly
easy to use so I'm going to
lightning-fast go through some
strategies of migrating data because
these are fundamentally different
they're structured differently typically
we talk about a background sync you have
your old app you build a new up in a
cleanroom
you might need some type of transformer
logic but you can use that to load and
import
can use that to test your new app with a
snapshot of old data you can drop that
data if you want and restart next you
need to restart again and do syncing
with your back-end to make sure that
when you have these two copies they
don't diverge this is a bit of a
challenge because you need to sync at
the same time as your import so it can't
overwrite old data
I've written some cloud code for you
that I'll share that can help you do
these types of migrations but the other
option you can do is just take your app
and put it into read-only mode while
doing your initial sync and then start
your synchronization afterwards the
other option is a double write you start
with your old app you connect to a new
database with an app that has access to
both copies first you treat your old
database at the source of truth and you
might do a back fill of data in the
background as features become available
or fully migrated you can change your
source of truth to be the hybrid app or
sorry to be the new back-end eventually
your old app stops being used you can
clean up your dependency on the old
back-end and then write your new app so
like I said I'm going to be sure sorry
there's two sessions to dive in deeper
deep dive into the real-time database
and zero to app develop a firebase so
today we show you how firebase is a
suite of integrated products designed to
help you develop your app grow a user
base and earn money we've covered how
firebase fits in the Google ecosystem
how you can add some novel tools to
firebase or from firebase and how far
business approach to giving you or to
building an app gives you novel
advantages so remember
migrating to firebase doesn't need to
mean migrating away from something else
we've shown you how the firebase tools
can help you solve problems in ways you
haven't been able to before what's next
we had the rest of firebase at calm or
firebase at Google calm down line I'd
love to hear what you've been doing what
you love about the new firebase and how
we can improve so thank you very much on
behalf of myself and my partner savanna
who wrote the migration guide I will be
spending rest of my
time out in the tent or I'll be at all
of the afternoon sessions I oh thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
