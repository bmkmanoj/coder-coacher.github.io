firebase cloud messaging not only sends
messages to Android devices but it can
also route notifications through APNs
Apple's push notification service to
talk to iOS devices but I think it's
worth explaining how it does this partly
because it's kind of interesting but
more importantly because it can give you
an understanding of what to look for if
things go wrong
let's explore further on this episode of
Fire casts
so two things are needed from any
service to communicate with a P&amp;amp;S first
you need a certificate which basically
allows you to communicate with the APNs
servers in the first place these days I
know you can also use something known as
an ApS off key which is a little more
convenient to work with if you're
writing your own communication code but
I'm going to focus on the certificate
for now because this is what firebase
Cloud messaging currently uses second
you'll need to tell APNs what device you
want to send a notification to and for
that you need a device token it's
essentially a way to uniquely identify
this user's device using an identifier
that only works with your app so this
device token is something that's
typically requested from APNs by the
device and then sent down to your server
since firebase Cloud messaging is taking
the role of the server here it needs
these two things the certificate and the
device token so one of the first things
you do when you set up firebase cloud
messaging is to upload your APNs
certificate in the form of a p12 file to
the firebase console and this allows the
FCM server to talk to APNs then when
your app starts up your users device
will request a device token from APNs it
will then send that token down to
firebase cloud messaging and then
firebase Cloud messaging will create and
send back a copy of its own device token
in exchange so at this point FCM has
everything it needs to communicate to
your device using a P and s and now
you're ready to send off your request
through firebase Cloud messaging so just
like with APNs you need two things to
send a notification request through FCM
a way to communicate with the service
and a way to identify your target device
so first off instead of a certificate
you're going to use an API key which you
can think of as the secret password you
need to talk to the FCM server on behalf
of your app and you can get this from
the firebase console next assuming you
want to talk to individual devices
you'll also need the FCM token which
you'll get from your client these two
pieces of information are then packaged
up into a notification that you send off
to firebase Cloud messaging now firebase
will look at whatever entry it has for
the device with a matching fcm device
token and it will see that it's
associated with an ApS token so it says
I probably need to route this message
through APNs to talk to this device so
what firebase will do is it will create
a new APNs version of this notification
using their certificate
the token that it has stored on its side
this new notification will then get sent
to a P and s which will then notify our
iOS device and your notification will
finally show up ray so I know that's
kind of a lot to process right but if
there are two things I want you to take
away from this explanation it's this
first most of this work is being done
behind the scenes for you most of the
time you don't need to know or care
about any of it second is that by the
time we get to here this is just a
regular old APNs notification as far as
your app is concerned this notification
looks like any other notification it
might have received from Apple so let's
stop and think about the work our device
had to do during this process we had to
one ask a ps4 device token to send that
ApS token off to FCM and then three
receive back the FCM device token while
getting an ApS device token is
accomplished by calling register for
remote notifications the way you
normally would as for these other steps
you don't really need to do any work to
make this happen
as long as your app has firebase enabled
we do most of the work for you thanks to
some fancy methods Quisling if you're
new to the concept of methods Quisling
it's basically away developers can add
on functionality to preexisting methods
in iOS by calling a custom version of
that method which usually then calls the
original method when it's done now often
developers use these to customize
methods that are part of the standard
iOS library but in our case we're using
them on top of any delegate methods you
might have written so when our Swizzle
did register for remote notifications
call we receive the APNs token and send
it off to firebase Cloud messaging in
exchange for an FCM device token by the
way I've actually been lying to you a
little bit this token is really known as
an instance ID token which in theory
could be used to identify your device
for services other than just firebase
cloud messaging and that's why you'll
see it created by the instance ID
library in our code and why it's
sometimes called your registration token
in the docs but for the purposes of
understanding FCM I think you're better
off just calling this an FCM device
token because this is basically what it
is I should also point out that we
Swizzle some of the methods for
receiving notifications as well and what
we're primarily doing here is making
sure that we're recording analytics
information about these notifications
this is how we can give you some of
those nice hey 30% of these
notifications were open reports that you
see in the notifications panel
and if you're uncomfortable with the
idea of having somebody else Swizzle
your methods you're more than welcome to
turn this off you'll just have to add in
the code manually to do the work that
we're doing and we've got documentation
for that finally one last note with
these Swizzle methods is that we don't
automatically call anything that would
bring up that standard iOS dialog asking
the user if it can show any user visible
notifications we know this is something
you probably don't want to call until
you're pretty sure your users are
actually going to say yes so this method
will still be up to you to call at the
moment that makes the most sense for
your app of course now that I've told
you that this is nothing more than a
plain old APNs notification and you
don't need to do anything special to use
firebase cloud messaging you might
notice this section in our documentation
where we ask you to explicitly connect
to firebase cloud messaging so what's
that all about
well you see in addition to being able
to communicate to your device through
APNs you can also connect through
firebase Cloud messaging to receive
notifications directly through that
service but there are some restrictions
here first and foremost this only works
if your app is in the foreground second
this will only works for data only
messages nothing with an alert message
badge sound anything like that
it also doesn't work with content
available messages those will always go
through AP and s in fact an AP nest land
I don't think you're allowed to send a
silent notification that doesn't include
content available so this type of
message is only valid through firebase
Cloud messaging as far as I can tell so
if you send this type of notification
and your app isn't in the foreground and
hasn't explicitly connected to FCM it
won't receive this message until you
reconnect so of course the question you
might have is why would you ever want to
do this so communicating directly
through firebase Cloud messaging does
have some advantages for one thing FCM
tends to be more aggressive about
getting these data messages to their
target device for another there's just
one fewer hop for your message to take
which is always nice and also your
device could actually send back upstream
messages through FCM to let you know for
instance that this message was received
but because they only work in the
foreground their use case is kind of
limited to apps that are generally okay
with not receiving these notifications
in the background one good example
YouTube their iOS app uses the FCM
connection to deliver room chat for its
YouTube live events since this app
really only cares about getting this
avalanche of chat messages when it's in
the foreground
a pretty good use case for firebase
cloud messaging but if you don't think
your app is going to need these types of
messages I might recommend not
connecting to the FCM service directly
at least until you've gotten the rest of
firebase Cloud messaging working it's
just one extra factor to deal with when
you're trying to track down issues with
your APNs implementation so here you go
that's how FCM works on iOS devices in
an overly simplified nutshell hopefully
this gives you a little more insight
into what's happening behind the scenes
