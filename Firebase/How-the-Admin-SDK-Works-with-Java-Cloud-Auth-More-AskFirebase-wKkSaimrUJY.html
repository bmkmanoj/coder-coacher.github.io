top of it again I know what I'm going to
say I got this
hey all you firebase developers welcome
to another episode of ask firebase and I
am here with Tonya and we're gonna be
answering your burning firebase
questions I'm so excited that you're on
the show today because you work with one
of my favorite products around here why
don't you tell us a little bit about
what you do here yeah I'm in charge of
firebase administer K offerings that
that's our SDKs for the server-side
environments and we have four different
flavors of it starting from the no J's
admin SDK which is our most widely used
and probably most mature and most most
feature-rich administer K offering and
we also have Java Python and since
recently go the SDKs that's right we
just had a go as well really excited
about that and people might know the
admin SDK if they use cloud functions
for firebase yeah
in fact the functions SDK is probably
one reason why not administer K is so
popular because it it's based off of no
that mean SDK so whenever you are doing
database call or user management
operation in a function you're actually
using the nodejs admin SDK or you know
actually why I want to do - come on is
because whenever I have questions about
the admin escape in you and I know you
have a lot on your plate but you always
get back to me right away with an answer
and I figured why not share that
knowledge with the rest of the firebase
community so glad to have you come out
and share your knowledge with the 70
larger group so let's get into some
questions about the admin SDK first
question comes to us from Stack Overflow
I am creating a simple web portal using
firebase cloud authentication one user
is an admin who will create other normal
users and handover the credentials to
the normal user so they're using
the admin SDK for that now I want that
admin have the option to reset the
password for a normal user how can they
achieve this if you look into the alt
and user management API that are
currently available in the admin SDK is
one one feature that we support out of
the box is just this just resetting the
password of an existing user this comes
up very often in server-side use cases
there's an admin and a non admin users
and the admin needs to provision user
accounts as well as do certain updates
and mutations on the user data
like resetting the users password is one
of the most common scenarios in that
respect and what you would do is if
you're programming in let's say node.js
you would call admin dot all that update
user and pass just pass the new password
in and that gets propagated to all the
backend systems in firebase and
suite I will also link us to the
documentation so if they want to find
out more you can check out all the
different options you have with off for
the admin SDK all right what else we go
okay oh this one so I really like this
question this is one I specifically
asked you about because there was an
update to the Java admin SDK and we had
a user on Stack Overflow that noticed
that they weren't getting calls to the
real-time database when they were trying
to read it it appeared that everything
else was happening but those calls
weren't being made but when you think
about it a little deeper there was
something else going on so what is it
about how the Java admin SDK works that
might impact what that experience is
like if users are testing things right
this is actually one of the kind of the
fundamental differences in the way the
Android how an Android app would work
and how a regular app regular Java
application would run Indy JVM so JVM it
comes up and then your application it
starts the applications main thread and
it does some operations and mean when
the main thread exits the whole
application the whole JVM exits provided
it hasn't spawned any other threads so
if you let's say you start your
application and you do firebase dot you
call initialize app and then you start a
database connection and then you start
listener you think you're waiting for
the events to fire but what's happening
actually is the main thread exit
it takes the whole JVM down so before
any events could fire any real-time
events are actually delivered from
firebase back-end 2d to your application
your whole program exits so what you
have to do is actually tell your
application - hey register this event
listener and wait for things to happen
and there are different ways to do it do
this the simplest way you should just
tell your thread tell the main thread to
just go to sleep
just wait or you can use more advanced
concurrent programming struck constructs
like semaphores and wait notify
constructs and there are all sorts of
cool fun things you can do in Java and
threads to just do to implement this bit
of synchronization right and I would say
that this is certainly a feature and not
a bug because it wouldn't be a good idea
to block the main thread for something
like this yeah so you can actually argue
for I've seen arguments for both sides
of the story some some uses certainly
prefer if the SDK can just wait for wait
on behalf of them but the philosophy
that weaves we've sort of followed is if
the administer case starts at thread it
will also takes care of cleaning up that
thread and any thread that the SDK
starts will be actually started as
what's called a demon and demons will
not prevent the JVM from exiting early
and that's actually this is actually
important if you're if you're running
your application in environments like
App Engine which is thread constrained
Java which has other constraints on
threads you absolutely do not want
threads just hanging out you want the
whole thing to exit as soon as possible
so that's why the administrator is
designed that way unfortunately it has
this other ramification like if you're
running this on your own server if
you're quickly trying to you know try
something out it has this weird behavior
it seems to the naked eye it seems like
the application just stopped before
anything happened right I feel very
lucky that I get to be surrounded by so
many people that I can just turn and ask
when these things come up but I think
that it's really great information about
how the admin
CK works with Java and super helpful so
thank you
oops well thanks so much for coming on
and answering some firebase questions
and as I start to collect some more
content when you have some questions
about the admin SDK make sure you put
them on social media and tag them with
ask firebase so I can have hiranya back
on the show any of your other questions
that come along make sure you send them
our way Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
