that your users are going to love but
you want to get it into people's hands
and let them see just how awesome it is
well AdWords helps you do this putting
ads for your app in front of billions of
people that you search YouTube Google
Play and more you can quickly set up an
ad campaign to reach the type of users
that might be interested in your app you
only pay if the user clicks on that ad
and you can set the budget and
acquisition cost that you're comfortable
with but how do you know you're reaching
the right users maybe some will install
your app and forget about it while
others will make it part of their daily
lives
firebase analytics helps you do this you
can define events that happen in your
app that you consider to be important
such as reaching the first level of your
game purchasing a fancy new pair of
sunglasses or returning every morning to
check out new products you can tell
AdWords which of these events are most
important to you then AdWords will
display ads to people who are more
likely to complete these important
actions in the future you can also build
audiences which are specific segments of
users and have AdWords display or app to
them for example imagine that you have a
group of users who are very active have
added a product to their cart but
haven't purchased yet well you can use
firebase to create an audience of just
these people and then use AdWords to
give them specific ads and encourage
them to come back to your app and take
action understanding your users and
engaging with them at just the right
time and in the right way will help you
build loyalty wrap firebase in AdWords
working together to help you grow your
user base get started today
your new users are waiting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
