new episode of hashtag ask firebase and
we have a special one this week
coding doug is here with us and fun fact
about doug is that he has better than
average vision at only one eye and fun
fact about Dave again he wanted to name
this first child Kanye Kanye East but
anyways we have a great show for you
today we got lots of questions from
andevcon so let's dive in oh there's no
gum here is your computer
yeah first up we have a question from
Jim and EV Khan let's check it out my
question for firebase is this we've got
all these new features feels like
Christmas I'd like to know what's for
Christmas next year what can you tell me
about firebases plans for the future the
this is a difficult question to answer
because Google we usually don't talk
about the future we don't make promises
and we don't want to be misleading in
any way I would love to tell you more
but I can't I will tell you this that
one of the hallmarks of the fire-based
product is its ability for all of its
features to work well together and we
feel like we could do that even better
than we do now for example analytics
works well with a lot of different
features and we would like that to be
even more than it is now there's been a
lot of demand for server-side hosted
logic which is a crucial for a lot of
apps to move logic from their app to the
server we're looking at ways to get that
done in a cost-effective and flexible
way so you know you can look for those
things I haven't really had my
one-on-one with Santa yet so have you
been naughty let's cut that part so
check out our next question from Gary
I'd like to ask firebase how would I
take an existing sequel a database that
is relational and port that to firebase
storage services that is a great
question Gary and one that we get quite
often so there's no straightforward way
of doing it there are two totally
different types of databases but there
are a couple tricks that you should know
so if you're going to start out with
sequel you usually work with tables and
with no sequel there is no tables
there's no foreign keys there's none of
that but what you can do is take these
tables and treat them as top-level nodes
in your no sequel database anywhere
where you have a foreign key you can use
the shared key concept in no sequel
which pretty much means that these keys
that you're using in your sequel
database you tend to just borrow them on
the no sequel side so you make sure that
each one of your nodes when it needs to
relate to something just matches up so
like I said there's no straightforward
way of doing it but if you follow some
of these practices it does make your
life a lot easier
next like this next question I'd like to
ask firebase how to send notifications
based on a prevents for example if the
user logs out of our app and we want to
get them back is it possible to send
them a notification all right thanks for
the question Ben and by the way I
remember you and your team from the
hackathon it was a ton of fun to your
question about sending notifications to
users who have logged out but you can't
do that with firebase notifications but
you can do that with firebase Cloud
messaging it just requires that you have
a server side component to your app and
on your server side logic you can
respond to a logout then schedule a
message to be sent later on so you can't
do this on the client side only right
now but if you do have your own server
side that can make that logic you can do
it that way and on the server there's
SDKs for the real-time database so you
can actually monitor for things that
happen in your app so you can set up a
queueing system so when something
happens you can do something like send
that push notification or send a payment
or really whatever you want to do so the
next question comes from Lucy I'd like
to ask firebase do you make it easy to
include photos and video in mobile apps
and do you allow provision settings for
who can read and write the photos and
videos that is a great question Lucy and
by the way thank you so much for
participating in the hackathon so do we
make it easy to include photos and
videos and set user permissions on them
yeah we do Barbie storage is the perfect
solution for this so if Barbie storage
all you do is include the SDK in your
app and then when the user selects a
photo a video really any file you can
upload that to firebase storage without
any need for a server and as far as
authenticating users and protecting
their data well when you integrate with
firebase authentication you can set
security rules that secure those files
to their proper owners that is all
customized by you and the firebase
console so David just how many photos
could you store in firebase
1 million photos but seriously probably
like a lot more than that next question
I'd like to ask firebase how your
notifications differ from doing
notifications through APNs on Apple or
iOS and how they differ from Google
Cloud messaging great question Shawn
so turns out that Google Cloud messaging
was actually rebranded to firebase Cloud
messaging and as part of that rebranding
there's now more things that it can do
than GCM used to be able to do so you
can still send messages to Android
devices and you can send messages to iOS
devices and you can send messages to web
clients as well so you can do all that
through FCM but in your specific case
you asked about APNs which is what you
use to send to iOS devices so it turns
out that FCM uses APNs behind the scenes
to send its notifications so when you're
using FCM you're actually using APNs in
the background you don't have to worry
about all those details another question
sure is I'd like to ask firebase to
explain good use cases for firebase with
the Internet of Things including
specific examples in in both practice
and code so that is a great question
Stephan and a lot of people are using
the real time database for their IOT
needs and you can actually use the real
time database SDK on in Arduino so it's
a really nice fit there it turns out
there's code samples too so if you go to
github you can check out a project there
and see how it's done so the links are
right here right right here if you use
the links right here to see how it's
done so it's all the questions for this
week thank you all so much for sending
them in and if you have any more
questions make sure to send them in to
us on YouTube Twitter Seco or Foe just
use the hashtag ask firebase and we will
get to them and if you're interested in
getting started with firebase and
Android check out this guy's screencast
right here on our youtube channel and if
you'd like to find out more about david
east you can read David East diary going
