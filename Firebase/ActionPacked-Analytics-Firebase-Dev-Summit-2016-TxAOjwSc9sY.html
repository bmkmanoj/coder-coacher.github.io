action-packed analytics the life of an
analytics event specifically in firebase
analytics no app analytics solutions
have been around for a number of years
I've personally used several of them in
my own apps
I'm sure you've used the gamut as well
we could get together on break and talk
about the pros and cons of each one's
and which ones are more accurate than
others at certain things but they all
typically revolve around the concept of
an event which is something that you can
measure in your app that often refers to
or is connected to some user action that
you want to measure and what I've
noticed being in this position and
talking to a lot of you and just from
you know working at Google and having
exposure to many more developers that
I've noticed that developers their
strategy for logging events actually
changes over time as they get more
mature an example for my own experience
about six years ago I was working on
this app it's called order up to go for
iOS when I first heard about app
analytics and I thought oh that's that
like website stuff right and like oh
they have it for apps now you should
totally put it in your app and I was
like how much was the cost well it's
free okay so I put some analytics SDK in
my app didn't really know what to
measure what we used it for was to
measure how many hamburgers were served
in the game so that we could brag about
in promotional posts basically how many
millions or billions of hamburgers that
we were serving and then shortly after
someone was like well you should be
measuring user engagement and retention
with this thing and it's like all right
I really didn't understand what I was
doing and I just threw the kitchen sink
at it logged every possible thing I
possibly could and the result was really
just a bunch of noise because my logging
strategy wasn't at all aligned with the
tools that was using to process the data
and that's really critical so what I
hope to achieve in this presentation is
I hope to help you understand all the
places in firebase analytics or
throughout all a firebase that your
analytics events can appear and can be
really valuable to you and I hope to
also prove to you that events are
valuable to everyone in your
organization and it's in the best
interest of the whole stack to log
events for different purposes
now this is the typical life of an
analytics event he looks kind of sad
there right especially when juxtaposed
against that you have a high contrast
here so analytics events you typically
log them they get in the line they march
towards some pie chart some static
report and that's not to diminish the
need for reporting we obviously offer a
lot of reporting but my point really is
that analytics can be a lot more
actionable and be a lot more than just
fuel for reporting fire brace breaks the
mold in this regard that's it's a huge
focus of ours to consider the action
ability of your events invested in the
following we realize the following
things that events actually describe
users so the patterns of events that are
logged and the parameters that
contextualize them actually describe
groups of users so if you have some user
who's logging events to that he's
listening or he or she was listening to
songs hip-hop songs let's say maybe they
listened to a hundred of them maybe
that's a hip-hop fan you have some other
user who's listening 100 jazz songs
maybe that's a jazz fan and although
that's certainly useful to understand
for reporting purposes how hip-hop fans
and jazz fans use your music app
differently it's also very actionable
because when you know these things about
your users then you're able to engage
them and with with very tailored
messaging and customized perhaps the app
experience for each audience differently
we also realize and want to convey that
events bring context to them I mentioned
before parameters giving context to
events but there's also user properties
these are like sticky parameters that
you can use to further differentiate one
user from another common ones are age
and gender those are ones that everyone
seems to understand but you can use
other ones like maybe you want you know
if your users are single or married and
you can log those user properties and
they're great for reporting just like
with audiences but you there's these are
action this is actionable context as
well we also have screen tracking which
I mentioned is went out in the latest
version of the SDK so you have that
context of knowing where the users are
in your apps how much time they're
spending on each screen time stamps so
get to know the sequence of events
occurring in your apps and the user and
device properties these are all really
highlighted in our integration with
crash reporting so we'll go into an
example of that in just a bit
and lastly users inform sorry events
inform user acquisition this is perhaps
less obvious to you but conversion
events those events which you've
identified as being the business drivers
for your apps those events that you wish
every single user who comes into your
app would log because then you would be
super successful those events can also
be fed back into user acquisition
campaigns so that you can make sure it
so you can optimize to get the most
valuable users this is done through and
in it first-class integration we have
with Adwords and universal app campaigns
will show an example of this in a bit
but feeding back your events into
AdWords can help it understand which
users are converting so it can acquire
more users like that so this is another
way that your events can be much more
than just about reporting so how do you
log an event we made this part really
simple and familiar
I'll show you so an example using
Android studio this example here that
you see on the slide is how you would
log in event in iOS let's switch to the
demo again we're going to be focusing on
this icon shop app that I showed in the
keynote the code is available the code
labs available and also the github
repositories available for you to check
out we'll take a look at what the
functionality is of this app and map
that to the events you would expect
expect to be logged so you can move
around the app go into different
activities Add to Cart is certainly an
action that you would expect to have an
event for you going into the cart and
then removing from cart you'd expect to
see that and then checking out as well
now the first place you would expect
these events to show up again is debug
view which I showed recently so let's go
look at your analytics reports and make
sure that the events are being logged
so there they all are
again it reads like a narrative so that
I can do I can validate my
instrumentation looks like there's no
API errors we can look at the parameters
and make sure that it's all legitimate
it's what I expected it to be okay the
icon add location fifteen tokens okay
all looking good new ones just came in
the e-commerce purchase happened all
right
excellent let me show you the code that
it took to log DS okay pretty simple
stuff here's a line of code that logs
the add to cart' event and above it you
can see the parameters that I'm
supplying to contextualize it I'm
showing this not to not to say that it's
anything exciting the point is really
that this is very typical and simple
there's nothing there's not really much
work that goes into logging these events
that I'm proposing are very valuable
throughout all a firebase furthermore
there's other places where I log events
here so here's the remove from cart
again we're adding some context and
parameters and here's the e-commerce
purchase that we log giving it how much
how much how many credits or tokens it
took to actually make this purchase so
we've seen those in our debug view and I
want to kind of show you the next place
that events Connect can show up in the
rest of firebase events are also clues
as Francis mentioned in the keynote the
sequence of events that lead up to a
crash are really really important for
helping you understand what causes the
crash
I mean this has been known ever since I
started developing software and often
times you'll get a crash that's in some
common code and what are you really
going to do with that if you don't have
more context around it you're not gonna
be able to fix it that sort of bug goes
right back to QA and you ask them need
more information or it could not
reproduce and so this this new launch we
have this new integration with crash
reporting is extra
valuable and you're gonna wonder how you
got by without it this is also something
that I've used in my own apps now that I
wonder how I got along before they would
existed so here I've set up the app I
make a purchase a crash happens right
someone's going to get fired for that
and then I head over to analytics I
would expect to see some reporting on
this okay so everything leading up to it
we have the context user engagement and
an app exception event this is by virtue
of the integration with crash reporting
so when you use both analytics and crash
reporting together they talk to each
other and they work together crash
reporting is going to log an app
exception event so that you can
understand what the impact is of crashes
on your users you have these questions
like who is it crashing on and what's
how valuable was that user how does it
impact their user engagement and
retention so crash reporting does its
part by letting us know that a crash
occurred but that's definitely not the
end of the story heading over to crash
reporting we can see the other half of
this awesome integration so this is for
the same app we can see three crashes
occurring and this is looks like it's
the one hey I clicked on the item card
to add it to the cart I'm going to view
the details of this now again it's very
common code and even if I know it's
related to adding an item to a cart I
added lots of items to cart there could
be thousands of items I it could be that
I've never seen this crash myself and if
I had QA this would be the sort of thing
I I would just ask for more information
about but if you scroll down you'll see
that we are we do have that information
for you here automatically by virtue of
this integration with crash reporting so
not only does crash reporting let
Analytics know that an exception
occurred within analytics let's crash
reporting know the sequence of events
that preceded the crash and their time
stamps and it reads like a book it tells
you the narrative of what that user was
doing before the crash along with every
step every event that's logged you get
the context so we know what screen
that happened on what activity what the
icon was etc and what I see here is that
the final step before the crash was the
adding of the by our bar icon to the
cart okay that's good this is a clue
maybe I can go and do this myself and
reproduce it or maybe I want to actually
look at other crashes to see if they're
similar if there's some common thread
between all the occurrences of this
crash maybe some certain category of
content well here's another one there's
a long history of activity but again a
crash occurred when adding the bar icon
to the cart and so on and so forth and
that I the the goal here is or the idea
here is that this is this is what you
would want from your queue a this sort
of information of telling you the
context around a crash and what you were
doing before it but these are your end
users so the crash reporting you were
getting on your end users already that
produced call stacks well that was nice
in that connection that could be really
helpful but now it also tells you what
they were doing before the crash which
could be way way more value valuable
especially in high-volume so this is the
one of the places that your events can
show up and this is probably more
especially valuable for your developers
your engineers so now even these
engineers who have really no interest in
seeing your user engagement or Mao Dao
Wow all these things they don't really
care about they're gonna be really
interested in login events because
they're gonna help them fix issues so
this valuable for one once I'm gonna be
organization next the events are
valuable as context we mentioned before
parameters and user properties they're
great for reporting purposes but they're
actually actionable too I'll give you
another example using my demo app so in
the code lab we set something up which
is perhaps a little bit contrived but
for the purposes of demonstration we
asked up top
what is your profession that may be tiny
and you might not see it but it asks
what is your profession the reason we
asked that is because the theory might
the theory is that perhaps someone's
background of the profession actually
affects how they use the app what
content they're interested in so any
signal we can get from the user is value
for segmentation so my profession I'm
gonna say engineer because once an
engineer always an engineer even if you
have a title of product manager right
I'm gonna log some events because events
carry the context the user properties
not sent by itself it's carried along
with the events that's are logged not
checkout head over to debug view to make
sure I did everything correct and you
see here this special treatment on user
properties changing you can see that the
profession user property changed to
engineer that happens because in the
Android code in the main activity when
someone selects item from that list we
actually set that as a user property for
their profession we had set up
previously that user property here in
analytics under the user properties tab
called profession describing the user's
profession useful again for reporting
purposes so I could see look at first
for example their user engagement and
see what the difference is in engagement
between engineers and program managers
that's great but we were talking about
action and not just analytics here in
reporting so you can use this context in
firebase remote config to actually
customize the user experience for
engineers so I'll show you how to do
that now I go to the room up remote
config and you see that I already have a
parameter for the card color which
describe describes that what color the
background color is of the cards in that
demo app I said it's a transparent and I
could change that now for everyone in
the world if I wanted to or do some a be
test but also if I if perhaps I know
something about this audience or this
segment maybe I know something that make
that makes me want to customize the app
differently it's like a not like an
airline they might they treat their
frequent fliers differently from how
they treat their casual travelers and
they know this because of the habits and
makeup of these two different audiences
so in this case maybe I think that
engineers like
different colors and darker schemes so
I'll do something about that so rather
than change the value globally I'm going
to define the new condition engineers
that applies if the user property
profession exactly matches engineer for
the value I memorize the hex value of a
color I really like and see if you guys
figure what it is all right that's a RGB
for dark gray and I publish the changes
all right and that's live head back over
to my app and rerun this thing there it
goes
so it's already started updating it I
was gonna rerun the app but it's faster
than that even and there it is for an
engineer it's darker gray and I love it
and I want to stick around and buy all
sorts icons now right
so now your product manager is going to
want you to log events and set user
properties because it gives them the
ability to customize the user experience
for different segments and for different
user properties next events are valuable
as criteria I mentioned before that the
pattern of events logged by a user
actually define help you define
audiences around them I mentioned jazz
audiences versus hip-hop audiences
there's a million examples you can give
but if you know if you can see a pattern
of events logged by them then you can
basically define the criteria that
defines them and I'll show you an
example of this with the demo app as
well I've been logging all these add add
to cart events with their parameters
maybe the volume of events logged could
be a clue to creating a segment here if
I go to analytics audiences this is the
place where I would define a segment
based on a pattern of events I create a
new audience let's say I want to target
people who just love icons a lot because
I'm planning on releasing a new pack of
icons and I want to let them know about
it so that they can go check it out and
make a purchase so we'll call these
people icon a holux I just can't get
enough right users that love icons a
little too much these are users that
added icons to the cart let's say a
hundred thousand okay icon of holux
audience has been created and I can take
action on this and engage those users
once I accumulate enough of them alright
and let's say if you loved those icons
here are some more and choose to send
now or later target an app target an
audience and there are my icon all holux
I could state what conversion event I'm
interested in that driving that's
because analytics isn't just a source of
information here it's actually helps you
to measure the impact of your campaign
you don't want to just
fire-and-forget and hope that it moves
the Grand Needle somehow you want to
know that this campaign had the effect
you intended on it having and it could
be that it had some negative effects you
didn't intend on it having such as
uninstalls but what we're doing here by
engaging this audience directly based on
previous activities we're trying to
limit the amount of spam we know that
these users love icons so we're sending
them a targeted message that's very
relevant to them without spamming the
whole world and let them know that icons
are available maybe they just barely
open their app the app for the first
time they get this message they've never
bought anything they think of it's gonna
spam me this much all the time I'm not
I'm not gonna use it and they just
uninstall it so targeting audiences more
directly and intelligently least a
better user experience and more
conversions so your marketer now is
going to ask you to log the events that
they can use as criteria for creating
audiences and engaging with them through
notifications or remote config or
through AdWords I didn't mention this
example before but any audiences that
you create if you link to an AdWords
account those audiences are then
available for you to to send to show
advertisements to outside of the app
experience one really clever and common
use of this is to create an audience of
users who have uninstalled your app and
maybe now you're launching a whole new
version like a brand new 2.0 that is so
much better and you have instincts as to
why people didn't like the first one you
want to reach out to those people who
were initially impressed by you and
hoping that your app was so much more
and let them know give it another shot
check out our app again that's one way
that you can really take advantage of
audiences outside of firebase analytics
and the last one I want to talk about is
analytics events that help you
supercharge user acquisition we've
talked before about how you can identify
your most important business drivers as
conversion events you do that in your
analytics UI you'll see a list of all of
your events along with this knob that
says mark as conversion you can identify
up to ten of your events as conversions
to let us know those are the most
important to you and we treat them
especially as I mentioned in the keynote
we upload them from the device in real
time
and then we'll also do attribution for
you so you know which campaigns are
driving users to convert I'll show you
that for one of the for a different app
this is that skateboarding game a
skateboarding game I worked on for which
we are running some campaigns and you'll
see here that the different sources that
drove users to spend virtual currency as
the conversion we're looking at here my
conversions for this app are first open
which is the first time a user open the
app which is commonly referred to as
like your install conversion in-app
purchase this app has in-app purchases
as well so I can see which campaigns
drove users to make purchases but then I
have this custom custom conversion which
is spend virtual currency because I want
to drive users to do that as well
we're here that campaigns that have
driven it so I can understand which
which ones I should actually get behind
more and reinvest more in because
they're driving more converting users
this is nice but it's still just
reporting and this sessions more about
action outside of reporting so what I
want to talk about is the power of your
conversion events to supercharge user
acquisition so how many of you are
familiar with universal app campaigns in
Adwords all right just a few of you this
this is exciting to me as an app
developer because I I don't know about
you but when I went to use AdWords for
the first time as an app developer it
was really intimidating there are a
million knobs all over the place and
you're not sure what to enter for your
app what information enter for your app
and and also it's the first time I ever
found a phone number from Google where
you can actually call someone and talk
to them and they paid attention to you
and you needed that help that
hand-holding to launch a campaign that's
successful AdWords realized all this and
created a much much easier way to drive
users to install your app called
universal app campaigns I'll do I'll
walk you through a few steps of that
just to show you how easy and
streamlined it is not not really the
purity to push you on that product or to
emphasize this point that your analytics
events can supercharge it but here's my
AdWords setup and I go to create a new
campaign and there's this type universal
app campaign
you select the app from the App Store so
it's Transworld endless Gator and
automatically using a template it
populates app the app advertisements
using this the resources i VAR le
updated to the upload to the app store
which is great this is a absolutely
great head start over what they had
before which is you having to manually
upload all this stuff and decide what to
show on every network you can further
customize it showing what the text that
you want to show in each case like
download free skate or Die download me
whatever and it shows up in the
templates on the right you can further
customize it by adding your own video
ads decide what locations these ads are
shown what language is and here's the
point I'm getting at
by default it says the goal is to get
new users for your app and maybe that's
what you want to do maybe just
interested in volume but the one
underneath it is the one I want to focus
on which is get new users who are likely
to complete in-app actions that you
select those in-app actions that you
select that I'm talking about here are
the conversion events from firebase
analytics and if you link your app your
firebase app to AdWords and choose to
import your conversions then it creates
a pipe through which those conversion
events are going to be sent in real time
over to AdWords to create a feedback
loop so it can optimize your install
campaigns once they realize that the
users are driving our are converting
they can go and get more users who are
converting intelligently through machine
learning so now you also have your
marketing and advertising team making
sure that you are logging the events
that they can use this to feed into your
campaigns and the cool thing is that
odds are you probably are already
because your engineer is logging those
events for clues your product manager
wants you to log those events to create
audiences and user properties so
everyone in the organization is lined
aligned to log in the events that you
care about lastly the other place that
your analytics events show up besides
reporting is in bigquery I previously
mentioned that you can link your app to
bigquery and on a daily basis your
events are exported over to bigquery and
accessible there through sequel command
lines
and and you can run super fast queries
on massive datasets big queries very
very powerful but I mentioned also that
on the your conversion events are
uploaded to bigquery or to our back-end
in real time and then over to bigquery
in real time as well so I'll show you
what my bigquery project looks like for
the app I've been using to demonstrate
all morning so take a look at this is my
bigquery project for this Android
analytics demo and there's two sets of
tables there's an this is tiny isn't it
there's an app events table which is ten
days worth of events and there's an app
events intraday this is this contains
everything over the last 24 hours that
I've been logging including this
morning's demos so I can run a query
here to get a list of event names it
finishes pretty quickly and there's 55
events that I've logged over the last 24
hours
that's nice and maybe some of you are
familiar with sequel maybe some of you
feel allergic to sequel and it's not
something you're interested in doing or
maybe no sequel but you don't really
have somebody who can produce reporting
on this so this comes back again to the
data studio integration and the data
studio report templates that we launched
today which understand natively the
format in the schema of this data and
can produce this reports on it so I want
to show you a data studio report that I
created for this this is the events that
I this is the report that I've created
using my intraday data set you can see
all the events here log in the city of
Berlin over here in Germany I can apply
a filter to say I just want to look at
add to cart' and I want to take a look
at the item IDs you see here the
breakdown in this over here of which
items that I added to my cart most and
it's super easy to customize again
there's three pages of reports
dashboards events and conversions that I
can break down but if I wanted to change
this maybe I'm not interested in paramah
as much as I am in device breakdown we
have a list here of all the dimensions
as you can pick from we've exposed all
of these because we know they're
important to have
developers so there's time there's
current there's LTV there's OS version
and device information there's the city
continent region country platform and
here I'm going to I'm going to choose
device category maybe I want to know how
many of these were logged on a phone
versus a tablet hundred percent on phone
or maybe I want to see the device model
that wasn't it it was a emulator
breakdown of country Germany so it's
really easy to just select what you want
from dropdowns rather than running
queries to do it manually so it opens
the door and lowers the bar to create
reports based on your raw data and to
share it with others
maybe when I get it just right I choose
to share and I'll invite my UX
collaborator to make it look pretty so
that we can present it for a
presentation to the whole company maybe
just want to brag to my boss or
something maybe I want to share it with
Ben and say I slaved all weekend on this
I'm aren't I awesome when I send that
it's just like Google Docs it's the same
format you see my head on in the upper
right corner if Ben responds to this he
shows up at the same time we're editing
at the same time we're collaborating to
make this the best dashboard the company
has ever seen super flexible ok
so I've given you an idea of all the
other places that analytics events can
show up besides just your static
reporting and I hope that I've made a
good case for why events could be
valuable to everyone in your
organization but one other thing I want
to mention is that because firebase
analytics is free and unlimited ie you
can log in unlimited volume of events do
not be shy log limit log liberally log
what you need to measure so that it's
most valuable for everyone and make sure
you use debug view so that your
instrumentation is validated so you're
logging all the right event names and
parameters last thing you want to do is
release some app to the world and you've
named things wrong or some parameters
are missing or there's some errors and
then then your data set is incomplete
and you'd have to release a new app
version people would have to download it
so we've given you all these tools now
to validate it and after they're valid
make sure you're measuring everything
it's important you so everyone in your
