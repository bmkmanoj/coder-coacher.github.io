of ask firebase I'm your host for today
david east and i'm gonna be covering
what do you mean i'm i'm playing david
YZ am i not I'm confused I thought the
whole premise is that we have people
playing a character David East right we
had Florence I think Loras was a David
East and before that we had thought we
had Mike Mike was a good David East I
think he was the third David East and
before that we had the little guide one
with the skateboards who was that are
you sure
so I'm gonna be me today answering
firebase questions oh hey everyone
welcome to another episode of the ask
firebase show my name is Frank or for
those of you who follow me on Twitter
puff and I'm gonna be your host for
today the first question is from Twitter
and is from user tutor for death how do
I create a user with an email and a
password through the firebase CLI the
command-line tools that's a great
question
we actually just added a new command to
the firebase tools that allows you to
import a whole set of users with a
single month
you now have off Colin imports you can
import a CSV file containing all user
information in one go let's have a look
at the link below you can see that we
have a lot of information like a lot of
fields that you can have in your CSV
file where you can specify the user
information like the email address their
full name and of course their assaulted
and be cryptic passwords so if you have
one of these users already from another
system you have them export it somewhere
you just take two CSV file you upload it
into firebase authentication with the
firebase CLI off call an import command
great question now that I know that I
actually get to be myself this next
question comes from Stack Overflow
it's my read or the firebase questions
there and this one is from boost runner
I hope I pronounced that correctly how
do I retrieve data from firebase without
having to use the data snapshot that's a
great question
unfortunately on Android the easiest way
that you can retrieve data from firebase
is really by using the data snapshot
right we have an SDK and with that SDK
you attach to the database
you get a data snapshot of all the data
that you requested and of all changes to
the data this is really by far the
easiest way but if you really don't want
to use a data snapshot you can use the
firebase REST API now I understand that
when you just get started with firebase
it might be a bit tricky to start using
the SDK and that's why we have some
great material out there including the
firebase documentation but also our
brand new course on Udacity called
firebase in a week ends next question
and it's from let's see from Rancho
software how do you model many to many
relationships in the firebase database
and that's a great and very common
question it's so common that I actually
already answered it on Stack Overflow so
let's have a look what I said there if
you do a relational database and you
have him many to many relationship then
you're typically gonna have let's say if
we have two entities contractors and
companies like you have French off then
you're gonna have three tables right you
have a table of contractors you have a
table of companies and then you have
your many-to-many table that connects
the two together in the firebase
database it's somewhat similar but it's
also different we're still gonna have a
list of contractors and we're gonna have
a list of companies so those are the
same but now instead of having a single
many-to-many table we'll actually have a
list of company contractors so that's
for every company
the contractors for that company and a
list of contractor companies so this is
the other way around we've reversed the
logic so this is for every contractor we
have a list of their companies you store
the information twice but it allows you
to look it up very efficiently because
now once you know the contractor right
you can find the contractors information
in the contractors list and then you can
find two contractors companies by going
to contractor companies and then the
contractor ID under that and then you
just have the list of their company IDs
it's similar to how you do this on a
relational database but it's also
slightly different this will take time
to get used to so don't worry about it
too much it's very normal that you have
to get used to this that's why we have
some great extra resources for all of
you who come from sequel to actually
learn about firebase we have a video
series recorded by David East that is
called firebase for sequel developers we
have to link below here and I highly
recommend that you check it out because
David in addition to explain
the details of many-to-many
relationships he covers many more
details like how you do advanced
wearying how you actually can do
searches on firebase and many of the
other things that you are going to
encounter as you transition from a
sequel world to firebases
no sequel world great question Rancho
this is the official clap thingy
day 15 that thing is so Hollywood I'm
gonna be channeling my inner Demi Lovato
here the next question is from Frank's
mom that sounds cool the question is I
hardly ever see you anymore Frank how
can I see more of you
that's a great question mom and actually
I have the perfect answer for you
because we just released a new fire
based course on Udacity called firebase

you actually learn not just about
firebase but you also get to see more of
me if you take this course in that
course you learn everything about
firebase in just a weekend so you'll
learn about firebase real-time database
firebase notifications firebase
authentication you'll learn about remote
config and you can learn it for either
Android or iOS so whichever platform you
prefer we have the course for you great
question mom I really like that one and
with that last question we reached the
end of this episode and you know what
wasn't even as bad as I thought it would
be maybe I even like this who knows a
might do more if you liked this episode
