username and password authentication in
firebase you can now use phone number
off where a verified phone is enough to
sign a user into your app in this video
I'll show you exactly how you can do
that on Android you'll use the firebase
UI off library that you can find at this
URL this open source library does all
the heavy lifting for you so you can
focus on building your app and not the
many different user flows that you might
need to take into account when
implementing off for example when
implementing phone number off there are
a number of factors that you may need to
consider one of these is if the user has
saved some phone numbers in smartlock
and they want to choose one of them
instead of entering it manually
well this scenario has been handled for
you by the firebase UI off library
before coding the first thing that
you'll need to do is have a firebase
project in the firebase console if you
don't have one already you can create
one at this URL once you've done that
you need to go into the authentication
section and click on the sign-in methods
tab you'll see a list of the various
sign-in methods and on this list is
Fault slip the enable switch to on and
then click Save your app can now handle
firebase phone authentication in the app
itself you can then follow the normal
flow first check to see if you've
assigned in user already and if you
don't you can use firebase UI is intent
builder to create a sign-in activity the
behavior of this activity is set based
on the providers that you pass to it in
the set available providers method so
for example if I just want Google email
and phone sign-in I can configure it
like this this will present the sign-in
activity with the configured services as
you can see here when the user chooses
sign-in with phone they'll be asked to
enter a phone number or to choose one
you aren't writing any code for this
it's all handled for you by firebase UI
once the number is entered the process
of verification will begin and in this
case firebase sends an SMS to that
number containing a verification code
Android is capable of Auto verifying
this code so the user doesn't need to do
anything in a few moments the phone will
be verified and signed in and now if you
look at your firebase console you'll see
that the user is there they have a
firebase ID so they're a full firebase
user able to access data based on your
security rules and that's it as you can
see it's really easy to implement phone
authentication on Android using the
firebase UI libraries you can learn more
about it and download the sample app
that I showed you at this link you can
also learn more about what you can do
with firebase at firebase Google calm
and don't forget to subscribe to our
YouTube channel for more fire casts
conference talks and a whole lot more
I'll see you on there and happy fire
