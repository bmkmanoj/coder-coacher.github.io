about cloud functions for firebase my
name is Doug Stevenson and today's topic
is programming with JavaScript promises
in a fire story on cloud functions in
the last video I talked about using
promises in an HTTP trigger if you
haven't watched that video do it first
and come back here when you're done oh
wait so you learn last time that a
JavaScript promise represents some
asynchronous work going on in the
background of your function it has three
states pending fulfilled and rejected
and you can write callbacks using the
then and catch methods on a promise to
know when the state changes you also
learn the first rule for terminating a
cloud function HTTP triggers must send a
response to the client to terminate
properly today we'll look at the second
rule for all other types of triggers you
must return a promise that becomes
fulfilled or rejected when all the
pending work in that function is
complete this lets cloud functions know
when it's safe to clean up the function
invocation and move on to the next one
last time I wrote an HTTP function that
fetches a document from fire store and
it sends its contents to the client like
a simple Web API this time I'm going to
write a fire store trigger that fires
whenever that document gets updated with
new data if you recall my fire store
database looks like this in the firebase
console you can see I have a collection
called city's weather where each
document tracks the weather conditions
over time in a city as I mentioned in
the last video I'm going to Boston soon
so I made an HTTP API endpoint that my
app can call to get the latest
conditions any app can pull this
location to check for updates to see if
something changed with the weather
conditions in Boston this is OK for
general use by anyone who knows the HTTP
endpoint but I have my own firebase app
connected to this project and I don't
want my app to keep pulling this
endpoint repeatedly to get updates
there's a better way to do this what I
want to do instead of polling is write a
firestore trigger that fires in response
to updates in the Boston weather
document with each update I'll use Cloud
messaging to send a notification to my
app to indicate a change in weather
conditions this is far more efficient
than repeatedly polling the HTTP
endpoint or even querying the document
directly and my app can always stay up
to date with the latest weather data
even when it's not running let's see how
to do that
here's the HTTP function from last time
that can be pulled for weather updates
in Boston what I'll do here is write a
new firestore trigger that fires in
response to updates to that document
I'll export it and call it on Boston
weather update then I'll use the
functions XDK to create a fire store it
responds to updates in the Boston
weather document I'll pass a function to
the on update method which will be
invoked whenever there's a change in
this document the function accepts a
change parameter that describes the
update that happened the change
parameter has two properties before and
after I'm interested in the contents of
the document after the change occurred
this after property is a document
snapshot with the updated contents of
that document so I'll use its data
method to convert it to a JavaScript
object now that I have the document data
what I want to do is build an FCM
message payload to send to my app I'll
paste some code here that I already
wrote FCM requires all the values to be
strings so I'm converting any numbers to
strings as needed now I'll use the admin
SDK to send this data payload to a topic
called weather underscore Boston this
lets every installation of my app
receive these notifications if it uses
the FCM SDK to subscribe to this topic
if you're not familiar with FCM that's
okay you can learn all about that by
clicking the links in the description
below it's a great way to keep your app
up to date with changes in your database
but there's one thing I forgot on my
code remember the second rule for
terminating all functions other than
HTTP triggers they must return a promise
that's fulfilled or rejected when all
the pending work is complete what I
forgot to check in my code is what the
admin SDK returns when I sent that
message so let's go see it in vs code if
I hover the mouse over send to topic vs
code will tell me its arguments and
return value and I can see here that it
returns a promise that means this
function returns immediately but it
isn't finished until the promise is
fulfilled or rejected so what I can do
here is return this promise from my
function and that will make cloud
functions wait until FCM is done before
cleaning up and moving on ok that's
better but there's still one thing to
consider remember that every promise
either becomes full
successfully or rejected with an error
so it's a good idea to think about if
you need to handle any error conditions
when you're dealing with the promise if
you remember from the last video you can
use the catch method on a promise to
trap any errors what I'll do is call the
catch method on the promised return by
send to topic I'll pass it a callback
function that handles the error
condition for now I'll just log it and
also note the catch itself returns a
promise when it's callback is complete
which is what this entire function is
actually returning now but if all you're
going to do is log the error there's no
reason to use catch here if I just
return the original promise as before
cloud functions will log the error if
the promise is rejected in that function
if I didn't return a promise that's
fulfilled when the admin SDK is done
sending the message asynchronously it's
very possible that the message would
never be sent because cloud functions
could clean up before the work is done
forgetting to return a promise can lead
to inconsistent bugs in your background
function you should always track the
promises returned by api's you call in
your functions that way you always
return a promise from your background
function this includes functions
triggered not only for changes in
firestore but also in real-time database
cloud storage authentication analytics
crashlytics and pub/sub and possibly
more to come you should know there's
still more to learn about promises next
time I'll talk about what you can do
with promises to manage more complicated
work in your function code so subscribe
here to the firebase channel on youtube
to get notified of that until then check
out some of the links in the
documentation in the description below
and I'll see you here next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
