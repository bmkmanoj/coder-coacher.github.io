on this week of hashtag as firebase
what's up everybody
David here and I can assure you that
this cup of coffee it's not a prop
that's tough welcome to ask firebase
where we cover all of your firebase
questions for Android iOS and web
development so we got a lot of questions
this week so Rodrigo asks on Twitter how
can i integrate firebase with my
Postgres database Thanks
Thank You Rodrigo how you do this is I'm
assuming that you're Postgres database
is on a server on your back-end
somewhere you can actually use the
server SDKs that the real-time database
provides and whenever something happens
in the real time database like there's
an update in real time or something like
that you can synchronize that data with
your Postgres database from the real
time database and if you go to our
documentation which is in the links
below you can see how to get started
with our server SDKs which are for
nodejs in java if you're not supported
with no GS or Java we have a REST API
which doesn't give you the real time
capabilities but still will work for any
back-end question time Bradley asks on
Twitter how expensive are observers for
the client so I'm assuming that you mean
real time database observers and to
think about this question we have to
think about it in two parts so the
observer that lives on the client just
thinks about synchronizing data from the
server to the client that part is really
not all that expensive what the second
part is is more expensive is the data
that comes down through that
synchronization so the data that's
downloaded over the network and that's
what you have to keep track of so if
you're only synchronizing like four
kilobytes of data 10 kilobytes of data
at a time you know that's pretty cheap
there's nothing you really have to worry
about there but when you're starting to
synchronize something that's like a
megabyte for every single change
you're gonna rack up quite the bit of
the bandwidth bill that's the type of
thing you need to look at when you're
wondering whether you're doing something
expensive time for another question
laxman on Stack Overflow asks what are
the differences between the real time
database and firebase storage well those
are two different types of data when you
think about the two of
so the real-time database is a JSON
database which means it stores string
and object based data you think about a
user profile you're going to store the
user's name their age you know their
location and all this basic information
about them and that is all really just
text-based string data that works great
in the real time database because we can
synchronize that data from the server to
the client so every time that user
updates their information you know your
app automatically gets that update so
now let's say the user wants to upload
their photo to their profile that data
is binary data which you really don't
want to put into the real-time database
because it doesn't fit in string form
unless you go and do something crazy
like base64 encode it and trust me you
don't really want to live that life and
this is actually where firebase storage
comes in firebase storage is exactly the
place where you want to put binary data
so things like images and video and mp3s
and pretty much really anything you can
imagine all goes there you can actually
use a download URL to store in your real
time database and then that way you can
say profile URL is this download link
that's stored in firebase storage so the
to work really well and tandem together
and then also you have security rules
for your real time database and security
rules in firebase storage so you can
still do the same permissions per user
across the two services you get a
question and you get a question and you
get a question TJ asked on Twitter David
will you be making a video for
retrieving data in real time with
firebase in Swift well TJ I may be
making this video or my colleague Todd
Kerpelman also might be making this
video but rest assured where you're
gonna get this video question alert JSON
on Stack Overflow asks what's the
difference between firebase cloud
messaging and firebase notifications so
while the names might be you know kind
of similar they do two totally different
things so firebase Cloud messaging is
the service that you use to send push
notifications to Android and iOS devices
you get an FCM token and then you use
that to send a post request to FCM with
your payload and that gets delivered to
that device now firebase notifications
uses firebase Cloud message
and it's more so a tool in the firebase
console rather than having to do that
post yourself this tool will formulate
everything that that post needs to send
that device going even further beyond
that you can use firebase analytics to
specify which users you want to send
this notification to so you can pick a
certain audience and so if you only want
to send this to users in the United
States or users in Canada you can do
that with firebase notifications
questions questions questions like well
on Twitter asks what's the best way to
handle multiple app flavors as in you
don't want to register crashes or
analytics on a dev environment versus a
production up well Mac well what you can
do is you can associate a different
package or app ID for your app in the
firebase console so you'll have a
development build and you'll have a
production build and that way that your
crashes and your statistics are isolated
to each one of those package names is
there another question why is there is
Tyler asked can I use firebase with
react native and yes Tyler yes you can
because as of the 3.1 version of the
firebase SDK the authentication and
database parts are compatible it's react
native and if you want to know how to
get started with that you can check out
our blog post and I have a sample github
repo that you can see the links in the
description wow that's a lot of
questions do we have room for another
question I think so last question a bass
will you update your legacy skateboard
to the new version of firebase oh yeah
so that's it for this week thank you all
for sending in your questions they were
excellent and make sure you tune in next
week for Wednesday at noon and send in
your questions on Twitter Facebook
YouTube you know whatever really using
the hashtag ask firebase and we'll make
sure to get it in next week's show if
you like this video make sure to LIKE
subscribe do all that great stuff and I
will see you guys next week
we do sack of a float too right yep some
in on stackoverflow I'll trade you and
answer for a question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
