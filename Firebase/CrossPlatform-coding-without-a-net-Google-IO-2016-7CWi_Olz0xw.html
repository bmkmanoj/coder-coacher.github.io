the net are you guys enjoying Google i/o
are you guys enjoying Google i/o oh
that's great because we are sure
enjoying Google i/o now let's imagine
that I am an angel investor for an
imaginary company that's building and
have a photo sharing app called no big
photo stir the app is called big photo
search and we are going to develop this
app on iOS as well as Android now
working yeah that's great isn't it now
working in a start-up is always a race
against time so we decided why don't we
just live code the entire thing here at
Google i/o so here are my co-founders
and coders and since this thing needs to
work on iOS as well as Android we've
chosen the technology will and launched
yesterday to be able to do this we've
chosen to do it on firebase because
using firebase we can easily get
firebase authentication firebase torts
and firebase state that we implement
yourself authentication to get the user
signed in firebase storage to store the
photos and then the firebase database to
share those photos to links to the
storage of all of these different things
or right but you their audience you need
to engage as well we got two microphones
here so please walk up to these
microphones and ask us questions at any
time to the coders to our staff chief of
staff or myself of course and we will
try to answer those questions and so let
me introduce the staff here so for
coders we have professor Ibrahim Ulukaya
and professor cal ready and for staff
oracle we have professor ian barber and
my name is magnus Sisseton so without
further ado let's unleash these for
coding hands onto their keyboard let
this epic event start let the race
against time begin so without actually
creating a new project on the firebase
console well go ahead and like start the
big photos here alright so you're gonna
see a lot of typos in this they're all
intentional it's taken and now I will
get like the or and Reuters yes so
actually our the Android and iOS app
will both share this same console so
once he gives me permissions to access
this project I can actually go ahead and
add in my shot here as well myself of
course if we were pivoting from another
start up we could actually import our
existing firebase app or our existing
Google project but we're starting
Greenfield so once once he does this
it'll download a Google services doc
JSON file and this file is what you need
to use in your IDE
in order to configure your project to
talk to firebase that's the case as you
can see we're starting completely from
scratch creating the project in firebase
consult
okay so I have there you go now please
note that we've almost spent one and a
half minute and we haven't started
coding yet but we just saw the complete
new project on the sign up here we go a
project creation in Xcode is if you see
anything you have questions about just
just run up and ask like there's no
specific question point so if you're
like why did we do that then I will do
this if you do have a question and you
come up and ask it I will launch a
t-shirt okay that's the incentive for
asking questions we could be far far
done this is me yeah I have a question
when starting and creating the firebase
application on the console it asks us to
choose a country that's not we have we
do not have this option in the last
version what is this for is the you have
local caching on that country that I
pick or is just for information for the
pain that's a great question so the
reason you choose a country at the start
there is actually for analytics so if
you've used previously Google Analytics
you'll notice that when you go and sign
up there you have to choose a country
because firebase analytics comes built
into all the firebase stuff it's exactly
the same so it's for analytics purposes
before let's mean that this data storage
is still okay in u.s. not on on any
other data center close to my country
why no it's actually the analytics
reason is a terms and condition reason
so it's it's kind of compliance reasons
all right who wants a t-shirt
I am a poet in salt and my workspace is
already here
I'll start creating a project not ok
support files are being downloaded we're
ready to know coding you're choosing
square it's like I'm having the live
demo issue here
so if Abraham as an experienced
professional is sticking with what he
knows and going with Objective C I think
no no yes Swift well we're so up today
it works off is that is that what I'm
missing I just made a typo there
thank you developers thank you live
coding developers web developers all
right yeah I'd say it's worth nineteen
actually all of these services are
available on the web as well where we we
didn't have a third code oh the budget
wouldn't stretch but you could go ahead
and build this exact same thing five a
storage fibers database and
authentication all work completely fine
from the JavaScript SDK
Oh Abraham is configuring the URLs in
order for authentication to work yeah
this is this is very professional
go ahead question on njoy for fireplaces
it depends on the Google page surfaces
yeah breakfast but are in some
developing countries their cell phone do
not have Google page services inside is
there any work on one for yeah so the a
5s SDK is delivered as part of Google
Play services in general it requires
that the phones deployed to do have
Google Play services on that which is
you know the bulk in many countries but
certainly there are some countries that
the deployment of that is is less common
we do have some api's that will work
even without that so if you're using a
light X or you use an AdMob you can go
and deploy that even to advice without
Google Play services but what we
recommend doing is actually building a
separate apk out to target those other
app stores if you're building something
without losing in just video if I do not
add Google servers as dependency then it
will have ever come out so I have to add
it I cannot take those away before
building the apk see you well you could
always build a product variant or a
build flavor of your application but the
dependencies fine The Client SDK will
compile in the problem is at runtime
where some of the services will actually
go and attempt to connect to the Google
Play services service in that case
that's gonna fail if that service isn't
there so what you can do is actually
flag off that functionality it depends
on the exact makeup of your app but for
example if you're using remote config
and remote config isn't available then
you can just not check it so you can use
the Google Play services available
function to actually check whether
Google Play services is on that device
or you can flag it off a build team by
using a Bill Murray
all right still working on off on the
iOS side how are we doing on cal side
making a sign in view all right as you
can see here there's the firebase off
accepts credentials from a number of
different services so these guys are
using Google but you can go ahead and
use Facebook you can use Twitter you can
use github which gives you a little bit
harder to demonstrate live cuz you need
a server but you can create a credential
for any of those services and pass it
through and use that to authenticate and
you can even link so if you have someone
that's signed in with Google and they're
maybe on another device they're signed
in with Facebook you can link those
accounts if you wish and then they can
be the same user in your app even though
they signed in with different providers
when you work in the enterprise world
you you have to deal with more security
and more authentication challenge so
this file based support ad Active
Directory authentication and other
mechanisms sort of indirectly so the way
that we support those things is through
a authentication mechanism called custom
tokens so what we effectively allow you
to do is authenticate using a token you
generate in that case you can do
whatever you want to work out who the
user is then you give us back a sign jot
JSON web token we then trust that so you
sign out we know you signed it therefore
the user is signed in so you say so you
can plug it into any authentication
mechanism you want with any kind of
security you want
if using that it just requires that you
have a server to generate that jot on
and taking back all my data on this
firebase cloud is encrypted oh is the
yeah everything's over HTTP the data um
that's a really good question I don't
know the answer
but all up there's the firebase sandbox
over there I'm not sure what the
situation is I'm pretty sure they
encrypt at rest but I don't know for
sure so pop over to the sandbox and
someone will know all right who wants a
t-shirt
and you have the first or I'll trade you
know
okay so we're closing I am only five
minute
we're still working with all on both
sides
almost down to 20 minutes out
and
so you can see why everyone's doing
their was getting a database reference
now if you've used firebase previously
you'll be used to actually doing like a
new firebase possible URL and it's gonna
pull from that path underneath the same
thing is happening except because
there's so many products in the new
firebase there's so many little features
we use a config file so there's a config
file that first thing that was
downloaded the Google services JSON or
the Google service info.plist that
contains that URL so when you call for
up configure or actually have Android
it's done automatically for you that
information just appears so you don't
have to specify the database Aurora
and he pinyin has started working on the
table view that will show the actual
photo stream we're now subclassing the
table view cell which be be a custom
cell in this table so we can see the
photo studio stream okay so on the
Android side you see that I've already
previously signed it on this device so
it says welcome back and it just shows a
blank UI for now because I don't have
any content here so now we've integrated
with auth I'm gonna work on adding the
actual actual cards to show posts from
firebase one of the other changes from
the old firebase you may have noticed is
the we're doing all first here the
reason for that is with firebase calm
when you signed up you were almost
certainly signing up to create a
database so the default security rules
well anyone can read anyone can write so
that you could just try things right
away because there are so many more
features people might sign up and not
think about the database so we didn't
want to have it default world writable
so the default rules in firebase tour
google comm are actually you must be
signed in to read alright because that
means the developers actually chosen to
enable an authentication provider so if
you're doing this and you like porting
an app over and you think hey this
should let me write immediately and
you'll get in an error that's why just
go into your security rules you can edit
them there or you can use one of the
earth options just to get started
and here we go the post object which
would actually be the different fields
that will be displayed in each of the
table cells
that's a terrible spelling of cell we
brain
we should mention this this is not best
practices coding this is rapid
development okay so whatever you see on
the screen here that doesn't mean that
should go in a professional app this is
just a hack to get this app going in 30
minutes just to be absolutely clear
about that we do believe this is the
future of startups though if you want to
pitch something you actually have to sit
there and develop it in the room with
the investors so we've got the new
keyword in Swift Ibrahim convenience
what is that we are actual I get stuff
like coin the full parameter the
initializer we are actually having like
a convenience in sizes so if you don't
give any parameters it will actually
cause other yeah the designated
initializer kalium on the Android try
also building out the layout of each of
the rows in the table that we will have
the stream of photos no questions come
on ask questions there's got to be some
question this is crystal clear all right
oh do handle account energy essence if
you had it like Facebook and Google Plus
on one device and we had like some sort
of party provider on another device and
we want to add Facebook from this device
to count on the second device asking
questions so there the whole question
was about how do you do the account
linking and the Cal merging so the
system kind of lets you flag ahead of
time whether you want to allow accounts
with multiple accounts for a given email
address so like the easiest thing to do
is just to start linking on the email
address so when you actually go into the
authentication console and the firebase
console you can check and it's
defaulting to check saying one email
address is one account in that case if
I've used Google and
signed an email address associated with
that and then I use Facebook and try and
sign in with the same thing you'll
actually get an error back on the client
saying hey we think we've seen this
person before and you will have to kind
of prove that it is the same person by
Brio thing with Google you can turn that
off so if you turn that off then it's up
to you at any given point you can call a
link with credential and that is going
to let you give it a new credential and
say hey the current user also has this
signer so if you say you're let's say
that you've signed in previously with
email password and then the user on the
web and then the user comes into your
Android app and signs in with Google
it's gonna say hey I think I've seen
this person before you can say oh we
already have an account for you is this
you if so enter your password once they
do that you'll get a new email
credential you link them and from then
on they can sign in using either
provider so it's somewhat manual but
once you've done it the user can sign in
using the whole things like a
client-side sort of yeah API okay thanks
you can also do things like email
verification on there so you can say go
send off an e-mail verification you can
say go send off the forgot password all
that kind of stuff do all that from the
client-side but it's sort of managed to
securely all right who wants a t-shirt
oh so I started doing some UI for myself
I'm customizing my itself I will have so
I will have the positive image the image
they will be posting and
so for the images were actually gonna
we're going to be using firebase storage
which is kind of an interesting product
because it wraps are a pretty well used
service which is Google Cloud storage
I don't have anyone here as as touched
on that at all but it's a that is a
really nice service for doing blob
storage you can pull up from your server
and push Bob's up very reliable are very
highly available the nice thing about
the firebase version of it is it lets
you may do it for user-generated content
without involving a server so you can
actually go straight from the client up
to cloud storage which is very very cool
alright question for Ibrahim why are you
using that editor instead of just
creating the cell layout in the table
view 12 sorry why are you using that
place cuz I wanna actually pop like two
pictures and the normal designated one
is like one picture and like a one text
I want to create customize the text so I
getting to the customize each cell that
I can use my own UI visually include
like to both users image as well as like
the post image
so still yes we have cow let's just
started the app right have you attend to
cated in our I've authenticated so it's
not surprising because I don't have the
post content regulations sorry on my
policies are using the Ola V our
semaphore call a firebase UI is already
but it is also compatible with the data
binding library yeah good question I had
a couple of people ask about this
because there was another Android tool
but they talked about the two-way
data-binding right yeah we we haven't
done that yeah so there's nothing in
firebase UI that supports it Wow
firebase UI is totally open source so
we've pull requests very welcome
otherwise we'll probably get to it at
some point but yeah the the two-way
binding sounds super cool and will work
exceptionally well with the with
firebase because you can just do that
thinking
they will compile after you you just
talked about firebase storage is it also
available for web applications and can
it be used to upload files from users
yes so yes it works on the web it is for
user uploads and the uploads can be
authenticated to a user so you can do
uploads just for that users only that
you can get is it free it is free to
stop so it's part of the free tier if
you go to five s to google.com there's a
pricing page on there that'll tell you
the limits so effectively we got three
plans on the pricing and this is a
little different from the old firebase
database some stuff that was pay is now
free and some of the the pricing is a
little bit different we think it's
cheaper so for most people if you are
transitioning it should should work out
cheaper but the storage you get a free
amount of storage and amount of data
transfer and then there's two paid plans
one of them's like 25 bucks a month and
that is also hard limits but much higher
hard limits and the final plan is a
metered amount so it's over you just
paper usage usually the paper usage one
if you get to the point of pain usually
the paper usage one will be cheaper but
we understand sometimes people want to
know it will never go above the surface
that's why we
all right we're down to ten minutes
where did this music come from some
that's just a countdown music every 10
minutes alright let's take the other
side again whoa that didn't go far
sorry feeling guys it is coming together
what's that it's coming together yes
good so what I'm doing now is I'm adding
an intent to launch the camera app and
take a picture so that we can take it a
new post and uploaded anybody how are
you doing let me listen controls at the
bottom
I'll get that happen
so did anyone spot how the Android app
was configured on on iOS we called fir
app configure in the app delegate did
anyone see how the Android one
initialized itself so this is a trick
question so I'm guessing you all really
smart there's no one for the handle so
the reason you didn't see any
configuration on Android is because it's
actually done automatically for you
there is a firebase app don't initialize
app method you can call that and you can
initialize the firebase app I'll go and
we read a bunch of values and get your
app going you didn't see it here because
by default on Android we actually call
that for you so we're gonna call that in
a content provider very early on and
that is gonna set the whole app up now
you might get into a situation where you
actually want to connect to two
different firebase projects this is
relatively rare but it's possible if you
do get to that you can actually create
another firebase app instance and
everything will just work
prepare the t-shirt cannon so he's
leaving come back
someone must have a question anything we
can talk about some of the other
products as well I know this is
authentication storage and database we
got config analytics number of things in
there you might be interested in we're
happy to take questions mainly to reduce
the pressure from Ibrahim kellian of
live coding in front of all of you which
seems terrifying I'm very glad I'm not
doing it yeah we should say that we have
the sandbox area over there there are 15
features in firebase right now before
yesterday was only 3 features available
14 of these features are available in
both Android and iOS so completely
cross-platform it's an important
strategy for us okay actually Cal's just
a really interesting point where he's
now using the five a storage API so if
you look at the Android thing you can
see this five a storage instance and the
reference it's intentionally very very
similar to the database so files are
presented as in a tree structure just
like with the database now it's not the
same tree if you have a database slash
users slash photo that is not the same
as storage slash users slash photo but
obviously using the two together is
pretty common once you've got a
reference you can do all the things
you'd expect you can upload files to it
you can get metadata back from it you
can download files from it and just like
with database there's a whole rules
language it's actually a slightly
different rules language because we were
working on taking some of the learnings
from vault and from the firebase
database rules and building even better
rules language that's actually launched
first with firebase storage so there's a
whole way of configuring who has access
who can read who can write and under
what conditions so it's all documented
on firebase Tallulah comm but it allows
you to do some pretty interesting thing
in terms of cherry and uncrating falls
all right we're almost down to five
minutes here how are you feeling over
there almost getting that really good
we'll see I was getting worried about
that error message board it stuck with
you for a long time so you said the
firebase storage has rules that you can
configure like so how fine-grain so can
you configure like only upload images
with a certain dimension alpha not not
on the dimension side I think no so Ian
do you know this the granularity of the
permission rights for talent for harvest
towards a granularity how do you mean
well I specifically I'm thinking like
you know if people are uploading an
image can you respect it certain
dimensions or like any other properties
of the uploaded file to constrain it you
know file size or that's a question
actually yeah I'm not sure what the
exact level of rules you can apply to it
you can definitely apply rules to the
user upload I think I think you can
apply those based on the file name I'm
not sure the best place detect would
definitely be there are a whole long
document on it on firebase to build a
column such doc slash storage that will
have the details of exactly what you can
filter but yes sorry I don't know Thanks
we should say that the firebase storage
is also based on the Google Cloud
storage the cloud storage component yes
so when you see the schema specification
GS column there that's because it's
based on Google Cloud storage so yeah
follow up on that question is can we do
data validation from the firebase side
versus on the content side so the
validation actually happens on the
firebase side so you write the rules
and you can you rent rolls kind of on
the console and then that is gonna
happen server side so you the client
can't you know skip them to ignore them
ready for each plane and don't it's a
one-time thing you just define the rules
and then they're going to apply which is
the same for database actually so in
both cases you define it it lives there
and then the clients are unable to
contravene those rules that is that two
t-shirts
Magnus or what that was two questions
that was two questions an accident so we
decided to narrow it's just five right
all right guys we got three minutes left
all right thing good if there's specific
areas you're interested in about
firebase there are a whole bunch of
sessions around the different aspects of
it so definitely check the schedule or
as Magnus said the sandbox we always
have a bunch of people hanging around
who know this stuff and can actually
answer questions online me and they are
if you have a question for saying go
over and ask them and if there's not
someone there that can answer it there
will be at some point so we'll we can
make sure we get some get back to you
within sir there's also as part of this
a whole developer support thing so we
will go and try and answer your stuff on
Stack Overflow on the firebase talk
group and all those kind of noil place
now after do you need ever Platon have
an exception but there's also a support
address that you can have so if you go
to fire based on google.com slash
support you can go and fill in a form
there that will actually go to one of
our sort support team we're gonna take a
look at it if they'll help you they'll
help you otherwise there'll escalate it
as far as needed to get you the answer
and we'd have office hours this
afternoon at five o'clock there will be
20 firebase PM's and engineers in the
office hours ten so check out the IO in
the back and join us for that we will
have expertise in all of the api's in
the office hours I didn't touch my
recyclerview to the adapter
one minute left guys
Magnus everywhere we go
now I can make a living
I'll ship it
I've a question when the images or files
are stored on the storage is there any
way of adding extra processing so if I
wanted to process like to create
thumbnails or to create like different
make crop versions is it a good question
so there's nothing built into 5/8 I'm
standing behind a pillow
there's nothing built into 5/8 storage
the lets you do like hey go and run this
processing on top of it but you can
access this stuff from anyway the way
I'd probably approach that is when you
write into storage also write into
database and have a server process
listening on the same database key so
it's like a uploaded images in database
you have a nodejs process listening on
that that can go fetch the image from
storage processor and upload the
thumbnails as well so there's stuff you
can do like that there's nothing sort of
built-in for doing kind of process flows
on um in in five storage yourself so we
actually pre-loaded this this app on our
other phones as well let me see if I can
get another picture here
all right well there's the Google i/o
password from this phone
and I'm gonna keep tweaking the UI so it
doesn't look so horrible here
already saying yes so the quite the
question was can Italian showed the sign
in UI and Android because he was already
signed into the app can use so actually
I don't have a sign out functionality
but uh so let's see we're gonna try to
kill the app and let's see if it
remembers me from last time
in the meantime actually while I'm like
so I think that the other Club like oh
my pen but the image is kind of years
he'll take for than a minute you don't
think that like Nick super faster you
actually spin up another emulator I'm
Steve yeah I'll be signed out of that
one that screen is big that's why it's
it's kind of looking like too much yeah
I can make that stopped best practices
this release physically in this time
I should be fitting you yeah I think
it's cuz they so that's see I got the
app pre-loaded here as well yeah there's
just a few guys smile let's see if the
elk Evo's alright sign in guys working
on anything else I know so I'm working
on adding a sign out but we probably
don't have three minutes but I yeah we
probably should let these people get
home exactly so it's so since I already
logged in it was already cached and so
if I don't exclusively add a sign out
function in my app to let it sign out
its gonna keep using the cash
credentials clear the emulator cache
let's try that
Hey
all right
let's give it a shot oh now it's going
to my other emulator let's stop this
it's pretty exciting waiting for bill
what did you do I came to Google i/o and
watched an app that's probably make some
are more robust emulators here there we
go come on
watched pot never boils watched progress
bar never finishes you can totally help
oh there you go
so there's the UI I can select my photo
and it will drop us into the main UI oh
I really need to change this icon from
male to UM ad
and conference Wi-Fi come on has anyone
got any other author questions the earth
stuff is largely similar to the previous
firebase database things but there's a
there are definitely a few new features
linking is new the some of the ability
to customize templates do things are
those new you can even off to projects
other than this one so if you're
importing both a firebase project app
and a Google project you can import the
firebase project and still use your old
Google project which is kind of cool
feature okay so now I'm authentic ated I
think I yeah yeah so that was the auth
flow I think I might have a bug in there
where I need to invalidate my
recyclerview so redraws once I have off
but yeah so there so that's that's what
an unstyled ought UI looks like and then
obviously as we have more time we can
start fleshing it out ibrahim how are
you feeling thank God I'm just like
finishing up like the upload feature
right now and I'll be there in a second
what does enterprise's do support for
our CI many providers we support our
email password anonymous should guest
access Google Twitter Facebook and
github
and actually the the odds library that I
don't know if you mentioned this before
but if you look at my Gradle file here
my Gradle Dependencies I'm using
firebase UI auth and firebase UI
database it's an open source library
that's on github now and you can use it
too for example here I have all my posts
inside firebase database and what this
does is creates a recycler view adapter
automatically to pull the posts and and
send them and and download them from
database and load them into into the
recycler view so it does all the
attaching listeners removing listeners
and all that for you and also it has the
odd component where I didn't need to add
any you know Google sign-in button face
book signing button and all that stuff
it'll the library handles all that and
you just start an intent to it and then
it'll authenticate your app alright I
think we have to close it down there
let's give our coders a big round of
applause and we go over to slides just
excite ya so please remember these are
hacks these are not best practices it's
not a professional app is just a test
app for this session so thank you very
much very happy that you could come here
and look at this slide coding and please
remember go to all of the firebase
things that we've got going on in
particularly office hours that we have
