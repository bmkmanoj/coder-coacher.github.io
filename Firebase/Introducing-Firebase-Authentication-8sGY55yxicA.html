end users and developers most
applications need to know the identity
of the user so they can provide a
customized experience and keep their
data secure firebase supports lots of
different ways for your users to
authenticate if your users want to
authenticate with their email address
you can build that for them
firebase off has built-in functionality
for third-party providers such as
Facebook Twitter github and Google it
can also integrate with your existing
account system if you have one you're
given the choice about how to present
login to the user you can build your own
interface or you can take advantage of
our open source UI which is fully
customizable and incorporates years of
Google's experience in building simple
sign-in ux no matter which one you use
once a user authenticates three things
happen information about the user is
returned to the device via callbacks
this allows you to personalize your apps
user experience for that specific user
the user information contains a unique
ID which is guaranteed to be distinct
across all providers never-changing for
specific authenticated user this unique
ID is used to identify your user and
what parts of your back-end system
they're authorized to access firebase
will also manage your user session so
that users will remain logged in after
the browser or application restarts and
of course it works on Android iOS and
the web that's firebase off allowing you
to focus on your users and not the
sign-in infrastructure to support them
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
