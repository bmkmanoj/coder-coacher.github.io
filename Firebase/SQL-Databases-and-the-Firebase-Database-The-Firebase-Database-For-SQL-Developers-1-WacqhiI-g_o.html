breathing's hey everyone welcome to the
first ever episode in the firebase
database for sequel developer series in
this lesson i'm going to teach you the
differences between how data is stored
in sequel databases and in know sequel
databases like the firebase database so
to take a look let's dive on down to the
laptop relational databases use tables
to store data and a table is made up of
columns and rows and a column is a field
of data like name birthday or location
in a row is the entire record that
represents that entity so in this case
it would be like a customer and then
honestly nothing says sequel more than a
table full of customers
hash tag sequel joke now how do we know
that each one of these columns is going
to have a valid input what happens if we
leave one of them blank well to prevent
this we use schemas a schema is like a
blueprint it defines how the data is
organized it specifies what the column
name is what the data type is and
whether it's required these
specifications are called constraints
because they constrain some property of
the data one of the most special
constraints is called the primary key
and each row has one and a primary key
must be unique because it's used to
uniquely identify each record if you
want to insert data into this table you
write an insert statement where you say
what table you want to insert into and
then also your fields of data and then
the values of those fields now let's say
I want to add another field like last
name what happens if I just go in and
add that to my insert statement and you
know click execute well it's not going
to let me do that and that's because the
last name isn't already in our schema so
if we want to insert last name we need
to go and write an alter statement to
add it to the schema this alter
statement adds the last name column but
it also adds a constraint stating it
can't be null and right now that's kind
of a bit of a catch-22
- because how can I add the not know
constraint if there aren't any last
names in the table to begin with well to
fix this catch-22 you're going to have
to add the new column without the not
null constraint and then manually go
through your database and add the last
names into each row then after you've
done that you can come back in and alter
the column to add the not null
constraint and then you're finally done
sequel databases are strict to ensure
integrity but it can be kind of
difficult when you first start out
developing because you don't exactly
know what your schema is and also you
might have a rapidly changing data
structure so you're constantly altering
your schema and migrating data and when
you're modeling data relationally not
everything always just fits and this is
where no sequel databases like the
firebase database come into play the
firebase database is a no sequel JSON
database which is a fancy way of saying
it's just a JSON object JSON is really
simple it has keys and has values a key
is an identifier and a value is you know
lots of value like tables how do we know
what each key will accept as a value is
there a schema that we can use well the
firebase database like most no sequel
databases are actually schema lists
which means you don't have to decide
what your data structure is up front to
start inserting data and this provides
you a lot of flexibility so you don't
have to go back and alter your schema
just to update data however just because
you don't have to specify a schema it
doesn't mean that you can't validate the
types of data that are being saved to
the database the firebase database has a
rules language called security rules
security rules allow you to specify the
shape and size of data before they get
saved to the database these rules can be
written after you've settled on what
data structure works best for you so it
provides you with a lot of flexibility
you can think of security rules as
constraints and sequel this example rule
checks any direct child Keys underneath
the customers key every time there's a
new child saved
the rule checks to make sure that first
name is a string birthday is a number
and location is also a string and if
this expression fails then the data is
not safe
so you're still able to validate your
data structure as if it was a schema
with constraints insert data you use the
firebase SDK you first grab the database
object and then you create the reference
to where you want to save the data and
in this case we're creating a reference
to the customers location from there you
specify what the child key is underneath
the parent key and this child key is
like your primary key because it's
unique within that collection and after
that you can just go and save your data
and this key is unique due to the nature
of JSON if you try to add another key of
customer 1 to this data structure
it'll just replace the existing one so
essentially there's no way to have two
customer one keys underneath the
customers key in this example you can
think of customers as a table and
customer one as your primary key but
it's not always that cut-and-dry know
sequel databases can be used in this
table and row structure but you have a
lot of flexibility since you don't have
to adhere to a schema so there's
sometimes better options you can use to
structure your data the main difference
between sequel databases and no sequel
databases is integrity and flexibility
sequel databases are really inflexible
but they provide a lot of integrity and
no sequel databases are really flexible
but some of the data integrity is left
up to you the developer which you saw
with security rules so in the next
lesson I'm going to take a look at a
more advanced relational model and then
convert that to a no sequel database and
