fire based dynamic link to deep link
into your app well you've come to the
right place let's get started with
dynamic links on this episode of fire
casts so firebase dynamic links their
deep links that work the way you want
them to with one single link you can
take users right into the app on the
appropriate platform if they have it
installed or the appropriate App Store
if they don't and better yet they
survive the App Store installation
process sound good well let's get into
building one so there are three main
steps in implementing firebase dynamic
links in firebase first we need to
perform some additional configuration
steps in the firebase console and our
Xcode project second we'll need to
create an actual dynamic link for
testing and then finally we'll need to
add some code into our app delegate to
read in and parse in a dynamic links and
then pass them off to the rest of our
app to handle sound like a plan great so
before we get started let's take a
moment to understand how dynamic links
get passed into your iOS app there are
two ways you'll see this happen first is
through Universal links you probably
know what Universal links are but if you
don't they're essentially a way for app
developers to map their website to their
iOS app by placing a little apple app
site Association file on their website
now this file tells iOS that any content
found at certain locations on your site
is also available on your app so an iOS
encounters these URLs it will open up
your app without going through Safari
then it will pass that URL directly into
your apps that your app can handle it
and then show the user the right
information now don't freak out if
you're like I've never set up Universal
links for my web site you don't have to
see what happens is when you use
firebase dynamic links all these links
start with the domain that looks a
little something like this
well firebase will create its own little
mini website at that domain then it will
add its own apple app site Association
file that points from this domain right
into your app so an iOS runs into a URL
at this domain it opens up your app
instead so you don't need to do the work
required to set up your website for
dynamic links you just need to flip or
switch or two to enable it on your
client now the other way dynamic links
can sometimes make it into your app even
an iOS 9 is through custom URL schemes
basically you can think of these like
normal URLs except that instead of
starting with something normal like HTTP
they start with something
unique for your app your app basically
tells iOS that it claims any URLs that
begin with this scheme and then when iOS
encounters any one of them it'll pass it
along to your app to open in our case
we're going to use our apps bundle ID as
our custom URL scheme which you can
totally do even though it might look a
little funny
now I'm going to start with an app where
I've already created a project in the
firebase console and performed all the
initial setup steps don't know what I'm
talking about you should watch this
video first and then come back ok first
things first let's set up our app to
receive Universal links so I'm going to
jump into the firebase console here
select my project then go into project
settings and for my iOS app I'll need to
make sure that the team ID here is my
team's iTunes team ID don't know what
that is you can go to developer Apple
comm slash account this is like
membership and you should see it there
and then you can copy and paste it into
this field here on the firebase console
now while I'm at it this might be a good
time to set my App Store ID if it's
blank if you're working on a published
app go ahead and select your actual App
Store ID otherwise if you're fooling
around with the test app like I am go
ahead and pick your favorite published
app I'm just going to go with YouTube
gaming here ok now this is done firebase
is going to go and create that mini
website with an apple app site
association file pointing to our app in
fact we can check it out right now
I'm going to select the dynamic link
panel here select get started and I can
see that my dynamic links are going to
start with this domain yours will be
different but go ahead and copy it into
your browser and then add in the path
apple app site association afterwards so
if all looks good you should see a
little JSON something like this see this
section here basically says that any URL
sent to this domain will go directly to
my app on iOS ok next up we're going to
need to make sure our client can handle
these incoming links so go ahead and
open up your Xcode project or go ahead
and create a new one here if you're just
experimenting select your target and
then over here in the capabilities tab
you're going to want to turn on
associated domains now depending on the
developer account you're using Xcode
might just think for a second and then
enable this for you but if that doesn't
happen it might mean that you're going
to need to talk to whoever has access to
the Apple developer portal and ask them
to turn it on for you basically what
this means is your Apple
developer administrator person is going
to go over to the identifiers section of
the Apple developer portal here and
either create a new identifier for your
app or select an existing one and edit
it and enable associated domains among
the services they might also need to
create a separate development
provisioning profile for your app that
they will download and send you to
install which you can usually do just by
double-clicking on it either way you
should then be able to turn on
associated domains in your capabilities
now once you've done that you're going
to need to enable the domain of the
dynamic link short link so I'm going to
start by typing app links colon and then
I'm going to go back to the firebase
console here and copy and paste the
domain from here and then I can paste it
into here
remove this HTTPS vid in the trailing
slash and you should have something that
looks a little like this okay so
Universal links are done let's support
custom URL schemes
now this one's pretty easy from within
Xcode select your target then select
info now down at the bottom where it
says URL types hit the plus sign for
your identifier you could leave it blank
but I like to give it a name like bundle
ID then where it says URL schemes go
ahead and add your actual bundle ID dots
and all a little something like this
great we're all set up in fact you
should be able to test this now one
thing about Universal links is that they
won't work if you just cut and paste the
URL into the address bar and Safari you
need to click on these URLs from
something like Safari or the Notes app
so to do that I'm going to test this on
my actual device which I'll show in a
QuickTime window hey there first I'm
going to run the app next I'll switch
over to notes where I'll create a note
and I'll include this URL let's go back
to the console here and make sure I get
the domain right okay get that in there
alright good now I'll click on it and
you can see that iOS switches over to my
app that's great so now we're on to step
two let's create a real dynamic link now
there are two ways to do this
programmatically but the easiest way is
just to jump into the firebase console
and create one there so I'll go back
into my project make sure I'm in the
dynamic links section then click this
new dynamic link button
I'll give it a link name like my very
first link I'll select my iOS app here
and if this app had an Android
equivalent
there'd be another drop-down for my
Android app make sure you select that as
well because that's what allows this
dynamic link to also take Android users
to your Android app and then there's
this link parameter hmm so the link
parameter is the data that's going to
get passed into your iOS or Android app
you might expect this to be say a JSON
blob or something but you'll notice that
dynamic links requires this to be a URL
and that's because if you were to open
this dynamic link on a non I oh s or
Android device like a desktop browser
the link parameter is where we would
take your user and that's why it's got
to be an actual web URL so if you're a
company where the content of your app
very closely mirrors the content of your
website it's probably best if this link
parameter basically points to the
corresponding content of your website
for starters it'll take people the right
place if they open this link on a
desktop browser but it also means they
can probably piggyback on any Universal
link logic you may have already set up
to turn these links into view controller
destinations similarly it means your
Android compatriots can do the same
thing with app links if they've got that
set up on their side now on the other
hand if you're an app like say a game
where your apps content isn't really
mirrored at all on your website go ahead
and make it any link you want but I
might recommend putting them all in the
same root directory so that you can
easily redirect people from these URLs
back to like a marketing page or
something if they were to open this
dynamic link on a laptop make sense all
right let's head back to our console now
I'm going to add the very inventive link
parameter of HTTP colon slash slash dub
dub example.com slash data slash
and I'm clever now my link is not an ad
so I can leave this unchecked and I
don't really need I need these Advanced
Options but you can see these include
things like my Apple affiliates token or
my UTM tracking parameters which are
useful if you want to measure the
effectiveness of a marketing campaign so
I'm just going to click create here and
then you can see I've got my dynamic
link ready to go nice now dynamic links
automatically shortens this link for me
but if I click on link details here I
can see the link parameter along with
the full dynamic link that this short
link represents I sometimes like to
refer to this full link when I'm curious
about how I might build a link
programmatically but that's a topic for
another video now I can also try out
this link on my device bypass
two notes although as these links get
longer I sometimes like texting to
myself and hangouts or iMessage and just
like before when I click on it it opens
up in my app and just like before my app
doesn't really do anything with this
link yet so let's fix that as a general
rule reading and dynamic links are
pretty straightforward we're going to
pass in any incoming URL to the dynamic
links library and it either returns for
us either a dynamic link object if it
can parse it properly or a null object
if it can't so let's do that now
first off I'll need to make sure that I
have the dynamic links library installed
so I'll open up my pod file and add
firebase slash dynamic links to my list
of pods we'll exit this and then run pod
install alright that's better now
remember that incoming URLs can reach
our app in two places for universal
links we handle those in our app
delegates application continue user
activity restoration handler method so
let's make one of those
first off I'll check and see if I have
an incoming URL here by checking if user
activity dot webpage URL exists if it
does I'll want to call dynamic links dot
handle Universal link on the incoming
URL this is what's going to parse this
incoming dynamic link URL and turn it
into a dynamic link object note that it
returns a boolean right away if it
believes this is parsable but then gives
me the object itself in a separate
callback and that's cuz in some cases
like expanding a short link into a long
link we need to make a network call so
it won't be quite instantaneous so in
this callback I'm going to check that
this dynamic link object exists and that
it contains a URL parameter this URL
parameter is basically the link variable
that I entered back when I was using the
firebase console so if it does I'll send
this object on to a handle incoming
dynamic link method that alright in a
moment and if not well I'll probably
want to investigate the contents of this
error object okay let's finish up this
method I still need to return a boolean
and I can say return link handled here
although keep in mind that if you are
using Universal links for other things
don't do this do a you know if link
handle return true else do other stuff
here and then here at the end I'll
return false since I've got nothing that
could handle this incoming activity now
as for this handle incoming dynamic link
method I'm just going to start by
printing out my dynamic links URL
parameter
and actually you know that's all I'm
gonna do now let's give this a try so
I'm going to run my app and hmm
well normally this would work but
something weird happened to me when I
first did this recording I got this
uncaught exception error where configure
durable deep link fails now I'll be
honest I've used deep links a bunch and
this is the first time I've ever
encountered this error but I decided to
leave this in my screencast just in case
this happens to you see after some
investigation I discovered this error
occurred because my Google services
plist file was somehow missing its API
key entry now luckily this is very easy
to fix I just went to the firebase
console went back to my project settings
here andrey downloaded the plist file I
have to you know rename it to get rid of
that too in parentheses and then I'll
just delete the old one for my project
and drag the new one into Xcode and back
out everything working again so like I
said I don't know if you're ever going
to get an error like the one I just did
but if you do that's apparently how you
fix it anyway now I'm going to run my
app I'll switch over to notes and click
on the link and this takes us back into
my app and we can now see in my Xcode
log that it's successfully extracted my
hello world link parameter nice oh and
just because I'm sure I'll get flack if
I don't
let's make self a weak reference in this
block I'm going to use this idiom here
that I copied from the Ray Wonderlic
Swift style guide okay that's better but
like I said there are two ways of
getting a dynamic link even on iOS 9 or
greater you're still going to need to
handle dynamic links sent through custom
URL schemes this is typically for when a
user first installs your app via a
dynamic link so we'll add the code for
it and then I'll show you how to test it
now in my iOS 9 app I'm going to capture
any incoming custom URL schemes by using
the application URL options method
although keep in mind that if you're
still supporting iOS 8 or earlier you
should use application URL source
application annotation now I can pass
this link on to the dynamic links
dynamic link from custom scheme URL
method this works very much like the
handle incoming link method but it's
instant so there is no callback and just
like before I can send the dynamic link
object that gets created to my apps
handle incoming dynamic link method now
if an object doesn't get created well it
means it couldn't parse this URL
properly and I might pass it off to
other libraries that might make use of
it oh and while I'm here I'll also print
out a little debug info so that I know
I've received a link through a custom
URL scheme instead of a universal link
so now how do we test this I suppose one
way would be to test this on an iOS 8
device but there's another way and
that's to simulate installing the app
for the first time so first I'm going to
go to my device and uninstall the app ok
next I'm going to go back to notes and
click on this link since I no longer
have the app installed it's going to
take me to the App Store page for the
YouTube gaming app remember that's the
ID I supplied way back at the beginning
of this video now will simulate my app
getting installed and open for the first
time by running my app from Xcode you'll
see that when I open the app for the
first time it once again finds my
dynamic link information and we can see
by the line the log here that it did so
through a custom URL scheme gray so now
as far as actually processing this link
parameter goes that's really up to your
app here in my handle incoming link
method I could probably parse the app
like so and do something interesting
with the path components oh but there is
one last thing I should probably call
out you'll notice that every dynamic
link has this parameter called match
confidence this lets you know how
confident the library is that you've
gotten the dynamic link for your
intended user now on iOS 9 and later
this will almost always be a strong
match that's a good thing but for iOS 8
and earlier devices there's a chance
that this value will be weak if your
dynamic link has a weak match confidence
you need to handle the possibility that
you might have the wrong link in a case
like a coupon code or like a link that's
coming through a marketing campaign it's
not really a big deal but if you're
dealing with the link that has
resulted from user to user sharing this
could be a big deal you don't want to
leak any kind of personal data so
depending on the link that comes in you
might want to sanitize it or even ignore
it completely do something like this oh
that was kind of a scary note to end on
let's end on a happier note by seeing
that dynamic link work one more time
we'll click on the link check the
console oh yeah yeah that's the stuff so
there you go kids everything you need to
get started using dynamic links in your
own apps now there's certainly more we
could get into like talking about what
those advanced parameters mean or
building out your own dynamic links from
within your app but these are topics
best left for other videos in the
meantime go ahead and check out the
documentation here and start linking
