episode of fire cast we're gonna be
covering the real-time database and the
web and we're actually picking up where
we left off last time where we talked
about synchronizing data in real time
using the value event and we're going to
move on from the value event and take a
look at child events and just as a
reminder this is one of many many many
episodes on firebase in the web so make
sure you subscribe so you get updated
every time we post a new video but today
we're going to focus on child events
which are a great way of getting
granular control over your data
synchronization so it's great for lists
so if you want to know when something's
been added removed or updated you
synchronize to that specific child event
and you're ready to go so we're going to
take the object that we synchronize last
time and turn it into a list so let's
get started so inside the data viewer I
can actually just provide a little JSON
object I'll give it a key of coffee and
a value of coffee and just like that
I have the beginnings of a list so let's
go and add another hobby let's say that
I also like ponies because who doesn't
love ponies and just like that I have
two items in my hobbies list so now that
we have a list let's use child events to
display this list so I'm going to create
an unordered list and give it an ID of
list so I'm going to switch over to my
app j/s and I'm going to grab the list
from the Dom just using document dot get
element by ID and then I'm going to
create a reference for it and I'm going
to call a DB ref list
so for DB ref object we created a
reference at the root and then we
created a child reference to this object
and now we know that we have a list of
hobbies so for this hobbies list we
could just it array inside of this real
time listener because we are getting the
hobbies back inside of this snapshot
value but it would be a lot more simple
to just create a reference to
synchronize these hobbies you might
wonder
isn't that downloading the data twice
and the answer to that is actually no
because all this data is served from a
nice little cache
and so since this data already exists
since we're downloading it in the value
event it will also exist here in the
cache so it only goes over the network
once so I'm going to use D bereft object
and then just call that child of hobbies
so now I want to synchronize the list
changes and if you remember to do that
we go on to the reference so DB ref
lists and we call the on method so the
first parameter is the event type and
previously we use value to think ranae's
any change at all for the object but we
want to know just a granular change so 1
granular change you might want to know
what the list is when children have been
added to the list and for that we can
use the child added event and much like
the value event it to also takes this
callback function and the callback
function returns to us a data snapshot
so let's just go and log the value to
the console what makes this child added
event different than the value event
well let's go and see it in the browser
so when I boot up my web app I have two
values printed to the console coffee and
ponies which is the list right here and
so you might be thinking well that makes
sense because it's when children are
added to the list but no children were
added these were just existing values so
why were they printed to the console
well one common misconception with the
child added event is that it only fires
off when children are added after you
are connected but that's not the case
what actually happens is is that it's
list synchronization so it will read for
every existing object and now if we
actually go and add another item
so we'll say skateboarding is another
hobby that will also be printed out to
the console so the child added event
synchronizes each item one at a time as
its added to the list but there's
something important to note about the
child added event and dealing with lists
in the real time database
and that's to do with sort order so
let's go and add an item just call it a
you might notice something interesting
here is that to the right we have coffee
ponies skateboarding and a and to the
left we have a coffee ponies and
skateboarding and these two are not the
same order and why is that well the
real-time database sorts itself
Lex eco graphically which is a really
fancy alphabetical sorting which not
going to get totally into but just think
of it as alphabetical sorting and right
here that makes sense a CPS but here
we'll only adding items as they're being
added to the database so it does not
regard sort order it only regards them
as they're being added so if you care
about sort order you can either do some
stuff with querying or you can use push
IDs which is calling a method called dot
push which generates an ID that helps
keep your sort order by adding the
recently added items to the bottom but
we are going to go over that in a later
video so now that we know how the child
added event works let's go and add list
items to our unordered list so let's
create a list item with document create
elements and then we're going to tap
into the inner text with the snapshots
value and then we're just going to
append the child to the unordered list
now on our web app we have our initial
three items and let's go and add another
one so it's at Z Z Z which obviously
stands for sleep because I love sleep
and that gets added to our list in real
time but now let's say we want to go and
add another item so I'm going to add a
back again and that adds to the bottom
or a list which is what we expect
because we're only adding children to
the list as the child added event fires
off but now let's go and actually modify
the value of a and change it to B and
you can see that nothing happens
and then when I delete it you can see
that still nothing happens to my list
even though it was changed in my object
and that's because the child added event
only cares about when children are added
to the list it does not listen for when
that child has been changed or when that
child has been removed and so there are
two other events that we can listen to
for that so for updating children as
they are changed or removed we're going
to make that easy by adding an ID to the
list item so we're going to call Snap
key and snap that key is just the key
name for each item so you can see here
in the Dom that we have our unordered
item of list and each one has an item of
their key names so coffee pony
skateboarding and sleep and if we hover
over them you can see it's each list
item so just like child added we're
going to listen on the ref list but
we're going to listen to the child
changed event and this is similar to
child added but it only gets called when
children have been changed and this also
takes in a callback function that
returns a snapshot and then using this
snapshot we can get a list item from the
Dom but we can get it from the Dom by
using the key so the key will correspond
to that specific list item whose value
needs to be updated so it update it will
just grab the item and then change its
inner text with these snapshots value
and so now that will update items when
they're changed but we also need to
update them when they are removed so we
actually just copy this and paste it
then change the event type from child
added to child removed and if you've
caught on by now you'll probably figure
that this will be fired off every single
time a child has been removed and the
snapshots value will be the item that
has been removed so with this
information we can actually change the
variable name to Li to remove and then
just call remove on it so now let's test
this in the browser
let's go and change the value of sleep
to Big Sleep
and like it's updated and then if we
remove it removes from the Dom so that's
everything you need to know to get
started with child events so all you
need to know is is that it helps you
keep track of when items have been added
changed or removed in a list so now that
you know how they work what are you
going to use them for in your app
because you can pretty much use them for
anything so let me know in the comments
below and make sure you check out the
firebase documentation to learn more and
the link for that is in the description
so that's all for today I will see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
