and we really started because the
problem that we had which was asking the
same questions our closest friends where
are you what are you doing
we were baffled by the fact that there
wasn't a solution that solve this
problem and we felt like we could build
one that was better the value that is
drives for all users is knowing which of
your friends are nearby so if you look
around where we are right now in arena
how many times have people go on to a
basketball game hockey game or a concert
and found out the next day that they had
friends were at the same event and think
about all those moments that are missed
because they didn't know they had
friends there so what we're solving is
letting people know who's nearby in
making those moments matter my name is
diesel pelts and I'm the founder and CEO
of is I'm mark French co-founder of is
we felt there was no reason users should
manually go fetch data when I get a text
message or no reason for me to tap
refresh we felt why should it be
different from anything else inspired
based let us solve that firebase really
allowed us to enhance user experience by
making it real-time simplified UI by not
having a fresh button and cut down and
developing time like any startup the
most valuable asset that you have is
your team and your time and what
firebase is allowed us to do is save 50
percent in terms of time by moving that
much quicker with a product it's a game
changer we're using 8 features from
firebase right now air analytics remote
config dynamic claims the real-time
database and more traditionally that
would have been in 8 different places
and now we go to one place for the
firebase console or eager to launch this
product in a big way we're seeing how
people are using the product and how
they're inviting me
and that were concerned we're growing
very very quickly
so we sleep a lot easier at night
knowing that we got firebase that's
really there to build that
infrastructure if you're a developer use
it we love it and it's enabled us to
focus on developing your user experience
and not have to worry about the things
in the background that should be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
