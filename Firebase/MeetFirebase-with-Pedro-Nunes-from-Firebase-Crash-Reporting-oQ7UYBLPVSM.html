when you get to meet the Googlers that
make firebase happened on the show with
me today is Pedro Nunez Pedro everyone
if you have you on the show nice to be
here what do you do with the firebase
team I'm the tech lead for the front end
for crash reporting and I also help out
around the console around the whole
other products as well and I've been
focusing most more recently on mobile
responsiveness of the console if anyone
at home has used firebase crash
reporting they've probably seen your
work already hopefully hopefully they
like to do yeah well I like it i've
gotten a lot of you said of it but about
you where are you from originally I'm
from portugal i was born in the tiny
island between lisbon in New York called
Posada it means third in Portuguese and
it's part of the archipelago lasers
lasers yeah Anthony Bourdain likes it
yeah yeah well that's how I found out
about it too watching his show so what
are some interesting things about the
Azores it's extremely green it's
extremely beautiful and untouched nature
is just overwhelmingly beautiful it also
has very interesting and unique
traditions a memory around bullfighting
but in none not in that traditional way
that we know it has a different
philosophy behind it you also have very
interesting culinary vicious especially
being an active volcano alone there's a
very well-known stew please in portugal
that it's cooked underground so if you
go too near geysers own and you dig a
hole and wrap food around the blanket
bury it back for hours later it's great
Oh in the volcano cooks for stew yeah
the soil is that hot wow it's amazing
I'd have to try that sometime should see
were born in Azores and then you move to
Portugal what did you do there I'm up to
the mainland together with my family
when I was about six and crew up part of
my life there as well and then
eventually i joined College in Queen
bruh which is a very old college very
interesting experience as well yeah and
you study compete
science there I do and then at the
beginning of your career you became a
software engineer but you didn't stick
with that so what happened I didn't I
worked there for two years in Portugal
and eventually I wanted to try something
else I wanted to see what it was like to
live abroad to work abroad to do other
types of work and I did there was an
opportunity to join Google in Ireland
doing customer support and that's what I
started doing so you transferred
essentially into customer support role
right but you still found ways to make
your engineering background work that's
correct that was doing customer support
and after a while of doing support you
end up realizing at least in our case
that there's a lot of processes that
look repetitive and if something is
repetitive enough then you can automate
it so I started automating some of those
processes and doing internal cooling and
dashboards for that department and
eventually I moved back into engineering
again yes so he became a software
engineer at Google and then you joined
the firebase team which is kind of where
we are now through you mentioned you
grew up in the Portugal area then you
move to ireland and you didn't stay
there you actually like traveled all
over the world right yeah I've been
traveling a lot traveling is something
that I love it just provides unique
experiences and knowledge of people in
the world it's just like building
software right you cannot feel one
experience it needs to be dynamic enough
and if you don't understand really the
people and how different places or
markets or whatever it's never going to
be great and so how widely have you
traveled throughout the world I've been
to about 50 countries a little bit more
Wow 50 countries but what is one place
in particular that really stood out to
you where you really had a great
experience every place is very unique
and very different and special in many
ways most recently I was in Vietnam and
that was a very unique experience you
travel through these isolated regions
you see these small communities that
live and work in the rice fields every
day
you understand that the same constructs
that we have in our society as being
rich or as being poor it's really
different they don't care about your
color about your height of us your
anything it's just to give you
everything people are just genuinely
good it was an amazing learning
experience you probably imagine taking
all these experiences and brought them
into the firebase experience of some
degree so I know on the firebase team
you've tried to make the firebase
console very easy to use on mobile
devices yes yes that is something that
is very important not only about mobile
responsiveness so that you can you know
it's important to see crash details or
whatever it is that you are looking for
at that particular moment without having
to wait to get home or to get to a
desktop but also because throughout the
world there's different infrastructure
so it's important to make the console
the console very responsive and very
fast on you know slow connections on all
these different types of environments so
that it becomes accessible for everyone
for crash reporting in particular I
imagine there's a particular need to be
able to triage and respond to crashes
there is we actually made that and it
became very evident and it's actually
highly used now with the new releases
the alerts which gives an entry point to
the console and I mean when was the last
time you opened an alert on your desktop
yeah we do that on if you go the button
says view details doesn't say open later
that's exactly the point yeah well so I
hope a lot of people find that very
helpful being able to view the console
more easily on mobile device so
something in the news recently Google
announced that they are acquiring fabric
which includes crashlytics which is
another crash reporting tool and so I
think a lot of developers are probably
wondering which one do I choose do I
choose crashlytics or do I choose
firebase crash reporting what kind of
advice do you have for them about that
well developers should evaluate both
options and go with the one that serves
their immediate needs crashlytics
shining Google should not affect anybody
life today or tomorrow Google should
provide
smooth transition throughout the process
as we as time folks alright great so it
sounds like no matter what developers
choose Google got their back so that
they won't have to have some sort of
rocky transition threads are you sure
yep they should not okay so I have a
game to play with you now about crashing
all right so I have a tablet here and
what I've got is a series of code chunks
that either definitely will crash or
make rash but sitting on some
circumstances so I'd like you to take a
look at these and see what you think and
we'll we'll score them at the end so the
first one is Java right you can see the
most okay these will essentially raised
a lot of bonds exception and it's out of
bounds yeah when the I reaches the link
right so how would you fix this one room
of the equal remove v equals so it's
just I less than right arcs out length
okay yeah so yeah we're definitely
crawling off the end of the array all
right next question this one is see ooh
Italy no oil this is a little tricky one
this is a little creaky one so there's a
pointer a chair pointer there's
directors open I actually don't know how
they are getting dressed haha it's a
trick because the code looks like it's
trying to replace the first character of
the string from our to T right and then
printing it out but that second line
where the string pointer equals T that's
actually going to crash because it's not
indexing into the string it's actually
messing with the string pointer itself
so it's a it looks like it'll work but
it actually doesn't work alright move on
to the next one this one is back to java
so you have a function f s is null you
switch on argh if R equals key and you
want to know the length of s yeah these
might crash is there's no default on the
switch this will crash if arg does not
eventually match t1 or t2 yeah so what's
fee expired the exception there's no
point to accept no pointer exception
that's right very cool let's go to the
next one so you have an object route
that has a bunch of entries that
our functions then you have this
dispatch function which is going to call
on this the parameter routes will
potentially have the value of Route 1 or
a 2 flex oh yeah so this will be will
fetch one of those functions and it will
call that function when we know you have
route yeah the value of relatives will
be like wrasslin for example correct and
then you're going to call that function
again and again and again I don't
understand well let's take a look
consider if route doesn't match one of
the entries in the routes object if
route has the value of Doug sure example
why would I have to value at me right
that will be undefined undefined is not
of functions that that classic then
you're going to call function with
undefined in with args you're going to
call the routes with undefined yeah
you're going to end out our with an
undefined function exerting out of that
yeah and then what happens if you try to
call a function undefined those mother
function yeah i was at classic
javascript oh yeah yeah it's a
JavaScript version of no pointer yeah
like it's terrible it's been tormenting
me for you yeah yeah you gonna be both
alright we have one more all right what
do you think of this one while the
monkeys hungry um playerbase the sounds
of 90 bananas yeah I don't know about
that one that seems like something that
that Nate may be added into our game I'm
not to talk to nate about tampering with
our games again go put more minimal
rather than the existing I'm kinda
hungry myself yeah I think well if you
know met if you know Nate this could be
an infinite loop because he seems to be
hungry all the time oh yeah we want to
we'll have to see how this algorithm
actually works for him alright Pedro
thanks for playing the game is the
heavens and I'll talk to Nate later
about tampering with the game it seems
to cause some difficulty for everyone
watching at home you can subscribe to
the firebase channel on YouTube to get
updates on all our video content my name
is Doug Stephenson this is Pedro Nunez
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
