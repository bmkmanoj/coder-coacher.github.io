woke up and I had a cold brew and then I
came into work and then I'd a macchiato
oh that's it sure I actually went back
before work and I picked up a pumpkin
latte cuz you know September right
before lunch I had my pre-lunch mocha
and then after lunch on my post-lunch
mocha and then we were filming you know
as far base so I had my pre ass firebase
triple shot venti americano non whip
mocha so not that much coffee what's up
everybody welcome back to a brand new
episode of hashtag ask firebase the show
where you send your questions in on
YouTube Twitter stack overflow and we
answer them my name is David East's I'm
a developer advocate here at Google on
the firebase team in case you didn't
know we are having our largest ever fire
based developer summit visit november
seventh in berlin and we want you to
participate so we're gonna have lots of
members of the firebase team there and
we have some really exciting product
updates so you definitely want to check
that out and we have a link in the
description for more so the first
question comes from samir who asked on
youtube what are some of the differences
between angularfire for angular 1 and
angular fire for angular 2 and you know
it's sameer that is a great question so
when we set out to build each one of
these libraries we design them for the
framework so for angularfire one we
tightly integrated firebase into the
two-way data binding system the two-way
data binding system is every single time
your model updates review updates or if
your view updates your model updates and
we created a third part of that where
every time you update something it goes
all the way back to your database we
call that three-way data binding so with
angular 2 they have an observable system
which allows you to model your data flow
before any data is actually downloaded
to your web page and what we've done is
we've taken the firebase database and
we've taken the real-time data streams
and we've built them into these
observables which make it really easy to
bind data from your database right to
your view and you can see it just update
in real time so Samir the differences
are is for angular 1 we tightly
integrated into the two-way data binding
system and for angular 2 we're tightly
integrated
the observable system great question so
the next question comes from Daniel on
Twitter and Daniel asks will you be
putting together any sort of angularfire
to seed repo because it would be great
to be able to see everything working
together and all the best practices well
Daniel we are actually working on just
something like that so right now we're
preparing a bunch of recipes so you can
see like how do i check for existing
data how do i combine multiple
observable streams together all these
things that you want to know how to do
then give a fire to we're gonna have an
entire repo for and right now if you go
to the install and set up directions you
can get started with angular 2 and
angularfire too and really just a matter
of minutes so you should go check that
out and the link is in the description
great question but shad on twitter asks
i would love to see an example of saving
and retrieving multiple users data using
firebase in angular 2 Thanks hashtag ask
firebase know Thank You Chad so
angularfire tues dynamic wearing makes
this really easy the first thing that
you always do when you're using angular
fire is that you inject the angularfire
service into your components constructor
and once you've done that you can do
things like create a firebase lists
observable and this is how we retrieve a
list of data from our real-time database
and so to do that we can say AF database
list and at this point we need to
provide where the data is actually
located and the path for our users would
probably be underneath the user's
location and so this list observable is
a list of users in our database so if we
want to be able to add new users we can
just say the observable stream dot push
and it's just like adding items onto an
array so now when we create this
firebase list observable we are
retrieving all of the users in the
database and if we want to just get a
subset of that back we can use the
dynamic query incapability of angular
fire to the second parameter of the
firebase lifts observable allows us to
specify our query so we provide an
object and then we specify our query
let's say we only wanted to get back the
users who are located in Washington DC
well we can say we want to order by the
child of location and we can make sure
that's equal to DC that's just an
equivalence query but we can even
to a range query so we can say that we
only want to order by the age of our
users and we can start at the age of 18
and we can end at 45 so if you want to
learn more about angularfire 2 and the
firebase list observable make sure to
check out the docks which are in github
and the link is in the description great
question check this next question is how
can i prevent the duplication of user
data when a user signs up with the same
email address more than once that's a
really good question because you don't
want the same user signing up over and
over again that make your system super
confusing how you solve that is by
keying off of the users email address
and then making sure that the user can't
save to the same spot more than once
with security rules so if you take a
look at this little bit of security
rules right here you can see that I save
my users underneath a user's node and
then i'm using the dollar email wildcard
to signify that i'm skiing off of the
email and then i'm saying only the
people who can write to this location or
authenticated users and the kicker right
here is that no data exists at this path
so if a user has already signed up with
the same email data will exist in this
rule will allow them to sign up if you
want to make sure that you are
duplicating user data make sure that
your keying off is something unique and
you're writing that your security role
isn't allowing the same data to be
written twice and you want to know more
about that we have an entire
documentation section on securing user
data using security rules you should
check that out with the link in the
description below great question next
question what's the difference between
the fire based authentication methods
create user with email password and
sign-in user with email and password
well while these methods might seem
different there is a little similarity
between the two of them so sign end user
with email and password pretty much does
what you think it does you sign in a
user provided that they give you an
email and a password but now create user
with email and password it will create a
user when they give you an email and a
password but it will also sign them in
so it's really important to know that
when you are using that method because
you have to
know that it's going to automatically
sign in the user after you've created
them and if you want to learn more about
this I did an entire video on email and
password authentication with firebase
and you can check that out the link in
the description below great question
next question we have any more coffee
you drank it all so that's all the
coffee and questions for the day thank
you all so much for sending them in and
if you want to see your question
answered make sure to tweet at us go
onto youtube stack overflow and just use
the hashtag ask firebase and we'll keep
on answering them if you enjoyed this
video make sure to LIKE and subscribe so
you can stay up to date with all the
latest and greatest firebase content
that's all for today I'm gonna go look
for some more coffee</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
