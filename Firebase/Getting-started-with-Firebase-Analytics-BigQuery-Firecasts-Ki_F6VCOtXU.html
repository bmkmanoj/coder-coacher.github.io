might want to use it with firebase
analytics why it's kind of awesome and
how you get started with it and to do
that we need to explain a little about
how firebase analytics works now as you
know firebase analytics gets data
constantly from your app along with
thousands of other apps from all around
the world and every few hours it runs a
batch reports on all this data
these reports turn into the nice graphs
and charts you see in the firebase
console and while these reports are kept
around for you to view whenever that raw
data is not that means that if you
wanted to say run specific ad-hoc
queries on historical data or export
your data to be used with another
analytics tool or simply run some
specialized reports or charts that
firebase analytics doesn't include by
default you'll need access to that raw
data and the best place to do that is
with bigquery the query is basically a
data analytics warehouse in the cloud
it's a service designed to run very fast
queries over very large amounts of data
like the analytics data that your app is
generating now it's important to note
that bigquery is not completely free if
you want to make use of bigquery you'll
need to update your firebase project to
the pay-as-you-go blaze plan but keep in
mind this is a feature that's only
available to Google Analytics customers
if they've signed up for the premium
analytics 360 service so yes you do have
to pay for bigquery usage but in my mind
it's kind of like getting a car for free
and then finding out you still have to
pay for the gas
I mean sure paying for the gas is kind
of a bummer but come on in free car of
course the big question you might
actually have is well how much is this
actually going to cost and as with most
things in life the answer is it depends
there are three main areas you'll be
concerned with storing data loading in
the data in real time and querying the
data if you want an example let's take a
look at Bingo blast this is an app with
about 24,000 monthly active users across
iOS and Android it records about 70
different user events but only three
user properties and right now we have
about six and a half months of
historical data which equals roughly 19
gigabytes of data so our data storage
charges are about 38 cents a month to
store that data we're also paying about
12 cents a month to insert that data
into bigquery in real time running a
very simple query across say a month's
worth of android data cost
one-tenth of a penny if we were to run
fifty queries like that every day across
both Android and iOS we'd be talking
about three bucks a month although in
our case that would actually fall under
the one terabyte free tier that we get
from bigquery so this part would
actually cost me nothing
now obviously huge disclaimer these
figures can vary considerably depending
on how much data you're collecting how
long you keep it around for and how
often and how complex you are making
these queries but still at least for
bingo blast these charges ended up being
pretty minor plus I should also note
that there are some tools in place to
set quotas or alert you if pricing
starts to go over what you're expecting
so with all that said let's go back to
my sample app that I've used in the last
few videos as you recall I've been
recording an analytics event any time
the user adjusts that slider now with
that event I've been storing a custom
parameter that lets me see what value
this slider ended up with after users
are done adjusting it but until now I
haven't been able to query that value
this isn't something I get automatically
with the firebase analytics standard
event reports so this sounds like a job
for a bigquery so the first thing I'm
going to do is link up my firebase
account with my bigquery account I'm
going to go into my project here and
under project settings I'll select
account linking now at this point I'll
click the upgrade project and link
button now this account already has
billing set up but if it didn't I'd need
to do that to where I'd supply my credit
card and billing address but for now all
I need to do is click confirm purchase
and I'm in oh yeah and I should click
this continue button - there better so
let me jump over to bigquery which I can
do by heading to bigquery cloud Google
com and here on the left or list of
firebase projects that I can select from
on top here you can see my project below
that are some free public datasets
things like baby names in the US and
hacker news posts that are available for
you to experiment with if you want to
now select my project and well right now
there are no tables that's because
there's no data bigquery starts
collecting my raw data from the point
that I turn it on which I did just 30
seconds ago so let's add some data shall
we
I'll go back to my app and I'll trigger
a few events then I'll move my app to
the background to make sure the data
gets sent to firebase and I'll do that a
few times all right now we'll switch
back to bigquery notice that we now have
this app of
intra-day table this is basically like a
temporary table that gets created to
hold the day's events at the end of the
day these get moved into a more
permanent app events table which you see
here the reason I have one of these
already is that it's actually been a day
since I did all that stuff in my app the
magic of video you might not have this
but but that's okay so let's take a look
at what I have here now obviously a full
deep dive and a big query would probably
take many hours in quite possibly a book
or two but let's give you the basics
first off this schema button lets me see
what my data looks like you can
basically think of this as a giant
database table although it's a little
more sophisticated than that you'll
notice that some of these sections are
described as records things like this
device info section here I tend to think
of these as rows from other smaller
tables that get pulled into this one
more importantly a few of these records
here are listed as a record with type
repeated user properties for example as
one of them this is sort of like
grabbing multiple records from these
mini tables and putting them all into
the same record without my having to do
any kind of joins in this example for
instance I have multiple user properties
all of which are associated with this
event and I can see them all in the same
entry without my having to do some kind
of join with a link table or anything
you might also notice that this event
dim is a repeated record itself it turns
out each row in my table is usually
several events of from the same user all
bundled together or I guess if JSON
trees are more your thing you get these
records as child objects inside our tree
and these repeated records are more like
child arrays inside our tree so if I go
up here and click preview this gives you
a better example of what this data
actually looks like or at least it
should but sometimes on intraday tables
it won't have had enough time to add
data into this preview buffer so you'll
get something that looks like this so
I'll just go ahead and preview
yesterday's data and it'll have the same
structure so here's my first event and
right away you can see the user property
data that's being collected with it it's
a repeated record and I happen to have
two of these properties associated with
this event or I guess more accurately
the user who triggered this event so I
got first open time that's something
firebase Analytics collects right away
as well as my custom dog or cat person
user property so it looks like I'm
checking out the events from a dog
person let's move over to the event data
I can see that this event up here was a
button click
and if we move over to the event
parameters here well there's there's not
a whole lot of interest but let's move
down to a slider event here's one and
here in our event parameters value I can
see the new value entry that I've been
reporting from the client which now
means I can start analyzing these events
by clicking this query table button and
entering in some sequel queries now it
turns out there are two ways to enter
these queries
there's the legacy sequel which is what
bigquery supported before and there's
the new standard sequel which might look
more familiar you if you've done a lot
of sequel work in the past at the time
of this recording standard sequel has
been out for about a month so legacy
sequel is still the default option but
I'm going to switch to standard sequel
partly because everybody keeps telling
me this is the new hotness but also
because it makes some of these more
complex queries a little easier so I'm
going to do that by selecting options
and then unchecking legacy sequel here
although by the time you see this video
who knows maybe this will be the default
so I'm going to go ahead and wreak lik
this query table button to bring up the
starter query in the nice new standard
sequel format and now at this point I
can create a simple query to list all
the new value parameters for the slider
events I've seen so far you'll notice
what standard of sequel I have to do
this unnecessarily property of the value
record
so now I'll run this query and look at
that I got a bunch of values that it can
kind of scroll through now if I want to
get the overall average of this value I
can then change this line here and that
will give me the average there we go so
let's do a slightly more complicated one
to give me the average of the slider
events for dog people compared to cat
people so I can start to see how these
two groups differ in their treatment of
sliders so basically you'll notice that
once I call unnecessary and the dog or
cat person user properties and yes it's
totally weirding me out that I'm not
using double equals here so we'll run
this and find out how our dog and cat
people different their slider behavior
so it looks like our cat people are
dragging to the right a lot more than
our dog people incidentally you'll
notice that I'm doing all this on the
intrud a table that was created today
and in a real life scenario you'd
probably want to run this across many
weeks worth of data the quarry to do
this would actually look pretty similar
it's just that instead of selecting an
individual table like this I'd add in a
little wild card here at the end of the
table name and specify the tables that I
want with a special table suffix line in
my where clause so I create something
like this and now I can compare all my
data over the last 30 days which in my
case just happens to be yesterday's data
notice that bigquery keeps a history of
queries for you and you can save
individual queries like this and share
them with others in case there's a
report that you want to run fairly often
also note that this little green check
box here is telling me if my query looks
valid before I run it which is nice and
when I click on it it'll tell me about
how much data this query will process if
you're more of a visual person in which
you could see this data in pretty graphs
or dashboards or something
there are a number of third-party tools
out there things like tableau click view
and Google's own data studio that you
can set up to run on top of bigquery to
see this info a little better so that
there is the whirlwind tour of bigquery
there's a lot more information that I
haven't covered so this has got a
hankerin for more information feel free
to check out the documentation and yes
there really is a whole book all about
it but if you don't feel like reading an
entire book this blog post is also a
pretty good way to get started and if
you follow these two links here you can
get access to some sample firebase
analytics
data for iOS and Android so you can play
around with some actual analytics data
and get used to the way your data is
going to be structured so thanks again
for watching and we will see you soon on
