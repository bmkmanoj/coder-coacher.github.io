cast my name is Doug Stephenson and I'll
give you a quick walkthrough on how to
do the first test of your app with fire
based test lab for Android the firebase
team understands that application
quality is extremely important for the
long-term health of your app and the
business it supports and I know from
personal experience that publishing an
app with a serious issue can cost time
and money to fix and there's a risk that
your users might simply uninstall the
app if it's causing them trouble to help
prevent these problems you can use
firebase tests lab for Android to
maintain a high bar for quality by
testing your app on many devices at the
same time there's a lot you can do with
test lab so let's just take a look at
the easiest way to get started with test
lab right now okay I already have an
Android project created in the firebase
console that I'm using for development
so let's take a look at that now when I
select test lab from the features on the
left the console is telling me that I
need to upgrade to the Blaz plan and
when I click on the upgrade button I see
some choices and that the Blaz plan
includes tests lab so when I select
blaze I notice I'm going to be billed
for my use of real time database file
storage and web hosting but I already
have a problem here I'm still building
out the first version of my app and I'm
happy with the free spark plan I don't
yet want to start paying for storage and
bandwidth used by my app and this is
okay I don't have to use tests lab in
the project that I'm using to develop my
app so if you're like me and you only
want to pay to use test lab for now what
you can do instead is create a whole new
project for all your testing needs then
you can just upgrade that project to the
blaze plan and you only pay for the
tests that you execute against it in
fact you don't even have to add firebase
to your app at all to be able to test it
with tests lab you can simply upload any
APK and test lab will run tests on it in
the project you choose using only the
billing information for that project so
let's create a new project real fast
number first I'll go back to the
firebase console main screen then I'll
choose to create a new project I'll give
it a name that makes it clear what I'm
trying to do here and keep the default
country
okay now I'll choose to upgrade this
project I'll select the blaze plan and
go ahead with the billing setup but I'll
stop the recording right here because
I'm not going to show you my credit card
number today so completing the rest of
that setup is up to you but when I'm
done with that I'll see my project is
now on the blaze plan which means I can
run tests with it I imagine right now
you wonder
what exactly it cost to test your app
you should know that your credit card
will be billed five US dollars per
physical device hour that means if your
test runs on five different device
configurations and you've submitted a
test that takes 12 minutes from on each
device that's a total of one hour which
costs five dollars or if you have six
distinct device configurations that each
run for 10 minutes that's also a total
of one hour for five dollars the math is
pretty easy so you get the idea anyway
let's do an easy test if I click test
lab on the left in my upgraded project I
have an option to run a couple different
kinds of tests the easiest test to run
is a robo test this is an automated
intelligent test that requires no extra
coding on my part it will operate my app
and give a report at the end all I have
to do is upload an apk and select the
configurations to test with here I'm
just going to select the Nexus 7 and
Nexus 5 devices on API levels 21 and 22
in both landscape and portrait and I'll
leave the default locale of US English
now
when I scroll down the console is
telling me that this is a total of six
unique tests in this test matrix when I
push that button the tests are deployed
to my selected devices in test lab and
the results will appear some time later
right here in the console and when you
get to writing your own instrumentation
tests you'll be able to run those tests
from the console here as well like I
mentioned with you you can run tests
against pretty much any apk this means
to bug or release build types with or
without firebase integrated and you can
test multiple different apps all on the
same project oh and there's one other
thing if you aren't able to pay for
testing you can still make use of
firebase tests lab by uploading your apk
to an alpha or beta Channel in the
Google Play Developer console all you
have to do is opt in to use the
pre-launch report on Google Play and
from that point on every apk you upload
to those channels will receive a
five-minute Robo test across several
devices at no charge to you after a
while those test results will appear
alongside the apk in the channel where
you uploaded it so that's all we have
time for now stay tuned here to the
firebase channel on YouTube for more
details on firebase tests lab for
Android and other firebase features if
you have any questions reach out to us
on Twitter with the hashtag ask firebase
or in the comments below my name is Doug
Stephenson thanks for watching and don't
forget to test or
and often with firebase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
