is Dan schlosser and I'm a product
manager on firebase morning everybody my
name is Sam I'm on the firebase team but
I was the lead engineer on the Senate
checker app awesome so this morning
we're going to be talking about Santa
tracker and firebase but let me back up
many of you may know every year on
December 24th Santa flies on a sleigh
pulled by reindeer around the world it's
a lot of work but he delivers over a
billion present in just 24 hours that's
Google scale all right now as any kid
would tell you it's actually a huge pain
when you don't know when the Santa is
going to come sliding down your chimney
right you have to stay up cookies and
milk the whole thing so here at Google
we figured its 2017 you shouldn't need
to stay up all night wondering where
Santa is so now there's an app for that
Santa tracker is a holiday tradition
here at Google in it kids can play
holiday games track Santa's he flies
around the world we publish a web
version and an Android app and today
we're going to focus how we use firebase
to modernize it and make sure the
holidays went off without a hitch for
those of you that don't know firebase is
Google's mobile app platform with
products that make it easy for you to
build your app and grow a successful
business but today we're going to be
focusing on how we combine Google
Analytics crash reporting and remote
config to ensure that we could roll out
this app to over a million users last
December so Before we jump in let me
describe our nightmare scenario
so every year Santa tracker rolls out to
over a million new users and with a user
base that big there's a lot that could
go wrong and this really keeps us up at
night so this is why we're proactive
about using firebase in the app so
before Santa flies in early November a
bunch of Google or elves meetup in an
igloo in Mountain View and we start
planning the next release we have a few
goals we need to address
last year's feedback fix any crashes
that we heard about any bugs and we need
to add a bunch of new features games and
a fresh coat of paint to keep the app
feeling new
December 1st is the first big milestone
this is when we ship the apk out to the
Play Store and at this point we're
despite in our nails in anticipation
we're refreshing Twitter we're looking
at Google News we want to know if
there's any reaction good or bad to the
new version of the app but what do we do
if something goes wrong but say it's
December 18th and Dan's playing penguin
swim one of the new games on his Nexus s
running CyanogenMod and he gets the
unfortunately Santa Tracker has stopped
dialogue which I'm sure we're all
familiar with penguin swim were supposed
to be our big new feature this year but
clearly something's gone wrong so what
can we do about it first of all how do I
even know that something has gone wrong
in the app at this point it's because
I'm just refreshing Play Store reviews
and they're not good people are saying
they hated it or the app is stupid or it
sucks I could give it zero stars if I
could some people are even blaming us
that they didn't get good presents but I
actually don't think that's my fault and
yet these are all real reviews from this
year so we need to fix the bug we come
into the office the next morning and
we're aren't into the app for the bugs
if we're lucky we fix it that day if
it's complex it could take longer and
then once we've things we've fixed it we
have to make in new apk and start our QA
process all over again
so December 20th two days after the
first crash we can ship out an update to
the store now if Santa Tracker was a web
app we'd be done at this point our users
would refresh and they'd get the fix but
on Android as many of you know update
uptake can be a problem users have to
manually accept the new version so by
the time our average user sees the
working version of the penguin game
it's December 28th and for this app
that's no good we've totally missed the
holidays as I said updating uptake is a
problem for any mobile app but it's
particularly tough for Santa tracker
because this is our real user graph so
December 1st we released the app two
thousand downloads in the first day very
eager users by the middle of the month
were maybe in the low six figures 100
the new users December 24th when sent
that's actually flying now we've got a
million unique users in the app and then
the next day when Santa's landed
interest drops off more back down to the
low six figures maybe five figures again
so if our app update comes out on
December 28th we didn't really fix the
problem at all
none of our users saw the fix right so
we don't guard against errors like these
we might ruin the holidays for our users
let's jump in a time machine go back to
November first see if we can make some
better decisions all right first things
first we need to know immediately if our
app is crashing clearly waiting for
negative reviews and bad tweets is a
pretty terrible way of knowing there's a
problem in your app and then once you do
just reading a bunch of screenshots of
unfortunately Santa tracker is stopped
gives us very few hints as to where to
begin debugging to solve this problem
let's add a crash reporting solution the
standard tracker we started building
Santa tracker today we'd recommend using
crashlytics back in december we use
Google Analytics for firebase and
specifically here firebase crash
reporting which is also super free and
easy to integrate that's why we used it
crash reporting provides the technical
details we'll need to solve problems in
our app and diagnose where they're
happening so let's jump into the code
well turns out there's actually no code
to get started with crash reporting all
we need to do is add this single line
dependency to our app / build.gradle
file and crashes will be uploaded
automatically to the firebase console in
around 20 minutes so again no code to
get started just that one dependency so
let's head to the console and see what
kind of reporting we get just from that
single line dependency all right here's
our crash reporting dashboard as you can
see we've had a fair number of crashes
and almost two thousand users impacted
that's no good and we can see down at
the bottom our number one crash is an
index out of bounds exception in elf
controller Java and it's fatal now
normally this would be a bad thing but
I'm actually pretty excited about this
because at a glance I can see what
crashes are happening which ones are
impacting my users the most so I know
what to focus on
let's drill into that number one error
and we can see a lot more detail we can
see what kind of devices it's happening
on we can see individual crash reports
if we want or a full stack trace using
crash reporting is much much easier than
try and decipher a bunch of google play
reviews and remember we got all of this
reporting with a single line of code so
this is pretty good right we're getting
crash reports it's certainly better than
play store reviews but we're not really
much closer to actually fixing the bug I
mean our app is still passing QA we
wouldn't have shipped it otherwise so we
need to figure out what's going on in
this crash we know when the app is
crashing with firebase but now we need
to know why the app is crashing what
specifically is happening to our real
users that's not happening to our test
so wouldn't it be great if we could
basically look over the users shoulder
we could see every screen they enter
every button they press basically all
the steps leading up to the crash then
we have the best kind of bug report
which is full reproduction steps so this
is why we're going to use Google
Analytics for firebase to understand
user behavior Analytics is a free and
unlimited solution built specifically
for mobile and even better in our case
it integrates automatically with
firebase crash reporting so we're going
to understand in the class report what
the user was doing before they
experienced the crash so again this
might look a little familiar to get
started with analytics there's no code
at all you just have to add this one
dependency to your build.gradle file and
now you're going to get default
reporting well what I mean by default
reporting if you're an Android developer
this image on the Left you've seen it
before maybe you've had scene in your
nightmares it's the activity lifecycle
firebase can hook into the activity
lifecycle to detect when a new activity
has launched when it stops so you get
automatic events like first app open
screen view session start session stop
and that's all automatic by adding that
dependency so you get a basic sense of
the user's journey through your app
without wiring anything up at all so
let's head back to the firebase console
with mrs. Claus and take a look at what
our crash reports look like now
we've added analytics or app and
remember we've haven't written any
custom code yet so this is the same
report as before this is our elf
controller dot Java crash that we're
stuck on and in the log section where we
previously just had fatal one red bubble
we've done two new events they're both
called screen view we can see that the
first one was the user going to the home
screen and the second one was either
going to the penguin swim game and then
they experience the crash so this is
pretty good but we probably could have
guessed as much from the reviews and the
class reports I mean we knew the penguin
soon game was crashing and the only way
to get there is to the home screen so in
our situation this is not enough detail
and now finally we're going to have to
write some code because we want to get a
custom understanding of what's happening
in our app so what we're going to do is
log a custom event to firebase analytics
and this will help us understand a
user's behavior so first we're going to
get an instance of the analytics
singleton objects by passing a context
that context is how we hooked in to
activity lifecycle before now we're
going to send an event name and a map of
parameters these are custom events it
can be anything you want the name of our
event is going to be tasks game button
and the parameters will tell you what
button the user press so it's a bundle
we're going to say the button name is
new game this is when a user starts a
game of penguin sub so let's imagine
that we've filled our app with tons of
custom events like this because
analytics is totally free and unlimited
so there's really no reason not to and
we need to get more information about
the crash now let's see what the crash
supports look like enhance with all this
information this is what we were looking
for right this is the magical look over
the users shoulder and see exactly what
they were doing we have the same two
screen view events that we had before
but we've got a bunch more now we have
click sign-in button so the user signed
in before they started the game we've
got a game start game finish and submit
score it's a pretty natural progression
and then we've got the crash so what I'm
focusing on here is that sign-in click
don't think our tests were actually
using a signed-in device because that
can be a bit of a pain so I bet that
probably is where our crash is coming
from so what do we do next right we'd
love to push out a fix to our bug and
roll out an update to our app but that
would take too long and our users will
miss Santa if we go that route so what
are our options for damage control well
let's think about our wrap a little bit
this year we're adding the penguin swim
game and what we're worried about is
what happens if penguin zone gets a bug
or two or three if penguin swim will be
super popular it means that if it breaks
users might have a bad opinion of our
app as a whole but some games like
memory match have been in our code base
for years we know that they're stable
and they know we know that these games
are super fun so if we have a problem in
penguin swim users should just go play
memory match or some other game what if
we could box off that crashing game and
hide it until it starts to behave better
if users never played penguin swim they
wouldn't have anything say a bad about
our app because they have all the other
games to play by the way even if your
app isn't a collection of games like
Santa tracker you can still design your
app in a modular way so that new
features that you add don't cause
regressions in your existing code base
we do things right some bad code in our
latest release shouldn't cause problems
for the rest of their app all right so
we're going to need to be able to stop
crashes quickly and notice them and do
whatever we can to put our app in a
working state at Google we call this
rollback first which is putting our app
in the last known stable state before we
ever start trying to fix the bug now a
lot of engineers have an instinct to fix
forward instead of rollback this means
as soon as there's a bug go and try and
fix it and push that fix out to users
but as many of you may know from that
experiences when you try and fix bugs on
a short timescale you end up introducing
new bugs and then the whole process
repeats itself right so to make changes
in our app without pushing an app update
we use firebase remote config the
firebase remote config we can change the
behavior and appearance of our app
on the fly right from the firebase
console not only will be will we be
warned of errors when they happen with
crash reporting and be able to diagnose
why they happened with analytics we'll
be able to fix them in just a matter of
minutes let's dive into some code for
remote config so don't get intimidated
but this is the way that we're going to
fetch a parameter with firebase remote
config it's actually pretty simple first
we just get our singleton instance of
the firebase remote config object will
call that config then we'll call fetch
on the config object and passing in an
expiration value this expiration value
will tell us when to hit the cache and
when to make a request to firebase this
makes sure that your users device
doesn't get hit with drained battery
life or a high network bill when that
request comes back successfully we
activate the latest values and then we
the config object has all the new values
in it for Santa tracker all we need to
do is called get boolean with the enable
game string and we'll get an enable game
boolean that we can use in our app to
hide or show penguin swim when it's
broken so with just that amount of code
let's head to the console hope you're
not tired of this gift and we're going
to turn off the penguin swim game with
just a few clicks our users will have
the updated version of the app in just a
few minutes all we need to do is go to
the remote config section of the
firebase console and find our enable
swimming game parameter and set it from
true to false then we just click update
and our users will start getting this
app update or this little modification
in just a few minutes a lot faster than
eight days all right so dad's turned off
penguin swim and the app is back to a
healthy state because the crashing game
is totally disappeared but if you think
about it this is not really the best
user experience that we could offer and
the reason it's not the best is because
we've disabled the game for every single
user everybody's getting enable swimming
game is false but only a small subset of
our users ever had the crash begin with
so now we've just taken probably the
best game away from a bunch of people
who could have played it and if every
game has a small number of crashing
users now we're going to have to turn
all of the games off which would leave
the app empty and that's not going to
work so what we really need is to target
these changes we need to only turn the
game off for users who have experienced
the crash or are likely to experience
the crash in the future when you target
changes like this you're going to give
each user the most complete experience
that they can have based on their own
conditions which is really powerful so
let's think of a few ways you might want
to target this maybe we have no idea
what's going on we want to run a 60/40
split and see if our crash rate goes
down by the appropriate amount just to
see if we're headed down the right path
or maybe we want to target it by country
so if we think it has something to do
with being in France we'll turn it off
for French users and nobody else can
keep playing the penguin swim game or
what if we think it has something to do
with language if anybody's ever
developed a localized apps you might
know that German strings are very long
and it might be overflowing our layout
that could be causing the crash turn the
game off for users with German devices
leave it on for everybody else or what
if we think it has something to do with
API level which it often does let's turn
the game off for jellybean devices and
leave it on for everybody else so all of
that is built into remote config by
default let's go back to the console and
see how this works I'm going to create a
simple condition to see the turn the
game off for users in Antarctica I mean
they already have plenty of penguins in
Antarctica anyway so they probably don't
need the penguin swim game it should be
a safe change so you can see I'm
defining a new condition
and give it any name and color I want
that's for me and I in the apply section
I say this applies if the device region
or country is Antarctica and device
region and country is automatically
detected by firebase in this situation
you don't have to do anything once I've
created the condition this I can add it
to the parameter that Dan defined before
so this is enable swimming game this
controls whether you to see the game or
not
now it's if you match the is in an
article condition it's false it's
for everybody else once I've saved that
we can see that our config is no longer
a bunch of a list of static values there
are some branching conditions you could
add many conditions to a single
parameter and if user doesn't match any
of them they always fall back to the
default so okay we can target by country
but I don't think that's the problem
with my game I have some ideas that are
specific to the way I built the apps
that I think might be affecting it for
one thing I know I didn't have great
tests covered on tablet devices with
large screens maybe I want to do it by
screen size or maybe somebody just
released a new connected toaster on
Kickstarter running Android and it's
just crashing every single time to use
your loads and on that device or what if
you know it's sign-in state like I guess
before maybe I want to turn the game on
for Assigned out users and all for
signed in users or maybe I just want to
turn the game off for Dan because I
don't like Dan hey so now we're going to
write some codes because we need
customization how we're targeting and
what we're going to do here is use user
properties of Google Analytics so use it
the way user properties work are kind of
like headers where our events are things
that happen at the single point in time
user properties get attached to every
event after you set them so I'm just
going to set a few basic ones here I'll
set the device board which would be
galaxy s 8 or pixels device brand Google
or Samsung and go user to check if the
user is a goat and that is a real call
in the Android SDK I did not make that
up and now that we've set a bunch of
user properties in the app we're going
to go back to the console and make some
changes to our configuration based on
these custom properties that we just
made up so now we're going to be
delivering values over-the-air based on
properties set in order in our app
without any servers or really any
configuration at all so this is the
screen where I define a new condition
last time I was here I was doing is in
Antarctica but now I'm going to do a
condition for is on pixel and I want to
turn the game off for people using a
Google pixel or Google pixel excel so
how am I going to match those users well
I want to know if the device board the
property I defines contain
pixal that's your cover pixel and pixel
XL and if the device brand matches
Google exactly so here you can see that
you can chain operations on strings and
number comparisons and create really
advanced conditions without having to
just fall back on the default that
firebase provides and now that we've
learned all this about configs
we know what to do when there's a
problem in our app first thing we're
going to do is roll back and box off the
app but we're going to do this only for
users that have conditions that we think
might call it the crash so by disabling
penguin swim in this case only so the
users who have the crash everybody else
can still play we're giving the best
experience all of our users by using
firebase and now we've got the reviews
we wanted all five-star reviews people
are saying I love you or this is the
best game ever or the greatest game in
the entire world these reviews I agree
with so this is great our next release
we could just relax crash comes in stay
calm and address it in the firebase
console so we used firebase to make a
crashing app stable but can we use
firebase to make a good app great of
course we can we can use remote config
and analytics to fine-tune our app and
improve it for users in between updates
here's a helpful workflow to think about
this process first we use Google
Analytics for firebase and try and
identify an area for of improvement for
our app next we use remote config to
make a change to improve that experience
for those users here's what I mean to
better understand our user behavior
we'll use analytics stream view which
gives us a real-time view of the events
being logged from our users devices it's
a great way to get an intuitive
understanding of what's happening in
your app as opposed to running a bunch
of big query scripts and doing a formal
analysis you can do it right on the fly
then we'll use remote config to send
those improvements but before we get
into remote config it's important to
note that remote config requires some
advanced planning you can't just change
anything about your app at any time
we're not there yet but what you have to
do
for example would be replaced magic
numbers with calls to firebase remote
config every app has some amount of
magic number
magic hard-coded string that makes our
app work and here we have an ice cube
density value that we're setting to zero
point nine seven because that was the
best value in testing but we don't
actually know if that ice cube density
is going to be the best thing in
production so we can set it to a
firebase remote config call and be able
to change that on the fly we can change
it over the air and not worry if we
chose the right magic number back in
testing so let's look at our dashboard
penguin swim is running fine but half of
our users are dying before they score a
single point you can see that zero is up
at 48 percent this game is much harder
than we thought and we need to do
something about that well just by adding
that call to remote config we can lower
the ice cube density parameter right
from the console we'll set it to zero
point eight for a random subset of our
users and leave the default at one point
out we can change this value without
spinning up a whole new apk which is how
we would have had to test this
hypothesis without remote config if
we're successful here we should see that
score distribution smooth out in stream
view this is great and our game is crash
free but now let's say we get a ton of
usage in the US and sort of lackluster
interest in Canada thought they'd love
penguins but we were wrong
so let's deliver them a custom
experience maybe change the colors red
and white if you may believe maybe
they'd like that after defining a few
key UI parameters with remote config in
our app we can iterate on design in real
time over-the-air
with remote config hopefully our
Canadian users will like this new design
and if not we'll roll it back let's head
back to the dashboard now we've set
ourselves up for success but inevitably
something always goes wrong in this case
we've lost contact with Santa's sleigh
we're getting a bunch of 500 errors in
our app well we can do more than just
fiddle with the way our app looks with
remote config we can also use it to
react to unexpected events like this so
while Stan works on a fix you know to
fix the 500 error I could use remote
config to send a friendly
error message to our users Senna's
fuelling up his sleigh be right back is
much more like easy to understand and
much more friendly than server error try
again or something along those lines and
we couldn't have hard-coded that error
message into our app because we didn't
know what was going to go wrong ahead of
time so we did it right the apps a
slam-dunk it's not crashing our users
can play all the games and we made two
app even better over time using firebase
so let's compare where we are now
to everywhere in the nightmare scenario
this is the same timeline we showed
before we shipped the app on December
1st we have a crash on December 18 but
now we identify the crash and fix it on
the same day using firebase crash
reporting Google Analytics and firebase
remote config so now when December 24th
comes around and Santa's ready to fly
our users will all have a really smooth
experience if you've been following
along and I hope you have this should
make you feel really powerful firebase
is your command center you can sit
behind the computer and have a Minority
Report interface over what your app
users are doing and give them the best
experience over-the-air
you never have to deploy an app update
if you have foresight and use firebase
and best of all everything we showed you
can be set up in just a few lines of
code that we showed and it's all
completely free so if you don't believe
me Santa tracker is entirely open-source
go check out the code maybe you just
want to get some cool pngs of penguins
and that's fine too but you can also see
how to use firebase in a real app from
github comm / Google Santa tracker
Android awesome thank you all for
listening to how we use firebase and
Santa tracker you have questions for
samurai we're going to be out these
doors to the left in the firebase
sandbox area as soon as we're done here
and remember there are lots of fun
firebase talks that are happening here
right in this stage stage 7 livestream 7
today at 10:30 we'll have the fabric and
firebase team both on stage to talk
about how we're bringing the best of
these platforms together and at 1:30
we'll talk about pirate metrics to grow
your user base then at 4:30
well then to the we'll dive into the
details on app for for
the new feature we just launched today
thanks for joining us
