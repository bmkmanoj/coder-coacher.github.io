Stephenson and in this fire cast I'll
get you started with firebase remote
config you may have noticed that it's
kind of a pain to build test and publish
a new version of your app just to change
some hard-coded value in it but with
firebase remote config you could instead
change that value in the firebase
console and have that affect your app
without having to republish it remote
config gives you the ability to define a
set of named parameters and assign them
values in the console then in your app
you can fetch those values and use them
as you need any time you change a
parameters value in the firebase console
it will be made available to your app if
you want to make use of firebase remote
config it's just a few lines of code to
fetch the values and put them into place
the first thing to do is integrate
firebase into your app if you haven't
done that yet check out this video first
where I walk you through the basic
integration then come back here to
continue with remote config I already
have an app that's using firebase so
I'll add remote config to that and use
it to change some of the behavior from
the company here's a simple app that
lets you type text into an edit text
widget and that gets overlaid on an
image view with the firebase logo on it
kind of like a mean right now there's no
limit to the number of characters you
can type into it which can be kind of
awkward so what I want to do is limit
the number of characters that can be
typed into the edit text widget so
things don't get out of control if I
switch into my project in Android studio
and open up main activity I can add a
few lines of code to set the max length
of that edit text you can see I've hard
coded a value of 5 right here for now
but I'd rather be able to change that
whenever I want without having to
rebuild the app I'll do a bit of coding
for that first I need to configure my
app to include the remote config SDK so
I can move my hard-coded settings into
it I'll open my apps build.gradle and
find the project dependencies block then
I'll add the dependency for firebase
remote config the latest version at the
time of this recording is 10 0.1 but you
should find and use the latest version
after that I'll synch the project to
make the api's available ok now I need
to convert that hard-coded value into a
remote config parameter in
an activity I can get a reference to the
singleton remote config object and store
that in a member field then and on
create I'll do three things first I'll
configure remote config to enable
developer mode I'll say more about
developer mode later second I'll define
a new parameter and assign it a default
value here I'm using a map to tell
remote config about my default I'll give
my parameter a name of overlay
underscore max underscore or chars and
give it a default value of 5 the default
will be used until the app is able to
fetch a change to this parameter from
the console third I'll call the fetch
method to tell remote config to download
all the parameters I defined in the
console I'm passing it a zero for now
which is a cache expiration time and
I'll tell you what that means later
fetch returns immediately with a task
object which tracks the progress of the
download then I'll add a listener on it
which will get invoked when the fetch
completes successfully in the success
callback I'll choose to activate the new
parameters using the activate fetched
method any changes to the fetch
parameters won't be accessible until
they are activated like this also I'll
call the method from earlier that
updates the max length of the edit text
and finally in that method I'll ask
remote config for the current value of
the parameter instead of hard-coding it
there already let's see how it works
when I type text into the box you can
see that it's limited to the default of
5 characters that I assigned in the map
of default values typing more characters
doesn't do anything and that's what I
expected so what if I want to change
this setting dynamically at the firebase
console let's look at the console for
this project in the list of features on
the Left I'll click remote config it's
asking me to add my first parameter so
I'll go ahead and do that I'll call it
overlay max characters exactly as I
named it in my code and give it a value
of 10 when I click Add parameter it
records the value and lets me know that
I should publish my changes when I'm
ready
this parameter won't be seen in my app
until I push the publish button so I'll
go ahead and do that now
and if I switch back into the app leave
it then launch it again I can see that
the new limit of ten characters was
fetched and activated now with my app
using remote config I can change the max
number of characters for the overlay
text as often as I want all I have to do
is change its value in the console and
publish the change you should know that
you can store different types of values
in remote config you can enter boolean
double long and string values into the
console and each type is obtained
through the client API with a different
method since every value is stored as a
string you should take care to format
them correctly so they can be parsed by
the SDK when you access them so there
are a couple things I mentioned before
that need a little more explanation
first fetched values are normally cached
for 12 hours before another call to
fetch will actually make a request for
new values the decoder I wrote to set
the cache expiration to zero is helpful
during development to let me get new
values every time I make a call to fetch
this makes frequent value changes at the
console easier to test
but you shouldn't publish your apps like
this instead you should only use the
study during development in this code
I'm using the build config object to
determine the best cache expiration
second you should know that the SDK
normally imposes rate limiting on your
request to fetch so a poorly behaved app
can't cause too much network traffic
when your app is being swatted like this
calls to fetch won't work for a while
but during development
you can enable developer mode to bypass
this restriction which makes it possible
to test calling fetch repeatedly for new
values again only do this during
development so you don't have problems
in production third you should give some
consideration about when you call fetch
to get new values and when you call
activate fetch to make those new values
available if you only call fetch once in
your main activity it could be a long
time before that happens again and you
end up with stale values also if you
activate some new parameters that change
the user experience drastically that can
be kind of awkward for your users to
best deal with these issues you can
watch this other video by my colleague
Todd Kerpelman ok remote config can do
even more than what I've shown here it
works in tandem with firebase analytics
to provide a way to perform a be testing
with the value of a parameter this helps
you experiment to find out what settings
your users prefer also you can provide
different values for a parameter based
on factors like the users analytics
audience or a user property this lets
you provide a customized experience for
your app depending upon who is using it
you can learn about these things and
more in the firebase remote config
documentation in the description below
and that's it for this fire cast if you
have any problems you can leave a
comment below or contact us through one
of our support channels have fun
remotely configuring your app and I'll
see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
