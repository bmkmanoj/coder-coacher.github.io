firebase my name is Ed Wang and I'm a
product manager on the AdMob team and
I'm Milo a product manager on Google
Analytics for firebase on Wednesday
students Issy announced the new AdMob
and the latest updates to Google
Analytics for firebase we're here to
take that a step further and show you
what the AdMob firebase integration will
add to your developer toolset if you
haven't heard Google Analytics or
firebase is the new name of firebase
analytics but our mission remains the
same we're here to help mobile teams
develop better apps and help you grow
successful businesses a big part of
going a successful business is
increasing your earnings Google
Analytics or firebase and AdMob are
working together to help you do just
that
we know from developers that the problem
these days isn't finding ads to use in
fact many of you are probably
overwhelmed by the number of options you
have to choose from the challenge is
knowing what types of ads to use where
do you put them how often do you show
them and to make things even more
complicated we know that putting ads
into your app isn't the only decision
you're making around monetization in-app
purchases paper downloads subscriptions
ecommerce these are all viable options
we know that you're expected to make
money from multiple business models
because you're expected to generate
revenue from every opportunity you have
every year we top we track the top
strategies used by developers like
yourself and every year we see the
overlap between these strategies get
bigger and bigger you're not using just
one but sometimes two or even three
monetization strategies we're calling
this the shifts towards hybrid
monetization but whether you're using
one or three streams of revenue we want
to help you earn more
AdMob has helped over 1 million apps
monetize with in-app advertising and
that's across both iOS and Android
but even so our largest publishers tell
us that developing a data-driven
monetization solution is still too hard
and so we're really excited to announce
a rich integration between AdMob and
firebase we believe this integration
will eliminate a lot of the guesswork
you may have had and make you feel
confident in the monetization choices
you make if you're already using
analytics inside firebase you know that
even by itself it can be an incredibly
powerful tool giving you insights into
how your users are behaving inside your
app and then you use those insights to
figure out how to effectively engage and
grow your user base but on our own we
couldn't give you visibility into the
ads revenue and this meant that if you
are monetizing using both in-app
purchase and as revenue you are only
seeing part of the picture you couldn't
get answers to questions like what's my
lifetime value or cost in-app purchase
and ad revenue or how to rewarded ads
impact user engagement and ARPU the
average revenue per user or how does the
revenue differ between my purchasers and
my non purchasers and yet we know so
many of you are trying to get answers to
these very questions because they're
absolutely critical to your business
many of you have in fact told us that
you're trying to log these events and
parameters manually so you log in custom
events you're building spreadsheets and
even with all that effort it's
impossible to measure accurately on a
per user basis because you don't have
that click level revenue data that you
need that's a lot of extra effort for
very little reward so what you told us
was that you need granular data on your
monetization strategy and of course you
need it in a tool that's both simple to
integrate and simple to use
your needs are what inspired all of the
features that we're going to be talking
about today the AdMob firebase
integration is not only the most
accurate way to measure app monetization
it's also fully automated so let me show
you what you're going to get out of the
box if you caught the AdMob talk
yesterday afternoon you might have seen
the brand new AdMob we think in
everything that we've learned from you
and rebuilt to the front end so that you
can spend less time learning about how
to navigate our site and more time
building the best ads experience for
your users one of the most noticeable
changes that you'll see is the
introduction of the app overview
dashboard this is a place where you can
go every single day to check on your
earnings and see how your app is
performing on the dashboard there's two
cards that are powered by the AdMob
firebase integration and I'm going to
show you how you can use them to improve
your overall app business I mentioned
earlier that monetization strategies are
becoming more and more complex with the
shift towards hybrid monetization and as
that happens it's getting harder and
harder to track your overall earnings we
believe that if it's hard to measure
then it's even harder to optimize so let
me give you an example if you're using
in-app purchases you're probably
checking the Play Store and maybe iTunes
if you're using e-commerce then you're
pulling figures from your internal
dashboards or maybe your databases and
let's not forget about all the mediation
revenue that you have across all of your
networks answering a basic question like
how much money am I making shouldn't be
this hard the close integration with
firebase lets AdMob bring all of your
revenue streams into the app overview
dashboard and the card the hutt to the
right of me gives you a 360-degree view
of how your app is performing at any
given time as soon as you integrate with
firebase you'll be able to see your
in-app purchase revenue and your
e-commerce revenue instantly start to
populate that means no more opening a
dozen browser windows in no more
spreadsheets
AdMob is also displaying the most
important user metrics right on your app
overview dashboard today we know that
it's not enough just to track
impressions clicks and revenue don't get
me wrong they're still important but
user value is only one part of your
overall business the monetization
strategy that you choose is going to
impact your user experience whether you
like it or not this is why industry
leaders are all tracking user growth
user engagement and user retention all
of these metrics are available at a
glance so that you can keep an eye on
how changes to your monetization
strategy end up impacting your user
experience and if you see a star sharp
drop there's a full set of tools in the
firebase UI to help you debug and figure
out what the issue is
so my is going to show you how all this
is working in our demo project the
flooded app so flooded is a puzzle game
with about 17,000 monthly active users
across Android and iOS and this is our
publicly available demo project which
makes it an awesome place to explore
firebase and check out all of our latest
features in fact you could go there
right now and look at the features will
be showing you throughout the talk today
so as you know if you didn't catch the
Google Analytics or firebase talk I want
to go over a few key analytics concepts
so you get context for how AdMob and
firebase are working better together
what I'm going to do is go over the
components that are now richer and then
I'll take time and dive more deeper so
that you see how the integration is
reflected in those components let's go
to the live demo alright so here you see
the home page or our dashboard and this
is a place you go in analytics to see
all of your key metrics at one easy
glance so they are basic user stats
business drivers acquisition retention
metrics
basic user engagement stats and then
demographic data for your user base next
to see events tab which is right next
door and this is where you go to see
detailed reports on all of the events
you're currently logging so here's the
event management table and you see all
of the events listed and when you click
on any of these it takes you to the
detailed report of that event next is
the audience tab and this is one of the
most popular features inside analytics
here's a list of all the user segments
that you've defined because they're
important or interesting for you to
track and these are the same audiences
that get sent to other parts of firebase
that you may be using like notifications
or remote config here is also the place
where you want to configure a new
audience that you can track moving
forward so last but not least I want to
highlight the attribution tab and here's
where you get data on user acquisition
campaigns The Associated lifetime value
really any data around conversions where
they're coming from and the revenue so
now views good context let me tell you
specifically what's more powerful with
the AdMob firebase integration so as you
remember me saying people usually use
Google Analytics or firebase to track
and analyze in evidence and that goes
for both the broad a performance metrics
that I showed you earlier in the
dashboard and also when you're looking
for a specific insight into your
business such as how much money you're
making so let's go to the dashboard and
let me show you what's new so with AdMob
and firebase together ARPU the average
revenue per user and also lifetime value
now also include revenue this makes them
so much more complete and so much more
valuable for you now you have data on
how to optimize your acquisition
campaigns and you can set much better
goals around total user values
there's also a new card on the dashboard
around add performance so here you have
a quick glance at your ad performance
metrics so let's look at the event
logging for the two new events that
we're logging which is act click and add
impression again these events use told
as you're logging or trying to log
manually but now their logs
automatically as soon as you link your
AdMob and firebase account so let's look
at one of the detail reports and we'll
click on add click and this report
should look fairly familiar if you're
already using analytics it's the
standard event detail report but there's
a new card here and it has incredibly
powerful data inside it so there's
impressions clicks estimated revenue and
a new metric are on ad exposure which is
the time your ads were exposed inside
the app here in this drop down menu you
can see the data in different dimensions
so ad unit with the actual AdMob ad
placement then there's screen ad format
which is basically the type so like
native interstitial banner reward it and
then add source which is the network
where the ads are coming from so let's
look around a little and see what would
be interesting to explore here I'm going
to choose to look at my revenue rights
screen I'm choosing screen name from the
drop-down and now I can compare how the
ad performance varies by screen so right
away I see there are two top performing
screens that far outperform the others
main menu and skater menu when it comes
to successful advertising timing is
everything
you want to place an ad at a time when
there's a natural break in the content
skater menu is the menus the users in
this app see when they're just starting
a level so they are thinking about how
to optimize their performance and they
want to choose like the right character
to help them do that main menu on the
other hand is the menu people go to
after they finish every level so when
you look at the difference between the
two you see that main menu is only a
third of the ad exposure time of scanner
menu but yields roughly the same amount
of revenue we see this again when we
compare main menu and level menu so here
you see the ad exposure time is roughly
the same for the two that's 13% for each
screen but when you look at the revenue
you see that level menu is 90 percent
less than main menu so what this tells
me is maybe level menu isn't a great
place to show ads and maybe I should run
some experiments to figure out a better
one
you also see from this table that the
two top screens as I said our main and
Skater so when you thinking about
prioritizing your screens and what to do
in your app those are the places you
want to go to when you want to refine
and optimize your ad performance so
right now this app is only using banner
ads for both of those screens maybe you
should think about using a new AdMob
format such as native this is actually a
perfect opportunity for this game
because it's pretty stylized and so
native ads would blend much more
seamlessly into the app something else
we can do with the AdMob and firebase
integration is see how rewarded ads
directly impact your business so when it
comes to rewarded as many of you are
thinking about do users really stay
longer and play my game more or are they
more or less likely to purchase because
you can leverage custom audiences in
firebase which tracks data for you group
of users you're interested in you can
now get answers to those very questions
creating an audience of users who've
seen rewarded as can help you see
whether they spend more time playing
your game
and overtime spend more money inside
your app and that will help you see and
understand whether there was any
trade-off between IP and rewarded ads
also by leveraging the automatically
created audience of purchasers you can
see things like whether a purchaser is
clicking on the rewarded ads or whether
they purchase irrespective so there you
go I've demoed you some of the new and
powerful features that we filled with
this integration and some of the
questions that you can now get the
answers to and now it's going to show
you how one of our partners is using
these new features successfully right
now and how these new features are
helping them grow their business so
let's go back to the slide awesome
thanks Mai so this is a this is B works
games latest game called fungi Zed and B
works games is a game studio it's one of
our largest partners in Japan and they
make mushroom themed games they're
responsible for the hits like mushroom
garden and touch detective they recently
launched fungi Zen and this is the game
that we're going to be looking at today
like many studios B works as a Oh like
many studios B works have spent decades
building games and over that time
they've managed to build incredible
instinct they've relied on this
experience to design both the gameplay
as well as the monetization strategy for
plunge eyes done at AdMob we believe
that great games are born from great
instinct but we also know that when you
combine intuition with robust analytics
you not only get better monetization
opportunity but you also get better game
design so fun choice then is a strategy
game where you're trying to help
mushroom men build a thriving
underground city
it's got 41 levels of varying difficulty
and right now fungi zen is using banner
ads and in-app purchases to monetize
when we convince them to use this
integration we set out to try and answer
to
one how does user behavior differ from
level to level in to how does game
design an ad money
monetization impact the user value so
let me show you how we can quickly get
the answers to these questions to start
off we can use the user properties
functionality which basically helps
firebase understand the game a little
bit better so here we're creating a
custom user property called current
level and we're going to increment that
user property every time a user
progresses to the next level by tagging
every user with the level user property
every firebase event attached to that
user automatically gets assigned to that
level we can then analyze all of the
automatically collected firebase signals
by simply applying the user property to
the standard firebase reports that you
all know and love on the screen here
you'll see that there's just a single
line of code and that's all it takes to
set a user property believe it or not
this one line of code is going to drive
all of the analysis we're about to show
you it's incredibly simple but
incredibly powerful it's going to let us
analyze daily active users churn revenue
all across fungi Zen's levels so let's
dive into the data so the first thing
that we really wanted to learn about was
how users are distributed throughout
this game and one of our core hypotheses
was that users were getting to the last
level level 41 and then running out of
things to do and uninstalling the game
but it turns out that our intuition was
completely off here what this chart is
showing is on x-axis there's 41 levels
and on the y-axis it's daily active
users and the one thing that you'll
notice right away is that the majority
of fungi dens users are already reached
level 41 but remember we're looking at
daily active users so that means that
they're still coming back in playing the
game on a daily basis the retention rate
for fungi then is way higher than we
expected so what does this really mean
for B works modernization strategy so
good data should speak to you right and
what this data is telling me is that
users are clamoring for more contents
and more levels but we all know that
good levels take a lot of time to build
and so while these levels are getting
built B works can implement something
called AdMob House adds house ads give
developers the power to create
advertisements for their own apps like
mushroom garden B works can drive these
extremely valuable users who are at
level 41 into their other mushroom
related games and when the levels are
finally ready they can use firebase
Cloud messaging to send a push
notification to these users letting them
know that the new content is ready to
play in fungi Zen and you want to know
the best part
house ads are entirely free the next
thing that we looked at was the
uninstall rate broken down by level and
without knowing anything about this game
what you see is that the uninstall rate
drops off pretty sharply at the
beginning of the game and kind of levels
off so where we found that it's leveling
off is level eight and this is what
we're calling the captivation point this
is the point where we think users are
really becoming emotionally invested
into this game and they've really
decided that they want to spend their
time right we can also see that after
the captivation point users are still
continuing to drop off and what we've
learned was that B works have designed
seven super challenging levels into
fungi Zen now look what happens when we
overlay those seven levels onto this
graph we can see that at each of these
challenge levels we see little spikes of
uninstall and what this is telling us is
that users are getting frustrated and
uninstalling their app when they hit
these challenge points things get even
more interesting when we take these
insights and we layer on in-app and ad
revenue
so this is overall revenue here and the
blue bars represent in-app purchase
revenue the red bars represent banner
revenue and let me remind you that until
now you couldn't do this type of
analysis anywhere the reason why we can
do it here is because we're able to take
user properties an analytics concept and
join that up with ads revenue an AdMob
concept connecting this data for fungi
then we can see a couple of interesting
patterns emerge the first thing that we
see is that there's very very little in
app purchase spending before the
captivation point right and this is a
common phenomena for casual games users
need to be emotionally invested into the
game before they decide to spend their
real money improving their city so based
on these insights B works can actually
design their game in order to get users
to that captivation point faster they
can think about things like leveraging
tutorials social gameplay gifting
mechanics to strengthen retention and
the sooner that they can get that
emotional buy-in from their users the
sooner they'll start to see that in-app
purchase revenue flow in when we go back
and look at the graph there's one other
thing that I wanted to point out so here
you'll notice that there are some spikes
in revenue and when you overlay those
challenging levels you'll notice that
the revenue actually has a really strong
correlation to the level difficulty so
some of these users are taking the
challenge in stride right they're
spending more time and more money inside
their app but from the last chart if you
remember we know that some of these
users are also getting discouraged and
uninstalling the game so the question
that we had was how can be works really
lower their churn while still
maintaining and increasing their overall
revenue well B works can introduce
something called reward of ads and
reward of ads are an opt-in ads
experience whereby in exchange for
watching an advertised
and a user gets a reward typically the
reward is some kind of in-game item that
helps make gameplay a little bit easier
the most successful rewarded ads that we
see at AdMob are the ones that help
lower user churn without diminishing the
value of existing in-app purchases the
key here is being able to target
discouraged users and help get them to
the next level before they uninstall and
quit your game now you can imagine being
able to target some of these users who
have spent a few days trying to beat a
particularly hard level and then
offering them the opportunity to watch a
rewarded ad and this is something that
can actually be pretty easily designed
by using fire based custom audiences as
well as firebase remote config and
finally the last piece of analysis that
I want to show you so what we're looking
at here is banner click-through rate
broken down by level and I'm sure all of
you have heard the term banner blindness
before right this is a phenomena where
users are subconsciously learning to
ignore banner ad units they've seen
before this is something that we talk
about a lot in industry but until now
it's been pretty hard to collect the
data the reason is because ad units
typically don't have any concept of how
long a user has actually been inside the
game the AdMob firebase integration
changes all of that
right here we can see that the
click-through rate steadily declines
over the 41 levels and when you look at
the data you can actually see that there
between levels one in 41 there's a 50%
drop in click-through rate that means
that the banner units you're using at
level 41 are only half as effective as
the banner units that you're using at
level one this data does a great job at
helping us visualize and quantify banner
blindness so what can be works do the
Orcs is already thinking about various
ways to increase ads diversity and when
they can keep when they can ensure that
their ad experience is both fresh and
relevant they can make sure that their
that their ads are super efficient and
their users are engaged so they're
thinking about introducing interstitial
ads in between levels or potentially
incorporating native ads that fit really
nicely into game play and look and feel
like they're part of the underground
city and once they've implemented this
new ad strategy they can track all the
results right in firebase so this is
only the beginning for be works with
this quest with this integration they
can now answer questions like what kind
of rewards should we give our users when
they watch a rewarded video and what are
the best times to show advertisements
are my rewarded video spending more time
and more money inside my ad with these
new insights and firebase the works can
experiment with ad strategy and game
design in ways that they just couldn't
before they've always had that intuition
but now they have the data to go along
with it B works is just one of the
amazing partners that we've been using
to test this integration some of our
other publishers like send spark have
been using this integration to measure
and manage customer LTV so they can
build better user acquisition strategies
for their games and with all of this
data the number of experiments that you
can run are endless we're confident that
this integration is not only going to
help you earn more but also learn more
about your game so now that you know how
the AdMob firebase integration can help
you let's talk about how to get started
doing it we designed this integration
from the beginning to be automatic
seamless and depth simple to use can you
guess how long it took B works to start
their first experiment can you believe
it was just one hour the team came up
with the idea on a Friday at 4 p.m. and
already by 5 p.m. they've made the
changes and submitted their app to the
store it really is that fast and easy
because firebase does most of the work
for you automatically in fact all the
events we've shown you today are
automatically generated
when you link your AdMob and firebase
accounts so if you're already using
AdMob and firebase there are two steps
to get started first update to the
latest versions of the SDKs and second
link your active fire ways in the AdMob
UI as soon as you launch it you'll see
new data begin to populate and that's it
you don't have to write a single line of
code in fact if you've already recently
updated your SDKs and your accounts are
linked you may be already seeing the ad
click and add impression reports so
before you all run off and do just that
I want to mention that we've really only
scratched the surface of what this new
integration can do for you there's so
much more to come but now you have quick
and easy access to the data you need for
better monetization and better
optimization and we're working on deeper
integration to bring you even more
insights for you to power these
important business decisions if you have
any questions about this or anything
we've talked about today please come see
us at the firebase sandbox anytime we
want to meet you talk to you and
brainstorm ideas on how you can take
advantage of all the features we
mentioned today so thank you again so
much for coming out and being our
partners in this incredibly exciting
journey we cannot wait to see all the
awesome things that you do with this
integration so go out get the new SDKs
and let's build some awesome apps
together
thanks so much and enjoy the rest of IO
