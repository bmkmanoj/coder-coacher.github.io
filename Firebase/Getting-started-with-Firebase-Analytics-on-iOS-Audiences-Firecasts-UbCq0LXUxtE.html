groups of users you define in firebase
analytics that can be used in a number
of different ways you can filter
analytics reports and - sports against
particular audience
you can send firebase notifications to a
specific audience you can send different
remote config data to different
audiences and you can target these
audiences in remarketing campaigns like
Adwords
now they can be very broad like people
who've made an in-app purchase are very
narrow like Canadian women over 35 who
are fans of yoga and I've shared my app
with their friends and while they are
quite powerful they also have a number
of limitations and the key to most
effectively using audiences is to
understand these limitations so let's go
over these first audiences are not
retroactive when you create an audience
it will initially be empty see it turns
out that the logic that's used to
determine if a user as part of an
audience is located on the client so
when you create an audience you'll need
to wait for the clients to receive that
audience definition and then decide for
themselves whether or not that user
belongs to a particular audience
additionally if your audience depends on
an event being triggered like making a
purchase you'll have to have that event
happen again on the client before the
client decides to place that user into
an audience
second audiences that include your users
gender age or interests you know the
data you get when you hook up the ad
support library can only be used for
building AdWords campaigns you can't use
them for remote config or notification
groups finally the way audiences
currently work once a user joins an
audience they don't ever leave their
like the Hotel California of user groups
now - some folks like people who deal
with remarketing campaigns this
generally works the way they expect but
for those of you new to audiences this
can cause some confusion for instance
let's say you tried to create a just
browsing audience of people who visit
your in-app store but don't make a
purchase now initially that audience
would start off pretty true to its name
people might visit your in-app store not
make a purchase and be placed in your
audience but over time and people on
that audience will make purchases but
they'll still remain in your just
browsing audience which means that this
audience isn't really all that accurate
anymore it's this mix of browsers and
purchasers so my recommendation is when
you first integrate firebase analytics
one remember the
Hotel California roll it'll make it
easier to understand what audience
definitions will be useful in the long
run and too early on in the process and
a handful of audiences that you're
pretty sure you're going to want to use
this will ensure that they start
populating as soon as people start using
your app so with that in mind let's add
an audience to our app now I'm going to
go back to this fascinating sample app
that I've used so far in my previous two
videos so if you want to follow along
and have been using your own version of
the sample app in the last couple videos
keep using it otherwise any app should
work as long as you've already installed
firebase analytics and have set up a few
events and a user property or two so our
marketing team is very interested in cat
people who use this slider here they
think they'd be the perfect audience to
upsell our new laser pointer feature too
so they're going to want to create an
audience of these people which we'll do
by combining the adjust slider event
with the dog or cat person user property
let's give it a try so the first thing
I'm going to want to do is create an
audience I'll head on over to the
firebase console and select analytics
and then select my app I'll select
audiences here and you'll notice that
firebase already has two audiences set
up for me all users and purchasers now
to create my new audience I'll select
new audience we'll call my audience cat
sliders and I'll add a short description
here to remind myself what this audience
really is about so the first thing we're
gonna do is select user property from
this drop-down nurse the comparison
operator here says equal to but if you
look at the full drop down you can see
this is actually four numbers and I'm
storing this as a text string so I need
to select this exactly matches condition
instead and then here I can select cat
person from the drop-down now if you
don't see these values in the drop-down
your app might not have submitted enough
user properties yet for them to appear
but you can still type them in by hand
next I'll click and to add another
condition to my audience since I want an
audience of cat people who have adjusted
the slider I'll also go ahead and select
event and then select adjust slider by
default it gives me this count greater
than zero condition which is what I want
notice this add parameter feature this
allows me to refine this audience based
on some of the custom parameters passed
in with this event if I wanted to make
the science consist of people who only
adjust the slider to the right side for
instance I could do that here but in my
case this isn't really
Cerie and that's about it I'll create my
audience and I'm done now you can see
that this audience is initially empty
because that whole audiences are not
retroactive thing I was talking about
earlier but let's go into my app and
test it so before I start on my app I'll
double check that I already have
analytics debugging turned on which I
did a couple of videos ago and now I'm
gonna go ahead and make sure I'm part of
this audience I'll specify that yes I am
a cat person and then I'll go ahead and
use the slider now I'll hit command
shift H to go into the background and if
you dig into the output here you can see
I have this audience evaluation results
section here it looks like it's added me
to the audience with the ID of to which
I'm pretty sure is the audience I just
created and now if I go back to the
firebase console you can see that my
audience which formerly had fewer than
ten users now has fewer than ten users
or I guess more accurately and fewer
than ten devices but trust me when this
app gets the more users it'll be a lot
more exciting so once this audience gets
beyond ten users I can start using it to
filter my reports and notifications or
target via my AdWords campaigns and then
I can finally start selling these cat
people my laser pointer upgrade so
hopefully this is enough to get you
started with audiences like I said at
the beginning of this video I think
audiences work best if you have a bunch
of them already defined when you
incorporate analytics into your app so
start thinking about what audiences make
the most sense for your app in the
meantime feel free to check out our
documentation subscribe to the firebase
Channel and I will see you soon on the
next episode of fire casts
