getting started with RO config on iOS
well you've come to the right place
let's update our app from the cloud on
this episode of fire casts so here's my
app that I'm going to configure using
firebase remote config I've got a button
here in my view controller and you can
see that off in the code I've added both
the button as an iboutlet
as well as the constraint that positions
it near the top of the screen so in the
course of the screencast we're going to
do three things first we're gonna take
our two values the text of the button
and the constant of our constraint and
give them to a remote config as defaults
ii will ask remote config to download
any new values from the cloud if they
exist and third we'll wire up our app to
use these new values so that we can
change the look of our button from the
firebase console without having to touch
our app so go ahead and get your own app
to follow along with as long as you have
a few values of your own to play with
you should be just fine so I've already
gone ahead and created a project in the
firebase console and set up cocoapods
configure my Xcode project and
initialize firebase don't know what I'm
talking about
check out this getting started video
first alright so next up we need to make
sure that remote config is actually
installed so go to your pod file here
and add the firebase slash remote config
pod if it's not in there yet run a pod
install and then open up your EXCI
workspace and alright looks like we're
ready to use remote config but before we
do maybe let's take a little moment to
understand how remote config so with
remote config you first start off by
giving it a bunch of default values
stored as key value pairs and these are
just defined locally by your app next
you're going to tell remote config to
fetch updated values from the cloud very
often this will be just a subset of the
default values that you supply right
like you only need to supply these new
values from the cloud when they're
different from the defaults that you
have locally remote configure will then
keep these values and kind of a cached
holding pattern on the device until you
tell it to apply them now the reason
these values don't get plied
automatically is that you could get into
weird situations when your apps of
values change like right while your
users in the middle of using your app
and that could get all sorts of weird so
when you tell remote config to activate
these recently downloaded values they
will then be applied on top of
whatever values you already have at that
point when you ask to retrieve a value
for a certain key remote config will
either give you the default value or a
newer value that it's downloaded from
the cloud makes sense all right well
let's try that now in our app so before
we do anything else let's go ahead and
import the firebase module remember this
is all I need to do no matter what
firebase cocoapod I've got installed now
I'll start by creating a set up remote
config method in which I'll supply my
default values there's a couple of ways
you can set up default values in remote
config you can either add them through a
plist or you can use in nsdictionary i'm
going to go with the dictionary approach
here so let's create our NS dictionary
with our button text equal to let's call
it default and our button constraint
constant key equal to o let's say 50 and
yes if this were a real app I wouldn't
want to be typing out the names of these
keys like that that's that's kind of bad
form so our recommendation here is go
ahead and put all the values you might
ever want to change into this dictionary
of default values right like all your
hard-coded strings your magic numbers
what you know what have you in essence
this should replace whatever app
constants file you've got lying around
in your app yes we all have one of those
I know so remember you only download
values from the cloud that are different
from your defaults so adding all these
defaults won't increase the size of your
network calls but it will give you the
flexibility to change any of those
values later if you want you don't want
to be in a position three months later
when you decide oh you know I really
should change the speed of my animations
and realize that that animation speed
hasn't been wired up to use remote
config next up we can access remote
config which will always do through the
remote configured singleton instance and
we'll call set defaults and then pass
along that dictionary alright so far so
good
now that we have defaults we'll fetch in
any new values from the cloud so let's
create a second fetch remote config
method to do that so one method you
could call at this point is fetch with
completion Handler this method by
default will only fetch new values if
the ones that already has are more than
40 3,200 seconds old which is 12 hours
to you and me but that's also a long
time to wait if you're trying to test
out remote config changes in your app so
instead I'm going to call a fetch with
expiration duration completion handler
and give our expiration duration a value
of say zero seconds to make sure I'm
always fetching a new version now
normally this would cause our app to get
throttled pretty badly by the remote
config service but you can fix this by
turning on developer mode which
essentially removes this calls per user
throttle for a small number of users
I'll create a settings object with
developer mode enabled set to yes or
true if you're on Swift we can now set
our config settings to be this new
object and we're good to go this will
let your app fetch remote configures a
lot more frequently without getting
throttled but don't do this in
production row config will stop working
in fact I kind of like sticking
everything behind a debug flag sort of
like this we'll pull out our expiration
time into a separate variable can set it
to zero if we're in debug mode and
43,200 if we're not and yeah that's
probably a little safer anyway we can
now go ahead and fetch these new values
and I'm gonna do two things in our
completion handler
first off I'll pronounce ol and then
we'll also call activate fetched
remember this tells remote config that
it's okay to take those values that we
fetch from the cloud and apply them on
top of our current values so we'll run
this and we can see that we've
successfully made a call to the Internet
hooray of course we're not actually
doing anything with any of these values
and remote config so our app looks
exactly the same as before let's tackle
that next so I'm gonna create a method
called update view which will basically
set my button text and constraints based
on the values I get back from remote
config and I'm gonna call it in two
places
first up here right after I set up my
default values and then again here at my
fetch callback so I can apply any new
values that might have come in now
calling self or from within a block like
this could lead to a retain cycle so
just to be safe I'm gonna add a weak
self reference in here a little like
this there we go that's that's better
now grabbing values from remote config
is pretty straightforward you're gonna
call the config value for key method
which retrieves the corresponding value
from remote config you can also access
these values directly with bracket
notation sort of like this which is a
little nicer sometimes now these values
have a type of remote config you can
think of it kind of like an NS object
but you're almost
never going to use them directly instead
you're gonna call one of its follow-up
methods string value number value data
value and so on to convert it to a
usable data type it is up to you to know
what type of value you're expecting and
call the appropriate method so that
remote config can parse it correctly so
going back to my app here I'm now going
to set my buttons title to remote config
config value for key button text cuz
that's the that's the key and then
string value and then I'm gonna set my
constraints constant to remote config
config value for key button constraint
constant number value which is an NS
number and then float value to get the
value as a CG float now I can run this
and you can see that my buttons text and
position are being set by the remote
config object it's pulling all of its
values from the defaults right now but
let's see what happens if I set these
new values in the firebase console so
I'm gonna head over to the firebase
console for my project and I'm going to
select the remote config tab you can see
that I'm being asked to create my first
parameter so let's do that
so the key parameter here is really just
the name of the key that I want to
change and I'll start by adding button
text here and we'll change its value to
hello from the cloud I don't need to add
quotes here or anything everything's
basically saved as a string at this
point and that's it we'll run it and
check it out we got some new values you
may have noticed there was this tiny
moment when my text flickered from the
default value to the newest values after
it loaded them from the remote config
service and remember that's because I
called applied fetched immediately
instead of waiting for a more opportune
moment I won't see this again if I run
my app again because any values that are
applied stay applied so you're not going
to start off with pure defaults every
time you you open up or start up your
app oh but you know for fun let's change
the value of this constraint constant to
we'll change it to something like this
and run it again and whew look at that
button scoot down so that's the basics
of remote config for you there are
certainly some other topics to cover
including delivering different values to
different users running an a/b test and
applying fetch data intelligently so
that you don't get that little flicker
when your app gets new values all of
which are very good topics for future
videos in the meantime please check out
the remote config documentation and
go configure your apps from the cloud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
