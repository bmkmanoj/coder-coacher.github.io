DAVID EAST: Is--
mm-- it's just--
OK.
I just need a-- uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
Hey, everyone.
David here.
And today I'm really excited,
because we're going to be
launching a brand-new video
series called &quot;Server-Side
Rendering with
JavaScript Frameworks.&quot;
So if you're building a
website that uses a JavaScript
framework like Angular,
Ember, React, Preact,
a lot of your
rendering code is going
to be tied up in JavaScript.
And this makes it really
hard on your page load.
But as my friend Addy
Osmani once said,
&quot;JavaScript
frameworks can be fast
if you're willing
to put in the work.&quot;
And in this series, we're
going to look at all the places
where we can put in that work.
So there's a great
tool out there called
server-side rendering.
And with server-side
rendering, we
can take the same
client-side code,
render out HTML on the
server to send down
for a fast first render.
So in this series, we're
going to be exploring
how we can implement this with
each one of these frameworks--
Angular, React, Ember,
Preact, and Vue.js and Next.js
for React.
And then, with each
video, we're also
going to be releasing
a companion video that
does profiling for the
server-side rendered version
versus the non-server-side
rendered version.
We're going to be releasing
new videos every single week,
so make sure to subscribe to
the Firebase YouTube channel
so you can stay up to date.
And I will see you in the
upcoming videos of &quot;Server-Side
Rendering with
JavaScript Frameworks.&quot;
SPEAKER: What should
they subscribe to?
DAVID EAST: Our YouTube channel.
SPEAKER: And which
YouTube channel's that?
DAVID EAST: The Firebase
YouTube channel.
