thee still roll still rolling in the
back hey everybody welcome to the fifth
lesson in the firebase database for
sequel developer series and in this
lesson we're going to be talking all
about joins so the firebase database SDK
doesn't have any methods for joining
data specifically but that doesn't mean
that you can take data from one location
and then find the related data and merge
it into one set so to see how we would
do that let's dive right down into the
laptop this is the database of events we
have events users and attendees and an
attendee is obviously a user that goes
to an event and if we want to get back
all of the attendees data we would have
to write this sequel query right here so
we have two inner joint statements we're
entering events with attendees and
attendees with users and we can do this
because of the foreign keys in the
attendees table so attendees has event
ID which references events and it also
has a user ID which references users so
when we enter join these together we can
then create the data set we need to get
all the users data that are going to a
specific event so how would we do this
in the firebase database the firebase
database the data structured as JSON and
our top-level keys are users events and
event attendees an event attendees is
how we show which users are going to
which events so the f-m key is the same
key as the events key so we know that
all the users underneath FM in events
keys are the same users that are going
to the event which is the key of FM so
how would we do the join in this case we
would use the real-time database SDK and
we would get a reference to the event
attendees at the FM key and then we
would start doing a child added event
and this would fire back each user that
is going to the event so the first time
we would get a key of one which is David
and then a key of 9 which is Alice and
that just gives us
the name and not all the other user data
so to get all the other user data we
then have to do a join so what we have
first start up by doing is we create a
reference to that users location inside
of the callback so we can create a user
reference using the snapshots key
because the way we structured the data
is that the snapshots key is the UID for
that user and then once we've created
this reference we can just do the once
method specify the value event and then
return the user in the promise and this
gives us back our specific user data for
all the users that are going to this
event now one thing you might want to
note is that we're using the once method
and this will only retrieve that data
one time and not listen in real time and
this is the easiest way to do a joint
because you're not going to have to
worry about inter subscriptions and to
see what those are let's see what
happens when we use the on method so
using on value this will listen to
updates for the user in real time but
when you use an on method you always
need to be able to dispose of that so if
you're no longer need to listen to these
updates in real time you can call ref
dot off with the handle and then that
way you aren't listening to that user
anymore so when you listen to an event
in real time you're going to need to be
able to dispose of that event and so you
can use the off method to stop listening
but you also have to pass in a handle
and when you listen using the on method
a handle is returned to you so inside of
each child added callback we're creating
a new real-time listener and so this is
a new handle that we have to keep track
of for each attendee so this is how you
keep track of each handle so we could
actually unsubscribe from the real-time
events so we'll create an array of
handles and then inside of the child
added callback
we'll do our join where we grab the user
reference and then get back the user
data and then after that we will push
the handle onto the handles array and
then somewhere later down the line when
you need to dispose of all the child
events you can just loop
the array and then you can call the off
method with the handle so that is for
your more complex situations where you
need to keep both datasets updated
together in real-time but as you can see
for most of the time when you are
grabbing reference data like the user
data it might not always be changing in
real time so you can just get away with
using once rather than having to keep
track of all the handles with the on
method so now that we've taken a look at
this let's go dive in and write some
code so right here I have AJ s been with
a few variables at the top we have an
event key which is a key to just one
event root reference to our database and
attendees reference and the users
reference so let's first see all of the
attendees at this event so to do that
I'll just say attendees ref once value
and we can log the snapshots so
console.log snap that Val we want to
make sure we use the specific event so
I'll say child of event key so now we
run it and these are all of the
attendees at this event and you can see
that we have this key right here and
then the user's name so Margaret right
here and this key is actually Margaret's
UID and it's the same here for Anthony
so all of these keys are the unique
identifier is underneath the user's key
so since we have this key we can know
how to join the data so we'll write a
function it will call it get users at
event I'll pass in a key and a callback
and so now we could say attendees ref
got child of key then we can say on
child added and pass through a snapshot
so child added will fire off for every
user so this came back as an entire
object in the console because we did a
once value but on a child added it's
going to fire off line by line so since
we know that the key of the snapshot
will be the user's ID we can actually
create a reference to that user's
location
so we'll create a user ref and that is
users ref child of snap key and then now
we can say user ref dot once value get
that users data as a snapshot and then
rather than actually writing this
function right here we can just provide
our callback since it will be called
with a snapshot so now we can call this
method and so we'll say get users at
event will pass through our event key
and then a callback function which will
just log the value to the console so now
I'll clear this out run you can see that
we have all of the entire data sets for
each user that is going to the event so
that's how you do joins in the firebase
database and you can see that it's
really dependent on how you set up your
data structure and when you share keys
across your data structure it makes it
really easy to find any related data
using that key so that's all for this

the next lesson we're going to talk
about do normalization which is a
cornerstone in structuring your data for
no sequel databases that's all and I
