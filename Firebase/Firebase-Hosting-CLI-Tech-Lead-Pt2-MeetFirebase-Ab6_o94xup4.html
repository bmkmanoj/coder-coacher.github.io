Bly from the firebase team where they're
picking up the second half of his
interview right now Michael how did you
end up on the firebase team back in 2012
I actually founded a startup called give
shot and I had been working in sort of
the open source world for a while and
trying to build things for developers
and I wanted to see if I could do more
there so the first thing we built was
sort of a drag-and-drop tool for
building bootstrap HTML unlike other
WYSIWYG tools the idea was this would
export sort of clean useable HTML and as
we were building that out we were
looking for a place to host the static
content so just the HTML Javascript and
CSS that would talk to the various api's
that we used and there wasn't really
anything there so we kind of pivoted the
company towards static hosting for
developers which as it turns out was
very similar to firebase hosting and so
the opportunity sort of came along for
me to join the firebase team with div
shot you know merge the two products
together and make something more
ambitious because firebase obviously
isn't just hosting its this entire
development platform yeah so I've been
working in the developer tool space for
a long time and it's just been really
exciting seeing how everything has
developed I was in a similar situation
so I was at a startup called pulse dot
IO and we were making a mobile
application performance monitoring tools
and then my startup I didn't co-found it
but my startup was acquired and that
became what is known today as firebase
performance monitoring we had actually
very similar ads in the fireface world
so it's pleasure to have someone to
share that sort of developer focused
prior product experience very cool so
Michael what are you watching on TV
these days I mean I watch a lot of stuff
I'm really pumped for the new season a
Westworld yeah I watch West for all
loved it I heard they're doing something
different this year it's not just West
Rob they're adding like another new
world or something yeah I don't know I
mean lots of missed like I think that
you know they can't say too much or
they're giving away the mystery yeah
it's really interesting because the
first season is just sort of this really
like encapsulated meticulously crafted
thing and then it's gonna be really
interesting to see where they take it
from here
and it is itself kind of a game right I
mean one of the characters treats it
like a not like an escape room type game
but it's its game it qualities yeah
definitely the other thing about that
show is it also kind of puts a spotlight
on what happens when you have really
sophisticated AI you know there's always
that you know is what's gonna happen
with very sophisticated AI or the robots
gonna take over they're gonna think for
themselves and I think it like touches
on that just a little bit yeah now I
remember you tweeted about Halton catch
fire oh yeah that's a great show I love
that and I think it really captured like
the spirit of computing in the 80s yeah
that show I think for one thing I was
really surprised it just got better from
season to season which doesn't always
happen with TV one of the things that I
thought rang really true about it is the
way that like even though this is set
over a period of decades like these
people sort of keep looping back and
running into each other and I've found
that to really be true in my career it's
sort of you meet certain people and like
you really like click with them or you
do something that you know is important
to you together and then like those
people are there throughout your career
you know there are people who work at
Google who also worked at like in
Tritiya the first job that I got like
just out of college and like it's just
weird how everything sort of converges
and it feels like a very small world
yeah yeah I've noticed that some of my
prior colleagues would look me up on
Google and say hey you remember me and
I'm like of course I do welcome to
Google it is kind of a small world and a
lot does converge here I think how did
you end up getting into computers I'm
very curious I mean I've been fascinated
by them my whole life my parents tell me
I don't remember but I was like 2 years
old and like climbing up onto the desk
and trying to put floppy disks into an
IBM XT like a lot of kids I got super
into video games and how do they work
how can you make them and over time you
know I started picking up programming
from that I wanted to really be able to
do a lot just by myself and that's sort
of how I got into the web and
programming for the web because I felt
like one person could do so much no well
that's that's kind of similar to how I
picked up computing although I don't
think I was - there were no there were
no floppy disks but they were certainly
floppy disks when I was six or seven
yeah I played around with Apple 2
computers at school and at the librarian
Oregon Trail
yes I've watched interviews by I think
people who created it talking about
their story of creating and I just found
that fascinating yeah love that game
well Michael thanks so much for being on
the show yeah my pleasure pleasure to
finally meet you and talk about video
games and TV and stuff and thank you for
tuning in I hope you enjoyed this
interview be sure to subscribe right
here to the firebase channel on YouTube

this I'll see you next is my code safe
it's a yes or no question painful yes or
no look man I told you I wasn't gonna
answer this question just a yes-or-no
that's all I want
actually it's asked</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
