today's episode of fire cast we're going
to be covering the real-time database in
the web and just as a reminder to you
this is one of many episodes on firebase
in the web so we have a whole series
using firebase authentication firebase
hosting the real time database you know
pretty much everything firebase offers
with the web including JavaScript
frameworks like angular ember and reacts
so make sure you subscribe to the
channel so you get notified when we post
those but today it's the real time
database and we're specifically going to
be covering real time events starting
with the value event which is great when
you're trying to synchronize things like
objects or primitives so let's see how
we work with that so to the left right
here I have the data viewer in the
firebase console and to the right I just
have a little web app and this is my
index.html page and then I also have an
app j/s where I've configured my
firebase project so in this app I want
to demonstrate how to synchronize events
in real time so demonstrate a value
event I am going to create a pre tag so
I'm going to create a pre and then give
it an ID of object because what I'm
going to do is I'm going to display an
object inside of this pre so I'm going
to switch over to my app j/s and I'm
going to get this element from the Dom
just using document get element by ID
and just pass through the ID of object
and now that I have this Dom element I
want to create a database reference so I
can synchronize data from the real time
database to my web app and as you can
see there is no data yet there's pretty
much just this null object but we're
going to be changing that in just a bit
so I'm going to create this reference
and I'm going to call it DB ref object
and to get it I'm going to write
firebase database dot ref child of
object and essentially what this does is
this ref
function gets you to the root of the
database and then calling chyle just
creates a child key of object and then
from here we can store whatever value we
need now I'm going to do the magical
part which is synchronized data in real
time and there's one all-powerful method
that you need to know and that's the on
method so I'm going to synchronize the
object changes with calling DB ref
object-- dot on and you need to take
note that right here I'm calling on the
database reference and this database
reference points at the location of
object so essentially right here we will
have data existing at this object
location and what we want to do is every
time this data changes you want to know
about it in our web app the first
parameter the odd method takes is the
event type and the event type is how you
control the level of synchronization
from the real-time database so I'm going
to use the value event now the second
parameter is the callback function and
the event type right here controls when
the callback function is called in the
case of the value events the function
will be called each and every time there
is a change at this location in the
database so I'm going to create a
callback function using es2015 arrow
functions and then I'm going to log this
value to the console so this snap
parameter is essentially called a status
snapshot and the data snapshot is not
just your data and that's why I'm
actually calling dot Val the data
snapshot also returns lots of other
important things such as the key name
and ways to iterate children and whatnot
but if you want to get the value you
have to make sure to call dot Val so I
pulled up my web app in the browser and
as you can see this value is null which
makes sense because this is null right
here so let's go and change that so
going to add a key of the name object
and then a value of hi and then boom it
changes so I'm going to go and change it
again to hello and you can see that
updates and let's go and actually delete
and now we synchronize back to the null
object so what you might notice is is
that every single time we change
anything here it just started logging it
out to the console no regardless of the
change whether it was something being
added so a new value or something being
changed to another value or even if we
deleted the data it all logged out to
the console and that's what the value
event does it's sort of a catch-all and
it works really really well when you
want to synchronize an object
so rather than synchronize just a string
let's go and synchronize an object so
here in the data viewer I'm going to add
a key name of object I'm going to add
other fields so I'm going to give it a
name of Miss object say this hobbies are
being an object and the favorite number
of course 42 and now when you look at
the console it's just a POJO a plain old
JavaScript object and has the same
values fave number hobbies in name just
like what we put in over here so let's
go and actually change some of this so
instead of 42 let's change it to 45 what
do you think is going to be logged to
the console do you think that it's going
to be a the number 45 or be the entire
object
tik-tok which one well let's hit and
turn find out if you selected B you are
correct it synchronizes the entire
object not just the value that was
updated and why is that but the value
event is a catch-all event in the sense
that every time you update a value
you'll get that change but you don't
just get the little Delta change of the
value updated you get the entire object
back and this is known as state
synchronization
so now that we know how the value event
works let's go and display it in the pre
tag
so rather than logging to the console
I'm going to grab the pre tag tap into
the inner text and then just JSON dot
stringify snap dot value and give it a
spacing of three and right here we see
our little JSON output so we're go and
change some things around change your
number back to 42 that updates in real
time update some hobbies and all of that
synchronizes to and fro in real time so
that's how you use value events which
you saw are great for when you're
synchronizing objects in primitives so
now have a question for you what kind of
objects are you synchronizing in your
app are you synchronizing users are you
synchronizing profiles which I mean I
guess those are the same things but you
know what are you synchronizing your
apps just let me know in the comments
below and that's all for today but stay
tuned for next time we're going to be
covering child events which provide you
with a lot more granular control over
the items in your list so I'm Scott
