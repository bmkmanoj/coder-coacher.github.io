having a blast at i/o so far and welcome
to session one of our AdMob series earn
more revenue from the AdMob platform I'm
a product manager on AdMob I'm Allen I
work on developer experience and I'm
joined here today by two superstars on
our developer relations team Eric and
Tristan these guys are true Renaissance
men they do everything from developer
documentation the code samples to
answering your support forum questions
so we're super super excited to have
them today and we're very lucky to have
them today we're going to talk all about
what AdMob is why you should use it and
specifically we're going to talk about
the innovative ad formats that we've
been working on how easy it is to scale
with AdMob and how easy it is to
implement ads with AdMob but before we
do any of that I want to take a step
back and I want to talk about the
process of creating a successful app
business as app developers we all know
that there's so much more to creating a
successful app business than just making
the app itself after you create the app
you have to get users on your app you
have to get traction and after you get
traction on your app you have to figure
out how to monetize that out and that's
why Google was so happy and so proud
yesterday to announce firebase firebase
is an integrated suite of products that
makes it easy to develop an app grow a
user base and earn money so it's broken
down into three pillars develop grow and
earn the develop pillar is all about the
set of tools that you need to create and
maintain a great app so it's stuff that
Google and firebase have traditionally
been famous for like real time databases
and cloud messaging
along with a new set of tools like crash
reporting so let's say that you use the
develop pillar to
great app now you want to use grow to
get users on your app and to get them
engaged with your app so you might use
AdWords to drive installs onto your app
and you might use notifications to keep
users engaged and coming back to your
app so now you have this great app and
you have users using your app the
question becomes how do I turn my app
into an app business and that's what the
third pillar urn is all about and this
is where AdMob really shines AdMob is a
sophisticated ad platform that makes it
super easy to integrate in app ads and
today more developers are monetizing
through in-app ads than through any
other form of monetization and for good
reason because the amount of money the
advertisers are putting into mobile is
only going to increase in fact by 2017
it's estimated that the in-app
advertising market will be sixty two
billion dollars AdMob is the easiest and
most powerful way to tap into this
market
and AdMob has been at the forefront of
driving innovation in ad formats and now
this is important to you for multiple
reasons because you as an app developer
you not only care about making money
with your app but you care about
creating a great user experience within
your app so because our ads are more
engaging and means that users are more
likely to click through and you're going
to get more revenue per impression per
app that way but because we're also so
invested in these formats it means that
our ads are more user driven they're
richer they're more seamless and ensures
that you're going to continue to have a
great user experience within your app so
we're going to talk later in this
session about some of the innovative ad
formats that we've been working on but
first I want to take another step back
and I want to talk about some of the
developers already using AdMob so by
show of hands how many of you have
played or still play trivia crack all
right
some kindred spirits I love it so you
know max it's a true AdMob success story
because when they came to us they were
already implementing with in-app
purchases and they were already
monetizing that way but they wanted to
explore another revenue stream and so
they implemented banner and interstitial
ads with AdMob and by doing so they
increase the revenue by almost 50% now a
50% increase in revenue even for a small
developer is a huge deal but when it
comes from a developer the size of an
either max it's really nuts it's really
bonkers and it shows you the power of
in-app ads and the power of AdMob
now eater Max is far from the only large
developer that uses AdMob as their
monetization platform you can see on the
screens here that many of the largest
and most successful developers in the
world use AdMob to monetize but we're
not just a platform for the largest
developers in the world in fact a
million apps every month choose to use
AdMob as a monetization platform and
these are apps that span globally and
across all different app categories
using AdMob is so so flexible because
it's easy to integrate and we have a
powerful feature set that means as a
small developer you can integrate with
AdMob without spending too many
developer resources on it and as you
grow and as you scale and as you become
that next eater max you can begin to
implement our more powerful feature set
you can do direct deals you can leverage
the man from other ad networks and you
can advertise your app within other apps
that you own with our feature called
house ads now as you grow and your
customer base grows admob's global and
massive inventory means that that means
that you're not going to miss out on any
monetization opportunities as you scale
AdMob scales with you and like firebase
we support both iOS and Android so now
we've talked a little bit about what
AdMob is and why you might want to
implement AdMob and I hope by now you're
saying to yourself hey I'd like to earn
some more revenue on my app so now I'm
going to talk a little bit about the
implementation process and what we're
going to go over in our code demos today
so today we're going to touch on two
specific ad formats
banners and interstitials what you see
on the screen is a banner ad and this is
a popular ad format because it's very
flexible and it can be implemented in
apps with only one screen things like
utility apps things like flashlight apps
and so you can just append it to the top
or the bottom of your app screen with a
few lines of code it's incredibly easy
with AdMob and Tristan is going to show
you how to do it in just a few minutes
the other app format we're going to talk
about today is the interstitial ad so
this is a full-screen ad it typically
comes at a breakpoint in the flow of
your app so you can imagine putting it
at the end of a game level we've been
investing a ton in this format we have a
lot of really cool and interesting
interstitials and eric is going to show
you how to implement an interstitial ad
later on in this session so we're super
super excited to showcase this entire
platform to you it's super super easy to
integrate with that mob you can scale
very easily with us and we have these
dynamite dynamite ad formats with that
said I want to pass it off to Tristan
and Tristan is going to show you just
how easy it is to implement banner ads
thank you
hey everyone my name is Tristan Emmerich
and I'm a developer programs engineer on
the mobile ads developer relations team
so now that you have an overview of what
AdMob is and how it can help you earn ad
revenue in your apps the next step is to
integrate with AdMob and you do this by
placing ads in your apps so I'm really
excited to show you today just how easy
it is to implement and request a banner
ad in an iOS app written written and
Swift so before we get started with the
implementation I want to show you what
the app is going to look like when we're
done implementing it so it's gonna be a
very simple app with a single request
ads button and when clicked it's gonna
show our test banner ad so very simple
very straightforward the actual
implementation itself is broken into
four main steps first we're gonna create
our Xcode project next we're going to
integrate with AdMob by linking the
Google mobile ads SDK to our project
we're gonna build the apps user
interface using storyboard and we're
gonna create the ad request in the view
controller so let's get started with the
implementation
all right so since we're creating an iOS
app we're gonna use Xcode as their
development environment to create the
project so let's go ahead and set up the
Xcode project so here we are on Xcode
we're gonna select the single View
application for our template our ILS
template we're gonna click the next
button then we're going to specify our
product name or our app name your app is
most likely going to be a lot shorter
than this lot catch here then Tristan
and Eric super amazing Swift project but
next we're gonna set select the language
in this case you can select either
objective-c or Swift for this demo we're
going to show you how to implement it
using Swift and then again we're going
to click the next button and save it to
the file system and we have our Xcode
project so very straightforward alright
next we need to integrate with AdMob and
we're gonna do that by linking our
Google mobile ads SDK to our Xcode
project and a really great tool for
doing that is cocoa pods cocoa pods does
a great job of installing and managing
library dependencies in your Xcode
project so let's go ahead and get that
set up so here we are in our root
directory of our Swift project that we
created we're gonna first create our pod
file we're gonna do that by running pod
in it you can see the pod file is now
created we're gonna go ahead and open
the pod file and we're gonna drop the
Google mobile ads SDK pod in there we're
gonna leave the default settings the way
they are we're gonna save it close the
pod file and now we want to install that
pod so we're gonna tell cocoa pods to
install it by running pod install you
can see it's downloading the pendens
ease and the Google mobile ads SDK has
successfully installed into our Xcode
project and you see we have the latest
version of the SDK now you also see in
the green text there that an Xcode
workspace was created so that's what we
want to open this time not the Xcode
project so we're going to open our Swift
Xcode workspace
so once that opens it's gonna take us
back to Xcode and you'll see our Swift
project that we created as well as the
second project called pods and this is
where the Google mobile ads SDK lives
and is linked to our Xcode project and
there we go
we've successfully integrated with AdMob
by linking the SDK to our project next
we need to build the apps user interface
and we're gonna do that using Xcode
storyboard so let's go ahead in the
storyboard and we're gonna add our
request ads button and our banner view
so in the bottom right corner of Xcode
is the object library we want to grab
the UI button which is going to be the
request ads button drag it on to the
storyboard change the text and now we
want to set some layout constraints so
we're gonna hit the control key and drag
and a menus gonna pop up and we're gonna
position it in the center horizontally
and vertically in the container all
right so now we need to get the UI view
which is going to hold the banner view
so we go back down to the object library
drag the UI view onto the storyboard and
now we want to set the layout
constraints so we go down to the bottom
right on the pin icon we're gonna set
the banner to the bottom of the
container so we set the bottom margin to
zero we're gonna set the width and the
height to 320 points by 50 we're gonna
go ahead and add those three constraints
next we're gonna align it so we want to
line it at the center and on the bottom
of the container so we're gonna
horizontally center it and as you can
see on the left side of the screen you
see some orange dashes and what this is
saying is that storyboard expects our UI
view to be positioned at that location
since we've set our layout constraints
but we need to resolve those without
constraints before the back of the view
gets updated so we go back down to the
right-hand corner to resolve our layout
constraints simply click update frames
and we have these blue lines so these
blue lines signify that the banner view
or in this case the UI view
is positioned correctly in the
storyboard so we have a uiview but we
actually want to we want to implement
that as a GAD banner view and that's our
SDKs custom class for displaying a
banner so we're gonna go up to the right
hand top corner of Xcode into the
identity inspector and we're gonna
change the class from a UI view to a gad
better view and so this will allow us to
create an instance of the gab banner
view so that we can call its methods as
well as set its properties so now we're
going to open this assistant editor so
we can display the storyboard and the
view controller side by side we're gonna
again hit the ctrl key and drag up to
the view controller so we want to create
a reference to the newly created banner
view so we're going to go ahead and make
that connection
next we want a handle when a user taps
on the request ads button and so we're
gonna create an action this time so that
that action event gets fired when the
request ads button is clicked so we'll
leave all the default settings where
they are and that will create our
request ads method and as you can see
Xcode does not recognize gap banner view
yet and the reason for that is we need
to import the Google mobile ads module
so we go ahead and import it and we
control B or build the app and it builds
successfully so just a quick summary of
what we did we created an IB outlet and
the IB outlet keyword represents that
there is a connection between our view
controller and the storyboard and this
allows storyboard or a basically we tell
story board to create and take care of
the initialization of the gab banner
view so that we can reference it in our
view controller call its methods set its
properties we've also created an IV
action which links the storyboard to
handle user taps on the request ads okay
so now that we've built the apps user
interface next we actually have to do a
little coding so we're going to go into
the view controller dot Swift file and
we're going to create the add a request
back in story are back in Xcode we're
going to close the assistant editor and
go into the view controller and in the
viewdidload method this is the method
that gets called when the view
controller is getting created and is
gonna appear and is going to be visible
to the user of the of your app we're
going to set the ad unit ID property on
the banner view to our test ad unit in
this case next we're going to set the
root view controller property equal to
self and self in this case is this view
controller which is the root view
controller of our banner view that we
placed in storyboard so I just want to
mention that we're using our test ad
unit ID in this case but for your apps
you're going to want to we recommend
that you create a new test ad or an ad
unit ID for each unique placement of an
ad in your app and you were going to do
this on apps AdMob comm now we want to
create the ad request so we're going to
go ahead and create a GAD request that's
our SDKs ad request we're going to call
its initializer
next we're gonna call the load request
method on the banner view object and
we're gonna pass it to the request
object so super intuitive syntax using
swift to set up the banner view and make
the ad request we build just to make
sure everything works does build
successfully so now we're ready to run
the app and we're gonna do this in an
iPhone 6's simulator so we go up to the
tops s if I iPhone 6's hit the play
button a Run button and now you'll see
the request ads button up here we're
gonna go ahead and click on it and we
have our test banner ad even says we did
a good job displaying the 320 by 50
banner ad it was really that simple to
integrate with AdMob and a place a
banner ad in our app we created an Xcode
project we linked the mobile ads SDK to
our project we built our user inner
face by adding the request ads button
and the banner view to storyboard and we
created the ad request in the view
controller so very straightforward and
we did all of that in just four lines of
code alright so there's one last thing
I'd like to mention flip back over the
slides and that's that we have a bunch
of resources available to help you get
started integrating with AdMob we have a
full suite of example apps for both
Android and iOS iOS written in both
Objective C and Swift on github we also
have developer guides and a QuickStart
to help you learn the implementations
for the other ad types that AdMob
supports so we'll have a link to these
resources at the end of our presentation
so please take the time to check those
out so now I'm going to turn it over to
Eric Eric who's gonna show you how to
implement another ad type that AdMob
supports called interstitial ads thank
you Tristan hi everyone my name is Eric
lengthen slug I'm a developer programs
engineer with AdMob and I'm going to
talk to you today about how to integrate
interstitial ads in the same application
that Tristan used to integrate banners
and you'll see that it's just as easy so
due to the full-screen nature of
interstitial ads because when they're
presented they take over the full screen
and take over the user experience it's
very important to split the the
interstitial loading step as well as the
showing step and these two steps within
your code may happen seconds apart or
even minutes apart depending on how
early you can do the pre loading so I'm
now going to walk through how to do this
first step which is the pre loading
so we're gonna continue on with with
Tristan's example just as he left off
and the first step is to instantiate a
gap interstitial object we're gonna do
we're going to create a local variable
and we're gonna call it interstitial and
it's gonna be a type gat interstitial
this is the object we're going to
reference throughout the rest of our
class the next thing we're gonna do is
initialize the interstitial and we're
gonna use the same request ads method
that was set up previously to do this
this means that when the request adds
button is pressed we're gonna start
requesting the banner as well as the
interstitial now there are two things I
want to note here first is that we
initialize the interstitial in the
request ABS method rather than
viewdidload like we did for banners so
the reason that we did that is because
any AdMob interstitials are a
one-time-use object what that means is
once you load the interstitial and then
show it if you want to load another
interstitial later in your app you're
actually have to create a new
interstitial object so by doing it in
request ads here we can guarantee that
every time you press the request ads
button to load an interstitial that
we're doing it on a fresh interstitial
object the second thing I want to
mention is that the ad unit ID is
different than the one that we use for
banners so this happens to be our test
interstitial ad unit ID so we get our
test interstitial back but in general
having different ad units for each
placement is highly recommended because
then when you go into AdMob and check
out your reporting you can get segmented
reporting for each placement in your app
and see how each one is performing and a
point is performing to bed you can
investigate why so the last thing we
need to do to start loading the
interstitial is simply call the load
request method this looks exactly the
same as it did for banners and you can
see that we actually use the same
request object because the request
object is simply used for ad targeting
we can actually reference that same
object and make the request for both ad
formats as well as the rest of the
formats that AdMob offers so that's it
that's all it took to preload our ad so
now I want to go through the second step
which is actually showing it
so showing the interstitial we're gonna
do at a later point in our app and what
I'm gonna do is create a second button
and it's gonna I'm gonna simulate a game
because games are a great way to use
interstitials and so I want to create a
button and call it end game to simulate
a intercept or a game level being over
so we're not gonna skip any steps we're
gonna go right back into the storyboard
and create a second button we're gonna
put this button below the request ads
button we're going to use auto layout to
set constraints just as we did for the
request ads button except this time I'm
gonna put it 40 points lower than
request ads that way the buttons don't
sit on top of each other I'm also gonna
call this button endgame because once
again I'm simulating the game being over
the next thing we have to do is hook up
this end game button back into our view
controller so that when we actually tap
it something happens so I'm gonna hook
it up to our view controller and I'm
calling it and game over to signify that
our game is being over and so when I
click this button
what has ever in the game over functions
will be executed so that's all we need
to do for storyboard now we're going to
go back close the assistant editor and
go back into our view controller dot
Swift file and implement this game over
function so there's two quick steps to
show the interstitial the first thing we
want to do is check that the
interstitial is ready so you might have
pre-loaded this ad if you had a game at
the start of the game level you might
have implemented the request ads
function and then the users playing your
game and depending on how quick a level
is the level might be a few seconds if
you have a simple tap game it might be a
few minutes if you have a more complex
game level and so it's it's undetermined
how long you have you've requested the
ads in advance and so when it comes time
to show you want to make sure that the
interstitial is ready prior to
attempting to show it assuming the
interstitial is ready we're gonna go
ahead and call our present from root
view controller function to present the
interstitial and this is what will pop
up the full screen ad this present from
group view controller method takes in
one parameter which is a view controller
and
is telling the SDK what the
viewcontroller is that you're currently
on and when the interstitial is
dismissed
that's the view controller the user will
be taken back to once once you do
dismiss the interstitial so you can see
we have about four or five lines of code
for interstitials and we're done that's
it we're gonna run our app and see what
this looks like so I'm gonna press on
the request ads button to start the
interstitial loading and we're just
going to wait a few seconds to make sure
the interstitial is loaded at a later
point in time we'll click the end game
button to simulate the game being over
and you'll see our test interstitial ad
and so this shows that we've
successfully integrated interstitials in
our application as well as banners
earlier and look we have about ten lines
of code in our app completely made from
scratch and we have AdMob fully
integrated
the next thing I want to talk about is
add events you may have been wondering
in this previous demo I might have
waited two seconds that might have
waited two minutes but how did I know
that the interstitial actually
successfully loaded maybe there was a
network problem maybe the interstitial
failed to load
maybe the ad just took a really long
time because the connection is slow you
might want to know earlier in advance if
that interstitial actually loaded rather
than having to pull is ready and is
ready consistently so the SDK offers add
events that notify you of both loading
States as well as presentation states
within the process so the to loading
events that we have are the add received
as well as the add failed to load every
single time you call the load request
method you will get either one of these
two events back whether or not the ad
succeeded or the ad failed for ad
presentation we have three events the
first is when the ad actually presents
an overlay you can implement this
callback to pause your app when the ad
overlay is presented because your game
will no longer be active similarly once
the ad is dismissed
we give you another callback so as the
owner of the application you can start
the next game level or prepare the user
for the next game level or whatever else
your app does you can continue doing it
finally if while the interstitial is
being presented and the user clicks on
it and that causes the user to exit the
application to go to Safari or to go to
the App Store to download some other app
you'll also be notified with the ad will
leave application event so these are the
ad events that we have for interstitials
these ad events also exist for banners
in the same function and I'd like to
walk through how to actually implement
these at events
so at event implementation is broken up
into three quick steps we first have to
make our class implements the GAT
interstitial delegate protocol and this
is saying that our class will be able to
handle these events the second step
we're gonna do is tell our interstitial
objects that when you have these events
send them to our class that implements
the interstitial delegate so that we can
handle them
finally we simply need to implement the
add events that we care about if you
implement get interstitial delegate you
don't need to implement all five of
those events you can implement just one
or two if that's all that you care about
so let's walk through doing that now and
we're going to show a demo of just
implementing the add view or the
interstitial ad being received so that
we can know in advance whether or not
we're going to be able to show it
all right so let's get right back into
it continuing on right from where we
left off the first thing that we're
going to do this is step one I described
is make our class implement data
interstitial delegate so by implementing
this protocol we're saying that our
class is capable of handling these
events when they come back the second
step is to go back into our request adds
method where we define the interstitial
and we're going to set the delegate
property to our self so this delegate
property has to be of type dad
interstitial dead interstitial delegate
which we didn't step one and we're
telling the interstitial hey when you
have these events notify our class and
our class will be able to handle it
so we've promised the interstitial that
we can handle these events now we
actually have to implement these events
and so the final step is to implement
the ones we care about and in this
example we're gonna implement
interstitial did receive AB for this
demo all I'm gonna do is print the
function which is going to log a message
to our logging screen with with the
method name and this will be an
indicator that the interstitial was
actually received so that's it just
three more lines of code and we have an
add event integrated so I'm going to run
this app again and we're gonna see the
difference of how we're going to be able
to see that the interstitial is actually
loaded a quick second after pressing
that request ads button you can see
logging to the screen our interstitial
did receive add events at this point we
can be confident that the interstitial
was received and that when our game is
over we will be able to show that
interstitial so I didn't have to wait
this long but if I continue on with the
demo and press the GAMEOVER button boom
we now have our interstitial and we can
be confident that it was ready
so you've seen how easy AdMob is to
implement it was literally ten lines of
code three more four at events and we
again have a fully integrated app with
AdMob with banners interstitials now for
our interstitial demo you saw our test
interstitials and while they're very
functional and they say you've
integrated AdMob successfully we admit
that it's not the most beautiful app
format you've ever seen so I'd like to
talk about some of the actual
interstitial formats that you'll see
once you've integrated AdMob and your
app is in production and the first one
of these formats is app installed
interstitials so those of you who have
integrated AdMob before probably know
that F installed interstitials
themselves aren't anything new but what
is new is our complete redesign of the
format for both Android and iOS in this
latest revision we've used a technology
called color extraction to actually
extract a primary color from either the
app icon or from the cover photo and be
able to use that color within the rest
of the ads such as in the footer as well
as the install button so this is great
for advertisers because the app has a
consistent look and feel with the with
the advertisers app and users we find it
more engaging because they like these
different styles as well as different
colors of the ad the next format I'd
like to talk about is interactive
interstitial ads these are rich html5
ads that the advertiser can control and
they can build their own advertiser
experience within these ads so
advertisers love it because they get the
freedom to do these things and they're
not controlled or limited to some kind
of AD template and they can build these
interactive demos users like it because
the the ad itself is interactive they
can actually scroll around such as in
this boom Beach ad you can see that it
allows you to scroll through and see the
cast of characters in this game so
because users can actually take action
they're more engaged with this type of
AD speaking of ads being interactive and
engaging I'd like to talk about trial
run ads trial run ads allow the user to
play a game for up to 60 seconds without
even having to install the app we think
this is a really really cool format
users love it because they don't
actually have to go through the pain of
installing an app waiting for it to load
waiting for it to open
cetera before they necessarily start
playing this game they can start trying
it out right away to see if they like it
advertisers love this because the user
can try right away for the same reasons
they're more likely to get the user
hooked on this a type of game and if the
user does decide does decide to install
this app it's very likely that it's
gonna be a high quality conversion
because the user has already tried out
the app they know they like it and
they're downloading it for that reason
so what I've showed you is three
separate ad formats and I've explained
how they're great for users and how
they're great for advertisers but you
guys are all app developers and you're
probably wondering well how does this
help me so the way this helps you is if
advertisers are happy that these ads are
engaging and deliver high-quality
conversions they'll be willing to pay
more for these ads and if users are more
engaged with these ads and can interact
with them they're more likely to to
engage and click them and both of these
things result in higher monetization for
publishers so that is where the
publisher benefit comes in so if there's
three things I'd like you guys to take
away from this presentation it's this
first off AdMob is simple you've seen
how we've integrated an app from scratch
with about ten lines of code and we've
integrated both banner and interstitial
ads into it second off AdMob is scalable
AdMob is used by over 1 million apps
each month so that demonstrates that
even for small publishers it's easy to
get started and even for big publishers
such as eater max you've seen that AdMob
can add significant value to their app
business by integrating ads finally the
AdMob app formats are beautiful we've
demonstrated a few banner and
interstitial formats here and I would
love for you guys to stick around for
the next session where we'll discuss our
late at innovate latest innovations in
both rewarded ads as well as native ads
so that will be happening right back in
this room at 10 o'clock so that's it for
our presentation thank you all you guys
for showing up I'm going to leave some
resources on this next slide for those
of you want to copy that down and get
started implementing ad
your app today and will be around for
questions around this area right now if
you want to come talk to us so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
