going to cover one of my most favorite
subjects which is firebase hosting so
you probably use firebase hosting to
deploy static websites but did you know
that you can use firebase hosting to
deploy dynamic node apps and because
firebase hosting is backed by a CDN
there's lots of cool performance tricks
we can do to optimize our page loads so
let's dive right down into the laptop so
I'm here in the terminal and just an
empty project the first thing I need to
do is initialize my firebase hosting
project however if you don't have the
command-line tools installed all you
have to do is do an NPM ID SG firebase -
tools since I have it installed I'm
going to say firebase and knit hosting
this will set me up with a hosting
project and so I need to set my default
project and then my public directory and
then some other default files and then
now that I have all of my hosting setup
I want to set up my dynamic cloud
functions and to do that I'll say
firebase and knit functions so this is
going to go through and ask me if one
will install the dependencies from NPM
which I do all right now that it's
finished installing we want to go into
the functions folder and I want to
install the Express server framework so
NPM I express save and with that done
we'll CD back and open up our favorite
code editor so in the code editor you
can see that we have two folders we have
this function folder and this public
folder and it's really important to
understand the difference between these
two if you've used firebase hosting
before you'll recognize this public
folder because usually your entire
static application goes inside of here
but now that we can do things
dynamically our dynamic server code goes
into our functions folder and the reason
why they are separate is because they
actually go to two different places so
if you need something to generate your
assets dynamically it needs to also be
in the function folder so I'm going to
go into the index.js file and you can
see that we actually have this little
boilerplate cloud function so I'm going
to uncommon it and we're going to go
step by step and see what's going on so
the first thing you do is you require
from the firebase function
ock and then from here we create a HTTP
function and what this says is is that
every single time there is a request to
this function we can take in the request
and handle the response and then also
what we're doing is we're taking the
results of this function and we are
storing it to an export and right now
we're naming the exports hello world so
all of the dynamic code can happen
inside of this on request callback but
it's very likely that you don't want
your entire server operating in one
callback so instead we're going to use
Express so to use Express we're going to
go up here to the top and require from
Express and then once we have expressed
imported we can create an Express app an
Express app allows us to listen to when
a user or machine sends us a request and
then we can handle the response so in
this case whenever someone does a get
request to the timestamp route I can get
that request and then send back a
response so inside of this callback we
could do something like send hello from
firebase but instead I'm going to send a
current date so use dates dot now so now
inside of on request we can actually
take this Express app and then use that
as the parameter so I'm almost ready to
deploy this but what I need to do now is
I need to hook up this cloud function
with my firebase hosting project and I
can do that inside of firebase JSON so
far we saw JSON allows us to do lots of
great things like set up redirects and
headers and in our case you want to use
rewrites and what we want to say is is
when we see the route of timestamp we
want to call the function app and this
function name app we can know to name it
app because here in index J s when we
say exports dot right now we call it
hello world but if we change it to app
we now match the same name as we have
here in firebase JSON so
test this out on in the command line and
I'm going to use firebase serve - - only
functions and hosting which this will do
a local emulation so now that that's
emulating I'm gonna go out to the
browser so we can see right here we have
our time stamp and every time we do a
refresh we get a brand new dynamic time
stamp now that we have our app running
let's actually take a look and see
what's happening when the user makes a
request so what I either makes a request
it goes all the way out to our server
our server does all the dynamic
generation and then sends the response
back to the user however our user could
be really far away from our server and
in that case it actually could take a
long time to make this round-trip so
it'd be really good is if we didn't have
to send the content back this far what
if we actually had a server to cache the
results right near the user well this is
exactly how a content delivery network
works so adding caching to your dynamic
server code is really easy because it
only actually takes one line of code
back in my index J s I'm going to go and
create another route that's kind of like
time stamp but just a little different
so I'm going to create a new route
called time stamp
- cached so I can cache the content by
setting the cache control header so
using response that set that is how I
can set a header and this cache control
has three parts to its value the first
part is public and what public States is
that we can actually cache this content
on a server if it was private we could
only cache this content in the user's
browser the second part is the max-age
property and max-age says how long we
can store this content in the user's
browser in this case we'll set it for
300 seconds and this last part is the s
max age and s max age says how long can
we store this on the CDN in this case
we're going to set it for 600 seconds or
10 minutes so now I'm going to save and
we're going to go and actually deploy
this app to production but before we can
do that we need to go back to firebase
JSON and we actually need to redo our
rewrite because right now we rewrite
only matches for the timestamp route so
if we want it to also match for
other routes we can change it to use a
star star glob which will say match any
route so now in the command line all I
have to do is write firebase deploy and
this will go out and deploy our static
assets to firebase hosting and our
dynamic code to cloud functions so now
that my app is deployed I'm going to
copy this far base hosting URL and then
I'm going to go up to this time-stamped
page and you can see right here we have
our timestamp so now if I pull up the
chrome dev tools and I go to the network
panel I'm going to do a refresh we see
that was 437 milliseconds 228 now if I
go to the cached version we can see how
fast that is we see that that wasn't
really much different there was at 690
milliseconds but watch what happens when
i refresh again went down to all the way
to 17 milliseconds and actually pay
attention to the timestamp on the page
when i refresh it doesn't actually
change and that's because this content
is now cached so you're probably
wondering why the second load of our
cache page was much faster than our
first and to see let's take a look at
what's going on behind the scenes so
just like before we have a user who's
going to make a request for our website
but with a content delivery network it's
actually going to stop at this edge
server which is close to the user and
the edge server is going to check to see
if the content is in its cache if it's
not in scash it's going to forward the
request off to the origin server the
origin server is going to do the dynamic
content generation and then it's going
to send that back to the edge server the
edge server is going to cache this
content which will be controlled by the
cache control header that you set it'll
then send that content back to the user
now let's say another user in that same
area makes a request for the web site
that request will go out to the edge
server and the edge server will
recognize that it has this content in
the cache so rather than going out to
the origin and doing the new dynamic
generation of a page it's going to send
back the content to the user and that
response time is going to
be much much faster because it's local
to the user and what's amazing about
this is that other users in this area
also can make requests for this content
and it doesn't have to go out to the
origin server it goes right back from
their local edge server for a really
fast page load now after the cache
expires the whole process will begin
again where we go out to the edge server
the edge server recognizes that the
content has expired
so it goes out to the origin origin
dynamically generates sends it back
caches it according to your cache
control headers and then back to the
user where it's cached so far I've just
added a timestamp which isn't really all
that interesting so let's actually do
something a little more advanced with
server templating Express has this
really great mechanism called a view
engine and a view engine allows you to
use whatever server templating language
you like without really caring about the
actual implementation
so what we're first going to do is we're
going to create our server template
we're going to do that inside of a
folder called views and we're putting
this file actually inside of the
functions directory because we need this
to generate our content dynamically so
I'm going to create index HVS inside of
here I'm just going to do a little HTML
boilerplate and we're going to name this
app true fax or as you like to call them
fax
so now we'll create an h1 where we name
it true facts and then within here I
want to iterate through a list of facts
so I'll create a ul and then I'll use
the handle bars each helper and I'll say
for each one of these facts we will use
a list item and spit out that list items
text so now that I have the server
template I actually need to go and
install my handlebars dependency and
then set up my view engine so here in
the command line what I can do is I'm
going to CD into my functions folder and
I'm going to do NPM I handlebars and
then also a library called consolidate
which contains all of the Express view
engines now they're installed I go back
to my code editor and inside of index.js
I'm going to require engines from
consolidate
and then now that I have this I can
create the engine for my handlebars so
if the app dot engine I'll name it HBS
and then I'll use consolidate here and
say engines dot handlebars now if my
engine created I'm going to set my views
folder to be the local dot slash views
and then lastly I need to use that
engine so I'm going to say app dot set
view engine and use HBS so I can do now
is I'm going to delete my timestamp
routes and just use this timestamp
cached
but rather than naming it timestamp
cache we're going to just use slash for
the index and what we want to do is is
we want to use response render and we'll
say render the index page and send back
this data and what we'd like to do is
we'd like to get some facts and then
render this page based upon the facts
that we have retrieved so to get data
I'm going to use the firebase admin SDK
which I'm going to import up here by
saying require firebase - admin and the
first thing I need to do is create in
firebase app so create a variable for
that and I'll say firebase initialize
app and you can get your configuration
from the firebase website or you can use
this nice little helper from the
functions SDK or we can say functions
config dot firebase and this will
actually use the configured projects
credentials so now that we have this
method I'm going to create a function
I'm going to call it get fax and then
within here I'm going to create a
reference to my fax so I'll say firebase
app dot database dot ref and I'll name
that my fax ref and from here I can
return ref dot once because once we'll
get this data one time and since this
returns a promise I'll chain this then
I'll get the snap shot and then just
unwrap the value and then now that I
have my facts and
side of here I'll call get facts chain
on the promise and then I can return
this res done der inside so now I'll
save and I'll go actually and serve up
my app so in the command line I'll run
my server again so firebase serve - only
functions and hosting and with my server
emulated let me go check out the web
page now when I go to my home page you
can see that I'm not actually getting my
fax I'm actually getting the default
firebase hosting page and there's
actually a really good reason behind
this so we check out the folders in the
code editor you can see that we actually
have this index.html in the public
folder the firebase hosting will
automatically serve a static file over a
dynamic route and this is really good
because if it didn't then you would have
to whitelist every single one of your
static assets and in this case to fix
this all I have to do is delete
index.html and then now I'll go out and
deploy my website so now that it's
deployed I'm going to copy this URL and
now we have our list of facts because we
no longer have that index.html so this
web page is looking pretty bare-bones so
I'm actually to go and add some CSS so
here in my index that HVS I'm going to
create a link and I'm going to link out
to style dot CSS you might be wondering
where should we put style dot CSS should
it go inside functions or should it go
inside public I'm actually going to
create it inside public because it's a
static asset I don't need it for any
server generation and it doesn't change
unless I deploy to firebase hosting so
I'm going to use a little snippet here
now I'm going to save and we're going to
deploy now we go back to our page we
have our nice styled version and the
great thing is and we go to our network
you can see that each one of them have a
nice
latency and they're all served over the
same domain and you actually can
generate more than just HTML content you
can generate all sorts of things like
JSON so we go back to our index CAS we
can actually take this app get route and
we create another one but we'll name
this one fax dot JSON and then from here
rather than calling read render can call
Reza JSON and then just pass back
effects and then now rather than serving
up HTML I actually have created myself a
JSON API with a CDN caching layer and
then now I'll go out and deploy my
website so now after I deploy I can go
up to FAQs JSON and you can see that we
have all of our JSON data being returned
so we take away anything from this video
know that you can now host no taps on
the firebase hosting and you can take
that generated result and store it into
a CDN for a huge perf benefit now the
question is what about JavaScript
frameworks with JavaScript frameworks
all of your content and your render is
held up in JavaScript but modern
JavaScript frameworks have tooling
around server-side rendering so you can
take that same client side app render it
out on the server for a fast first heat
and if you stay tuned we're actually
going to have an entire series on
server-side rendering with various
JavaScript frameworks so make sure to
subscribe so you stay up to date oh and
if you were able to get an app deployed
today with no to firebase hosting send
us a tweet because that kind of stuff
just makes us happy so that's all for
today and I will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
