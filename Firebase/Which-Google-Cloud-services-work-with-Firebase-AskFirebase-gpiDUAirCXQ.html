today's episode of hashtag ask firebase
what's up everybody david here and
little-known fact about me I once broke
my leg in the middle of the wilderness
and I had to crawl back two miles half
of which was like up a river and yeah
hashtag true story but we've been
getting a ton of questions this week on
YouTube Twitter stack overflow and if
you want your question answered next
week make sure to use the hashtag ask
firebase but let's get into this week's
questions there's there's no coffee in
here so Santosh on Twitter asks are
there any video tutorials a firebase
login using Google on the web well
Santosh you can actually subscribe to
this YouTube channel and we'll send you
updates every time we post a new
tutorial you know YouTube channel
youtube.com slash firebase and I have it
on good authority that there will be a
video on using firebase email and
password login for the web pretty soon
and if you wait just a bit longer you
might just find one for Google in the
web let's go to the next question
add water on Twitter asks how can I
create relations like making a friend
requests adding users or blocking
someone so the real-time database is a
no sequel database so it doesn't have
relations like a sequel database would
but the key concept to understand is the
shared key so imagine your data
structure of users and users contains
your entire list of users like in this
case we have the user of David and this
user of Alice and let's say I want to
represent that David is friends with
Alice in this social network well to do
that I have this friendships node and
then I can share the key of David which
is the same key that's underneath the
users key and then this way I can say
that David has the friendships with
Alice just by using Alice's key which is
the same key you see over here from
underneath users and to access this data
using the firebase JavaScript SDK we
just create a
reference to the friendship ski using
that users key and that way we get all
of the users back that that person is
friends with so there's no real
relationships or foreign keys or
anything like that in a no sequel
database but if you share that same key
while you're structuring your data it's
gonna make your life a lot easier and a
lot easier for you to be able to
represent these relationship type
structures excellent question
let's go to the next one on Twitter
inter Plato asks what's the best way to
push to firebase hosting for a repo
hosted on github
well interplay tow the firebase CLI has
a specific method that gives you a key
for CI continuous integration systems to
use like Travis so in the firebase CLI
you just type firebase login colon CI
and this will take you through a bit of
a login process but once you've finished
you will have this key and then if you
go into the Travis configuration for
your github repo you put that in and you
give it a label of firebase token or
something like that
and then now in your Travis ya Mille
after a successful deployment you can
run the script firebase deploy - - token
and then use that label right there so
whatever a private variable you need and
really that's all it is
so it's just set up the secret key in
Travis push to the repo and then boom
you've deployed a firebase hosting so
thank you interplay tow that was a great
question let's see what's up next
so Richard on YouTube asks I'm building
an application where users can choose to
share their user-generated data and my
question is how do I ensure
authentication and security by only
letting authorized users access that
data well thank you for your question
Richard what you are looking for is a
whitelist let's say you're gonna make a
note-taking app where you want to have a
user create a note and then they can
share that with only the people they
invite you know to see that note and so
the data structure for the note should
you know just be a simple list of notes
and so we have two notes and this list
and each note has properties that
describe you know who owns this note and
the text that makes up this note now
this tells me what each note you know
is but it doesn't tell me who can access
this note and to do that I can create a
whitelist node and so each item
underneath this whitelist is the same
key for that note and then we can do
inside here is say okay which users have
access to this note and so user one in
this case does as well as user four and
then now that we have this whitelist
we can write a security rule that only
lets users on that whitelist read the
note
so in our security rules we can
essentially say when we see a note let's
go to the whitelist and check to see if
that user belongs to the whitelist if
they do we'll let them read it if not
we're gonna totally reject it and they
can't access it so just know that if
you're ever in a situation where you
want to secure a piece of data to only a
specific set of users that you want to
use a whitelist so thanks Richard so
those a great question let's go and move
on to the next one Carlos on YouTube
asks which folder do I have to use to
deploy an angular 2 app well Carlos
you're actually not the first second
third fourth it you know you get it a
lot of people have asked me this
question and it's a pretty common
mistake so what I recommend doing is
using the angular CLI because the
angular CLI uses a common folder that it
builds your applications to and that
folders name is just dist so when you're
setting up your firebase project by
using firebase seen it you specify dist
as your public folder and then after
that Carlos all you really have to do is
a firebase deploy and you have your
angular 2 app on the web so let's see
what the next question is this is the
easy one some random guy on YouTube you
know seriously his name screen name is
actually some random guy he asked will
you have an angular to firebase tutorial
out in the near future well some random
guy Jeff Cross and I are still working
on the library so it is a work in
progress and once we get some things
tied up we will definitely have some
screencasts and blog posts and all that
great stuff but for now if you want to
stay up to date then follow the github
repo at github comm slash angular slash
angular fire and you can read all of the
issues you can check out the
documentation we have so far and that
should get you up to speed so some
random guy
if you want to check that repo out just
go to the link in the description and
head on over to github and we will work
on getting those tutorials out to you as
soon as possible
excellent question and I think we got
one more mr. happy asked on YouTube mr.
happy
great screen name so mr. happy asked
which Google cloud services work with
firebase bigquery machine learning
compute engine well mr. happy
the main integration is with firebase
analytics and bigquery so firebase
Analytics is a free unlimited analytics
tool that's built specifically for apps
and it collects tons of crazy awesome
information like your average revenue
per user your total number of active
users it can even tell you which app
version your users are on what version
of the operating system they're using
and you can take all of this data and
just export it all out to bigquery which
is great at crunching those numbers and
giving you insights to that data where
you can run crazy powerful queries on
that and you can run the real-time
database server SDKs on Google compute
engine so mr. happy great question and
great screen name so let's move on to
the next question
so music a asked on YouTube how do i
download files with firebase storage to
a specific folder on an android device
well music a Barbie storage has a method
for you to download files to a local
temp file and to do that you just create
a reference out to that file in firebase
storage then you call the method file
dot create temp file and then from there
all you have to do is call get file on
the reference and then add a success
listener and when that success listener
fires you have yourself a local file so
music a it's just as simple as creating
a reference and then downloading it to a
temp file and another question I really
hope I say this person's name right back
by are asked on YouTube firebase you
guys are great firebase is so awesome
how do I sort post in my database
by number of likes or by date I'm
building an iOS app and I'm trying to
show the latest and most liked
host in the top of a table view well bat
by our thank you and you're awesome too
so if you're building an iOS app you're
gonna want to use firebase UI because it
can bind your real-time database
references to a table view which makes
your life a whole lot easier so really
what you need to do is you need to
create a reference to your list of posts
then you can use one of our querying
methods and so in your case you can
query ordered by value of likes so this
will sort everything by the like value
or if you need to sort everything by the
date to get the most recent you can do a
query ordered by the timestamp as well
from there you just take this query
reference and then you just pass that
off to firebase UI and that'll bind it
right to your table view so about my are
all you have to know is just query your
reference and then pass it off to
firebase UI so I think we have another
question for WOD asks on YouTube
tutorial on polymer fire element well
Fahd and everybody else interested for
that matter if you want to see a
tutorial on polymer fire you should
tweet at Rob Dodson hey Rob where's the
polymer fire cast you and David you
totally do one and I think we can get
something working thanks for log so that
was a lot of great questions this week
but one question that I commonly get is
like what kind of questions should I be
asking I like to think that the best
questions are ones that benefit like
everyone who watches so if you have
questions like how do i best secure my
data or structure my data or how do i
create custom events to target you know
whatever in firebase analytics or how do
i send a push notification to only this
specific type of users these are all
great questions because these are the
type of things that multiple people are
wondering so if you have a question that
you think can really benefit the
community call it out and just send it
to us on twitter youtube whatever just
hashtag ask firebase so that's it for
this week thank you all so much for
sending in your questions they are
seriously so great so make sure to keep
sending them in even if you've asked a
question you can go ask another one it's
fine there's no quota I mean there's a
bit of a quota it don't sound like 100
but you know you know I mean that's all
for this episode if you want your one
answer next week just make sure to use
hashtag asked firebase and all the
social channels and we will see you here
next week Wednesday at noon on the next
episode of hashtag ass-first
let's all tweet at Rob Dodson a polymer
fire cast I think so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
