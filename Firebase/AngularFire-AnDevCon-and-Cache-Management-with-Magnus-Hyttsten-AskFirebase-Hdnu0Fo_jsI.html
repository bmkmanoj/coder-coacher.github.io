o- how do you say question time in
Swedish their new ducks photo what's up
everybody welcome to a brand new episode
of hashtag ask firebase and it's a great
one because we have Magnus on the team
and fun fun fact about Magnus's is that
back in nineteen ninety he won the
silver medal in disco dancing in sweden
and a fun fact about david is that for
two straight years he had to sit and
program in the ancient programming
language ada hashtag true story we have
lots of great questions this week from
twitter stack overflow youtube and wait
for just dive right in sure it's
question time so the first question
comes from David on Twitter great name
dude but David asks when will you
support angular universal breakfast
final angular but what's angular
universal for those of you don't know
angular universal is a tool that allows
you to do server ending with the angular
framework and that's really great if
you're trying to get really fast first
paint times with your apps right now we
currently do not support that with the
angularfire to framework which is a
library i'm working on but that is only
because we're working on shoring that up
with some of the other firebase features
like you know firebase storage and also
getting it up to date with the new
release candidate with angular but once
we get a lot of that smoothed out we're
gonna work with people on the universal
team to get that working together so
just sit tight David and just watch the
repo at github com / angular /
angularfire too great question hey it's
question time so the next question is
from Burke a from Twitter and he is
asking is it necessary to remove
listeners from the database and Burke a
it absolutely is your activity or your
fragment that's using the database
reference its lifetime may expire and in
that case that listener will be dangling
in the memory of the Android device and
that's very very bad so you
must absolutely make sure to remove all
of those listeners when your activity or
fragment goes out of scope and you can
use the activity or fragment lifecycle
to manage these so on start methods or
the unpause methods to create a listener
but also remove it when you've left so
that's something really good to do great
question birthday and we've come to
another question so this next question
comes from adam on twitter and adam asks
are you going to update angularfire and
then rerecord the screen test you didn't
rerecord the screencast yeah I did and
we actually updated angularfire to the
brand new firebase 30 SDK and then just
last week drop the brand new screencast
so if you want to check that out the
link is in the description great
question Adam have you done this one hey
Magnus let's answer a question sure the
next question is from Pierre and he's
asking what is the best way to manage
the cash in the real-time datums and the
long answer Pierre is you don't because
the cash is maintained by the real-time
database behind the curtains and we
don't want to expose that API so that
apps can depend on the cash in any way
all of that stuff is done automatically
by the firebase real-time database there
is no need to access that cash but a
really solid question we've had it
before it's question time
so the next question comes from Danielle
on Twitter and Danielle asked is there a
way to get a list of users in my app
hold on from the authentication API or
the real-time database actually you
would use both so if you go to the
firebase console and you go to the
authentication tab you'll see a list of
your users you know from your app but if
you want to get them programmatically
you'll need to save them as they create
their accounts to the real-time database
and if you want to make sure that data
is secure you can just write security
rules to match against their you IDs so
it is a great question Daniel I've done
that yeah yeah what was it fun it works
firebase it works can we start filming
this in 3d let's dive into the next
question absolutely the next question is
from mia than me on is asking can i get
the storage size of the document or the
duration of a video file or the number
of downloads for an entity stored in
firebase storage and mia yes you can
there are a couple of things to this
first of all there is metadata stored
together with all of the things stored
in firebase towards so the size of the
file you can get using standard metadata
fields then you can also create custom
metadata fields fields that you actually
populate so when the user is uploading a
video for example you could set the
duration of that video as a custom
metadata field yeah but what about the
number of downloads that's right the
number of downloads same thing as for
the duration you can use a custom
metadata feel that you populate when the
thing gets uploaded to firebase storage
or better yet being perhaps in certain
scenarios you can store that data in the
firebase real-time database and what's
great about using the real-time database
and storage together is that they use a
similar file path data structure where
you could say / file / file name and
then map that to a path in your
real-time database and then just use
similar security roles in both storage
in real-time database to keep that data
secure thank you me um yeah really good
question that simplifies a lot oh yeah I
love security firebase what works so
Magnus last week we had dug on and we
answered all these questions from and
def con he told me you were there so
what were you up to if you won the code
then you should code hold away get up on
the floor that's right i was there i
interviewed a lot of firebase experts
did you interview Frank yeah but did you
interview Mike sure what did you
interview Sarah absolutely Timothy yeah
Timothy is great Jennifer of course Doug
absolutely Frank sure Sam yeah so if you
want to see more fire based content you
should check those interviews out for
the inside story so Magnus thank you so
much for coming on thanks for having me
and if you like this video make sure to
LIKE and subscribe and if you want to
see his interviews with the firebase
team just make sure to check out the
link in the description and we will see
you on the next episode of hashtag a
starbase question next click anyway next
