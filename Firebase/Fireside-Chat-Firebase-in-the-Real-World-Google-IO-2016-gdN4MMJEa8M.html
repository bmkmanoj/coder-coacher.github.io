row i am a program manager on the
developer relations team for google and
i run early access programs for google
and today is our firebase fireside chat
with shazam pic collage urbansitter and
we go and i'm really excited to host
today's chat with four of our really
important firebase early access partners
and today's a great chance for you to
ask them questions about their fire
based integrations and learn more about
if fire bases are good to fit for you
and I will let the panel introduce
themselves no hi everyone my name is
chemin product manager in shazam for the
Android platform hi I'm Jordan on the
Android engineering manager at chisholm
hi my name is Sarah Salim and I'm the
strategy director at urbansitter where
we help parents find trusted babysitters
hi I'm Ryan cook I'm the lead Android
developer at urbansitter and I did most
the firebase implementation hi we are
pickle OSH I'm Angela the product
manager for entry anamika I'm also proud
manager above focus on iowa's hi guys my
name is honey metal I'm from we go
Singapore to travel metasearch engine
I'm the VP mobile so I take care of the
mobile apps product all right so we've
got microphones in the audience so
please feel free to come up and ask
questions and to kick it off though
could you guys each tell us a bit more
so when Google came to you a few months
ago and said we were building firebases
unified mobile app development platform
what was your reaction and now having
having spent the past few months
developing with firebase and launching
on firebase what what guidance would you
share with other developers who are
learning about firebase for the first
time yeah sure I guess there were a lot
of excitement in Shazam and in some
curiosity as well we knew that with a
firebase
expertise combined with the Google
knowledge and and Google scalability
then probably a lot of opportunities for
us to improve our apps so we were very
good to know what all the products we
could integrate with and when it comes
to guidance I'd say yeah you need to
figure out because there are quite lots
of different products that you can
integrate with with five days so the
approach we had inches homage to go step
by step to understand what's the most
important thing we want to solve and on
our side engagement and retention was
really a key thing so we decided to
integrate first with a dynamic link and
that was great and I think we're going
to talk about our use case but yeah that
would be really it because you have
different things you can improve with
firebase you have the monetization you
have the quality of your app you have
the retention the engagement so probably
do a do a priority list and see which
are the product that suit that's your
app and then go step by step and if you
have time and and the engineers you can
also integrate with all of them what I
know it was one more thing to add I
guess for as a consumer of quite a
little bit the case there was
recommendation from early on which was
pretty cool and it really is as easy as
it looked in some of the demos here you
just create your configuration file you
drag and drop and it's pretty much
working out of the books from Irish
perspective is definitely first we're a
little can you hear me fine first we
were a little overwhelmed with all the
options but we were able to see
analytics felt like it was core to
getting a lot of value out of all the
features and we're just looking at
improving our analytic solution it was
able to plug it in in such a way that
was easy to write a wrapper around our
existing analytic tools so that it sends
to both our existing tools and firebase
and we're able to immediately start
getting more insights from that we
quickly belt on to crash reporting and
remote config using what we found from
analytics and they all complemented each
other quite well also piccollage is a
photo collage aiding the air
on an iOS entry and windows so for us
our men approach to improve Potter is to
run a lot of experiments so this is this
is the main reason why we are really
interesting to integrate firebase and
right before firebase we were thinking
to try out a Google tag manager and then
we found out that firebase actually
provide more features and even more
powerful and this is why we we decide to
try it on our product yeah and so we've
tried many features in firebase and our
main focus has been like doing running a
lot of experiments so one of the
features we value a lot is remote config
combined with analytics because
previously we use Google state's role to
do a lot of experiments in AV testing so
with remote config we were able to to do
the a/b test within one a PK without
having to do staged rollout and then the
whole process actually has been reduced
from two weeks to one week and I think
another feature is that the
notifications because we're targeting
globally and we want the users to know
our seasonal or holiday sticker packs at
the right time and previously we need to
like stay up late and or even send out
notifications on weekends so with the
schedule feature in in firebase
notification we were able to just
schedule is set it up and then we don't
have to worry about anything anymore so
far rework was a bit different I mean
before Google came to us we actually
went to Google asking for an SDK and the
reason why it's a bit different for us
is because we operate in markets like
Southeast Asia this countries like India
and Indonesia where devices are not as
powerful as in this part of the world
the connectivity is also way way too I
think there's more people on 2g and 3G
until I ain't ready so there's no
there's no hints of LTE coming in as
well very soon so for us I mean as poor
guys
it's a big challenge for us to have
light apps and by light apps I mean
something up to 10mb is something you
know we think is a good benchmark for
our markets but every SDK what we had
and I'm potential like people who had an
app for more than a year would have an
SDK for attribution one final it takes
14 push notifications maybe another one
for a be testing maybe 14 crashes as
well so for every SDK that we add it
adds a good one before and be on the
size and we're sending the same events
and parameters to all the analytics
tools as well so we we approached Google
as well pretty much begged them to ask
requested whatever you can you can think
but we asked Google given the position
to come up with something so when we
heard about firebase actually coming in
we were pretty happy about it obviously
and we jumped onto it so we hopefully in
the ideal way we have only one sdk which
does everything from analytics crashes
push notifications a/b testing dynamic
links and so on thank you I'll take a
lot of questions yeah I was wondering
urban set of guys whether you could tell
us a little bit more about what you were
using remote config for and kind of how
you found that sure so remote Kenisha
Lee we had just implemented the
analytics through the analytics who came
through our new funnels there were two
key funnels that had very low conversion
rates like below twenty percent so it
was kind of an obvious use case of the
can we improve this conversion rates so
we use the remote config to serve a
couple different copies different
options to get past the pages that were
giving people problems and with that we
were able to send the test in to
firebase analytics kinda using the same
tool which is the big sell point of
Ireland firebase and using the same
tools we could see which version was
converting better and make effortless
kind changes to then switch everybody to
get the better version it was sitter
signup funnel was the specific use case
we're focusing on I was just going to
add to that you call that something that
was particularly useful for us about
firebase analytics we found that the way
firebase handles
also worked really well in this case for
us so add urbansitter sitters are asked
to take a number of steps before they
complete their profile but we it doesn't
matter which order they take those steps
in and we'd had challenges with other
analytics tools and sort of expecting
that those would be closed and so the
open funnel worked really well for us in
using this data well so while we're
waiting for more live questions can you
guys tell us a bit more about dynamic
links and shazam you guys did a really
interesting integration with dynamic
links and in your coca-cola campaign can
you tell us a bit more about that yes
sure so I don't know how many of your
wishes on TV campaign that's not
something we do worldwide but in the
u.s. we do it quite a quite a lot and
one of them well it suppose not the TV
campaign but actually you can choose
some coke bottle which have lyrics and
then it takes you to a sort of
experience where you can do videos
lip-sync videos and you can share them
and before dynamic links you share your
videos and your friends were watching it
and if they wanted to make their own
videos that were tapping on a button and
they had to go to the Play Store install
it but once they open the app for the
first time they will go to our own page
without the coca coca concerns which was
the reason why they initially installed
the app so it was great because now with
dynamic link the first thing they open
when they install the app is actually
the coke campaign and then they can make
the video so it's the first impression
is the reason why they initially install
the app and we actually noticed that
from those users were coming from a
dynamically supposed to the one who were
coming and opening the app of the
homepage those users coming on from
dynamic links retain 15-person tire
after two weeks which is doing quite
high for us so that was our first use
and then the second use is when you are
designing the song a lot of users are
actually sharing it sharing it on
Facebook Twitter and when you're tapping
on whatever your friends share your
lending into our website and from there
you can install the app
so if you install the app again you're
installing the app before dynamic links
you were opening the up and coming to
our own page whereas now we can take the
user exactly where they were coming from
so the track page inside the app and
again we had some some very good numbers
on retention so that that's the main use
case for us and it's been very useful so
far that's great yeah yes don't think
too that is it really depends on how
you've architected the app as well so if
you already support deep links it makes
it so much easier because you don't have
to do much apart from just intercepting
the intense that come from the firebases
decay basically and that was that made
it really easy for us to integrate with
dynamic links did anybody have anything
else you want to add on dynamic links
and we will be very recently just
launched dynamic links and for us the
use cases that we can like a marketing
team can finally run retargeting style
acquisition campaigns now so so we're
looking at people's interests and giving
them an ad let's say about hotels in
Singapore they would click on that ad
install the app and then home page and
they've lost track of what they actually
wanted to see so now we can actually do
retargeting style acquisition campaigns
where we can target you at at the right
place right time something you
interested in maybe hotels in silico you
click on it install the app and you
automatically go to the hotels in
Singapore page which itself is a major
major uplift in in the kind of user
experience people are you so these is
I'll take another audience question and
I'm just curious if any of you guys have
tried the AdWords integration that we
recently opened up the AP and if you
haven't what you would expect from
something like that kind of experience
sorry is that the AdWords intuition I
mean you haven't done it but we plan on
doing that we've already launched five
five or six out of the 14 functions but
one of the biggest things we're looking
at is creating audiences in segments and
kind of importing that into AdWords so
that we can acquire more users who are
similar to you know the audience's that
make sense for us yet it's early days
for us we plan on doing that way soon so
we did just go through the AdWords
commit linkage with firebase and it was
really easy to do as a couple of clicks
to connect the accounts and one of the
nice things is that we can take any of
the events that we had instrumented with
our firebase analytics and actually turn
those into conversion events which then
show up in Adwords and is really great
and so where we've just started to do
some optimization of our marketing
campaigns around those events and I'd
say in general this is one of the
reasons we were so excited about working
with firebase it's just all of the ways
that firebase can play with existing
Google tools that we use so we also
connected fire based or google analytics
account because we have both a web and
mobile app property and since we're
already going to Google Analytics to do
a lot of a lot of our analytics having
the firebase data and dashboards show up
there is really great and so similarly
we're excited about the AdWords we're
excited about seeing that grow as well
being able to use that more will take
another question please um yeah I had
two questions I was wondering if you if
any of you have used the data storage or
the real-time data storage capabilities
and the second question was have you
taken any of your analytics data and
like reform that or reformatted it for
reporting purposes or tried to you know
kind of reuse that data for an external
audience so they're not like logging
into your dashboards etc for the
real-time database I think we all had
very large guy existing user bases with
established databases so we did not shit
none of us changed as far as I'm aware
from what I've seen it's really cool I
can't speak to that for the analytics we
wrapped
to work with other analytic tools we've
exported some what's a big query which
gives you a lot of options on just how
you want to get the data so it gives you
a good flexibility there are we still
are exploring Chi all the options
especially bigquery there's endless what
you can get out of that for us we Google
we already use bigquery as a as a back
in essentially a essentially a database
of users and events and everything well
again this is out to one of those things
where we haven't started it yet but we
plan on exporting that data into a big
query and then kind of merging
information about our users into into
certain other events that we can only do
so on the server site itself yeah please
I have a question actually related to
the question you're currently answering
is a so now we all have our existing
analytics to how do we do with the
historical data and imparted to firebase
analytics yes you guys know the answer
um I don't think there is a current
solution for historical data they're
adding features fast they love feedback
so you could suggest in they might add
some API where you can export it or
import historical data what we did was
we just wrapped all our existing
analytic events so they also send to
firebase and then kind of start it fresh
to firebase it gave us opportunity to
rethink some of our events but overall I
don't think there is a current solution
to get your historic data I have another
question like what kind of feature you
want most about currently not yet
supported in firebase yeah that's a
great question so you know we just which
thought we've just launched firebase
this is the beginning of a long journey
but what what additional features would
you guys like to see in firebase oh yeah
so I think if specifically for analytics
because
as I said we put a lot of focus on
experiments and when running experiments
we find that it's very important to find
out the confidential level for each
other up the stats and data so it would
be great because right now the firebase
already has like all the data show in
the one dashboard and it's easier to
compare so when doing experiments I
think if we had a feature that show the
confidential level of different groups
that would really help to validate the
result of each experiment for me
personally I'd say in the analytics we
mentioned that we like the open funnel
four funnels that are unordered but
currently the traditional funnel where
the user has to do first step to show up
in the second one is not implemented in
firebase there's a relatively easy
workaround for that but it was one of
those things we came in expecting and
we're looking forward to that showing up
that's probably my biggest request kind
of a smaller one for me would be to get
like a in ours as well with a cross
reporting because currently we you have
to go to a couple of places to check
where anr's happening crosses and since
we have been using cross reporting quite
heavily that's the thing that's missing
right now for four we go it's actually
around uninstalled and reviews so while
I'm on the latest in the latest version
of firebase we have uninstalled
attribution but we want to really find
out more about why people are
uninstalling our apps so maybe like
getting access to the last three or four
events within the app before someone
didn't uninstall or left a review on the
app store a lot of the times where
people live let's say to Charlotte
resell without explaining why and we
really want to improve improve so we
respond to them but sometimes you don't
hear back so it would be really good if
we can find out before someone install
the app or give us a rating what did
they do within the app what did they
find link was it because of bad user
experience was it because of slow speeds
was it because they
didn't get any results I think that's
something that for our part of the world
is very important because the lower
device memory people uninstall apps all
the time one more to add one of the
properties we haven't integrated yet a
chasm a place is the remote config and I
think it's pretty exciting I don't want
to say something wrong but I think
there's no api access for adding
removing values there so i think that
would help us make it communicate with
our older configuration servers and make
everything a bit more seamless well
thank you guys for all the feedback that
it'll definitely go back to the product
team and I really encourage other
developers out there also as you start
using firebase if you have feedback that
can help us make it better we definitely
want to hear I'll take another question
yeah I was wondering if you have any
specific examples where you used
analytics or crash reporting to gain
some insight from your actual users to
go in and actually make some change to
your app oh so I have I will smell one
like it's a long crash reporting so
we've used a couple of SDKs in the past
but none of them acts sometimes your app
crashes you you want to send those
specific users like a push notification
or inform them about hey you're still
fixing it please please bear with us or
it's been fixed where we've never had
that capability before now we've
basically gone through some of our
people who got crashes and send them a
push notification only to those people
so you can create audiences of people
who received a specific crash and then
send a new push notification from
firebase for me it would be to be able
to see the number of affected users by a
crush until now we didn't have that in
our preview system and I think that
gives you a very good idea about whether
a bug effects everyone or is it just a
very small group of people who have a
particular device and then you can just
go to the console and see what's
happening and yeah we have been able to
track issues like that in the past just
by the number of users that were
affected
so Ryan mentioned already that we used
the funnel a piece of analytics to look
at our sitter signup flow essentially or
is really the profile completion flow
and so in that we found the two steps
which had the biggest drop off where the
step where we ask users to sitters
actually to enter their direct deposit
information and also the step where we
asked them to film a short introductory
video and so we did some user testing
and then actually changed it ran a
remote config test on those screens to
helpfully communicate more to users what
we were asked by we were asking them to
do that as that was really helpful and
another one which which is not a product
we integrated with yet but we're really
looking forward to had it as a remote
config and we can think of several ways
where we could actually adapt our track
page which is our most impatient up when
you identify a song and we review what
the song is we've seen that quite a lot
of our users really like to share it and
some of those are just video lovers and
they want to watch the video so the good
thing with remote config will be able
basically to adjust on the fly without
having a new release and maybe say for
those users show more share options for
those users focus on the video for those
users they want to see lyrics and you
can basically yeah change change those
module on the fly and that will be very
useful so that's that's really something
we're looking forward to add thanks
we'll take another question we all run
into any performance issues with the
integration of analytics especially for
like less or performing devices I'm
sorry companies application yeah did you
run into any performance issues when you
integrated the analytics into your
application oh I mean because real in
the early access program we kind of knew
that we will be working with Google
getting them a lot of feedback and it's
in your like it's an only
private beta so there were some
performance issues but the good thing is
that we work with Google team and most
of these issues have been fixed pretty
much living the same week that we've
we've asked for but no performance
issues so far our iOS and Android apps
are currently live with firebase running
absolutely fine yeah a piece of the
initial versions of the firebases decay
everything is running as a separate
process so it shouldn't affect at all
what's happening even if you're doing
anything on the main thread really it
shouldn't affect the performance of
Europe and firebase the good thing with
firebase does all of their you know rely
on messaging so it's trying to push
whenever it finds network and all that
but you're talking about performance of
the app I don't think there's been
anything that we've noticed more
specifically like database access like
we use the database extremely heavily so
I've heard that there's issues but that
I was curious if you guys ran into any
of that so none of us use the firebase
database piece the analytic piece should
not touch the database or have any
effect on it as far as I tell it should
be sent always synchronously and
probably batch kind of the best
practices you would expect out of it the
most effect I could see is the APK would
probably a tiny bit bigger and you'd
probably use a tiny bit more of the
users data but both of those would be so
small it'd be hard to notice for
database effect I don't think there's
any from innolux I mean if you want to
stick around after the talk we have some
members from our analytics team here
we're happy to talk with you more in
depth on that so actually honey are you
able to share some more about what it's
like to develop an app in Southeast Asia
and specifically any challenges that
firebase helped you overcome yeah I mean
so Southeast Asia itself is is comprised
of countries like Singapore where we
have 1gb per second connection speeds
like the most expensive devices in the
world the best network ever and we have
countries like Indonesia where the sort
of like the local
you know we can get devices for fifty
dollars to a hundred dollars Android
device will be 2g or if you're lucky a
3g connection with it so and obviously
we want to make one I happened not one
app per country and if you want to make
one lap you for for Southeast Asia
there's about 10 11 languages there we
also operate in Middle East so we have a
total of 22 languages so for us it's
always a big challenge how do we
maintain a fine balance between what we
can preload into the app and what we
want to download on the fly and how do
we keep the app really really small in
size because we were like a lot of
gaming companies had this big problem in
Southeast Asia we're getting it like you
know a game of 1gb people will never
ever be able to download that even on
the best Wi-Fi connections so we try and
keep our App Store like a 10mb as a rule
of thumb max and we try and reduce the
number of network calls but having
having said that each L every you know
like function that firebase prizes in
the past we've had one sdk especially
for that and as I said previously as
well every SDK adds two to three MDS
every SDK builds his own problems and
every SDK needs the same events and
parameters being sent to them and even
worse when we start importing the data
into one global place the way I like
very unlikely that on a football match
so there's a lot of work required you
need like people to actually export data
and the map it and then for the end user
it could mean that uses in Asia start
downloading the app but give it up
midway or you know they realize it is
too much connection then use our
batteries dying so that's why we not
think one of the biggest challenges we
have is how do we keep our our appt
small fully optimized kind of something
similar to the other Google's next
billion user initiative we're probably
try and load the text fields first and
try and leave the rich media for later
on but spray challenging to do it on one
app when you operating in markets like
Singapore Saudi Arabia as well
none of this is a problem so yeah I mean
that that's why I didn't do very excited
about firebase one sdk just need to send
events one place and then can can use
the audiences can use whatever cohorts
one of the segments we've set up in
across whether it's Adwords or an AdMob
offer crashes or four for sending out
push it's great to hear so Angela and
Mika can you tell us more about the pic
collage integration with remote config
ok so for emo come faked we started from
Android first because previously we did
the experiments through States royal so
that's one of the features google has
and I think the integration was pretty
easy because it's just one sdk and it
doesn't require a lot of time like the
developer can do the integration within
one or two days but i think the most of
the time spent was on the discussions
between the product team and that
developed development team because we
need to find out like which metrics want
to we want to track and which experiment
is the most like priority you want to
run the first yeah so but we will
configure able to do it very quickly and
then we can wait we can apply the
results immediately after we get that so
actually we just had run an experiment a
few weeks ago which was to test like the
tabs in the app and then the navigation
button at the same time so we separated
using remote config and then we get the
result and then we applied it to one
hundred percent of the user may away
it's really great so I'm actually just
really curious to hear from you guys
you'll have integrations live with
firebase where do you see fire rate how
do you see your company using firebase
going going forward what are you most
excited about what problems what solved
for you how will help your business grow
I think we've spoken about it a couple
of times it's remote configured thing
for us would be next I'm pretty excited
about the test lab as well we do we are
we do have got a lot of tests and we do
maintain our own infrastructure because
we have a quite large test suite at the
moment we want we have our own tooling
to make sure everything runs very
quickly but I think that's that would be
our next step on the technical side and
so much when the girls I let Glenn get
that yeah I think one of the great thing
with the with firebase is how how
user-friendly is the platform so app
analytics for example you can very
quickly see if there is something wrong
and then react very quickly whereas
maybe some of the tools we used were a
bit much too much spreadsheet and you
really take some time to actually figure
out what's going wrong and and the whole
platform is very user-friendly and
remote config will looks like it is as
well and for me it's really going to be
a game changer because every time we
will need to change the variables or
something you would require some time
and I couldn't do to it on the fly and
with remote configured something that is
like I can change from one day to
another and really respond fast to
anything if anything is going wrong or
if you want to change something and
don't want to have to wait for our next
release so that's that's really good and
so one of the things that appealed to us
right from the beginning with analytics
is the fact that we can create more
events than we've ever been able to do
before and not have to think about
limits and so that's something I think
we're going to continue to lead into is
instrument even more in the product
itself and then our marketing team I
think is going to be very excited to do
some work with notifications that's
something we haven't worked with yet but
all of the stories we've heard from
other members of the early app or early
access program who've used notifications
it's just an incredible functionality
for teams to be able to use definitely
want to agree with the analytics events
work both of those are true of course
the analytics we've been
paid solutions before and the as a
smaller startup the pricing starts to
get in the way with aunt with firebase
it's the we know that every user is
going to hit the screen 50 times the
session that's great we want to know
every time they hit it and we're just
able to really illuminate lights on
funnels and parts or apps that we've had
no insight on the are people interacting
with this button do they use the sword
option so as with all analytic solutions
you can put as much analytics in the app
as you have time for and I think we're
going to be just pushing a lot more in
that direction I'm also very excited
about test labs especially with android
studio 2.2 they have the expresso
testing think that's Android studio but
the expresso test runner so it sounds
like it will be very easy to make
expresso tests and run them in test lab
which is just a really neat feature um
so for piccollage we actually we have a
lot of ideas not not just for piccollage
we have a lot of ideas for other
technologies and then at the same time
we wanted to build different apps to
validate this idea so it will be like
we're really excited to have the repo
config and analytics both at the same
time because we can easily like push out
our our apps and have the results
immediately through fire base and then
so the whole thing will make this cycle
very fast and as a start-up it's very
important for us to run the experiments
and to test out everything we wanted to
test in the very fast pass so we're
pretty excited about this so in addition
to running experiments on our side
projects we're also excited to have more
features in each in each features like
remote config we heard that it will
promote provide more than AP testing it
will have more variations in remote
config and also the dynamic links we are
excited to having more metrics like
install rate or even in-app purchase
rate because we use it for almost
the content on promotional links and
also for the applications we are looking
very very excited to have a deep link in
the app in the next update I think so
yeah we are pretty excited to to tribal
use cases through firebase and to
improve our product I think well
firebase being just one sdk has a big
advantage for our product directly a lot
of time that I want to highlight is that
because we use so many SDKs right now
and every educators something different
and definitions of of attribution
definitions of a user session can be
very different in each of these tools we
have we have the marketing team looking
into into one to the product team
looking to the other tool so we're
really hoping that you know going
forward we have one sdk 12 where are you
from the marketing p more from you know
from the sales team or from the product
team even if you're from the technical
side looking into the same data you're
looking into the same single source of
truth and you can focus more on building
great apps rather than getting your
analytics right all of these things are
great to hear and we're very much
looking forward to working with you and
helping you grow your business so if
there aren't any other questions I think
we'll wrap up here thank you for coming
out and thank you very much to our panel
