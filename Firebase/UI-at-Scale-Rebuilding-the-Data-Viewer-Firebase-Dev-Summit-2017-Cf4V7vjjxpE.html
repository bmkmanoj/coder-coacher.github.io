for coming we know it's the end of the
day but we're really really excited to
talk to you we expect you've heard a
little bit about firestore hopefully
both of it but it's firebases newest
database technology we're really excited
about it
and one of the things with firestore is
it's really massively scalable and
that's really really exciting but when
you think about that in terms of the UI
that's a little stressful firestore is
massively scalable but sometimes the
browser is not and so we this is Tim and
I'm Susan and we've been building out
the firestore UI and so as I said the
firestore is really really scalable and
the UI needs to be scalable to handle
that and so what does that mean
we actually expect that maybe many of
you haven't seen the UI so we wanted to
just show an image of what it looks like
so you can see in the leftmost panel the
collections are listed there we've
selected the collection demo and then in
the middle we have a document selected
document oooo five classic document and
then sometimes as real-time data updates
you'll see the field updates so maybe
that's a user updating a value and then
if you're adding documents it'll hai
animate in green and if you're changing
or updating them they're gonna go orange
gray so it'll be three parts to this
talk so first we're gonna talk about how
we model this data how we mapped it and
transformed it to get it into the UI
this massive like real-time stream of
data coming from firestore and then
secondly once we've got that massive
stream coming in we want to restrict it
and constrain it so that it still
performs well in the UI and then finally
once we've got all that set up we want
to add the the firebase II real-time
change visualizations to make it
delightful so we have firestore which I
like firestorm
we have that but how do we actually get
that data into our app so we think that
many of you probably familiar a little
bit with the real-time database SDK so
in the real time database SDK here we're
listening to items as a reference and
every time that a child is added or
changed we get an update so that's an
event based system so if there's 50
child added we're gonna get 50 of these
events and then internally in our code
we handle the state so we call ref dot
on to listen to those changes and then
when we want to stop listening time we
call ref dot off and that's really
important because otherwise we're gonna
have some memory leaks in our code so we
need to call ref dot off to make sure
that our app stays performing so here's
the firestore equivalent of this so
we're listening to the collection items
we call ref dot on snapshot so we can
actually do five store provides both
like the event view of the world through
snapshot doc changes so this would be 50
added events if we had 50 items or you
can do the state-based view of the world
which is snapshot Doc's so this is at
this point in time what is the full stay
that you requested so this is a little
bit different to the real-time SDK in
that in the real-time SDK if you had 50
items you would get 50 snapshots in the
firestore SDK you'll get the first
snapshot of 50 items so it's a little
bit easier to work out like what was my
initial list and what are the changes
after that and then of course to
unsubscribe it's a little bit different
there you get a method that you call to
unsubscribe later on cool so now we have
a way to get the data into the app but
so firestore is really really scalable
and that's really exciting but the
events are coming in over time so how do
we actually model that information I
mean what would be really great is if we
could have everything as an array ahead
of time so something like this we could
have players with some names I'm really
bad at sports terminology so if I'm out
of some names please forgive me but so
here we want to know the left footed
players so we could filter and map
across that data so filtering takes out
so in this example we're taking out the
right footed players and then mapping
applies a function across all the items
that we get so this gives us back an
array of just the one lion messy very
messy doesn't so that would be really
great but firestore events come in over
time so it would seem like maybe we need
something that can handle data events
that are happening over time luckily we
have that and it's called an observable
so as herbals are a data type that
really helps you model this information
we use observables from rxjs
but hopefully they'll be asked to the
JavaScript library we can't really know
that for sure
but there will be in a language of your
choice some sort of mirror to that
observables are quite complicated we
actually think you could have an entire
talk on observables and as we were
thinking about that we kind of came up
with a metaphor so when I first learned
about them I was very confused and and
this helped me and so it is sports
related but I think it makes sense if
you don't understand sports as well so
the example is that I'm an observer was
kind of like a goalie so you put the
goalie
on the field and as the events are
happening those are like shots being
taken at the goal and so an observable
catches those shots and then decides to
act upon them so maybe it throws it back
that's a thing yeah and maybe sometimes
it kicks it a little bit also a thing
right and so it takes an event and
decides what to do on it and so there's
a few other things here too if you knew
all the shots at the beginning of a
soccer game football game that might be
kind of boring so
these events happen over time so maybe
one happens at minute one and one
happens at minute fifty and you don't
know what they're gonna do but you know
that the goalie is gonna catch the ball
and enact on that so we go back to the
array example first up but let's say
that we had all the shots up front
you're familiar with filtering and
mapping so we're filtering these shots
based on ones kicked by left footed
players and then we're extracting using
map which transforming to get the name
so that would give us an array of left
footed shooting players so observables
have very similar syntax filtering and
mapping is similar except it acts over
time so if we imagine shots are coming
in over time we're filtering this stream
so that we only have shots kicked by
left footed players and then we're
transforming each of those into the
string of the player name so a couple of
things here we're using a dollar sign as
the variable naming convention that's
just like a convention in the observable
space that just denotes this is an
observable and then also subscribe so
subscribes pretty important so
observables are lazy by default so if we
wire up this to to connect some
real-time event source the it will only
start doing that once we call subscribe
so without subscribe nothing actually
happens and that will that will be we'll
use that later to our advantage
yeah and so here over time we would get
messy and then maybe Robin I'm not gonna
try and pronounce his first name so we
think that firing observe rules make a
lot of sense together so fire store has
a bunch of snapshot data coming in over
time you don't know maybe you're gonna
get a hundred documents maybe you're
gonna get a thousand documents and all
of that states gonna be given to you
over time and observables are a way of
modeling data that comes in over time so
for us together they make a lot of sense
so here's a so here's putting this into
action with the actual file store SDK
so we're listening to the collection
items observables we basically just wrap
the on snapshot using this method using
this format here so we now have
snapshots a dollar that's our observable
of snapshots over time then we can take
either the dock changes or the docks
we're going to use docks here for
simplicity so we're mapping a snapshot
each snapshot gets converted into the
plane array the state of the world at
that point in time and then we haven't
subscribed yet so here we'll subscribe
and we'll just log these out so an
example of this is we have an array of
two documents and then at some point
someone adds another one now we have an
array of three documents in order this
is the state of the world view so each
document can be up to one megabyte so
for our purposes we want to limit the
amount of information that were storing
and keeping track of in the UI so we do
a few more mapping so this is
interesting we do an observable map on
the dock observable and then that's
actually a list of documents so we map
within there to get only the dock ID and
an update time and we use the update
time for animations which we'll talk
about later and we use the ID to display
the data so we've gone from getting the
observer boat back from firestore to now
an observable of IDs and update times
and that'll look something like this as
you see just the update time and the ID
you know the right or in an observable
and so here putting it on the page we
can see we have a little bit of angular
syntactic sugar that bar async is a way
of subscribing so that handles
everything for us we use angular you
don't have to there should be some
parallels in whatever framework you want
to use but here all we do is just loop
through this document list data and that
puts everything up on the screen like
this so when we have 500 documents it'll
display that if we go up to 5,000
documents we'll get that back as an
observable and loop through all of them
so this works great works in real time
well it doesn't quite work great so we
started entering entering in a lot of
data and it the UI got really really
slow and eventually just unusable so
what's happening here so the problem is
we're just rendering way too much data
so if you imagine that this list on the
right hand side has like roughly six
nodes in it per document there's a
little arrow there's some hover things
that we do there so that's like 30,000
nodes that's way too much that's crazy
you shouldn't be trying to render all of
that yeah yeah
can I do that yeah so we need to
restrict that so first that we use
virtual scroll so virtual scroll is a
way of limiting what you see on the page
if you're familiar with recycle of view
from Android this is the same concept so
really we only need and care about about
20 documents that we want to see on this
screen so a virtual scroll says okay
what's visible on the screen and
everything else we it handles removing
and adding so we keep track of a
masterless which is all of our items and
virtual scroll tells us which of those
items is on the screen so this is really
great for a fire store because we start
with if we have only twenty documents
visible on this screen and we have about
six nodes HTML Dom nodes for that that's
about a hundred and twenty so if you
have 500 documents on your list you have
about 128 Dom nodes if you have 5,000
documents on your in your list that gets
added somehow you have 120 Dom nodes
which is a really great performance
boost for the UI rendering information
so this is what that looks like in code
we have here we pass in our docs into a
virtual scroll component and then the
virtual scroll component gives us back a
list of visible items and we loop
through that to display them on the page
so here's a little snippet of that in
action scrolling through that central
list and you'll see on the on the right
hand side in the dev tools it'll scroll
down a little second but you'll see that
we never go further than the 20 nodes
they're in the list
so now we have a way of limiting what we
show on the page but firestore is still
really happy to send us five thousand
fifty thousand documents back and so all
of that data going across the wire is a
lot for the browser to handle and also
you probably don't want to be sending
all of that luckily firestore has really
great querying capabilities so we
decided to take advantage of those and
just recycle our virtual scroll pattern
sounds about right
so we started with this pattern where as
we scroll we just update the query so
that the pipe async will unsubscribe and
re-subscribe if that if the query
changes the docs dollar sign if that
changes so here's that so we're using
start at and limit of 20 to create that
to recreate that query so the first time
this fires one single scroll we get a
new observable we tear down the old one
create a new one and that gives us back
item 0 to 20 ok we scroll one more
document we get items 1 to 21 one more
document we get 2 to 22 and every time
that's happening we're tearing stuff
down recreating our observable and just
really having some intensive operations
clearly that doesn't really make sense
we have a bunch of operations and maybe
like 20 of our documents stay about the
same so we realized that we needed to do
something else some other way to handle
this so we decided to restrict the data
using pagination yes so we decided to
split it up into chunks of roughly 50
items and then do a similar thing with
the virtual scroll but this would create
less query thrashing let's say so
initially we started using limits so
here what we're using here is order by
double underscore name is saying order
the documents by ID start at 0 or our
first ID and then limit
by 50 so this seems to work initially
but we run into some issues where users
aren't always putting data in at the end
of the list and so if you're deleting
from the chunks they start to overlap or
mr. so for example if that second chunk
is starting at 50 and the first chunk
starts deleting items out of it then the
item 50 will bleed into that first chunk
and then vice versa you'll have an issue
where if you're inserting items between
the chunks they won't get captured in
the queries so this wasn't quite enough
so we decided to use cursors we really
want to make sure that we get those 49
point one and 49 point two so there's a
few cursor queries you can do there's
start at and end at and those are
inclusive so it includes the numbers and
then start after and end after they
exclude the numbers that you pass in so
we found the mix of start after and end
act to be really what we are looking for
when we're trying to handle this
updating list of documents so we get all
of 0 through 49 and we start after 49
for the second chunk and end at 99 so
you could add as many 49 points whatever
as you want and those will get included
in the second chunk so there's one
caveat here is that we had to create an
initial query to build the chunks so
that's kind of our the drawback of using
that yeah so we use an initial limit
query of a much larger set say 100 300
items to to find those chunk boundaries
and then we create much smaller queries
so putting this together so on the left
here we have the visible scroll area
which informs the set of chunks in the
middle there the chunks can be
subscribed or unsubscribed more than one
can be subscribed at any time and then
that basically sets that those changes
flow into a master list where some areas
are not in real time and some areas are
in real time and then that master list
flows into the virtual scroll which
handles cut
the dome rendering so in code we create
our chunk interface you can see it has a
query and also it has an end at so this
is how we represent our chunks in the
code then we create a query on the next
slide area and so we call DV dot
collection of paths so we're keeping
track of the paths as we move through
the firestore UI so if you go in and
check it out there's actually a bunch of
sub collections that we handle really
nicely out of scope for this talk but we
keep track of the path to pass that in
as a thing we're listening to we order
by the name so that's the document ID
and we start after the previous chunks
last element and then we end at this
chunks end at so that allows us to
capture all of those things in a query
and we don't call snapshot or subscribe
there it's just the raw query because we
want to do a little bit more to it so as
you notice we subscribe here with the
new observable we call snapshot we still
don't just subscribe sorry my bad we're
still not subscribing here but we just
get the documents so we're ready to
subscribe but we haven't subscribed yet
so that's our query object yeah so
turning on and off chunks is handled via
subscribing and unsubscribing and so the
higher level view of that is when we get
to a point where we want to turn a chunk
on we use basically this this high-level
query so the query take until is an
operator in our chairs or in observables
that essentially says listen to this or
subscribe to this until such time that
this scrolled out of view emits an e
value so what is scrolled out of you so
that's another observable that's an
observable that listens to the scroll
position of the document list it filters
out and it filters those scroll events
until the chunk has scrolled out of you
and then take one basically says I only
care about one of these
so I only care about that first point
where it is scrolled out of you and so
tying this together into the top query
we're saying yeah take this take all of
the real-time updates for this chunk
until such time that I've decided this
the chunk is now scroll doubt of you so
I think that's him is really
underselling how cool this is this is
like the coolest thing we do in the UI
and I'm so like my mind every time my
mind is blown by this so what's
happening is we're setting everything up
off of a scroll event so this scroll
event moves in and out of the virtual
scroll and as we're doing that we're
saying once you get out of you stop
listening to the real-time database so
this allows us to really restrict what
we're listening to so we're not sending
a bunch of information across the wire
that's really cool
we're also handling tearing down logic
so as we said at the beginning tearing
down is really important it'll lead to
memory leaks it leads to bad performance
it's just really really hard to keep
track of everything something we
actually in our code have some things
that we do not unsubscribe from so it is
like really hard to keep track of that
and this logic handles all of that while
scrolling the page and keeping track of
what's in view it's amazing it's like
definitely the coolest thing that we do
in the UI for sure yeah and also so the
tear the tearing down is really
important as well because if you have a
massive list of documents they can all
be 1 megabyte in size when we detach
from the real time fire store listener
that takes those documents out of memory
as well and then also this is
essentially what we're actually doing in
the UI we have a little bit of delay
logic on there as well so that the
chunks disable after a timer but
essentially this is what we're doing and
just imagine doing this with all the
tracking and tearing down and
unsubscribing if you were doing this
like imperative Lee it'd be like three
times the size definitely three times
this size I think before we set this up
it was there were so many messy things
and then this came in and I was like oh
my gosh so you know we've taken this
massive amount of fire store
possibly scaling database and figured
out how to model it using observables
and we've figured out using firestore
queries how to limit the data that we're
showing on the page but that's not
enough we have to make the experience
really delightful and show off the
real-time capabilities of firestore and
also be firebase II which is important
to us so we figured real-time
visualizations would be really really
hard we're like that's gonna be we're
gonna have to spend a few weeks on that
but seemingly we have our visual changes
component and we use angular animations
here so every time a value gets added to
the Dom it's gonna go green and every
time it's removed it goes red and if
it's updated or changed we have a
function that compares compares things
yeah so so we just used the so in react
or angular you have some function like
this which is previous props next props
or previous value next value yeah so we
just basically diff on that value and
then that's how we do the the changed
animation which is the orange animation
there's a little bit more that we do
here with the fields so doing a direct
strict equals here is not always enough
so if we're comparing complex object
types we do like a shallow or deep
equals to handle the field changes but
this is essentially what we're doing
here so we put that all together and
hohoho it's business
yeah so we ended up with this see if you
can think figure out what's going on
they're not quite what we wanted so yeah
so what's happening here is we're using
angular animations which detects the
elements and the components adding to
the Dom to animate and then removing
from the Dom and then the virtual scroll
is not playing nicely with that because
it is artificially removing and adding
things from the Dom at the top and the
bottom of the list so as you scroll
they're both playing or
with each other so we need a way to get
around this so the way that we do that
is we hook back into that scroll event
and call a disable animations and that
disable and emissions weights half a
second and so until you're done
scrolling and then after that it will
reinstate animations and so that's kind
of how we got around a little bit of
jank a virtual Scroll in our UI so then
we ended up with an actual working
real-time viewer so here it is yeah and
as you scroll through you'll see it does
an update and then the updates happen a
little bit later okay so too lazy didn't
read of this talk is that we think
observables are a really great way to
model data coming in from fire store or
any streaming data that you're
processing via an API in JavaScript and
then take advantage of fire stores
queries to limit what you're what you're
getting back so you're not sending a lot
of stuff across the wire and then
finally take the extra steps to make it
real time and make it show up and be
delightful for your users cool thank you
thank you so much
