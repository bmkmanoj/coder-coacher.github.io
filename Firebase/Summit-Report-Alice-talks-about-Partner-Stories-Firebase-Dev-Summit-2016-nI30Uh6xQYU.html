fun energy I really feel like people are
getting to know each other on a personal
level the flow is really allowed for
kind of micro discussions to break out
spontaneously throughout the day and I
saw this at the beginning in the morning
actually this morning we had two hours
of partner mingling time so I feel like
people are getting to know each other
and they're having fun this morning I
brought in a couple of partners that had
stories to tell about their firebase
integrations and how it fit into their
business and so we heard from glide the
economist and alibaba com and they
actually flew in from different places
for the event to tell their story so
glide told the story of how they're
using crash reporting and other app
quality products to help improve their
releases the Economist talked about
multiple products is part of the launch
cycle and part of their growth strategy
from firebase and alibaba com is
actually using FCM for web so they told
the story about how it's improved
engagement with their buyers around the
world so these are three unique
perspectives and my hope by its kind of
exposing these stories of different
partners is to hear more partner stories
later so after the after the talk
walking around the event I got to hear a
lot of other people's stories about how
they're using firebase there is
enthusiasm for a lot of products that we
might not have spoken about as much and
also I feel like there's a custom
implementation for everybody so I it's a
really sophisticated crowd a lot of
people are thinking about advanced
integrations and advanced
implementations we haven't thought of
before and it's exciting problem solving
all around so I think just from a
problem-solving perspective most people
here are already familiar with the basic
product suite and so they're really
getting the advanced view
