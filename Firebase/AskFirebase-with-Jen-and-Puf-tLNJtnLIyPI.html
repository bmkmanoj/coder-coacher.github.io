killing us know why I'm killing that
hashtag I'm really confused about it
because it's not like 2012 hey everyone
welcome to another episode of ask
fire-based I'm your host Jim person and
today I'm joined by Frank van poppelen
so welcome back I'm so glad to have you
here and you're gonna help me answer
some firebase questions definitely it
was so much fun last time that can't
wait to see what questions you have for
us this time
great so let's just get right into it
then our first question here comes from
Sumeet Kumar on Twitter and he says how
can I test my cloud functions with
database off and storage triggers
locally before deploying them it's a
great question we now actually have a
shell and you can emulate and
essentially any cloud function locally
so you just run it locally and you
invoke it with the data that you want so
you can use it for quickly testing or
also throwing some like weird data at it
that that you might not easily get in
real life but you still want your code
man
yeah that's huge I'm really excited
about this it's really nice I mean
sometimes I enjoyed having those like
couple minutes where you deploy and you
can just go get yourself a snack while
you're waiting it's nice yes you can
test them locally now we'll throw a link
in the documentation so you can check
out how to do that great cool yeah
that's a definitely heavily requested
feature yeah no we're very glad that
it's out in Yankton all right let's see
what else we got here also from Twitter
where we get lots of great questions
Emory owner says can I send email with
firebase functions like let's say in
newsletter oh yes definitely it's all
the same yeah it's one of a common use
cases actually we have it on our
documentation but that doesn't mean it's
not a good question so you would set up
essentially in somewhere like your
firebase database or fire story you keep
a list of the users that you want to
send the newsletter to right so if
they've subscribed and then you set up a
function that you trigger
periodically and do you know how to do
that why yes I do
um so one of the ways that you can do it
I actually made a video about it so
we'll throw that link in there as well
yeah but you can uh
set up a cron job using an HTTP
triggered function and then you can just
however much you want to trigger that
once a week once a day they would just
call that function and send out the
email there are email services that you
can choose to use for that it really
depends on what your use case is but
yeah again we have a great sample for
that so check it out all right let's
check out this next question a deep
Patel says I would love to see a series
for server-side code I think this is a
very important point for any application
yeah for sure no it is right with
firebase we try to make sure that you
can focus on client-side codes as much
as possible but there's always a few
cases where you really can't run things
on the client and then you need
server-side code that's why we're so
happy that we now have cloud functions
available right as you know very well
because it's a great series on yeah and
I'm gonna be doing even more
specifically looking at the firebase
admin SDK so this can be used in
conjunction with cloud functions but
it's also an option for other kind of
server-side code if you choose not to
use cloud functions because it might
have situations where instead of just
having something that you want triggered
when a certain action occurs you want
something that can run all the time
so I'll be looking into those but as I
start making these videos I would love
to hear more ask firebase questions
around what sort of server-side
questions you have so this is where you
all come in right so if you have a
question about how would I do this with
some surface ID versus client-side code
or how would you actually implement
something on the server with the admin
SDK put the question on Twitter on Stack
Overflow and tag it with as firebase and
Jen might get to it yeah absolutely uh
without your questions I can't have this
show so gotta send it my way
boom the next one I'm gonna read it's
from Jabbar Asadi
and his question is what's the
difference between Google Cloud
messaging and firebase Cloud messaging I
think you might yeah I'll definitely
take this one up so firebase Cloud
messaging is the latest most up-to-date
version of Google Cloud messaging and we
have some great large-scale clients that
use Google Cloud messaging we send
billions of messages a day I I mean I
had to look up that number again I just
couldn't believe it so firebase Cloud
messaging being the latest
service offers a few different features
that you know have sort of built upon
this great foundation of Google Cloud
messaging so let's say a couple of
things that you can do is you can
subscribe users to specific topics and
you can send messages targeted by
different combinations of those so maybe
you want to send a message to met users
who are subscribed to two different
topics or subscribe to one and not to
another one so you have different
options that you can have to put
together so it's really customizable so
you're not spamming all the bit users
you're really targeting that that's
pretty cool actually yeah I also heard
that there was something recently
released called platform overrides can
you tell me more about that uh yeah this
was a huge push and I'm really glad that
we have it because as you probably know
as developers the different platforms
you know web and iOS and Android have
slightly different ways of doing
messaging so what that means is it was a
challenge to send a similar-looking
message to your different platforms you
actually had to even have let's say you
had a topic for a specific sport you'd
have to have that topic for iOS app and
Android up if you wanted to be able to
have them let's say select that message
and go to a specific spot in your app
but now as platform overrides you can
send one message and it has options to
send depending on what platform your
users are on so you can just have a
single topic and you know it allows you
to much easier and more quickly target
those users it's very cool so it means
that you could have a single message
that you send to users both on iOS and
Android
and it behaves as they would expect one
on each of the platforms but exactly
that's nice I hope that actually answers
your question Jabbar
all right let's see if we got any other
ones Abdullah on Twitter says how do I
use a phone number in firebase security
rules so let's say you want to make sure
that to access a specific piece of data
they are the user that was signed in so
sort of how we use security rules for
you know other things yeah definitely
it's a good question actually I think
it's so good that I think I already
answered this one mistake
yeah so I have a fool example there but
the phone number of a user that has
authenticated with the phone number is
available in your security rules so you
can in your security rules find it under
oath the token dot phone number and then
you can actually use that phone number
everywhere as usual same as with other
forms of authentication I recommend that
you mostly try to stick to using the
user ID the UID in your rules to secure
and then do a lookup of the phone number
where needed but if you want to secure
it directly on the phone number it's
available in the token the phone number
yeah that's a really good point because
with the UID then no matter how your
users are assigning in you have a
consistent method of security rules
exactly imagine that a user first signs
in with a phone number and then later
they sign in with Facebook provider for
example then you actually your phone
number security rule won't work anymore
but the UID of that user will still be
the same well thanks everyone for
watching another episode of ask firebase
and thank you so much puffs for coming
on the show and helping me answer some
questions it's my pleasure yeah be sure
to stay tuned for future episodes to see
some great firebase questions answered
and if you have a great question make
sure you hit us up on social media with
the hashtag s firebase and maybe you'll
see it on a future episode yeah remember
everyone keep asking questions it's the
only way we can make shows like this
thanks for joining
