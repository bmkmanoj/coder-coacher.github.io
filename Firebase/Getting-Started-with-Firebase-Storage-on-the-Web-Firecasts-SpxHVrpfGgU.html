I'm going to cover one of the sweet new
SDKs firebase storage and firebase sorts
lets you store and retrieve
user-generated content like images audio
and video all without the need of a
server and just as a reminder this is
one of many screencasts in a series on
firebase and the web so make sure to
subscribe to get notified of tutorials
on authentication real time database
hosting and web push notifications with
firebase Cloud messaging also if you're
a fan of JavaScript frameworks I'll be
dropping videos for angular 1 into
polymer react and ember so you better
subscribe because you don't want to miss
any of those but today I'm going to show
you how to get up and running with
firebase storage in the web I'll show
you how to get your project initialize
and then we'll upload in download files
to firebase storage directly from the
browser so let's get started so to begin
we're going to need to have an
initialize firebase project like I do
right here so the getting started with
firebase and web videos covers this but
just as a reminder you can access this
in the firebase console by clicking add
firebase to your web app and then you
can copy and paste the code right here
and you would just put it into your
project so I'm going to be building a
simple web app with a progress element
and a file upload button and so the goal
is is that when I click upload it will
upload the file to firebase storage and
this progress bar will increase as the
upload occurs now you might be wondering
how did he get everything centered
horizontally and vertically in the
middle so to get everything aligned I
actually turned the body of the page
into a flexbox with display flex and I
set the entire height to be the viewport
height and then to get everything
horizontally and vertically centered I
set the Flex direction to column and
then a line item center and justified
content center and to remove the default
browser appearance of the file upload
you can set WebKit appearance
and in the regular appearance none so
these are my Styles you can really use
whatever you want but if you want to get
everything centered in the middle you
can steal these so to get these files
uploaded the first thing I'm going to do
is get the elements from the dom so
create a variable for each of these dom
elements so of our uploader is going to
be document dot get element by ID of its
ID and the same thing for the file
upload button so now what I need to do
is I need to listen for when and file
has been selected I can do that by
attaching a event listener onto the file
button and we need to listen to the
change event
so whenever a file is uploaded it's
going to call inside of this function
right here so inside of this event
listener callback there's a couple
things I need to do I first need to get
the file and then I need to create a
storage reference which I can use to
upload the file and then lastly I need
to update the progress bar as the file
is uploaded so to get the file I'm going
to get the first file off of the files
object on the target elements then I'm
going to create a storage reference
using firebase dot storage dot ref and
you can think of our structure as folder
names and file names so you have a
folder and within folders there are
files so if you had a folder called
photos underneath photos you could have
one dot PNG and two dot mp3 which
wouldn't fit but you know it's binary
storage so we consider whatever you want
but this is essentially how we store
everything in firebase storage is
through folders and files and the
extension can be whatever you need so we
could do file name dot PNG jpg mp3 you
know dot whatever so in my case I'm
going to upload some sweet gifts so I'm
going to call my folder sweet gifts and
then I'm going to create a file from the
files name now I need to store this
reference into a variable so I can
upload the file to this location and to
do that I can call the put method
pass in the file so the put method will
upload this file to firebase storage but
I want to monitor whenever the file is
being uploaded so I can see how much has
been uploaded
well the put method returns an upload
task and using this task we can
subscribe to when any state changes
happen so the on method allows us to
specify what event so state changed and
then there are three types of state
changes we're going to listen to and
these state changes are represented by
functions so the first function will
notify me of the upload progress and
each time there's an update I'll get a
callback with the snapshot of the
progress state and this is what we're
going to use to update the progress bar
the next function notifies me of any
possible errors and this returns to me
an error of something that might not
happen you don't have enough security
you had some upload error it'll all get
callback inside of this function and
lastly the complete function lets me
know when the file has finished
uploading so since the progress function
returns us this snapshot I'm going to
use it to indicate the progress in the
progress bar so I can calculate the
percentage uploaded by using two pieces
from the snapshot I can get the bite
size transferred so far and then I also
can get the total byte size of the file
and then just simply dividing these two
together and then also multiplying by a
hundred will give me the percentage and
once I have this percentage I can grab
the upload element and just set the
value so I'm going to upload my sweet
gift right here and it looks like it's
working but if I open up the console you
can see that we get an unauthorized 403
status code and that's because of the
default security rules set for the
storage bucket so to fix this I'm going
to go to the firebase console and click
on the rules tab these are firebase
storage security rules and if you're
familiar with the real-time database
this is similar to the JSON based
security rules these rules allow us to
decide who has
access to what files and what kind of
files can be uploaded and how big or
small those files can be and right now
the rule says that only authenticated
users can read or write data which you
can see right here allow read or write
if the authentication variable is not
equal to null so in my case that's not
going to work because I'm an
unauthenticated user so just for
development purposes I'm going to
disable these rules by setting the rule
to if true and this means that any read
or write will always pass to my storage
bucket but seriously only do this for
development because you don't really
want people storing whatever they want
on your storage bucket you're going to
want some type of security so only do
this while you're developing so we'll
publish this and we'll get back to our
app so I'm refreshing the page and now
that I've relaxed my security let's try
uploading one more time
so select my gift and the uploader
progresses and we didn't get any errors
in our console so let's go out to the
firebase console website and you can see
that we actually have this folder for
sweet gifts right here so let's click
into it and we have our firebase
features gif available so that's
everything you need to know to get
started and now I'll leave you with a
question how are you going to use
firebase storage in your app like what
kind of app are you building and what
kind of files do you most commonly store
that's all for this time so I will see
you all in the comments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
