where we're going to be talking about
some of the growth technologies and
firebase and like we're going to take a
little bit of hands-on advice and how to
use them so instead of just showing like
oh this partner did this we're actually
going to show what they did and then
we'll try to be hands-on and showing you
how they did it so we can learn from
partners of Google have been very
successful with the growth technology
I'm Laurence Moroney and I'm Alex GABA
and the firebase grow technologies are
primarily built so that you can have a
strategy for growth you know growth is
one of those things that when it's
something that everybody wants but
sometimes very few of us know really how
to do it in a systematic way often when
we want to build an application we'll
put it into a Play Store we put it into
the App Store and we hope for the best
we might have a marketing campaign to
draw people to it we might buy Adwords
and those kind of things to draw people
to it but we've all seen those curves
where once we launch the app we do our
campaign for our installs our here
the following week they're here the
following week they're gone so a lot of
the times if we really want to have a
good sustain growth thing we need a
strategy to do so growth isn't a lottery
ticket and like something like flashed
up becomes your lottery ticket let your
lottery ticket so that when your app
gets flash started again a great have
great growth but we really want to think
about how do you do that sustain
programmatic growth and we're going to
talk about some of Google's partners
that did that so in this session we're
going to go beyond the theory a little
bit and talk about a couple of companies
that have actually implemented these
growth technologies with real-world
examples and then we'll show you a
little coding demo of how you can do it
yourself in your app so we'll start with
Yahoo Japan who have the largest auction
site in Japan in their market and they
also have used app indexing and public
content and mixing to drive growth and
reengagement for their Android app then
we'll move on to Skyscanner who have
used invites and dynamic links to
differentiate themselves in a crowded
travel app market and finally last but
not least we will talk about cookbook
who have differentiated themselves as a
recipe app using remote config to
provide tailored
some experiences to their global
audience so let's go ahead and get
started with Yahoo Japan sure sounds
good thank you first of all any firebase
developers here ask you oh nice catch I
have a few firebase t-shirts the launch
engine crowd but first of all I want to
talk a little bit about Yahoo Japan and
this is a terrific application and your
world we're probably familiar with Yahoo
but Yahoo Japan is really really huge in
Japan they're one of the largest search
engines they're one of the big some
mobile in particular and they've built
this thing I hope I'm pronouncing it
correctly called Yahoo okuu which is an
auction site in Japan and Yahoo oku has
16 million mobile users and about 10
million web users and it's growing all
the time and they were looking for a
strategy to increase retention of their
app to increase the people's user
experience as they're using their app
and to increase just basically usage of
their app so that they could grow it so
they took a look at app indexing and
they took a look at personal content
indexing and as far as I know the date
that the app went live was like on May
10th and I learned about this app three
weeks ago when they started building it
so they were actually able to integrate
this stuff in about three weeks and the
personal content indexing part of it
that alex is going to teach us about
they were actually able to integrate and
can you guess how long one hour that's
all it took to be able to implement
personal indexing and if Alex was on the
team they would have done in half an
hour but not likely so so to talk a
little bit about it if you aren't
familiar with app indexing app indexing
is your technology that if you have
content on the web if you have content
on a website and you have the same
content in an app that you can link the
two of these together in Android you
link them with an asset links file and
iOS you link them with Universal links
and the logic behind this if you think
about it makes sense because if users
have spent the time and effort to
install your app on their device they've
already sent a signal that says I want
to consume this type of content in this
app and as Google then with our search
engine as it's crawling the web
searching for that type of content if it
sees that asset link or if it sees that
Universal link on your site that
contains the footprint of the
application itself and they'll say hey
this user really wants to engage with
this type of content in
so then when this user as part of their
daily routine they're using their search
app on their device multiple times a day
that now when they're searching instead
of being taken to a website with a lot
of blue links it's like saying hey this
type of content they like to consume it
in this app and then they're able to
open it in that app and get that type of
rich experience so let's take a look at
it if we were building an app Alex how
would we integrate app indexing so to
integrate app indexing and get your app
content indexed in Google search results
you really only need to do two things
the first is to set up deep links in
your app that map to URLs on your
website and the second is to create a
site at site app Association to verify
ownership of both your website and your
app and ultimately what that does is you
know it creates it signals that you own
your app and your app should be the one
handling all of these links so when a
user clicks on your link in Google
search results on their device they go
directly to content in your app and skip
that disambiguation dialog otherwise
known as the app chooser I think is the
like colloquial name so to implement
this in android use android app links
and we're going to go through how you
would do that in android studio because
we have this handy app link assistant
that guides you through every step of
creating android app links setting up
deep links in your app adding logic to
handle the incoming URL and then also
generating that digital asset links file
that verifies ownership of your site and
your app so first you would actually map
URLs from your site to your two
activities in your Android app so you go
ahead and click that open URL mapping
editor and it opens this fun GUI and you
add the URL and you can set a path
specifically a path pattern or path
prefix which we have here because we
want everything this recipe opcom slash
recipe to go to our recipe activity and
then you hit OK and then once you and
then this adds the following code to
your Android manifest file and as you
can see it's essentially routing every
recipe opcom slash recipe URL to the
recipe activity so once users get to
your recipe activity you need to
actually pull up
and show the right recipe based on that
URL so you add logic to handle the
intent you select activity from the app
links assistant select the right
activity and it adds some boilerplate
code to your recipe activity which you
can then customize to fit your needs
and once you've done all that you open
the digital asset like file generator
and enter some information about your
site some information about your recipe
have some information about your app
doesn't have to be a recipe outfit it
should be and generate the digital asset
link file you save that file and then
upload it to your site and then you skip
that disambiguation dialog and you can
test this on the Android studio emulator
or you can use tools to test it from our
documentation so another part of the
technology is personal content indexing
and anybody want to index for some
personal contents here have you tried
oops I think I vibration on now I need
to turn up the pressure the last time I
use this in a session I hit one of those
lighting entries I have to be really
careful so another part of this is the
personal content indexing technology so
when you've got app indexing where the
Google search engine is crawling the web
finding the content that links with your
app but then of course this content that
you generate in your app that's personal
to you that you want to keep on the
device but you also want to be able to
search on the device and a really great
use for this one is what Yahoo did with
their auction site like I'm somebody
that visits a lot of auction sites I
love visiting like eBay the auction site
because I have a strange taste in
obscure Welsh rugby jerseys and I rarely
get to go to Wales to actually buy one
so I usually go crawling around the eBay
looking for them but when you think
about if you're searching for something
like that all of the parameters that you
need to do like in my case Welsh rugby
Jersey size age I want to do one I don't
want to use one I want to know how much
the shipping is and there's all these
kind of tweaks that I have to do to find
the one that I want and then every time
I'm searching I gotta do the same thing
again and again and again and again
every day so the idea behind this one is
like in this case the person has been
searching for antiques and they may be
searching for because I'm peeks tend to
be larger they may be searching for one
in a particular area so that they could
pick it up locally instead of having a
chip they could be searching for a
particular style a particular price all
of that kind
thing and then that search itself can be
saved as a favorite and that's what the
little star icon here is and then once
it's been saved as a favorite then in
the future when they're searching on
their device when they search for
something like antiques you'll see over
here on the right-hand side of the
Google Search app does this thing for
finding in-app content and that's the
personal content and this is content it
stays on the device that's never sent to
Google the search application itself is
indexing it on the device so now when
they're searching for content like in
this case like Antiques those predefined
searches say for them will actually help
them find this in app content so they
can reengage and go directly into that
app and that's the really neat thing
about this because it's growth through
reengagement a lot of the ways that you
lose your users is that you're yet
another app on their device amongst the
300 other apps that they have but if
this is something that's part of their
daily workflow searching like in my case
searching for rugby jerseys in their
case searching for antiques then it's
something that you can actually have
your app become part of their daily
workflow and once it's part of the daily
workflow they're remembering it when
they're upgrading their phone next year
that's one of the apps that comes along
when they're using their phone on a
daily basis that's one of the apps that
they're actually discovering and alex is
going to show us how they were actually
able to code that in a shorter time as
they do yeah so largely once you've
indexed all of your content those links
will start showing up in in Google
search results personal content builds
and on device index and those links show
up in the in-app search on Android so it
is Android only but you do create these
fabulous indexable objects in your app
and you can create custom indexable
objects like this for example for an
auction app you would say you want a
saved auction and what whatever the URL
is and you only need to set the name and
set the URL and then all the extra
parameters you can actually decide for
yourself based on whatever you need for
your indexable objects and then we can
show you how that will look on our demo
device when you're searching for it
we can switch to the demo machine please
oh nice catch
so you can see we have the recipe app up
and if I go to Google and I search for
pierogi poutine which I have searched
for before because it looks delicious
and then I go to my NS tab and you can
see I have added a note here that says
pierogi poutine this is amazing
and if I click that it pulls up the
pierogi cooking recipe and then I can
change my noun and say like oh my god
seriously so good and I think the
serving is tonight and update that and
then theoretically my note will show up
and in up and you can see again it says
oh my god seriously so good it's an on
device index so you don't have to wait
for Google to crawl that we can go back
and go ahead and switch back to the
slide
so let's now look at another partner so
we saw how Yahoo Japan were able to do
the app indexing in the personal content
indexing technology to drive
reengagement sand to build a greater
user experience this other rapid
Skyscanner
and what Skyscanner are is that they're
a travel search site and it's the
typical thing when we do travel search
we're looking for flights or boats or
hotels or cars or things to do and there
are a lot of these applications out
there and there are a lot of these
services out there so what Skyscanner
really wanted to do was to find some way
to distinguish themselves they felt they
had a great offering they had great
prices that you could find and they end
up with like 50 million plus monthly
users and how would they distinguish
themselves so one way that they did was
like hey we believe that you're finding
the best bargains with us and we're
going to help you help your friends find
those same bargains I always like to say
that friends help friends discover great
apps and friends help friends discover
great content and they did so using app
invites which is part of firebase has
anybody use app invites you familiar
with it okay few of you cool so what
happened bytes is is that it's a built
in thing that uses the system UI for app
sharing but the app sharing the most
important part of this that there's two
really important parts number one is
that it reduces friction of sharing by
having an intelligently sorted contact
list I like to joke that my name my
surname begins with M and how many
friends do you have literally five
thousand nine hours
tens of thousands okay said I hope some
of my galaxy's got like lots and lots of
friends if she was going to share with
me I'm halfway down the list because my
surname begins with M my name is Anne
Aaron Aaron which would be nice because
I'll be at the top of everybody's list
but the idea behind app invites in the
dynamic sorting and the intelligent
sorting is that if it's the day of week
that she usually converses with somebody
if it's an act
type that she usually shares with
somebody if I've installed the same type
of apps like maybe she's sharing a game
and I've installed a lot of games that
she shared with me in the past I'm going
to bubble to the top of that list again
reducing friction so that you when
you're building this in your app I'm
making it easier for your users to share
this app with their friends so that's
the first part of it the second part of
it is that it's built on dynamic links
and dynamic links are actually really
cool because what they actually do is
that it's not just
link to your app in the Play Store or
the App Store this link contains context
about the app so for example Alex was
talking about pierogi poutine earlier on
and how much she loves it if she were to
share a dynamic link for an app
containing the recipe for pierogi
poutine with me and then I don't have
this app installed once I've installed
this app I'll be taken directly to the
pierogi poutine activity instead of
having to fish for it for my spouse and
that means I end up again with greatly
greatly reduced friction and if we think
if you reduce the friction that it takes
for friends to share content and apps
with their friend you're going to have a
lot of success and this is what
Skyscanner had done so they built this
sharing into their app but let's take a
look at how the app invites would
actually work so if we could switch to
the demo box if you're at my pirate
metrics talked earlier you would have
seen this app which is called really
friendly chat which is yet another chat
app that we've built and in this app
what I what we've done is we've
implemented app invites on it so if I
click invite it's actually you see it's
spinning for a minute and then these six
people appear and it's just it's
basically judges these six people are
the ones probably most likely to accept
my app invite right now you can see the
top two the left ones are Rebecca
Maroney things my wife and as a result
she generally answers my emails
hopefully and you know so it's
intelligently sorted it like that so
we're able to get these but let's take a
look at the code what we've taken to
build this we can switch back to the
slides so here's the toad so I built
this in Objective C I'm not really a
Taylor Swift fan sorry about that and
how do those laughs thanks my heart and
all I have to do is like there's an fi
or invites object and if I use that to
create a dialogue and then I set the
delegate for this dialogue to them to be
myself I get that system UI that you've
just seen it looks and feels like what
you have in other apps it looks and
feels like Drive looks and feels like
Gmail all of those are the ones and I
get that for these two lines of code but
not only that I also get a callback if I
set the delegate to the self and in this
callback I can then do interesting
things in this case I've done something
not very interesting and I'm just
showing a dialog that says you've shared
this output 15 users
or whatever the number of users are but
think about the things that you could do
here for example if you're using
analytics you can have a custom analytic
here that then says Lauren shared this
app with 15 people successfully let's
give Lauren some reward points let's
give Laurens or people who shared a
number of app like that let's let's set
up a custom analytic for them and then
when you use something like Remote
config that I'll be showing you earlier
on
you could have rewards driven for this
person so again friends help friends
discover great content friends help
friends discover great apps and here's a
mechanism that's built-in that you can
use to reward them for doing that so you
can achieve that kind of explosive
growth so as Lauren's mentioned this
technology's built on top of dynamic
links which you can also use on their
own dynamic links are URLs that you can
use across platforms to create these
custom experiences and you can generate
them programmatically within your app or
you can create them in the firebase
console and they do as he said preserve
URL state across the app install flow so
users get right to the content that
they're supposed to Landon even though
they've had to install the app first and
we can integrate this also with Google
Analytics for firebase so you can get
all of those awesome in place and build
even better dynamic links and even
better user experiences for your users
so as I said earlier you can generate
these programmatically within your app
using the iOS builder API or the REST
API so for example my husband and I love
to travel and if I found a great deal on
Skyscanner I could go ahead and click
that link from within the app send him
the flight deal and say hey you should
check this out and he'll go right to the
flight he'll even even if he has to
install the app first I can also as
Lawrence was saying earlier if I have
this pierogi poutine recipe or this
wedge salad recipe or whatever recipe
and my recipe app that I want to blog
about and I want to link users directly
to that recipe app to that recipe in my
recipe app it's a recipe one more time I
could just go ahead and include a
dynamic link in my blog post and send
users right to that recipe in my recipe
app and that we will show you how to go
ahead and create a dynamic link in the
firebase console so if we could switch
to a demo device
my life switching to the demo device yes
as soon as you can see we've created an
anemic link before we're going to create
a new one here and you go ahead and add
this mama cat the wedge salad let's make
it the good old fruity crew team it's
also like a potato salad in here that's
really good and you can say pierogi if I
spell it right um and then you can open
this in your iOS F select your iOS app
from the list or you can open this in if
you create it for your Android app your
Android app will show up here and then
you can set a bunch of custom parameters
here for what behavior you want if users
don't have your app installed or if
they're on an iPad or if you want to add
any sort of parameters to it we'll just
go ahead and click Next and then you
create a dynamic link and then it shows
up right here and then you can just copy
that URL and put it right in your social
media or blog post and if you want to
generate links programmatically from
within your app you would need this
fabulous unique URL here that you can
just copy and then if we could switch
back to the slide once you've added your
dynamic links either generating them
programmatically let's go there we go
they're generating them programmatically
from within your app or from the
firebase console you need to receive
links in your app and this is a swift
example because I am a Taylor Swift fan
and you see it's you're receiving the
URL here and then you can extract
whatever data whatever parameters you
put from it and handle that link I've is
showing the deep links content or
providing a tailored onboarding
experience and we do actually have a lot
of documentation on how to do that on
our firebase Google comm Doc's site so
definitely check that out
so you're tailoring their experience
with Swift ha telling you you got it
I'm sticking with our recipe hours to
prepare that joke he was really working
on that for like days sticking with our
recipe a theme here we've got cookbooks
which is a real recipe F and they use
remote config and smartlock and firebase
off to grow their signups 207 % so with
remote configs they created a custom
welcome and onboarding experience for
their global audience and with smart
lock and firebase off a reduced friction
and sign ups and sign-in so if you're
not familiar with remote config what you
can do with that is actually add
configuration information for your app
to the cloud so you can create server
side variables put them in your app and
then modify them in the firebase console
and update your app without having to
redeploy it and again this is integrated
with Google Analytics for firebase so
you can add screws so you can modify the
experience for segments of your users
and deploy those updates without having
actually like launch an update to your
app based on those analytics insights so
in cookbooks case they created these
regional welcome screams so if you were
in Italy you would see this Ciao Italia
screen and a shot of Venice if you were
in India you see the Taj Mahal and if
you were in the United States you'd see
this random bridge somewhere on the west
coast
what bridge is that beeping what's that
what bridge is that do you think I think
that's the Brooklyn Bridge yeah brother
Brooklyn I don't know now if you found
the best code Oh Oakland Briscoe and
then our Lawrence is going to show us
how to how to do cool stuff in a remote
config I know it's the Golden Gate
Bridge embassy we can switch to the the
laptop again please so I want to show an
example of an app not pierogi poutine
but an app that just shows an example of
how cookbook did what they did
so using remote config you can customize
somebody's onboarding experience you can
tailor their experience and in this case
I was thinking okay I'm going to build a
gratuitous app for an app which will be
like a travel concierge if you're
traveling to different countries
so for example them when you launch the
travel concierge and say I'm in China
you know it's going to give me this nice
friendly greeting it's traditional
Chinese clothing she's saying me how I'm
a and it's you know very welcoming very
Chinese kind of thing where I dress get
started to go now what happens if I then
go to Japan and I'd say wouldn't be
really neat if I could have a Japanese
onboarding experience so I'm going to
simulate that if I just go to the home
screen and then from the home screen if
I go to settings and then in settings if
I go to general language and region you
can see I was in China I'm now going to
get on a plane and travel really quickly
to Japan and then continue setting my
region give that a moment alright and
now if I go back to my home screen of my
region set and then I launch my
application and I'm in Japan now
suddenly the same application has
changed the background color is Sakura
paint it's a more of a traditional
Japanese look and feel and she's
actually sort of saying me how I'm a she
think and eg where I'm Kimiko you know
so it's very simple very good to it as
thing would think about if you're
building this for 50 countries or 100
countries with 200 countries and you're
shipping this kind of functionality in
your app you can have a lot of if-then
code if this country then that if you
know then that image if this country
then that text and you're maybe having
to do like a lot of things like a lot of
that processing has to be done at
startup which is a result then would be
flowing around from actually starting up
so he said okay well what would happen
what would this look like if we do this
in remote config because the neat thing
about remote configures you can drive
then the content off of analytics so in
this case there's an analytic for the
country that the user is in so then when
I started the application when I'd set
my device country to Japan you know that
analytic was being fired and then the
remote configured off of that one and if
we can switch back to slides I can show
you what that would look like
so actually first I'll show you the code
so the code is it's a case of for this
application you could see there were
three dynamic elements the first dynamic
element was the image the second dynamic
element was the welcome text message
that changed between Japanese and
Chinese and in the third one was the
background color so here this is just
objective-c again we're sorry it's a
little cropped off on the left that's an
NS string if I know you can see it on
that side so so here it's like I'm just
setting up an NS string for the URL
string and I calling self dot remote
config so this is part of the firebase
ABI API and I'm just saying get the
welcome image URL out of remote config
set that value and that was the URL of
the character so it was just loading her
image and then rendering it the same
thing for the welcome text message the
same thing for the page color so I'm not
doing any s-pen kind of logic here to
actually render the page for different
countries and now here is what remote
config would look like now because this
is a gratuitous demo I only had two
countries I had the Japanese thing for
Japan and I had the Chinese one for
everybody else so here you see in remote
config I've set the audience user in
Japan to be an audience of everybody who
are in Japan and in this case if the
user in Japan analytic was set then they
were getting the Japanese pose dot PNG
file if the user in Japan was set then
the welcome text message was konnichiwa
Ram Kimiko and for everybody else I was
giving the default value so if you're
thinking if you've got 200 countries
that you're managing instead of writing
the code to do that you'd set this
configuration in a remote config and
then the code that you're maintaining
would look something like the top of
this slide and then what would happen as
we can see here was that you know the
URL drove the character the texture of
the text that she was able to that she
was actually rendering so we've seen
with a little bit of code and a little
bit of walk-around how these growth
technologies and firebase have been used
by real people you know so some of the
things Yahoo Japan as we saw what they
were able to do is this great option app
and for me personally that does a lot of
option stuff that a lot of the friction
of doing an option a lot of the friction
of interaction with an auction would be
taken away by the fact that I could save
my preferences using personal content
indexing so we saw how they were able to
do personal content indexing and how
they were also able to do a pin
getting at least an Android by using the
asset link file then for Skype scanner
we saw how they were able to get their
growth and how they've been able to grow
to where they are using app invites and
using dynamic links and Alex then showed
us really nicely I think how we were
able to use the firebase console to
generate a dynamic link you can share
that dynamic link in social media or
using the API you can generate those
dynamic links so you can do it within an
application and then finally cookbook
who doubles their growth by having a
simple sign up and sign in and remote
config for an onboarding thing which so
I think pretty simply how the code would
be to do that in this case I did it in
Objective C it's just as easy to do it
in Android so that's it those are the
three partners that we've worked with
those are the partners we've been able
to achieve growth and we hope by showing
in a hands-on way how they were able to
do it that you you know there's
something new that everybody could learn
so thank you very much I hope you enjoy
