much for joining us and those of you on
the live stream as well thanks for
following along this is subir he is the
firebase predictions engineering manager
this is Ramona she's our product manager
for firebase predictions awesome
so this is actually our second time in
Amsterdam and we're really thrilled to
be here you may or may not know today is
Halloween in the US so for us traditions
trick-or-treat Oh a prediction we just
like a treat don't go with the tree
because that's what I have prepared all
right I hope you had a little bit of
coffee with your lunch because we're
going to need you to do a little bit of
math so activate please think of a
number oh and if you know this one just
follow along don't you have the answer
enjoy the trip think of a number between
one and ten
do you have it got it really okay
multiply it by two got that add 8 to it
/ - now subtract the original number
you're still o with me you should have a
number between 1 and 26 all right and
that's the number of letters in the
English alphabet so pick a letter that
corresponds to that number so if you had
one it's a 2 it's B and so on
got it now pick a country that begins
with that letter good
now let's go to the next letter in the
alphabet so if you had a now it's be
okay yeah so basically if and sorry and
now pick an animal that starts with that
letter the new letter that you have and
now hold on to that so if your number
was one you would have picked Austria
and then you would have picked B and you
would have picked a bat and now
Sabir is gonna make a prediction about
what all of you thought about how do you
do it and I'm gonna predict that most of
us picked an elephant from Denmark how
many people pick it up I'm from Denmark
raise your hands please don't be shy
thank you good numbers and you know
what's so amazing there are no elephants
in them work I've checked check with
them work there are no elephants maybe
in a couple of zoos but yeah we all
thought of an elf I'm from Denmark look
at that
so was that really magic not really the
majority of people felt magical which is
what we want in most cases when we were
doing user experiences right but most
people it turns out when you ask them to
think of a country with the letter D
we'll think of Denmark
we're in Western Europe your extra prime
to think of Denmark when you ask them to
think of an animal with a letter e they
will think of it elephant
some people think of emos if you thought
of an emu we should be friends come back
and find me after at the talk but evil
is an elephants aside what we're here to
talk about today it's really predictable
user behavior right how do we use
behavioral patterns to take advantage of
that and enhance our apps and has how we
do our user experiences reduce our chair
and increase our revenue and what what
can we do with that to just bring that
into a more tangible example let's make
a game what do you think about that
let's do it
I've called our elephant mr. Ellie he's
gonna be with us for half an hour might
as well get on first-name basis you okay
with that yeah I like that mr. Ellie
sounds good so it's billed again for mr.
Dedalus so sounds like a fun game mr.
Ellie is on a mission to collect bananas
all over the world
he's going to leave Denmark and go on a
cruise and looks like a fun game
tomorrow and I'll play this game but I'm
a little worried about this game already
you know what
you know the funnel of pain for most
game developers mm-hmm you know within
the first 24 hours these developers tend
to lose half of their active users do
you have to remind us and then by the
end of the week you tend to lose another
half of those users okay and guess what
it's looking pretty grim then by the end
of 30 days you tend to lose another half
of those users I get it I get it I get
it
it's looking pretty sad for mr. le I'm
sad for him too so but I am product
manager and I are gonna look at product
managers in the room hello thank you for
coming if you tell us that somebody's
gonna leave our app we might be able to
come up with some growth strategies or
some retention strategies and test them
out and figure out how to keep users in
our app the trick those layers you have
to tell me who's gonna leave before they
leave because it's easier for me to
retain users I already have then it is
to try to acquire a whole bunch of new
users so what can you do nothing I can
do that I'm glad you asked this question
cause that's exactly the idea behind
firebase predictions to enable machine
learning on an identifier patterns in
user behavior so that we can predict
these events in the future you know
we're really excited to introduce this
feature to you so let's dig into this
all right so if you're already using
firebase and you're logging your app
event data with Google Analytics for
firebase you've done all the hard work
needed to take advantage of predictions
all you have to do is go to the firebase
console and enable predictions for your
application data predictions will now
start giving you these actionable
insights so that you can target your
users and strategize how you want to be
and grow your app so I just want that to
sink in for for a minute here because
this is extremely powerful
we've practices a lot of times and I'm
still very excited every time the slide
comes up because now with no
intervention and no work on your part
you can reuse the same set of data that
you're already logging to look at the
past to look into the future and you can
take advantage of
Google machine learning in your app with
no effort on your part this idea of
democratizing machine learning for the
majority of developers especially
smaller developers is really very
exciting for to me and let's take a
little deeper into what we do so
basically at it at its heart this is a
supervised learning problem so the first
thing we need to do is actually come up
with examples to teach the model what it
is exactly that we want it to learn so
we take the last 100 days of user
activity and we reserve the last seven
days you call that a labeling window
meaning we look at it and see what
actually happened and we give labels to
the users Turner spender share etc and
then we take the rest of that historic
time period and kind of generate
features and that's learning the
behaviors grouping the events that have
happened during that period into a
meaningful fashion we both generate
training and evaluation hold out data so
what that means is that we're capable of
generating all sorts of fun statistics
about how good our predictions are doing
including accuracy precision recall all
that stuff and we expose some of these
like accuracy to you later inside the UI
so both the the training and the hold
out data it is fed into a neural network
structure using tensorflow and what we
then ask the model to do is take the
entire historic period of events and
then generate labels for the upcoming
seven days so what is going to happen
over the next seven days once we're sure
that the quality of the prediction is
good enough we write it to the various
predictions back-end what that means is
that you have it available to you to use
a remote configuration so that you can
customize your in-app experience based
on what the user is predicted to do you
can send notifications to predicted
groups of users you can also run a be
experiments to figure out how to
optimize the experience or what's the
best growth or retention or rabiner
strategy for predicted users user groups
so let's take a little bit deeper in
- what do you get out of default
predictions yes so out of the box if you
enable fibrous predictions for your app
you get two very important sets of
predictions and the first one is round
turn now these are the users who were
recently active within your app but are
predicted to not come back to your app
in the next seven days we give you a
prediction for churn and for not sure
and users who will most likely come back
to your app in the next seven days we
also show you the percentage of users
from your active spool which are about
the churn and you might see that these
percentages might not align 200 and
that's because our models cannot predict
the data for some user some users are
still new to us we are still learning
etc you also see the absolute number of
users you will be targeting if you use
the Z option to target these users so
the next set of predictions is around
spenders we will tell you which users
are likely to spend within your app in
the next seven days and which users are
likely not to spend within your app
again these percentages won't align 200
and then you see all the rest all vary
slider so let's talk about that so every
prediction comes with the risk tolerance
slider right and what it allows you is
to change and tell us how many false
positives you are willing to accept when
you target users so when I made the
prediction for elephant from Denmark
some of us did not pick that right and
the users who didn't were the false
positives now by changing this slider
you can actually tell us how few or how
many false positives you wanna include
depending on the way you're strategizing
to target these users so let's take an
example right like let's say you I want
offer a new in-app purchase in your
sender notifications to your spend users
it's okay to take a high risk profile in
this case because even if this
notification reaches some users who are
not likely to spend it's still okay and
you know your spenders will be covered
and you know no harm done giving this
option but if you want to offer
something for free like to bring all
those users were about to churn again
the retention that you want to be very
sure that these are users are very very
likely to be turning away so you can
choose a low res profile and we'll show
you the percentages and the number of
users when you target these users
so the nice thing about those profiles
actually as you can specify them every
time you take in an action so I'm
sending a notification I'm willing to
accept 30% false positives I'm giving
free free battle-axes I'm gonna accept
only 5% false positives in my in my
prediction all these numbers are pre
generated and so when you're using them
in the UI there are they're available
for use the second thing that we exposed
to you is the overall accuracy so after
a certain amount of time in each of the
pieces of the UI that you see behind us
which is called a prediction card at the
bottom of it you will see a little
accuracy graph when you tap on that we
exposed to you how did our predictions
do for the past 14 days so if you if you
hover over it it'll tell you the
percentage of the predictions that came
true so we evaluate which ones did that
we predicted to turn actually turn which
ones that we predicted to not turn did
not turn and sum it all up and provide
you with an overall accuracy metric so
let's talk a little bit more about how
can you actually use predictions inside
your apps so let's go back to our basic
sets of predictions that are available
right like we have this churn card we
see that 36% of users are about to churn
ouch
we have the risk tolerance slider so
jimana how can you use this card in
order to you know success make our mr.
le app grow well I know that in our game
a level 4 mr. Earley this is lovely
dance it really enhances people's
emotional connection to the app and I
know most people if they reach level 4
they probably don't leave so I could and
this is data them already logging say
for example using user property into my
user Analytics Google Analytics for
firebase so I could use that and define
a remote configuration to help more
people reach level 4 so for example I
can say that if this user group is
predicted to turn and they also have not
reached level 4 then I'm going to change
the default difficulty for the game
server side to easy and
set of medium this way I'm not affecting
the experience of the majority of my
user base but I'm doing something very
targeted to those who kind of turn
because I think that's gonna help them
stay in the app if they get to
experience that moment of joy at level 4
something good strategy all right so we
know our app has an approach as we've
been logging those events so we get this
nice prediction for spend and we see 22%
of our users are likely to spend in the
next 7 days so but for you how can we
use this data to increase our revenue or
increase our user base so a couple of
ways we could use that to increase
revenue one for example I could use it
with the brand new firebase a be testing
to figure out which variant look which
in-app purchases I should offer I could
do two variants for example and offer an
in-app purchase at a lower value or a
more expensive in-app purchase and see
which one performs better and only
target this towards people who are
likely to spend so my spenders I try to
get more you more give them more value
and it gives them more and improve my
revenue by showing them the more
expensive faring it and again I a be
tested so that I have a way to actually
validate with what strategy is actually
the best strategy the other way we could
do it is to use the non spent prediction
to for example enable hybrid
monetization in my game so at the end of
each level I could for people who are
predicted to not spend with the low risk
profile so no more than 5% false
positives I want to show them using
AdMob a rewarded video ad at the end of
each level and this way I'm not
affecting again the user experience from
us people who are going to spend but I'm
introducing safely a hybrid monetization
strategy into my game cool so let's talk
about one of my favorite features in
firebase predictions and I think this is
a really powerful tool fibrous
predictions allows you to create a
custom prediction for any conversion
event within your app as developers you
know which are the most important events
and moments in your app journey right
like in our game level for
milestone to log what you can do is just
log that event with Google Analytics for
firebase and then go to the console and
create a prediction all you have to do
is give the prediction and name and tell
us if you are interested in users who
are likely to hit that event in seven
days or likely not to hit that event in
the next seven days and that's it now
fibrous predictions will create this
prediction for you and you can target
users for the specific prediction which
is very unique to your app now in this
case we see the prediction is for social
engagement and we want to see if the
users will share or have the share event
in the next seven days so I'm guessing
you plan to use this in the Miss rally
game you guys play by is cheating he's
synthesized before so for example think
that there's maybe a very special moment
where mr. Ellie encounters an emu in the
game I can introduce then a more
aggressive sharing UI and say share this
with your friends but only show that
piece of UI to people who are predicted
to share this way I'm not like
cluttering the experience with a lot of
popups and invitations to do activities
and only showing them to people who are
likely to engage with them I'm not
missing out on the word of mouth from
the social butterflies in the game but
also I'm not pushing UI on every single
user inside the game awesome
so we've had fibrous predictions
available to our alpha partners for a
while and we've been taking their
feedback figuring out if our model
quality is good and they've been
analyzing the results and doing some
tests in their own way and we have some
success stories to share so I'll start
with the half break and this is
something that Francis also highlighted
in his keynote today half break used the
churn prediction and their popular app
dan the man and it resulted in a
retention rate boost for about 20
percent now let's follow the steps on
what made half quick get the success so
as I said earlier all they had to do
first was go to the console and enable
predictions for their app data they've
been logging their events in firebase
analytics already so it was all ready
for them
now the time it takes to produce a
prediction for a tournament depends on
the variety of other events you're
logging and the volume of events
our pipelines run every 24 hours so if
you have a new event or new data coming
in it will be incorporated in the model
quality every 24 hours
so once the predictions are ready you
get an email which has details on which
predictions are ready what are the
accuracy numbers how to target users and
you know see these details from the
console so nextstep is to go to the
console and in half its case they chose
to use it to target users so as soon as
you click that you see the options to
either use remote config or
notifications now half we decided to use
remote config and they went to this
screen to create a remote config
parameter they did something like this
created a variable for will churn they
were interested in users who were about
to churn and then they did publish now
as you know if once you publish with
remote config that parameter is
available to all your app installations
in real time when they do the next
remote config fetch and this is a code
snippet so on the client side so as you
can see if the will churn parameter
value is true we are granting a gift and
that's something very similar what
Halfbrick did what did it look to the
end users something like that they see
this nice banner to the users who are
about to churn and most likely these
users could play because it looks very
tempting I would yeah and you know it's
amazing how such a small change led to
an increase of 20% in depth seven-day
user retention yeah I mean I think that
that's that bears repeating here that
for the amount of work that really takes
to incorporate predictions into your app
it's really the upside is really worth
it I know we talked a lot about we've
been talking a lot about games and game
partners but that just so happened that
during alpha most of our partners were
game developers but the spent
predictions will work for any game that
has habitual spends so if you for
example is a language app that has
habitual spend and multiple
opportunities to spend and doing our
purchases this will work really great
for you as well if you have a single
spent event ever
the lifetime of a user it might not work
as well about triangle work for everyone
so talking about revenue there are we
have a couple of examples where partners
were able to optimize revenue using
predictions and the first one is
rockbind so Rob White has this great
game sci-fi game called deep town and
what the what the team has come up to us
with is the following challenge they've
been running a beat us for a while right
now inside their app trying to figure
out what's the best layout for their
digital store and every time they run an
a/b test it comes back inconclusive
because they're running on a portion of
the population and they're not quite
sure why it's working one way or another
so when we told them about predictions
they decided to use the well-spent
predictions in order to figure out you
know if there is if there's something to
the fact whether they're gonna spend or
not spend that the layout of the store
could optimize and indeed there was so
for the spender group they put this like
rare chests on top of the on top of the
their digital store and they observed a
25% increase in revenue and the
predicted in that predicted group they
repeated the experiment with the non
spender group and put crystals and stuff
like that on top that allowed people
maybe to continue playing in the game
for a little longer and they saw an
increase in spend also in this in this
group and based on the results they
rolled that change out permanently and
now any new users that come depending on
how they get classified will see a
different a different layout of the
store and as they move through their
user journey and their status changes
the layout of the store for them will
change as well another partner that saw
some good results in optimizing revenue
is concrete and what they did is they
actually used predictions the spent
predictions to optimize when and where
this show adds inside of their app so
they actually ended up optimizing their
in-app purchase by 21% by tuning the
frequency and when and where ads are
showing whom they're shown for so we're
hoping you'll be able to
try some of these things out and see if
if you can produce similar results
alright so in summary if you haven't
been logging events with Google
Analytics for firebase you should start
doing that now so that we have the data
to create these predictions for you all
so please log your conversion events
because I think you'll be interested to
get insights on what's happening with
those events with your users and then go
to the firebase console and enable the
predictions for your data I think it's
worth mentioning here that you can mark
as conversion either default events that
firebase logs like you know share and
writing a review and things like that
but also your own important milestones
inside the app you can mark them as
conversions and just like that with a
click of a button you get Google ml as
part of the team helping and augmenting
your team whether or not you have data
scientists on staff I think it helps
augment your team's ability to make
objective decisions about about their
product and remember that you basically
then get it in the rest of the firebase
ecosystem in this beta you get it in
remote configurations for customizing
your nav experience you get it
notifications so you can send targeted
notifications to predicted groups and
the most powerful integration really is
to do a combination of remote
configuration test a be testing and
predictions in this way you can
basically iterate over your various
growth strategies and figure out what
really drives revenue higher what really
reduces turn for you before it happens
ahead of time these are really powerful
insights and we are very excited to see
how you are gonna determine and how you
going to use different strategies to
grow your app either in terms of user
base or revenue and if you have any
questions we'll be in the firebase
lounge to answer those you can also
tweet us with the hashtag ask firebase
and thank you all for coming today
remember this is a beta so we actually
do have a discussion group that you can
join there's also our website should be
up right now so if you go just to the
firebase landing page you should be able
to access predictions we have the docs
we have the recipes of the success
is documented there as well so you can
enable predictions for your app today
and start experimenting with it we'd
love to hear from you so please do
connect with us on the discussion group
we've launched a beta because we felt
the product is strong and and ready for
you to use and we'd love to work with
you on what are the case studies and the
features you'd like to see more of in
the app so hoping you all will give it a
try
and come talk to us about it thank you
all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
