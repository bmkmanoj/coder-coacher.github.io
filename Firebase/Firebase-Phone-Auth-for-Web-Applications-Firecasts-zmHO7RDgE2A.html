offers phone number authentication where
your users can simply sign in using
their verified phone number and not have
to deal with usernames or passwords it
works by sending a message with an
embedded code to the phone number that
you sign up with this contains a
validation code and if the user enters
the right validation code they'll be
signed into the application and
registered as a firebase user you'll
also notice that a CAPTCHA is used this
is optional and you can turn it off by
using the radio button I'm Laurence
Moroney and in this video I'll show you
how it all works before coding the first
thing you'll need to do is have a
firebase project in the firebase console
if you don't have one already you can
create one at this URL once you've done
that you need to go into the
authentication section and click on the
sign-in methods tab you can see a list
of the various sign-in methods and on
this list is phone flip the enable
switch to on and then click Save your
app can now handle firebase phone
authentication if you look at this URL
there's a demo app that you can use to
inspect how the authentication flow
works it's this sample that will step
through for the rest of this video the
devil is built using the open-source
firebase UI libraries and I strongly
recommend using them as they encapsulate
most of the complex user flows that are
necessary in building an app that uses
sign-in a link to the libraries
themselves along with full instructions
on using them is right here
the first step is to use the libraries
of course and you can do that by
including them from our CDN here if you
prefer to use local scripts and p.m.
Bower or other methods check out the
link also to use firebase UI off you'll
first need to configure it and typically
this will include a URL to redirect to
on successful sign in a Terms of Service
URL and a set of options it's in these
options that you have to specify that
you want to use phone off with the phone
off provider and things such as whether
you want to use CAPTCHA or not here's an
example
once that's done you can initialize
firebase UI off with it and load it into
a div on your page like this you can
then check the on off state changed for
firebase off to determine if the user is
signed in or not if it returns non null
then the user is signed in otherwise
they're signed out but what's really
neat about this is all the user
interface that you see for managing
users is entirely automated you don't
have to build it for yourself firebase
UI handles all of it for you that
includes things like the user interface
for entering a phone number submitting
it to firebase and where you enter the
code to verify it and once all of this
is completed you'll then be redirected
to the signed in URL that you're
configured in the settings earlier it's
really that easy so to learn more about
firebase including more on firebase off
