things that you guys are working on and
today we just want to tell you a little
bit more about some of the great things
we have to offer for you so as you may
have heard at Google i/o once or twice
or a couple more times right firebase is
a suite of integrated products designed
to help you develop your app grow more
users and earn some money while you're
at it firebase allows you to share your
data with other platforms including
Google's own advertising platform of
course AdWords ad words helps people let
you know about how amazing your app is
and get it into their hands and into
their phones so this afternoon I'm going
to walk you through Adwords and how we
can help you find more of the right
users for your app so you can find more
people that are interested in whether
more people that are interested in
finding the great game for their child
right and more people interested in
security okay so I'm going to go ahead
and start by giving you some industry
context showing you how universal app
campaigns can help you find more of the
right users that you're looking for then
my friend Eli here is going to show you
a demo of universal app campaigns and
it's going to be amazing let me tell you
and then we're also going to tell you
about what we're doing to make universal
app campaigns even better to find you
more users and more quality users and
just because one of my secret super
powers is not keeping a secret I'm going
to let you in on my secret and what
Pasha's or what you guys going to tell
you about it might have to do with
launching universal app campaigns on iOS
and focusing on lifetime value yeah look
I love the excitement this is fabulous
finally pasta is going to tell you about
the improvements that we're making on
formats how we bring the art and science
of our automated tools to help you move
the needle and by the end of this
hopefully you'll be able to find more
quality used for your app and really
grow your business and if we'll also
talk about a little bit of the ways that
we try to make it really easy for you
get started so before I dive into things
let's talk about why we're really here
consumers are always on their phones
today you see this when you're on at the
supermarket people are on their phones
checking prices you see this when you're
commuting right people are listening to
music on their phone and you see this
when you're just sitting at home talking
with friends looking up you know the
hottest new news or something so eighty
percent today of time that people spend
on phones is actually spent within a
mobile app so it's really important to
get users attention and both google play
store and the App Store have reached
enormous scale with millions of apps
driving economic value north of 50
billion dollars per year 50 and that was
a be four billion okay that's a heck of
a lot of money coming from users on
mobile apps and so you know at this
point I'm making it sound really easy
right all you have to do is build an app
you're going to get people coming in and
downloading your app they're going to
spend time in your app they're gonna
spend money in your app and then they're
going to tell all their friends about
their app all the new friends are
beating here at i/o right and business
will just be booming and all you're
going to want to do is skip through the
park and sing a song like you're in a
musical but it's really not this easy
and that's what you guys are all here
right I hope axe presenti but the
ecosystem also creates challenges for
developers and marketers such as
yourself so first finding users is
really not that easy at the right time
when they're ready to download your app
secondly figuring out what works is not
that easy either knowing which channel
that uses are going to be on the right
channel to get people to download your
app right it takes time and it takes
money to test to iterate to manage and
to optimize those campaigns
and you guys are all very important
people and you have much better things
to do then turn a few knobs on your
campaigns third it's really difficult to
keep users coming back right mobile
users today have more choice than ever
before and while it's really great for
users such as myself it does possess a
challenge for people to download your
app and to engage again and just because
a user installs your app it doesn't mean
that they're automatic going to pull out
their phone every day and look at your
app and so this is where Google comes in
right we got your back millions of
consumers today are discovering and
engaging apps with all the Google
destinations today whether they're
searching on the web to find a great
place to eat lunch after this
presentation I know we're blocking your
lunch I'm sorry or just simply looking
for a new game to play so that when
you're standing in line you have
something to do right or watching those
amazing cat videos on YouTube come on I
know you guys all do that in your spare
time right we're woven into people's
lives in such a great fashion and we
have we actually have seven products
today with over a billion active users
so it's a lot of users ready to download
your app and we have been really
thoughtful about how we surface acts to
the right people at the right time and
we made great strides recently an app
discovery with two major launches search
ads in the Play Store and universal app
campaigns I'm hoping some of you guys
are feeling on here whoo good so some of
you guys are very familiar with these
products we're going to go ahead and
tell you a little bit more about them
just in case you're not familiar with
them so we're going to start with search
ads and play how do people discover apps
today well they're often searching so a
recent tune study has actually shown
that apps searches result in sixty-seven
percent of app downloads that is a huge
percentage of the app downloads
and so that's why we wanted to launch
search ads in play there's no better
place than to be right in front of a
user just as they're ready to download
that app and hopefully it's going to be
yours right it's the perfect addition to
our search ads inventory meeting user
intent right where it lives and
customers have found really great
success with this especially with the
search Network grubhub has actually
helped tens of thousands of hungry
people get lunch delivered to them
because they have actually had a 16 x
growth in the amount of downloads since
using search that's a lot of really
tasty burritos yum but it doesn't end
there we actually have lit up more
opportunities across all of our networks
including YouTube the Google Display
Network and google com we've actually
recently found in a study that users the
average user they open their phone a
hundred and fifty times per day okay
that might just be to see you know how
much traffic there is after I oh and how
to get home in the fastest and most
efficient way or how to get to the
airport and when they're at the airport
they might be thinking hmm I might want
to watch a play a game today so and
download a game right I might want to
watch a couple videos and see what games
are cool and then before I get off that
flight into the wild blue yonder I'm
going to download a fabulous game to
play or they might just be looking for a
great place to eat tonight because I'm
just obsessed with food obviously so
these are the moments and the points
where Google can reach users when no one
else can and we call these moments
micro-moments
and we make it really simple for you to
access users in these micro moments with
a campaign that we call universal app
campaigns so last year if you guys were
at Google i/o we shared how we were
making ass growth easier with the launch
of universal app campaigns these
campaigns which you can create either
through the Play Developer console or
through AdWords allows you to create the
ads that are you see here today when
users are searching on google com when
they're discovering for apps on the Play
Store when they're engaging with just
some of the apps they just download it
from the Play Store when they're surfing
the web or just simply watching some
videos on YouTube UAC is the one stop
shop for developers such as yourselves
to tap all the inventory and the formats
that we have to offer for you at Google
it's one campaign and a very minimal
investment in setup and it's working
it's working really well more people are
discovering apps on Google than ever
before and over the past year thanks to
universal app campaigns we have more
than doubled the app installs driven by
ads and to date we have delivered more
than two billion installs to developers
such as yourselves I'm saying a lot of
billions here there's a lot of
opportunity out there for you and
developers have really loved you AC okay
they love the product simplicity and its
campaign setup they love the efficiency
that we can bring and by hitting their
performance goals and they really love
the ability to reach Google inventory at
scale
and these are the two things that we
keep hearing over and over from
developers when we talk with them about
UAC there's simplicity and their power
and if you walk away from this
presentation remembering nothing else
what I want you to remember is that you
AC campaigns or universal app campaigns
are extremely simple and really powerful
ok so let's talk first about how you AC
is simple developers just need to enter
a few pieces of information you just
need to tell us a little bit a creative
text to tell us what your potential
users might be interested about your
appt second you provide some information
about where users are located
geographically and then just tell us how
much you want to pay per install and
we'll do all the hard work it's really
easy to set up and a line here is going
to put this to the test in a few minutes
with a really fascinating demo I promise
you so universal app campaigns hardly
require any optimization time HBO use
the universal app campaigns to put HBO
now app in the hands of a lot more
people and they were able to do this in
a lot less time Diana pessin at HBO so
that their setup time was reduced from
two hours to 15 minutes that's a whole
extra hour to 45 minutes that they can
use to go skip through the park if they
want and sing a song and be in the
musical universal app campaigns also
perform extremely well beating out HBO's
target cost per subscription
so we've talked about how they're simple
it's almost as simple as saying okay
Google and now let's talk about how
they're powerful google has a number of
really unique insights Google is able to
reach use intent whether they're
searching one of their reading are
browsing are communicating are simply
just playing google has better signals
about what a user wants to do and we use
these unique signals to understand
exactly how we can help you move the
needle across all of our properties it's
not just about the unique signals that
we bring but also about the power of our
machine learning that we use to make it
work for you the universal app campaigns
ought to make targeting we automate
bidding and we ought to make creative
generation to create engaging ads to
find you more installs for your money
our models evaluate countless number of
signals and we are always learning and
adjusting so that when we show your ad
it is with the freshest and most
relevant data the best thing is we do
all of the hard work in the back end and
invest in your money where we think it
goes the furthest and customers such as
strava have really seen how universal
app campaigns can work for them so
strava wanted to accelerate the growth
of their app in a lot of new markets and
universal app campaigns help them do
this in a simple and scalable way with
just one app campaign they were easily
and able to quickly hit all of the
Google networks and reach athletes
across all of these networks while still
maintaining their CPI goals and that is
pretty amazing and so now I'm going to
come up and invite Eli to join me and
we're going to do that demo that I've
been promising you about and don't tell
him that I let you in a what he's going
to tell you all the new things that
we're bringing in
it'll be our little secret okay okay
awesome thanks Melinda hi everyone I'm
Eli Danziger I'm a product manager here
at google and i work on app promotion
ads on YouTube so as Belinda mentioned
we are going to we're going to show you
just how easy it is to get started
promoting your app using AdWords so we
know that you're probably here today
because you want to know how you can put
your app into the hands of more users so
we're going to take you through a quick
demo it's going to be amazing
spectacular you'll see in just a second
through one particular campaign which is
the star of our show today that's
universal app campaigns so we up on the
screen good okay great so first we're
going to pick a campaign name something
something memorable like campaign number
two amazing you read my mind then we're
going to search for our app lets go with
Transworld endless skater it's one of my
favorites you can see that as soon as
you select your app we automatically
generate ad formats across the play
store google com and the Google Display
Network then you add four lines of add
text we even pull in your description
from the app store to help with some
ideas
once you've added these lines of add
text I know so much pressure once we've
added these four lines of add text we're
going to scroll on down and we're going
to add a YouTube video as well adding a
YouTube video allows you to run video ad
formats across YouTube but also the
Google Display Network next we're going
to pick our location and language
targeting let's step out of our comfort
zone here and go with us and canada and
english and french okay very good next
we're going to set our bids and our
budgets the bid is the amount that
you're willing to pay for an install of
your app and your budget is the daily
amount that you're willing to pay each
day now I know what you're all thinking
when Belinda hits save some fireworks
are going to happen this is going to be
a super cool demo right totally wrong
this is actually going to be quick and
pretty unremarkable but that's the
entire point right we're literally done
show me to hit save i canÃ­t say oh you
hit save that's it we're all done you
set up a campaign you guys are done high
five so this is really cool because
AdWords automatically sets up conversion
tracking for you so you don't have to go
into your app and and tag up your app
with with a bunch of SDK calls this is
all done automatically so you can see
just how effective your campaign is at
driving installs so instead of
maneuvering through millions of
different combinations of settings and
variables we've baked simplicity and
power right into the model now one of
the things that we that we showed in
this demo was that universal app
campaigns pulls in creative assets for
the google play store google com and the
Google Display Network basically for
search and display creatives and as a
video p.m. that makes me really sad
because we know that video is super
engaging for users it's an incredible
medium for storytelling and for
engagement and what that means
is that it attracts high-quality users
for your app but we also know that
creating a video can be difficult in
time time consuming so in addition to
search and display creatives we're
making it super easy to generate video
creatives as well this is a new tool a
free tool that's built right into
universal app campaigns that's going to
allow developers such as yourselves to
automatically generate videos using the
content that already exists in your app
store listings so it's another way that
we're doing the hard work for you in the
background so that you can focus on
building amazing and engaging app
experiences for your users this success
story really stood out to me quick show
of hands we're going to go back to the
interactive bit again how many people
have played trivia crack raise your
hands okay a couple of people a couple
of people for those that haven't the
name is is pretty telling it's it's a
pretty addictive app enermax which is
the apps parent company was looking to
enter additional markets around the
world they had this killer insight that
users really enjoyed playing trivia
games against other users around the
world and from this killer insight they
were able to use universal app campaigns
to keep going global they were their
campaign was able to achieve a forty
percent lower cost per install than
other channels and they were able to
drive more than forty thousand downloads
in the first two months which really
accelerated their entry into other app
markets okay the now is nice but let's
let's talk about the future on Wednesday
we announced that we're building on the
success of universal app campaigns with
a slew of new features and the key
insight that led us down this path is
that engagement with your app is key so
essentially that installs are valuable
but really engagement is what's going to
separate your app from being successful
from being not on the user's home screen
buried in a folder somewhere never
opened so with that I want to share our
vision for the next generation of
universal app campaigns
we want to build a simple way we want to
continue building a simple way for
developers to find high-quality users
across the broadest most valuable pool
of inventory and to keep them coming
back to your app so it wouldn't be much
of an inventory story if we didn't talk
about that other app platform iOS so
first we're really excited to talk about
how universal app campaigns is going to
be expanding to support iOS apps in
addition to Android soon all developers
will be able to tap into the power of
universal app campaigns to grow their
user base on iOS in addition to Android
after providing a few simple creative
and bidding inputs just like we showed
in the demo developers will be able to
reach billions again with the be of
users across Android and now iOS as well
and this is going to be with beautiful
formats that are designed to fit
natively and seamlessly into the
respective operating systems iOS is in
beta today and it's going to roll out
soon to all users we've got a handy
short link on screen if you guys are
interested in signing up for the beta we
encourage you to hit that hit that short
link and sign up for the beta will have
this up again later in the presentation
as well so don't worry if you don't get
it now second I'm excited to dive into
the core feature of the next generation
of universal app campaigns our teams are
focusing their attention on helping
developers to optimize for lifetime
value and so again this comes from the
key insight that installs are valuable
but really engagement is critical so
let's think about the three cases that
we described earlier each one of these
businesses has key events that really
move the needle for their business and
really drive value for their business
and these are actions that they really
want to drive with their app campaigns
so that can be ordering food online that
can be subscribing to a service that can
be taking your bike out for its first
ride
the goal is valuable engagement so a
recent study showed that seventeen
percent of users drive eighty-five
percent of in-app purchases and so what
that means is the difference between a
user installing your app and never
opening it and a user actually taking
action in your app there's a huge
difference between those two types of
users the problem is that the data that
makes your business run so understanding
how users behave in your app on one side
and how your marketing campaigns are
performing on the other have
historically lived in silos and they
haven't really talked to one another but
obviously we all know that they both
that they both have value to each side
and so bringing these two things
together is really where the opportunity
lies and so our vision for universal app
campaigns is that we can help you to
take advantage of this opportunity by
bringing this information together and
finding you more of the right app users
now instead of just app installs you're
going to be able to tell Google the
in-app events that are important to your
business and have universal app
campaigns optimized to find more of
those in app event we take care of the
rest so marketing and analytics better
together
and that's the vision for the next
generation of universal app campaigns
it's even more powerful than what we
have today but still keeping simplicity
front and center we're giving developers
we're giving you the choice to decide
between maximizing for installs and
maximizing for lifetime value of these
acquired users and to make this all work
we're working on making it much easier
to share these conversion events with
AdWords which is why we're particularly
excited about firebase analytics this is
our new app first app analytics platform
that we announced at i/o because have
probably heard about this once or twice
it provides pre-built engagement and
conversion signals that can help you
manage your conversions across AdWords
and over twenty third party ad networks
so if you're a firebase user you can
automatically funnel views conversion
events right into AdWords so it's even
easier for you to optimize your
campaigns and drive lifetime value one
of the great parts about universal app
campaigns is that you'll be able to
choose which actions are important to
your app and which actions drive the
right value from amongst a large
selection UIC is going to work
seamlessly with firebase analytics but
importantly it's going to continue to
integrate seamlessly with the top third
party app reporting SDKs we think of
this as a new era in app discovery a way
to buy app ads that's unique in the
industry it starts with understanding
the actions that drive lifetime value
for your app specifically and then it
lets the automation take over so how
does this all work set a lot of
high-level things get a little bit into
the details we leverage Google's machine
learning algorithms to find prospective
users that are likely to be high-value
customers for your app and to really
drive those in-app events that you've
identified as valuable to your business
you've all probably heard the deep mind
and alpha go recently beat one of the
greatest human go players of all time at
a game that is so complex it has more
board configurations than there are
atoms in the universe we utilize the
same underlying technology to process
user and contextual signals in real time
to find installs and soon these very
valuable post-install events that are
going to really move the needle for your
app so obviously this vision is
something that we're very excited about
you can you can probably tell but the
great thing is when we've talked to
customers we find that they really share
our enthusiasm including David rose
who's the head of performance marketing
at pocket gems and he said this is an
app marketers dream more valuable users
less effort and really we couldn't have
said it any better ourselves and we
completely agree with you David so now
i'm going to hand it over to pacha who's
going to talk about how our formats are
really helping to make our automation
even more powerful thanks Eli so my name
is Pasha Nahas and I'm a product manager
here google working on our App ad
formats and ela and Belinda talked a lot
about how universal app campaigns are
incredibly simple and easy but also
really powerful thanks to the power of
automation at the same time one of the
most important elements in determining
how well your ads perform are the
formats that your users eventually see
as a result is probably no surprise that
we apply the same sort of automation and
simplicity that we have with universal
app campaigns in general to optimizing
your ad formats so that they look more
beautiful and perform better with no
extra work from your end let's take a
look at one particular ad format that
can run with universal app campaigns
this is a full screen interstitial that
runs on third-party ad networks at the
third party apps
and these sorts of ads can show up in
natural apostate in an app for example
in between the levels of a game we've
been running these ads for several years
now and this is what they look like when
we first started you'd give us a few
lines of creative text and then we'd
pull in a whole bunch of other assets
from the Play Store or the apple app
store like the icon star rating
screenshots etc and we'd pull all these
assets together to make a rich full
screen creative then about a year ago we
did a redesign of our creative where we
pulled in a big beautiful cover photo
and we put a prominent round install
button at the bottom to draw users
attention and we match the color of the
footer and the button with the cover
photo so that all felt like one seamless
experience all these little design
touches led to a great improvement and
both click through it and conversion
rate then just a few months ago we went
one step further and started customizing
by ad platform as well so users on iOS
devices would see an ad that's developed
with iOS visual language and users on
Android devices would see an ad that's
designed with Android visual language
again we saw a great improvement in
performance and the best part about all
these optimizations is they happen
automatically with no work from you once
you gave us those first few lines of
creative text we did all these
enhancements automatically over time
with no extra work now let's talk about
another format that we're really excited
about which is native ads so Belinda and
Eli talked about the awesomeness of ads
on Google search and on google play and
part of that awesomeness is because the
ads feel really native in the context
they show up in these ads match the UI
and the visual language of the
surrounding content so we're trying to
do the same thing on ads the show up on
third-party apps as well so instead of
showing a simple banner that is
one-size-fits-all we're working with app
developers to show native ads that fit
in more seamlessly into the surrounding
content these ads are not only more
beautiful and have a better user
experience but they perform better too
in a beta version of our native ads
which we launched yesterday we saw
sixteen percent increase in lifetime
you for advertisers when they were
requiring users on native ads versus non
native ads that's a pretty significant
difference and again the benefit here is
if you're running universal app
campaigns you get placed into these
native ads automatically with no extra
work from you now showing users a few
images or screenshots or tax or even
video is really great but what can be
better than letting users try your app
for themselves with trial run ads you
can do exactly that trial run ads are
Android add to the run on google search
and on the Google Display Network and a
user has the option to try now and if
they select that option we start
streaming the app automatically and
immediately from the cloud no
downloading anything no wait times and
the user can start interacting with your
app just like they would with the real
thing if they're interested in what they
see then they can go and install from
the Play Store automatically now the
best thing about this is because we're
using the Play Store apk there's no
extra work from your end we can just do
this all automatically on our end no
work now this this demo here this the
screenshot is really cool but wouldn't
be better if we actually showed you what
this looks like in real life let's do
exactly that let's do a demo now I can't
promise can you guys see my screen there
we go I can't promise that my demo will
live up to the excitement and
razzle-dazzle of Eli's but I'll try my
best I guess you guys are gonna see my
pattern so please don't please don't try
to steal my phone later so here we have
an interstitial ad that is promoting the
1010 puzzle game and you see some images
about the ad and the star ratings etc
and you have the option to either
install or try now and let's say you
select to try now and we will start
streaming the app live from the cloud
and you can start playing with it just
like this and you get to see my awesome
10 10 skills now the thing I really want
to highlight here is we didn't download
anything this is all streaming live in
real time from the cloud automatically
so so this product is still in a limited
early-stage beta but if you're
interested in learning more we'd love
you to go to this website that you see
on the screen jiko / trial run as beta
and we'll send you updates when we have
more to share now I've talked a lot
about all these different formats that
we automatically optimize and make
better without any extra work from you
but you're probably thinking hey my app
is really special and I should be able
to show that specialness in my ad format
in some really cool and special way and
you're totally right we completely agree
that's why we have a product in beta
called interactive interstitials where
you can use HTML and JavaScript to
create a completely custom experience
that's tailor-made to highlight the
unique value proposition of your app for
example if you're a retail app like zoo
Laura you can showcase the hottest
trending styles and users can swipe
between them or if you're an action game
like boom beach you can show a panoramic
view of all the different gameplay so
that's a quick whirlwind over our act
formats and to summarize what we've
talked about in this talk Google is
making it a lot easier for you to find
high-value users with less work belinda
talked about the importance of google
and all its different properties in the
app discovery process and then she
introduced universal app campaigns as a
really easy way to acquire users across
all these different properties then Eli
did one of the best demos of the entire
IO week when you showed you just how
easy it is to use universal app
campaigns and he also shared some of our
upcoming plans around iOS and optimizing
for lifetime value and then I walked you
guys through our latest and greatest
formats and showed you how we're making
it easy to optimize your ad formats
without any work from your part and
because I'm going last and I'm the
formats p.m. I of course had to use the
only animated slide and also to put my
own face on the slide as well and we
wanted to say thank you for taking the
time to listen to us and now we'd like
to open it up to any questions you might
have
hey so we're about to spend lots of
money advertising our app NP R 1 and we
are looking for ways to optimize the CP
is and also to optimize for install
users so I'm wondering if you have
evidence that the CP is are lower than
like social advertising through Facebook
and how can I go about like rapidly
figuring out what those CPI's would be
and comparing them to our other
opportunities yeah sure so one of the
things that I don't know that we showed
that well during a demo but we do have
some recommended CPI's for you based off
of apps from your vertical and from your
country so that's probably a nice place
to at least take a look and see sort of
if that fits within the realm that
you're expecting and then just try it
out universal app campaigns because
they're so easy to go ahead and just sit
started you could start with something
small just check it out and see how it
works for you and then kind of keep
expanding from there
we're looking at advertising a wearable
app basically and apart from any other
targeting it really only makes sense to
advertise it to people who have an
android wear watch I think that's that's
that's good feedback and yeah it's
something that we should we take into
consideration going forward with our
road maps yeah not something that's
currently I would say there's I would
say there's kind of two answers to that
the first one is one of the great things
about the machine learning that we do is
that we're able to rapidly hone in on
the users that are likely to install and
the ones that are less likely to install
will rapidly not get ads shown to them
so that's that's kind of like the first
point there are some things that you can
do around remarketing if you know if you
know which users have already installed
your app or or have a list of users that
are likely to to have Android wear
devices already so there are some things
that we can do outside of universal app
campaigns that's a little more
complicated so we can talk some more
about that outside of here if you're
interested okay thank you great thanks
can use remarketing lists for universal
a conveyance
from AdWords not today but it's
something that we're thinking about
right now but as of now Universal
campaign doesn't allow any additional
marketing lists all right yeah but we'll
keep that in mind thank you for your
feedback hey it's me again the we've
been using the firebase dynamic links
and we love them so I wonder it like to
take the user right into an app state I
wonder if there's any thought about
integrating like a dynamic link so
rather than a generic install through
universal epidemics but take them in our
case to like a specific podcast or some
like that is that something you're
thinking about so we have a
pre-engagement ads or you are you
familiar with those or is that not what
you're thinking about I'm thinking about
first install it wet up I'm seeing
an app state as the hook and then using
a dynamically to take the user to that
app state through the campaign yeah so
one of our appt engage reengagement
formats allows you to install an app and
then and then once the user then presses
continue he'll actually be taking
directly into the link that you specify
so if you're interested in like
advertisers considered podcast you could
do that and with the re-engagement
campaigns well actually if the user
doesn't have the app installed we'll let
them install it first and then take them
to that specific page if they do have
the app installed we'll just go ahead
and skip the install stuff and take them
directly to that page so that's the
reengagement campaign yeah and I'm happy
to chat afterwards if you're not as
familiar with that yeah
honey for the dry run ads do you
monetize that so do i pay cost per
install cost per impression so you can
still bid on cost per install like you
would with with any other campaign and
right now we are experimenting with how
we exactly like charge and what what
things we do we like I said it's still a
very early stage product and so we're
learning what works the best to get you
the highest quality users and but you
could still bid on a cost per install
like you would with any other
great
any other questions okay sounds good
thanks everyone we really appreciate
your cover if you guys had any questions
because you were too shy we'll go ahead
