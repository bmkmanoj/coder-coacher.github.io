comically hello and welcome to this
week's episode of hash tag ask firebase
you've got a lot of questions we've got
a lot of answers why we get started
Doug start us off this one is from
jordan on youtube who asks how come when
i make changes in remote config they
sometimes don't show up right away and
leia oh all right that is a very good
question Jordan so the answer basically
is that the remote config library does a
whole bunch of caching on the client by
default up to 12 hours
before it goes out and hits our servers
to get new data and this is generally
sort of a way to keep the service free
it kind of helps make sure that your
clients don't accidentally you know ddos
our service and it turns out I have an
entire video all about it that you
should check out right here we'll just
link to it here all right great question
thank you very much let's move on next
question is from Casey at well 42 in
Twitter who asks ask firebase why in my
app does it say UI view controller is
not convertible to user status view
controller when I try to run it oh okay
you know I've actually seen this problem
before so the issue Casey is that on
line 96 of your user status view
controller you forgot to add a question
mark it's a common thing it happens all
the time but that was easy huh I hope
they're all this easy all right let's
move on next question this one is from
Alex on YouTube and come to think of it
a whole bunch of users on Quora
and our firebase Talk group and Stack
Overflow who all want to know hey ash
tag ask firebase how can I send a
notification in response to some data
changing in my real-time database that's
a great question you used to have to set
up your own server to do something like
that it was kind of hard but now with
cloud functions for firebase you can set
this up on Google cloud servers you
write code deploy it trigger on a
database right and then you can send FCM
messages to your users as simple as that
and where would a user want to go if
they wanted to find out more about cloud
functions they should go to the firebase
page at firebase Google comstock slash
functions alright we'll put a link like
should we put a link here here's a link
the link in the description below great
question
thank you very much everybody who asked
let's move on to another next question
this one is from Marie Waller also
on YouTube who asks hey hashtag ask
firebase in picasso's girl before a
mirror what is the mirror supposed to
represent oh okay great question so I
know some people think that the mirror
the reflection is sort of supposed to be
the girl's self perception you know the
way she perceives herself versus the way
the world around her sees her there's
another camp of developers who thinks it
might represent her blossoming
femininity but if you check out the
firebase FAQ section we actually have a
section all about this you'll see that
the answer is uh hang on I got it right
here all right
mortality its mortality thank you very
much for the question Marie let's move
on this next question comes to us
through our firebase Google Group and a
user who asks hey hashtag ask firebase I
want to record the names of the elder
gods in firebase ooh what's the best way
to do that Doug you're kind of an expert
on this why don't you take this one yeah
so you might think that storing the
names of the great old ones would be
done with just a bunch of strings so be
a candidate for a typical no sequel
database but it turns out storing the
symbols for the name of a whore god of
the labyrinth on a normal hard drive
will cause all physical storage within
half a league to transform into
carnivorous flies that will consume the
flesh of our data center engineers until
not but bones and teeth remain so don't
do that yeah use cloud storage for
firebase instead yeah that's really what
it's made for yeah awesome question
let's move on next question this
question is from Kelly s on Twitter who
asks hey hashtag ask firebase I have an
app where I'm using firebase cloud
functions to read in an image from cloud
storage for firebase and then
asynchronously apply some machine
learning to identify the content of
those images now my question is can you
teach me how to dougie teach me teach me
how to dougie well I'll be asked this
really seems like a better question for
Doug Doug no next question okay this
last question is from several of you who
have asked hey ask firebase what ever
happened to David East ah well David is
on assignment right now but he's assured
us that he'll be
can you hear me you two worse what was
that got me trapped in do whatever you
have to to get us back haha sorry we had
some technical difficulties there anyway
David is off on assignment but he's
assured us that he's really interested
in doing more ask firebase episodes with
you just as soon as time allows and he's
definitely not being held captive in
some re-education facility until he
learns to pronounce Jif correctly
don't you mean give well that's all the
time we have for today I'm Todd
Kerpelman the only host there has ever
been for this episode of ask firebase
asking you to keep sending in those
questions with the ask firebase hashtag
and we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
