my name is Doug Stephenson and after
following this fire cast you should be
able to connect your Android app to
firebase it takes just a few minutes
then you can start developing with
firebase components in your app will do
free things to help you get set up first
I'll show you how to check your tools
and make sure you have the correct
version of everything then I'll walk you
through the creation of your project
using the firebase console and finally
I'll show the changes that you need to
make to your Android app to prepare it
for development with firebase okay first
things first before starting with
firebase on Android you should check to
make sure you have everything you need
to run your app you'll need an Android
device or emulator with at least API
level 9 which is Android 2.3 also known
as Gingerbread and that must have Play
services 9.0 or later physical devices
should already have this update by now
but if you're using an emulator you
should get the latest update for your
emulator image and make sure you're
using one marked with Google API s this
means it has Play services installed to
check the version of Play services on a
device launch the Settings app and
select apps make sure you're looking at
a list of all the installed apps and
scroll down to Google Play services
select that and check that the version
is greater than 9.0 now that you've
verified you have a device that can run
firebase it's time to check your Android
SDK tools launch Android studio run the
Android SDK manager from the tool bar
and click the SDK tools tab there
you should have Google Play services
revision 30 or newer and Google
repository revision 26 or newer if you
have these installed you can start
building firebase client libraries and
always remember to keep them up to date
now that you have a device and tools to
start building we can start setting up
firebase to use in your app first I'll
navigate to firebase google.com this is
the home of everything firebase to get
to the console I'll click the console
link at the top right now I'll click the
enticing blue button in the middle of
the screen which pops up a dialog to
create a new project every project needs
a name clicking in the project name
textbox suggests that I should only
create a single project if my app is
cross-platform but we're only going to
do Android in this video if you later
create an iOS version of your app you
should reuse the same project if you
want to share data and configuration
between them
I'll also take the default location of
United States since I'd like to measure
in any currency values for the purpose
of analytics in US dollars
now I'll commit the new project with
this other attractive blue button after
a few moments my project is created and
I'm taken to the dashboard which shows
an overview page of everything I can do
in the console on the left side you can
see the various firebase components but
let's not worry about those right now
instead click the big button in the
middle with the Android logo on it to
get your app connected to this project
to complete the connection you'll need
two pieces of information
first there's the unique package name
that you used when you created it
this is typically defined in your apps
configuration in the build Gradle as
application ID I have a basic project
already created in Android studio so
I'll just copy its ID from build.gradle
into the dialog at the console the
second thing you should provide is the
sha-1 hash of your debug key this is
only required if you're going to develop
with remote config authentication or app
invites but let's go ahead and do it now
the sha-1 hash helps firebase verify
that your debug app has permission to
use these firebase services so to get
your sha-1 hash open up a terminal
window and type this command it will
prompt you for a password so type the
default password for the debug keystore
which is the word Android in all
lowercase what this does is print some
information about your debug keystore
the specific thing you're looking for is
the line that starts with sha-1 so
you'll want to copy the series of hex
values after that then paste that string
into the text box in the console now
that you've got these two values entered
into the dialogue you want to go ahead
and click the add app button this will
start a download of a file called Google
services JSON that contains your app
configuration remember that when your
firebase configuration changes later you
may need to download and update a JSON
config to add to your project what
you'll need to do with this file is move
it into your Android project under the
app directory I'm going to do this on
the command line now I can see it in the
correct place in my project once that's
done I can update my Gradle build files
to add firebase client libraries to my
app the first thing I'm going to do is
add the Google services Gradle plug-in
to my
build script configuration by default
this is in the top level build.gradle
file what I need to do here is add a
line to the dependencies block to let
Gradle know how to find a plug-in that
I'm going to add later because I
modified this file Android studio is
asking me to sync my project but I'm
going to ignore that for now okay close
that file now I'm going to open up my
app level build.gradle file and apply
the Google services plugin at the very
bottom of this file this plug-in will
read the Google services JSON file and
inject some of its values into your
build the last change I'll make here is
adding a compiled dependency on firebase
core the plug-in will actually do this
for me but I want to make sure I'm using
the latest version you should check the
documentation to make sure you're using
the latest and greatest so I'm going to
check here on the firebase Android setup
Docs so here we can see that the latest
at this moment is 9 point 0.2 and that's
what I'm going to use for firebase core
alrighty we're done now with the Gradle
modifications so I'll go ahead and tell
Android studio to sink the modifications
into the project now to make sure
everything is working as expected I'll
launch this app in an emulator and check
the log output to see a firebase
initialized correctly
and we see here that firebase
initialized just before the log message
in my application object so that's all
there is to it now you're ready to move
on to integrating the components of
firebase that you want to use in your
android app check out the firebase
documentation right here for more
details on those components and that's
it for this fire cast please leave your
questions in the comments below or
message me directly at coding Doug on
Twitter
there will be more fire cast published
over time so be sure to subscribe to the
firebase YouTube channel right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
