Kerpelman at Google i/o at the shoreline
amphitheater on this beautiful summer
day and on this very special episode of
hashtag ask firebase we're going to turn
the tables on you the developers and ask
you the question so while we go inside
so we can find a developer to on come on
what enough Senate i/o today were you
most excited about
so I love the firebase cloud functions
and are we paying you to wear this shirt
today no no you're not for sure open
sourcing that okay that's a missile to
into take a shoe and read go it was
really nice to see like how it's coming
and also all the newest features of
firebase you don't have to say firebase
I'm most excited about machine learning
is that is becomes to the common people
everyone can try it and use it profiling
of up because it will help us to find
slow connections and where our upsets
slow calls
I think the digit is a big one or a
phone number authentication other thing
I think the real time I'm very bad with
names but it's about the real-time
analytics stream view 3s 3 million yeah
stream views fun take that actually kind
of feel bad for people guys what's the
one development tool or utility you
can't live without lighthouse I think
Android studio it's super cool that is a
great answer or retrofit because I am
from I also all the most excited for me
is the case ashing display kids for the
web I would say visual studio code all
right here we go we're blasting off oh I
got this one way mo we need waynebow
Karsten left left left
which of these does not exist I think
that's me chrome dick oh oh no that
doesn't exist
don't film that toilet paper over the
roll or under the roll over there oh I'm
sure they're developer questions over
behind
I use water ah even better answer behind
why behind yes and those questions are
did you know maybe were working on a
toilet paper product you know you don't
know it's a secret
oh for sure / definitely if you take iOS
and you turn it upside down it says so
make sure this is lined up now nobody
touch it moving on is a hot dog a
sandwich public is it a sandwich no I
think it's not intend which you can't
see what's in it sandwich it is is why
interesting sound good no no no why
would it be ketchup or mayonnaise on
your french fries ketchup ketchup
ketchup none neither just just plain
both I like mixing those through so
that's that's a good answer - yeah we're
needs to be awful
does it be fun how've you been doing the
show excited about the Kotlin
announcement yes everyone is this is
Alec she's a tech writer for us to make
some amazing documentation that's the
show been going for you you guys feel
like it's had its ups and down ha here
at Google i/o next year sundar steps up
on stage and says this year we are super
excited to announce what would you like
to hear him say I've been freeway MO car
for everyone that is a great answer do
you hear that slender we're going to
work on it that Amit Patel is our new
CEO at be a step up maybe a promotion I
think probably maybe a more about
machine learning in terms of mobile
business for example there is a google
lens application maybe open sourcing
some of the nifty features there that
would be super awesome to see that would
be super awesome to see hot no pun
intended they seem to do a good job
delivering every year don't need my help
or it more fun when it's a surprise
operation system for iPhone and iPod
they will get working on that one now
all iOS developers that Jesus twist we
are greeting you and joking Susan Swift
on Android
Oh Swift on Android we'll have to see
about that one I would like the auto
bike ah self pedaling bike I like to go
to the forest and everything so it would
be easier to take selfies and everything
and enjoy the moment good idea so I have
two speakers for you it's super stickers
