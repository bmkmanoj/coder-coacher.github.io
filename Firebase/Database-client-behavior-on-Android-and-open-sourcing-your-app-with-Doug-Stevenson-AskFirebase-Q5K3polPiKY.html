hey everyone welcome to another episode
of hash tag ask firebase do we still do
hash hash tag okay my name is Doug
Stephenson I'm a developer advocate here
with the firebase team and I'd love to
draw your attention to an event we have
coming up very soon the firebase summit
is in Berlin November 7th we're going to
be doing YouTube recordings of all the
talks and more so be sure to subscribe
to the channel right here to get all
that action and now we'll take some
questions I need to do the the shake it
up who would this just in so beneath on
YouTube asks is there a way to
differentiate between debug analytics
and release analytics on Android now
this is a good question because it's not
even just analytics it's also crash
reports you don't want your crash
reports and your analytics from debug to
muddy up your production versions so you
want to keep those separate now the
easiest way to do that is to set up two
different apps within the same project
one for debug and one for production and
you can do that by creating two apps
with different application IDs that in
your Android build you can split between
two different builds one for debug one
for release with two different
application IDs you only work in your
debug version and then you publish your
release version if you want to know more
about that there's a blog post that I
wrote recently it's on the firebase blog
you can get to it right here and that'll
tell you all of your options so you
might want to create two apps within a
project you might want to create two
different projects the blog post will
help you decide which one is right for
you
great question vineeth thank you for
that okay let's take another question
this next question comes from a jing kia
on youtube a Genki asks can I share one
database in to Android apps now this is
a good question sometimes you want to be
able to in one Android app access
databases in two different projects so
in order to make this happen there's a
little bit of extra code you have to
write normally you don't write any extra
code to configure your project that all
happens with the android plug-in now if
you're using a second project from
within a single app what you have to do
is create a firebase options object and
that firebase options object needs to
know things like your API key
application ID and some other
configurations so once you have those
values you're going to create that
firebase options object pass it to a
firebase app class that firebase app
class can initialize a new version of
firebase app that you can use to get
access to the database in another
project so if you want to see some
actual code to make this happen we've
boiled down the essentials into a stack
overflow post know that stack overflow
post which you can get to right here or
in the description below that will get
you started in being able to configure
one app to access to databases thank you
gingka great question question we've got
one this next question comes from telmo
ping yo on youtube and tumble acts what
happens to events when my Android app is
not running now this is a good question
because Android apps don't necessarily
die when they go into the background by
default when an app is sent to the
background the process is still running
but it may not be killed until sometime
later so in Android if you have database
listeners registered in that app that
app goes to the background if those
listeners are still registered they will
still fire as database events occur
however when the app is killed by
Android to reclaim memory those events
will no longer fire those listeners are
completely gone the process is gone and
you can't get them back but and then the
next time the app is launched you can re
register those listeners and then
they'll fire as you expect so keep that
in mind as you're developing your app
that going into the background doesn't
necessarily kill your listeners but when
Android kills your app they will
definitely go away great question
thank you and next question can I move
the camera with the words next question
so this next question comes from Darion
tow on YouTube and Dario doe asks is
there any screencast for firebase
storage on Android now this is a good
question because I'm happy to say yes
there is one I just recorded it it's
available right here in the firebase
channel on YouTube you can get to that
from the description below now in that
video I'll take a little time to show
you how to upload an image and how to
download that image back from firebase
storage so it's great watch please go
see it already moving on to the next
question
Constantine asks
can I run queries without attaching a
listener on Android now the way firebase
database works on Android is all through
listeners everything that you ever
receive every piece of data is going to
be through a listener so there's no way
to just issue a query and then wait for
a response it doesn't work like that so
you have to do everything through a
listener now if you're trying to do a
query and you only care about the
results once like you don't want to
listen to it over and over and over
again you just want to listen a single
time you can use a method called add
listener for single event that's a lot
of words but it will trigger your
listener only once so you don't have to
worry about registering and
unregistering it's a bit of a shortcut
that you can use it should be handy
great question thank you all right let
me find another question on the list
this next question comes to us from
Quora and the question reads can I host
a git repository on firebase now the
answer that is yes
even though code hosting isn't one of
the core features of a firebase project
now it turns out firebase projects are
all Google Cloud projects so anything
you can do in a Google cloud project you
can also do in your firebase project now
Google Cloud projects have this feature
called cloud source repositories now
what you can do in a cloud source
repository is essentially host your code
through get in your project so it turns
out within your firebase project you can
host code using cloud source
repositories as a feature so go check
that out I think it's pretty neat thanks
for the question whoo this just in this
next question also comes from Quora and
this question reads can I open source my
firebase Android project the answer that
is of course yes you can open source it
but there's one thing you need to keep
in mind the Google services JSON file
that you download from the console you
should not check that into source
control that should be in your get
ignore or whatever it is that you use to
keep certain files out of source control
and the reason why you want to leave
that out is because there's information
in there that uniquely identifies your
project you probably don't want to be
sharing that with everyone else
if someone Forks your project they
should be using their own Google
services JSON that they get from the
console and you might want to mention
this in your readme so that people don't
get tripped up on that good question and
I can't wait to see what you open-source
thank you thank you everyone for all of
those great questions if you have
questions of your own be sure to reach
out to us on social media
with hashtag ask firebase and I'd like
to remind you of the firebase summit in
Berlin coming up I'll be there I hope to
see some of you there but if you can't
make it be sure to catch the sessions
right here on the firebase channel on
YouTube thanks for watching and I'll see
you next time hey everyone welcome to
ask firebase where we answer all
questions related hashtag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
