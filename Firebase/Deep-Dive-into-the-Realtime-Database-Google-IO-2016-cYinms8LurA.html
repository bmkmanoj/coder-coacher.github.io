super excited about the new firebase yep
that sounds like kind of excited like
you know like like 9:10 a.m. excited
let's get like real let's be like you
know 6:00 p.m. concert excited like
everyone how exciting about the
real-time alright that's a lot better so
I'm here today to talk about two things
those two things are real-time and
offline and it's kind of funny when you
talk about real-time and offline
together because they're kind of
opposites because real-time is a fresh
stream of data and offline is data that
we usually get served from a stale cache
so getting them together it's not that
easy
and trust me I know I once failed at a
startup doing just this my startups name
was kale and we had one mission and that
was to change the world and we're gonna
do that by building a collaborative
grocery list app and if it was going to
be warble changing then it needs to be
in real-time and it needs to work
offline so when we want that built our
app we started with the backend and we
were like okay we need a server that
makes sense then we need you need a
database because we have to store data
so let's do that and then we had to
build a real-time wire protocol just
talk to her devices in real time but
there's more than one device so we
actually had to talk to multiple devices
so we had to go to a synchronizing
method mechanism so we could talk to all
the devices in real time and then we
also had to deal with offline so we had
to build a local cache on each device
that could emulate a real-time server so
we could serve the changes to the noise
like it was in real time on the app and
then after that once the app went
offline and went back to online state we
had to send that data back to the server
to the database and then update all the
clients in real time so like a year
later we realized oh my god we haven't
even built an app so we built an Android
app
an iOS app and a web app and the chrome
team was like guys you only need to
build a progressive web app and her like
I'm sorry we can't do that and they're
like why
oh because we ran out of money so
building a real-time offline app it
didn't have to be this hard because we
could have used firebase so far base is
a suite of integrated products designed
to help you develop your app grow your
user base and earn money today I'm here
to talk to you about firebase real-time
database and the firebase real-time
database helps you build real-time and
offline apps the way it works is is that
every single time one device sends an
update to the server that update is
synchronized across all devices within
milliseconds today I'm going to cover
how you can store data in real time or
store data and then how to retrieve that
data in real time and then saving data
and then handling offline conditions so
let's start with storing data so you saw
that when I had my little manually start
up we had this big complex back-end
infrastructure and we were responsible
for building this maintaining it and
hosting it well if we were to use
firebase we wouldn't have this problem
because the real time database is cloud
hosting and what that means is is that
you don't have to build it you don't
have to maintain it you don't have to
host it all you have to do is build your
app and the real-time database will do
the rest so how is data stored in this
database well it's just a tree of lists
and objects so if you understand what
lists are and objects ours entries then
you know how to store data so let's take
a little visualization this right here
is the root of a tree we could create a
branch that'll be a list of grocery
items and then in this list we can have
a set of items that all have values that
are a grocery list now
if you stare at this structure really
really hard
you might notice something familiar and
that's that this is just JSON that's
because the real-time database is just
one big JSON object that you can manage
in real time so if you're familiar with
JSON that's exactly how you store data
in the real time database and we call
this a no sequel JSON database so a lot
of people who are coming from a sequel
background or something and they're not
familiar with no sequel they always ask
me a similar question how do you
structure your app's data like how
should I take this JSON data and fit it
for my app and there's just one rule of
thumb and that you can really follow and
that's you can structure your data after
your view so what this means is is that
if our data structure is a list of
grocery items and our app is a grocery
list app then we can take these values
and we just map them onto the view and
when you have it set up like this it
makes it really easy to read your data
in real time so let's see how we can use
the real time database to synchronize
our data across multiple devices so this
was my this is the way we did our
back-end with kale it was not really
great we never really mastered real time
so what we would do is we would send a
request to our back-end
and then we would get a response and
then we could render an item and while
that was just great for one device the
other device has no idea anything has
happened at all because we don't have a
connection from the database to this
device so it's always left in the dark -
any changes the real-time database
though has a persistent connection to
every single device so when data changes
it knows what devices to send that data
to
and we can do this using the real-time
database SDK so the SDK works on Android
iOS and JavaScript and with this one
line of code you can create a connection
to your database and this is more than
just the connection this database
reference class it gives us a lot of
control this database references are a
handle to an object or a list so when
you create a reference to this piece of
data you have control over it and allows
you to read this data in real time so
the first reference you usually create
is called the route reference because
you're pointing at all the data in your
database and likely you don't want to
read all the data in your database
because you're a smart person and you
only want to read just a subset so let's
say we want to get at the grocery items
well to do that I can create this child
reference and I can pass in the key of
my grocery items and now I have access
just to that list and using real-time
events I can stream this data in real
time so the two types of events I'm
going to cover today are value events
and child events so the way value events
work or is you can attach them to this
database reference and so what you're
essentially saying is is every single
time data changes in this location
send me an update and we can receive
this update through a callback and this
callback is fired with a data snapshot
which is our synchronized data set and
it's really important to understand that
we are synchronizing application State
we're not just sending back updates and
to understand what that really means I
set up this little debug station so the
top we're just an assigning a value
event listener to our grocery list and
then below we're going to be logging the
result
to this console so the first log from
the database is going to be our list of
items so we could take this list and we
can display it on the view now let's say
a user comes in and adds the item of
coffee what do you think is going to
happen inside on data change so you
might think that while we added an item
of coffee we're gonna get that new item
back and on data change but that's not
exactly what's going to happen it's
actually going to happen is we're going
to get the entire list including the
newly added item and that's because this
is our synchronized application state
it's the true state of our list and you
might think like that's kind of sounds
inefficient that if I just add an item I
download the entire set well the real
time database SDK is a little bit
smarter than that and what it tries to
do is it tries to take Delta events from
the server and so the only taking the
item that was added and then piecing
that together with your local state so
it becomes bandwidth conscious some
value events are way for you to
synchronize the entire value of an
object or the list when anything changes
but sometimes you want a bit more
control you may not want to get the
entire object or list back and you might
just want to get one thing at a time so
I might want to know when only items are
added or if items have been deleted so I
can display a fancy little animation and
so that's where we can use child events
so child events are similar to value
events in the sense that we can attach
them to a reference but they provide us
with more than one type of callback we
can tell when things have been added to
our list when the items value has
changed and we can even tell when
something has been removed
so see how this works I have that same
debug screen up and the very first event
that gets fired
is the child added event and this gets
fired for every item one at a time
that's existing in this list so I'll
first see it for each item at a time so
as I go through we add an item and then
we render it to the view so this gives
us single control one at a time and
let's say we go and we want to remove an
item so if a user goes and swipes an
item off a list well this is going to
fire off child removed and what this
will do is when this fire is off it
fires off on every connected device so
every device knows how to remove this
item so let's say we change one item let
me change from coffee we want more
coffee
and what that'll do is a fire off child
changed and then we again get a callback
and we know this is the item that needs
to be changed in our list and so this is
a lot of events and these provide you a
lot of control of how you synchronize
your data but sometimes you'll find
yourself writing a lot of boilerplate
code to get this to work with common
components on your platform so that's
why for Android and iOS
we built firebase UI and what firebase
UI does is it takes these database
references and it pairs them up with a
recycler view on Android so you can take
this database reference pass it to our
firebase recycler adapter class and then
every single time and event fires off we
will serve that change and bind it to
your view holder so it handles all of
the eventing for you and if you are an
iOS developer it does the same thing
with UI table views every time something
changes it takes that change and binds
it to the UI tableview cell and if
you're a web fan we have integrations
with pretty much every major JavaScript
framework
so whether that's angular polymer ember
react
we have integrations that work with your
style flow so that's how you retrieve
data in real time that's only part of
the puzzle because to trigger real time
events you have to know how to save data
so how would we add an item to our
grocery list we know that the initial
reference points to the entire database
and that if you create a child it points
to just a piece of the database just the
list well we can again go and create
another child from that list and that
gives us an object that we can save a
value to so in this case we're creating
a child underneath the list so a new
grocery item and we're giving it a key
of saying it's the second item and we're
giving it a value of coffee and the way
this works is is that when one item
sends this update to the real-time
database it's going to trigger a
real-time events for each connected
device and then we're going to render
that device or under that item onto the
view and this is what your data flow
looks like with the real-time database
you save items and trigger real-time
events and so we can keep our entire
application state in sync just through
this pattern but sometimes there can be
an issue let's say the other device goes
they also add an item using that same
key of item underscore two well that's
going to trigger a real-time events but
it's going to delete the item of eggs
it's going to add the item of coffee and
that's because we use the same key name
and what this is called is a collision
so we're colliding by using the same key
name and the real-time database SDK has
a really simple way of fixing this so
we'll go back and create our grocery
list reference and then rather than
creating an explicit choice
we're gonna call this method call it
push and you can think about it like if
it was an array and you're just pushing
a new item onto the array because we're
doing is we're actually creating a new
item onto our list in real time but this
item we create it has a unique
identifier and this way when we use this
we know that we will not be colliding
with any items that exists in the
database and when you know that you're
not going to have collisions it sets you
up to work offline so when we were
building Cael we had some serious
problems with offline we were a grocery
list app and then people would go to the
grocery store and then turns out grocery
stores are known for having pretty bad
connections so they couldn't even use
their app in the store and so when we
want to fix this we ran into an issue by
the fact that real-time over that
offline really manifests itself in more
than one way so the real-time
database handles offline in two ways the
first is intermittent offline and this
works for every single platform so
Android web and iOS and this is like if
you go into an elevator or a tunnel for
a short period of time and your
connection drops
well the real time database SDK puts a
local in-memory cache on your device so
if the connection drops we can serve
these changes through this check through
this cache so it'll work offline just as
it did online but sometimes you might be
going offline for a bit longer and you
might be getting on an airplane going
through a hike in the wilderness or you
just might be spending a really long
time in the grocery store and in these
cases you're likely going to turn off
your phone you're likely going to
restart the app and when you do this
it's going to clear that in-memory cache
well the real-time database has a simple
way of fixing this for Android and iOS
and what allows you to do is just in one
line of code you can enable a persistent
cash on your device and what this does
is is if the user goes offline and they
clear out of the app their data will
still live on the device what what
happens when they go online and what
happens if they were using the app when
they went offline and they were writing
to the database like what happens then
well the device as we know stores this
data in a persistent cache and when it
goes online it just sends that data it's
the real-time database and that merges
the changes on the server and then sends
a merged update to every device so
everyone can get back onto the same page
so that's how you do in real time an
offline but I want to talk a bit about
security because we're writing all our
code on the clients so how do we keep
everything secure
well the real-time database comes with a
set of security rules which are a
declarative way to say who has access to
what pieces of data and this integrates
with firebase authentication so you can
log in users and then secure data
against them and I'm not going to go too
much into detail on this because Jacob
Wenger an hour ago gave a talk all about
firebase and security and if you want to
see it you should check out our YouTube
channel that we just launched the other
day where all the i/o videos are gonna
be on and also a series of screencasts
called fire cast so it's going to teach
you everything you need to know to get
started with the new firebase and also
tomorrow you should check out 0-2 app
where four of my colleagues are gonna
get on stage and live code the same app
on Android iOS and web integrating the
real-time database with firebase off in
firebase storage so in this talk we
covered storing data retrieving it in
real time saving data and handling
offline conditions so now you know how
you can use the real time database to to
build real apps to build real
- now you know how to use the real-time
database to build real-time apps with
firebase and if you build something I
would love to know about it so you can
get started and then send me a
screenshot send me anything it just or
whatever of what you built and I would
love to take a look at it
so that is what we have for today but
for more information on firebase you can
check out our office hours or head over
to our firebase tents and we'd love to
answer your questions and just know that
when you build with the real time
database is that you're getting the best
of both worlds of both real-time and
offline thank you guys very much
