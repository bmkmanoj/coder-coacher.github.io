meet firebase we get to meet the
Googlers that make firebase happy my
name is Doug Stevenson and I just had a
yelling match with Nate so my voice is a
little bit hoarse thanks for hanging
with me on that today on the show we
have Lauren Lauren hey thanks for being
on the show great to be here thanks for
having me
tell me what do you do on the firebase
team I work on called functions for
firebase which we just launched at
Google cloud next so is our newest
product it allows you to do custom
server logic in response to events
happening in your app a lot developers
have been waiting for cloud functions
yeah number one requested there's a lot
of excitement over it I know Nate is
jazz for one so tell me briefly how are
developers using that in their mobile
apps yeah so they're using it to replace
things they used to have a server for
such as custom authentication sending
push notifications to mobile apps or
resizing a thumbnail image after it gets
uploaded sounds like things that people
have been doing with their own custom
server they no longer need that exactly
and they can just deploy their code to
the Google cloud yeah and just replace
all the friends when it needs to shut
down it doesn't need to run mmm that's
great I want to ask you more about cloud
functions later
yeah but first I would love to know
where are you from yeah so I was born
and raised in China in a city called
Shenyang in the Northeast and the
Liaoning province when I was 10 my
family moved to Toronto Canada and I've
been there since until I moved here for
Google about nine months ago
tell me what's unique about the place in
China where you grew up it is very cold
during the winters and very hot during
the summers but we are reputed to have
the best dumplings in the country can
you get soup dumplings there that's what
I want no soup dumplings are actually
from Shanghai oh they're actually
slightly different in the dumplings I'm
talking about I'm talking about the ones
that are boiled and served after being
boiled I like all the dumplings great so
I'll be sure to get dumplings if I ever
visit yes so you said you moved to
Canada and you went to school there too
oh yeah what was your major I studied at
Queen's University
in Kingston Ontario and I studied
biomedical computing biomedical
computing so that's kind of a rare path
to take how did you get in there so I
first went into university wanting to
become a doctor because my mother was
one and I took computer science as an
elective and it was the course I put the
least amount of work in got the highest
mark again so I thought this is great I
should do more courses like this so in
second year I switched into biomedical
computing still wanted to get into med
school but later on I took the full
plunge realize programming was actually
what was for me but you're learning
didn't stop there you got into this
program called the recurse Center tell
me what that's all about yeah so I did
that a few years after graduation is the
three-month full-time program you
retreat where people that I already know
how to program come to do things they've
always wanted to spend time - incurring
with so I just jabbed with a whole bunch
of things actually build a project very
similar to firebase before I discovered
what firebase was it's very hands-on
practical get your hands dirty you kind
of learn that's great I always like
learning by doing projects as well and I
think it's very effective for people
when they get into Google I'm kind of
curious how you decided to apply to
Google that's a good question I wanted
to join Google because I wanted the
opposite of what had I had done before
to get a taste of something different so
I had my own company I then worked on
another startup as a product manager so
I was looking for a company that had a
lot of mentorship support structures a
lot of training opportunities and Google
came out on top when I looked at those
kind of criteria so you've been working
on the cloud functions team like you
said what parts of that specifically
have you been working on yeah so I work
in the part closest to developers which
I'm very happy but I work at the
command-line interface the CLI as well
as the SDK that developers used when
writing cloud functions okay so it
sounds like for those of you at home who
have done a firebase deploy command to
get your code up into Google's cloud
that is something Lauren worked on and
so you're using her software when you do
that so that's great so I'm sure the
rest of the team is glad you joined to
make that possible and I understand that
some others on the team and you do some
extracurricular activities like dancing
is that right yeah and I think we have
some video of that that we'd like to
show everyone
so what kind of dancing do you do I've
recently been doing a lot of swing
dancing with a lot of members at the
firebase team I also do salsa sometimes
I've done Chinese folk dancing when I
was young
where do you do dancing around here I
sometimes do like Google I recently
checked out at the Argentine tango class
so it was a lot of fun and other times I
find different spots around the city who
are you dancing with in that clip that
we just said so that club was Andrew Lee
one of the cofounders of firebase and he
currently manages the engineering team
and San Francisco I don't dance really
well at all but I enjoyed watching like
other guests who have been on the show
you also enjoy travel what have been
some of your favourite destinations yeah
so I went to Peru a few years ago and I
did a five-day trek to machu picchu
called the salkantay trek that was
probably one of my favorites okay what
was that like it sounds pretty intense
yeah so it was very intense first time
ever done anything like that and on the
first night it actually started raining
while I was hiking and I was wearing a
down jacket because it was about
freezing temperature and the jacket got
wet and it was my only warm jacket so I
had to hang it outside my tent to dry
and tie it ups in hopes it wouldn't fly
away and it did dry the next day
thankfully well that's good so speaking
of adverse weather conditions okay
you've also spent some time in the
Arctic yeah I seem to gravitate towards
cold places so I was there volunteering
for a summer during my university years
and I was running literacy camps for
kids in youth living in Baker Lake
Nunavut in Canada and it was a community
of about 2,000 people
we were running camps that were fun that
taught kids how to read how to write how
to keep learning on their own okay so
that's that was more than just travel
you actually had a mission or a purpose
that so how long were you there again
two and a half months two and a half
months oh so you lived in that community
and sort of just existed with them I did
yes I got to even go to a local wedding
that was a lot of fun they had some
holidays that they were celebrating got
to go see their little parades on the
street and they were playing these games
in the community center I even went
hunting with a family out in the land we
drove out for a few hours
and didn't actually catch anything yeah
but it was a good experience
yeah it sounds like quite the experience
I've never done anything like that okay
now I want to circle back to cloud
functions right now cloud functions only
supports JavaScript for the node
environment is that right as well as
typescript II okay and I know that the
team would love to support more
languages in the future but today I'd
like to play a little game with you
I would like to quiz you on your
knowledge of various programming
languages okay so the way it's gonna
work is I have a tablet and there are
samples of code on here what I want you
to do is read the function and tell me
what language it's written in all right
so here we've got public static void
that is Java that is definitely Java yes
great next one this one's short at Def
tells me that it is Python that's right
okay so this one we've got the char star
that's either C or C++ and trying to
think I think printf is C ya see all
right next one oh I have never seen this
one before it's a lot of parentheses in
there maybe it's a functional language
it could be considered a functional
language yes is it elixir not quiet this
is school it's actually Common Lisp
parentheses kind of give that away if
you know that hanley languages okay
let's move on to the next all right get
a def and an end and it puts bidding at
the realm of scripting languages now oh
is this Perl
no that's okay I'll just give it to you
this this one is Ruby actually oh I do
not know Ruby yeah that's okay so let's
move on to the next so here you are
importing something and then func is how
you declare
oh it's go it is go that's correct I
like because of the variable name and
then the tape afterwards
- hello unit equals print line I'll give
you a hint it's a JVM language jvm
language app this one is Scala they're
kind of tricky now gotcha okay let's
move on to the next okay so some really
low-level thing stuff oh no this is this
is all some scripting language oh I have
no idea this one is actually Perl this
time this is yeah the dollar signs in
front of the variable names give that
yeah and the last one and I don't think
either of us have written a line and in
this one this one's kind of tricky so
why would you capitalize everything yeah
well that's you know the convention of
some languages right
oh is this Visual Studio this is Visual
Basic Visual Basic sorry yeah yeah we
don't do so much of that here at Google
but a good job on the game and thanks
