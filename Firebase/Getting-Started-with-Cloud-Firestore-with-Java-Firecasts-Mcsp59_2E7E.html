talk about two of my favorite things
cloud fire store and the admin SDK so I
love that firebase has such robust
client-side SDKs for iOS Android and web
but did you know that firebase also has
a server-side option the admin SDK the
admin SDK lets you access firebase
features server-side so you can for
example read and write to Claude fire
store outside of the client this is
especially useful for offloading CPU
intensive tasks and keeping secrets away
from the client now if you've seen
Todd's videos on getting started with
cloud fire store for iOS or Android
you'll already be familiar with the
sample app I'm going to use one that
stores an inspiring quote
if you haven't seen these videos I
highly recommend you check them out Todd
gives a great overview of the fire store
structure I'm going to use the iOS
version of the inspiring quotes app
which looks like this you can see the
quote and author as well as text fields
to write a new quote and a new author in
this video I'll show you how to use the
admin SDK to make changes cloud fire
store which can then be seen here in the
client so you may be wondering how can I
keep my quotes fresh with new
inspiration every day I could rely
solely on users to write quotes or just
try to remember something interesting
and type it in the console manually
after all there's no shortage of
misinterpreted quotes on the Internet
didn't George Washington say that anyway
one neat way I could handle this is
server-side I could use one of the many
quote generating REST API is out there
to get my quotes for me and then write
them to the database using the admin SDK
I can also use server-side code to send
a notification to users or something
like that if I wanted to so that's what
I want to show you today how to get
started using the admin SDK to read and
write data to cloud fire store I'm going
to show you how to use the firebase
admin SDK for Java but no js' Python and
go are also supported ok let's get
started
first I need service account credentials
which I can download from the firebase
console under the firebase admin SDK tab
I'll select generate new private key
now this service account JSON file
contains sensitive information including
your service accounts private encryption
key remember to keep it confidential
never add it to version control never
put it in a client app and never store
it in a public repository I'll create a
new project and IntelliJ and I'll add
the service account credentials in my
Gradle build I'll add the dependency for
the admin SDK
I'll import the service account firebase
option step builder constructs an empty
builder I'll use this to set the
firebase credential to use to
authenticate the SDK passing the service
account credential then I'll call build
to build the firebase options instance
using these credentials finally I'll
initialize the default app instance
using firebase app dot initialize app
passing the options from firebase
options builder no but if I were using
the admin SDK on the Google cloud
platform
I can initialize the app using the
application default credentials like
this no matter how I initialize the app
I'll then initialize an instance of
cloud fire store the same way calling
admin dot fire store now that I've
initialized the admin SDK I'm ready to
get a random quote and write it to the
database but before I get coding let's
briefly examine the structure at the
quotes app at the top level I start with
a collection called sample data this
collection contains just one document
called inspiration this document will
itself have two key value pairs or we
can call them fields one called quote
and another called author now as an
aside keep in mind I'm not storing one
quote per user everybody in the world
will be altering this one document if I
were looking to save a different quote
per user
I'd probably setup a user's collection
and create a different document for each
user and again if you'd like to see how
to build this app on iOS or Android
check out Todd's fire casts on getting
started with cloud fire store now I'm
going to call function I'm calling get
quote the result of which contains
adjacent object with a random quote
there is although the function looks
something like this
all right let's generate a quote and
then add it to cloud fire store okay I'm
going to call the get quote function
which returns a hashmap
containing the quote and author alright
the quote - the inspiration doc in the
sample data collection using the set
function which sets documents data to
whatever data I pass to the function if
the document does not yet exist it will
be created keep in mind this replaces
all data in the document with the data
pass
if I wanted to update some fields or add
to the document I'd use update instead
of set once that work is complete a log
that the quote was written to the
database alright let's see this code in
action the console logs tell me that the
new quote was written successfully we
can see the quote here then in the
firebase console I can see the new quote
but personally I think it's cooler to
watch the quote change in the app so
here's the iOS version of the quotes app
with the current randomly generated
quote when I run my java app again I can
see that the quote changed in the iOS
app as well see pretty cool my
server-side code can now generate quotes
great that's sure to keep users
motivated but I may also want to be able
to read data from Cloud firestore
server-side say if I wanted to sanitize
backwards from quotes or send
notifications when new quotes are
written so let's look at getting data
from fire store first I'll create a
reference to the document holding the
quote then I'll get data from the
inspiration dock in the sample data
collection using get ok after I get the
data I'm gonna check if the document
exists then I can use the document data
for whatever my app needs such as
sending a notification and there you
have it now you know how to use Cloud
firestore for Java on your server I hope
this inspires you to incorporate the
cloud fire store and the admin SDK into
your firebase projects be sure to
subscribe to be the first to know about
new videos from firebase including fire
casts like this one thanks for watching
and I'll see you on a future episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
