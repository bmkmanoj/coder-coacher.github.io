developer advocate on the angular team
I'm Alex Turco ba I'm a software
engineer on the angular team Rob and I
work on angular mobile and making
angular a great framework for building
mobile apps and we're here to talk to
you today about these things called
progressive web apps so if you've been
at i/o at all today you've probably
heard about progressive web apps I
talked to him a little bit out in the
keynote and I think for us to understand
why we're going to talk about today and
why angular and why you should be
interested in them we should probably go
back a little bit and kind of talk about
where we came from right so in the wild
west of the web development world and
this is like what six months ago right
that everybody is kind of this is this
how we started building web apps right
so you have a browser and you have
server and you know you'd go to a
website the server would kind of
construct this whole page and it would
send it back and then you know you
decide you want to buy this widget on
whatever shopping website and then you'd
send a post back and then the server
will reconstruct another page and send
it all the way back to you and the cycle
would kind of go on and on and on right
and this worked really great for a long
time and then we discovered Ajax and we
started building these things called
single page applications the idea was
that instead of this request response
cycle over and over again we would send
down a bunch of JavaScript code with the
first page then that code would take
over and kind of run the UI for us and
if it needed data it would go and get it
via an ajax call we wouldn't send back
HTML we'd send back JSON and drop it
into the Dom right so this was a much
better world actually we had
applications that felt a lot more
interactive and faster and so the
framework that we work on kind of came
from this world you might have heard of
it anybody in here an angular developer
yes you can go that's good if you want
to and so we you know we describe
angular as this kind of super heroic
JavaScript and the W framework and we
say it's like what angular would have
been had it or said it's what HTML would
have been had we designed it for
building web apps right and so this
worked great people have built millions
of apps you know there's tons of angular
apps out in the wild you've all probably
vote one and everything was kind of
wonderful and great right like it's a
great world we live in
so we
building more and more complicated
single page applications with more
features and more bells and whistles we
ran into some problems right we're
suddenly we're pushing a lot of code to
the browser every time the application
starts up and the web really wasn't
designed to do this web pages are
supposed to be interactive it shouldn't
take ten seconds to load all this code
in yeah and so this is really why we're
here today and this is why this
oppressive Web Apps thing has become a
thing right so this is the kind of quote
from from Google developers website and
talks about I'm not going to read it to
you consider but I think that the
primary takeaway here is this idea of
the app like user experience right and
so on the angular team we've been doing
this right we've been trying to kind of
hit this goal of building really really
app like really kind of native app like
apps right and so while the web has been
evolving while these ideas of pww a's be
coming out angular's been evolving right
so we've kind of been writing this new
version of angular or angular 2 and
we've been really kind of trying to
revolve the entire framework right as
this whole web kind of thing changes we
want to keep up right and so to do that
we wanted to build one right like we
wanted to see what the experience is
like because you know funny story that a
huge amount of the angular team we don't
build apps on a day-to-day basis right
like we're building framework code but
we'd almost write apps right and we
don't always know use developers are
having to deal with and how the program
works for you right so something we want
to do and so we wanted to build this
progressive web app and really get a
feel for like what it means to make an
application really perform it what it
means to make them reliable offline
online all of these things and really
how hard it is how easy it is to make
things really immersive to really get
this good experience so we didn't just
want to build like another to do MVC or
sample application we would have build
something we'd actually use and the
angular team we get a lot of github
issues a lot yeah and some of them are
really good bug reports with you know
very reproducible and some of them are
kind of like not as high-quality so we
need some way to like go through them
and triage them quickly so we built this
thing called issue zero and if you used
inbox zero it's kind of the same
principle you go through and you like
swipe left on issues to close them when
you swipe right on them you can triage
them and apply labels and stuff like
that as Rob was saying you know we
really don't build comprehensive
applications that much so we wanted to
make sure all of this stuff
that we were like pushing would actually
work well together so from progressive
Web Apps we took this idea of an
application show we took the Service
Worker API we use firebase
authentication because it's a serverless
app we use index TV to make sure that
data is cached offline so if you don't
have a network connection it's still
load and then we use two projects with
within angular our material framework
for building really pretty beautiful UIs
and our CLI which takes care of a lot of
the build tooling for us and so the
first challenge that we wanted to see if
we addressed really well was loading the
application getting something on the
screen really quickly and so this idea
of application shell that we're using to
do this comes from progressive web apps
maybe is that you really take advantage
of what index dot HTML is index.html is
not just this place where we put all the
scripts that we want to load and all the
link tags to the CSS that we want to
load it's the very first thing that gets
sent from the web server to the phone or
to the browser so we take advantage of
it and we've put this static UI into it
this code that will render this you know
a little title bar and the menu icon and
it's not much but it tells our users its
application is alive on the page it's
loading it's working it's doing work for
you in the background to fetch data and
at the very bottom we put our script
tags loaded asynchronously and that
means that angular is loading in the
background while this while the browser
is busy rendering this page and
eventually it'll fill this application
shell with dynamic content and that
gives you a really nice beautiful
loading experience but one challenge
doing this is you kind of have this two
copies of your application you have the
static code the HTML that loads the SAP
shell and you have your dynamic
application written in angular and we
didn't want you to have to do this so we
thought what if we could use the same
primitives in angular that we use to
control what Dom appears where you know
just how you normally write an angular
app to control what would be in your
application shell and what would be in
your static application in your dynamic
application so that's what we did we
have this little show render directive
and you can apply it and say this thing
should be part of the app shell or this
thing should be excluded from the option
and so how do we do this if you've built
an angular 1 application right you kind
of know what the point in back of
angular is the ideas always been that
you write an application you talk to
angular and angular kind of handles
talking to the Dom for you right like we
don't make you do manual diet Dom
updates this has always kind of been the
magical selling point of angular writes
why we all use it but it's also kind of
the biggest crutch in in angular 1 is
that we are really tightly coupled to
the Dom so in angular 2 we had this idea
of really splitting these two ideas
apart right so now angular 2 is very
much two parts right so we have the
angular that you kind of know and love
that you speak to and that's what your
application talks to and then we have a
separate layer we call the renderer and
the renderer is actually what handles
talking to the Dom but these two pieces
are very decoupled right so we have this
kind of bridge that you speak between
the two and it means that this renderer
could be by default it's the one we use
in the Dom like we do in angular one but
it also allows us to do some very very
flexible interesting things we roll a
lot of this work under a project called
the angular universal and so the idea of
Universal is that it allows us to do
really boot up your application and
treat angular as if it was just an app
you don't have to worry that you don't
have to think that it's a browser app or
you know a web app or whatever it's just
an app and so this is an example in gulp
we're actually booting up your render
application pre rendering the content
and writing it out to disk right so this
is happening when you build your app at
the same time you're compiling your code
this means that we can take that
application shell do all the work up
front and then you can statically cache
this application ready to go on your web
server yes so that's how Universal works
to build application shell for you from
your age from your templates in HTML at
Build time but you can actually run
Universal at runtime too on your web
server so if you have a node.js server
or asp.net has a beautiful integration
with Universal you can actually when the
user requests a page instead of serving
them the JavaScript and the HTML of your
application and having angular run in
the browser you can run angular on the
server and render out the HTML that you
would
you would otherwise have displayed in
the browser and send it to the user
statically so here's an example of how
that works in a nodejs server she
written any nodejs web code you probably
looked at Express expressed as a
framework for building web servers and
node and here we're telling Express that
when it sees a request for an HTML file
it should use the Express engine from
Universal so instead of sending static
HTML bytes to the client node we'll
actually Express will actually boot up
the angular application run through and
render all your templates just as if it
were running in the browser and send the
resulting HTML to the client it's a
really powerful way of doing things and
it has a lot of benefits we've talked
about performance right getting
applications on screen fast but another
one is search engine optimization not
every web crawler out there executes
JavaScript code when it's loading your
application so if you want to have you
know if you want to be indexed really
well and have a good experience in all
the search engines out there it's really
beneficial to be able to serve static
HTML to the crawler instead of a bunch
of JavaScript that it won't understand
and that also works in your favor on
social networks if someone takes a link
to your application and shares it right
the scraper from the social network is
trying to figure out like a good image
or text extract to put in the post won't
actually know what to do with the
JavaScript either but it can understand
the static HTML that Universal produces
so this experience with Universal
running on the server works really well
across all browsers all devices but if
your user happens to be using a modern
web browser like Chrome that supports
serviceworker this experience gets even
better you can think of a serviceworker
as a little HTTP server that runs in the
browser and handles all the requests
client-side so in the serviceworker we
can actually cache all of the static
content for your application all the
JavaScript CSS HTML that makes it tick
and whenever the user opens the app
we're not serving over a network
connection slowly we're loading that
stuff from cache on the phone in
addition to the static content we
actually cast that application shell
that was built for you by universal at
Build time so that even the very first
paint running locally happen
with static content and that is really
really really fast yeah like it's crazy
crazy crazy fast so that only gets us so
far right we can get the initial load
the initial first paint working really
quickly but angular still has to
download in the background and your
application still has to download in the
background and that means we still can't
be doing things like this where we just
load too much JavaScript code before the
application can start up and so how do
we deal with this problem we break up
the application and use the router to
load code in only when it's needed so
when we start up the app we only serve
the code needed to render the home
screen if you are watching the keynote
this morning the Android in synapse
works exactly the same way they're only
serving the part of the app that's
needed for that first view and then as
you move around in the application our
router will issue requests and loading
code dynamically to keep the to keep the
application running and that too gets
even better if you have a serviceworker
not only do we catch this static content
in the application shell for small
application we can actually load all the
routes into the serviceworker cache so
that they're available just as if the
user had downloaded your whole app for a
large application we plan to have some
strategies in the serviceworker to wait
for a strong Wi-Fi connection and wait
for the user to be idle in the
application and then start prefetching
some of these things more intelligently
and we think that'll lead to a really
good experience for all sizes of
applications no matter how much
JavaScript you need so again I think
we've solved or maybe not solved with
made pretty good progress on getting
this application up and running really
quick and again being able to kind of
progressive load this application as we
go along and of course data binding is
really the magic that makes angular tick
right I think it's a big reason that all
of us use it if you haven't just you
know we'll do a quick review this would
looks like an angular 2 you know we've
got a template here we've got a little
bit of data in our controller and we
were basically just binding this repo
dot icon to the source tag of the image
and we're doing these little double
curly brace syntaxes and we're just sort
of doing some some actual text binding
there so this is really fast this is
something that angular's done for a long
time I think I don't think it's why we
all love it right
and in English we've kind of made some
change
how the change detection works so in an
angular 1 application you could get
situations where if you were doing
strange things or you're having things
that updated other things updated other
things you get this idea of a cycle
right and if you've had an angular
application that's exploded and it said
something like infinite digest cycle
right this is why so angular 2 we wanted
to solve this problem and I think we
have some angular 2 change detection
kind of runs from the top to the bottom
so your angular T your angular app is a
tree of components and we start checking
at the top and we run all the way down
run at once it's very very fast right
but if you have a situation where you
have a huge list right if you have a
thousand get up issues to get through in
your app you can get the situations
where you get bogged down right you have
a lot of stuff that has to be changed
detected and so we put an OP today shin
here excuse me an optimization in here
but we call on push change detection and
what this allows us to do is in this
case we have like an issue list and this
is going to have a lot of stuff in it
but you might be doing other stuff in
the application that's not going to
change all it often what you don't want
to do is have to repeatedly check the
bindings of this list right so we can
declare this on push change detection
strategy and what means is that when the
application does its regular change
detection cycle we'll just skip that
whole tree of components right so it
gives you a really big boost in speed
and then if you're using observables or
immutable data or anything like that you
can then just say that the application
hey this thing is ready to be dirty
checked right you get a really nice
performance from doing that and so bear
with me because this gets a little bit
technical but this is kind of my
favorite part of angular 2 I think so
in Engler one we did this idea we took
your template right and the way that
data binding works is we compile your
templates so we load them in we pull
them off the server right we were a
little bit of code in the browse in the
browser that parses these templates and
then we sort of turned them into
instructions to update the Dom so when
this bit of data changes we're going to
update the the browser Dom right it's
how it works in angular 1 again it works
really well but we wanted an angular 2
to make sure we did it better so angular
2 we have a very similar idea we have
this idea where we're taking your
templates and you know to sort of
generate these instructions from them
but again we're actually doing it at
Build time so rather than doing it in
the browser when your application boots
up we do it when you build your app with
gold program or web pack or whatever
and we generate very very very efficient
code to buy us on our team calls it
obviously fast which i think is a really
good term for it so again you get some
really big benefits it's fast right you
don't have to ship all this extra weight
to the browser things start up very very
very quickly we got this demo working
the other day this is a hello world
application so this is this is I believe
it's broadly zipped right so this
compressed and angular 1 application
excuse me an angular 2 application where
we have to ship all this extra code gets
down to 118 K what isn't bad but if we
can run the pre compile step and pull
out all this extra codes it's not
necessary we get it down to 22 kilobytes
which is pretty ridiculously small I
think there's an angular 1 itself like
the whole library around 50 it's bigger
than that yeah yeah it's bigger so Rob
loves running this offline compiler and
figuring out how small he can get
angular this is my favorite part
literally in my life that's all I do and
I meant this is my favorite part of the
offline compiler so at the top here we
have angular running in the dynamic mode
and that means we're shipping the
compiler to the browser we're
downloading all your templates all your
code in the browser and running the
compilation step there and it's not a
bad experience for developing an
application you can edit code on disk
save it refresh it shows up in the
browser it's a great way to develop but
we have this big green blob here and
this mag can't see the screen this big
green blob is actually angular compiling
your application all the work that we
have to do all the execution we have to
do in the browser before your app even
boots up and then we finally finish
compilation there's pink ribbon on the
right which shows angular actually
starting to execute your application so
that works today with the offline
compiler we get rid of that big green
blob we're no longer downloading the
compiler and running it right we don't
have to do that work when angular when
the browser loads the JavaScript that
the offline compiler produces it starts
running your app for the first line and
so it just works and it's a lot faster
and we don't even have to do the work in
the browser of parsing the JavaScript
from the compiler and that gives you
even more speed up so here the dynamic
application loads in about 500
milliseconds and whatever this trace was
captured
we're booting the static the compiled
version in about 250 so it's a really
good speed improvement so I think that
we've done the huge amount of work right
I think we've done some really really
good stuff and I think one of the big
things that we are all really excited on
the angular team is that now everybody
else can start building stuff on top of
this right and so the reason that
angular 1 was such a success is we had
this huge community people who built
really awesome tools right and I think
that for us it's now that time where we
really get to see the cool stuff come
right so if you can who watched the
keynote this morning there's this big
deal with firebase yeah whoo we've
worked with firebase for a long time
they've been really really amazing
partners if you've used angular fire in
angular one really really awesome
library we wanted to make sure that
there was an equally good experience
better experience for angular 2 so we
have angular fire to write obviously for
angular 2 angular for our two works on
their real-time database it's awesome so
it's a single thing you just drop in
your anger an angular application this
is a real-time chat in what 8 lines of
code really not a really very very
simple thing to do so that's amazing
that's part of the firebase umbrella
authentication right authentication is
super hard for for web belper super hard
for everybody right and so again in
angular fire we just drop it in you to
two bits to config you plug into your
application and then it's you know two
lines of code log in there you go super
super simple the other thing that comes
into firebase is push messaging right
firebase Cloud messaging cool so we've
never been able to do this in a browser
before right native apps can do it's
easy it's something we all do we've
never had this possibility in a web
browser before and so now with service
workers because they're running in the
background constantly all the time if
you've got access to a Service Worker
you can tell it to register for push
notifications and it will even if your
applications closed you get a push
notification it's amazing amazing stuff
this were super super excited about the
other one that we're really super
excited and deontic team talked about
this a little while ago so ionic is a is
has been an amazing partner for us thing
go on again like hundreds of thousands
of ionic South ionic apps out there they
do a really good job at you know doing
visuals of doing sort of a people in
general they
they're going to do they're going to
support progressive web apps we've been
working with them a little while on
building ionic progressive web apps so
that's going to be super super super
exciting stoked about that and this is
one thing that if you're if you're a
JavaScript developer like this is mind
blowing and if you write code in any
other language you're like why are you
talking about this but if you're a
JavaScript developer I want to show this
to you right so this is angular 2 we use
typescript write angular 2 and this is
the idea that now you have we have code
that understands itself effectively
right so this is me getting code
completion in my IDE which the first
time I got this it was like right now a
web developer I don't get this and then
when I screw up right again I get
messages I get warnings before you
compile your code before you run it it's
like hey you did something wrong and
this this is a big deal right and again
if you're if you're like an Android
developer you're like why are you
talking about this because we don't get
this it's why bill uppers right like we
don't get to do this this I think is
super super amazing so this is coming
for us now one of the really awesome
things too is the offline compiler
generates typescript right that's true
in your templates you will actually get
error messages saying oh you misspelled
something in this data binding it
doesn't actually exist on your component
yeah I spent three minutes I thought 30
minutes the other day going on
what have I broken in the compiler and
it was actually telling me no actually
you you've got something wrong in your
template and I had no idea again like
this has never happened as an angular
developer that your template is checked
and it said nope you're wrong do that so
that's coming soon very very cool so an
angular 2 you're writing these these
angular components and you're building
applications by composing them and that
works really well but there's also this
thing out there called web components
and a web component is basically a
custom Dom element that you make and add
attach some behavior to and because
they're normal Dom elements and angular
works really well with all Dom elements
they actually fit really well into an
angular application so this is a YouTube
search page that we've written it has
you know an input where we want to type
for something and a list of search
results and a YouTube player and this
YouTube player is not actually an
angular component it's a web component
that someone's written it takes a video
ID and we just bind that video ID to the
one that comes out of the search and it
just works it's awesome so
we've talked about typescript we've
talked about this compiler and in
general like the JavaScript ecosystem is
getting kind of complicated angular
works with es6 modules now there's all
kinds of compilation steps you have to
do so we really wanted to build
something that would get that out of
your way and let you focus on just
building applications and that's what
our CLI is designed to do it lets you
focus on your app and we take care of
the tooling so I'm going to show you how
that works so to start a new project
with the CLI you first npm install it
right we're all used to doing stuff like
this and you say ng new my web app and
the CLI will set up an angular
application for you with a build script
and all that and when you CD into it and
say ng serve it'll build your
application it'll start up a web browser
set up a web server open the app in the
browser and actually watch the file
system so when you edit code in your IDE
and save it it'll refresh the browser
and it'll just start executing so if you
want to start doing mobile app
development with angular we've added
this - - mobile flag to CLI and when you
say ng new - just mobile we set up the
same angular application scaffold for
you but we also add a web app manifest
so you get a really nice install to
homescreen prompt in chrome and we I
think we had meta tags for Safari as
well and if you want to
it'll also set up a serviceworker so you
can do your application will be reliable
to work offline or online it's
integrated with the build process so we
figure out what you know static content
your application has in the service were
called cache it and we set up that
application shell for you with Universal
so you can use that shell render shell
in the render and it'll generate it an
application shell for you so our CLI is
not only designed to help you start up a
project but also to live with you as you
go through the development process it'll
create your project at install
dependencies it will help you scaffold
your application so every time you're
creating new components or creating new
routes or something like that it'll set
up the boilerplate for you it'll help
you at Build time run all the
compilation process generate service
workers and manifests it helps you set
up and run tests do CSS processing and
when you're ready to deploy for
something like firebase hosting that
supports HTTP the CLI has integrations
for that too it really lives with you
throughout the development process so
this is this is the thing the thing that
is very kind of interesting and kind of
crazy to explain and I love talking
about it so again we've done a huge
amount work like we've optimized
everything that we can in angular 2
right but we are still kind of at this
disadvantage to native apps that you
know they have the ability to take
advantage of the whole application kind
of power right they've got multiple
processors and mobile devices now and as
a web developers we're used to working
in this world we have this single thread
that we can work with right we've got
one thread and we're actually sharing it
with all the work the browser ask you
painting rendering all that stuff right
and so this idea of multi-threaded web
apps is kind of crazy right and we've
had this thing called web workers for a
long long time but you probably never
use them some people do but very very
few people actually take advantage of
web workers in their applications right
and this is because they're really
really hard to work with right you have
to kind of start up a script in the
background and then you sort of like
your remote controlling your application
over this little tiny pipe right it's
really hard to work with nobody uses
them and it's kind of a shame because we
have all this power waiting just kind of
to be unlocked right so again in angular
2 we wanted to take advantage of this
and so the same tech that lets us do
server-side rendering an application
shell and all these things where we're
rendering in different contexts actually
allows to do something really
interesting so we can take your angular
application we can move the whole thing
all of your code and angular into a web
worker and then we run a very very
lightweight rendering thread basically
so your main Dom thread basically just
has a really tiny listener and all it
does is talk to the Dom and listen to
events and then transfer everything to
angular running effectively in the
background and so rather than your
applications lifecycle looking like this
where your app code is doing work and
doing work and then sharing and kind of
competing for resources with the rest of
the browser we can split it up and this
means your application kind of gets to
work free form in the backgrounds and
then that main UI thread is kept really
really clean just for render and paint
and all the things the browser needs to
do this gives you really really
incredible performance this is
experimental right like this may not be
right for every app but really I think
the point of us of this for us is that
we want to be sure that for the next
five
over ten years whatever comes down the
pipeline and the browser we're flexible
right and I think that this is the
beginning of something very very
interesting from angular and so this is
kind of close to the end of our talk
right but I think the point that we want
to get across is that this is really
just the beginning for angular 2 right
we're just coming into our release
candidate go try it out
we want to see what you guys build with
it I think it's going to be really
really exciting this whole progressive
idea right there's been a lot of talk
about it I think that it's a really
really amazing concept generally for the
web and we just want to make that as
easy as possible for everybody to get
started you know one of the things I've
heard people say is the progressive web
apps are like really good normal web
apps that get superpowers and browsers
that have all of this functionality and
angular is the super heroic JavaScript
framework so we think they go perfect
together
well so if you want to check out our
code issue zero is open source we have a
github repo here if you want to learn
more about like their serviceworker and
application shell integrations mobile
angular do has all of this content and
tomorrow there is a talk by Jules and
Cara from the angular team we're going
to tell you more generally about angular
2 that's at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow and
crater so make sure to check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
