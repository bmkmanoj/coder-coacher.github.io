to store and share data from a server
there are a lot of things that you'll
need to keep in mind setting up and
maintaining a database can be a hassle
and if you want your data synchronized
in real time or need offline support
well now you're talking some serious
time commitment but with the firebase
real time database you can get that time
back the firebase real time database
lets you store and sync data between
your users in real time this makes it
easy for your users to access their data
from a device web or mobile and it helps
your users collaborate with one another
whenever you update data in the real
time database it stores the data in the
cloud and simultaneously notifies all
interested devices in milliseconds the
real time database is also optimized for
offline use whenever a user loses their
connection the database SDK uses a local
cache on the device to serve and store
changes this means that when the user
comes back online
their local data is automatically
synchronized and how do you keep your
data secure you can use database
security rules to specify who has access
to what pieces of data and how your
database should be structured the
security rules are securely stored with
the real-time database on our servers so
if you want to make sure your users can
only access their own data or ensure
that their message is no more than 141
characters you can do that in just a few
lines of code
getting started only takes a few minutes
the firebase real time database is
hosted for you in the cloud so there's
no server maintenance or operations and
there are SDKs for Android iOS and
JavaScript to get started with the real
time database check out our QuickStart
which will get you up and running in
minutes we can't wait to see what you'll
build with firebase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
