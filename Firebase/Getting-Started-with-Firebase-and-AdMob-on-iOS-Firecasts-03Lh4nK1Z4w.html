episode of fire castes
I'm Andrew Brogdon from the mobile ads
SDK team and on today's episode I'm
going to show you how to get firebase
and AdMob working together in an iOS app
using cocoapods
first we'll link an app with firebase
then we'll download the configuration
plist file next we'll update cocoa pods
to include just the right dependencies
and then we initialize firebase alright
so step one is linking an app and we'll
do that in the AdMob console so I'll
meet you in a browser window okay so
here are the four steps for iOS and
we're gonna begin with the first linking
an AdMob app to a firebase project
there's a bunch of ways to get started
on this and I'll include a guide at the
end of this video but for now I'm just
gonna go to the analytics tab in the
AdMob console where the front-end team
has this nice get started with firebase
button when I click that I get a list of
my AdMob apps and I can click link to
firebase right here to link my app that
gets me a prompt for my apps bundle ID
which is needed for the configuration
stuff to work later
and depending on whether you've already
created a firebase project or not you
may have some choices on the next screen
here you can either link the app to one
of your existing firebase projects or
create a brand new one either way once
you're done with this screen you get one
that looks like this telling you the app
is linked so that's step one step two is
to download the plist file that contains
your firebase configuration information
which is crazy easy because the screen I
just showed you has a link right to it
right there
that'll take you to the firebase console
and start the download automatically
alright
so I've got an app linked and I've
downloaded the plist file that contains
the configuration info for my firebase
project now it's time to get the right
SDK components into my app so we'll head
into Xcode
and here's my very basic iOS app and I'm
gonna use cocoapods to get the firebase
SDK and the mobile ads SDK into it so
the first thing I need to do actually is
close Xcode and create a pod file using
pod in it there we go so I got a pod
file which I'm going to edit using vim
so everybody out there thinks I'm smart
cool inside the pod file I just need to
add two dependencies to my target first
is the firebase pod which gives me
access to basic firebase stuff like the
firebase app class which we'll see in a
second plus firebase analytics and then
a second pod for AdMob there are by
other way a ton of these pods here's a
list of the available firebase services
and the pods that go with them which you
can find in the setup guide I'll
actually link you to later but as you
can see there's a whole bunch cool so
now I do a pod install to get all my new
dependencies there we go and now I'll
open the workspace file that cocoa pods
made for me to get back into Xcode cool
so that steps one through three finished
now I just need to call firebase is
configure method when my app launches so
it's back into Xcode to start I'm going
to grab that plist file that we
downloaded earlier and I'm gonna drag it
into the root of my source tree firebase
uses this config file to store a bunch
of keys and ID kind of things that's
what the files for there we go next in
my app delegate I'm going to import the
firebase framework provided to me by the
pods and then call the configure method
in the firebase app class there we go
that configures my app at launch and
make sure that all the installed
firebase components are ready to go so
that's it I'm done with all four steps
and AdMob with firebase is ready to go
that means I can come into the view
controller for example import the
firebase framework and start playing
with AdMob classes here's a guide banner
view and you can see the type resolving
right there so you know the SDK has
properly been imported so there we go
firebase and AdMob in an app working
together and it only took a couple
minutes that's it for this fire cast
please leave your questions in the
comments below or reach out on Twitter
and G+ with the hashtag ask firebase by
the way if you like seeing videos about
mobile ads I got a whole other series
just about that it's got screencasts
feature breakdowns clones moose
repellent hairless
and sweaters you name it it's called the
mobile ads garage so if you're
interested in mobile ads check it out
in the meantime we'll be dropping a new
fire cast every few days so don't forget

to date
I'm Andrew Brogdon and thanks for
