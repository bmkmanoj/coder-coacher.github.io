where you get to meet the Googlers that
make firebase happen on the show with me
today is Alex get off Alex
okay great having you on the show thanks
for being here
now would you like to tell me what do
you do with the firebase team I'm a tech
writer and I work on firebase app
indexing real time database and the iOS
SDK okay great so if the people at home
have used the iOS SDK they've probably
encountered some of your work at some
point absolutely so tell me where are
you from I'm from San Diego originally
and then moved up here for school and
then moved back to San Diego and then
back up here okay so you've bounced
around California a bit but you're a
California natives California native
we've had on the show even though we are
filming here in Mountain View so you are
a native speaker of Spanish now this of
course makes you at least bilingual is
that right I would most find you and get
bad low pal yeah no okay so your
trilingual yeah I learned Italian in
college and studied abroad in Florence
and I've since forgotten a lot of
Italian but I still can't get by but
English is not your first language no my
parents were both from Mexico so what
they were also Spanish speakers and they
wanted me to learn Spanish at an early
age so they spoke to me in Spanish and
then they had me watch a lot of Sesame
Street and mr. Rogers and Snorks and mr.
Rogers is responsible for my cardigans
and and then my dad was a really big
believer in sort of learning grammar and
and making sure that you had a solid
foundation in language so he gave me
grammar lessons in both Spanish and
English and I was able to read and write
in both languages by the time I hit
kindergarten oh that's fascinating yeah
so that probably had a lot to do with
leading up into your career as a tech
writer that very strong background
writing real early age and then you
ended up majoring in English Lit but
that's not what you originally wanted to
do what happened there I actually went
to school thinking that I was going to
major in biochem and then Stanford has a
really great management science an
engineering major that looked really
cool and then I just really wanted to
take English classes and maybe go to law
school so I started taking more and more
English Lit classes and loved writing
and loved it and so I stuck with it okay
so you cross streams into and deliver
eventually you also didn't expect to get
into tech so how did that happen when I
graduated from from college I really
thought that like I would pursue a
writing or an editing or a publishing
career I do that for a couple years and
then go to law school but I sort of
learned HTML CSS and JavaScript and
started applying that on the job at at
the newspaper where it worked
and once the newspaper started kind of
going progressed a little bit more down
hill and layoffs were on the horizon I
started applying to more and more
writing jobs and took a tech writing job
at ESET which kind of married the skills
of writing which I had a strong
background in and my interest in tech
and my love for all things tech and I
just loved it oh that's interesting
you're formally trained as a writer but
then you had enough tech experience that
you were able to sort of merge the two
yeah so like most writers I assume you
like to read I like to read I read
mostly nonfiction and like news and and
tech articles and stuff like that so
what kind of stuff do you like to read I
like to read a lot of science fiction
and fantasy novels so huge Harry Potter
fan and then Patrick Rothfuss and his
Kingkiller Chronicle is one of my
favorites at name of the wind and Wise
Man's Fear great books okay okay so
you're a tech writer you read fantasy
that makes you what pushes you into the
dirty geeky side of things which is yeah
I'm there as well myself and so Nate
also likes to read he seems to read the
same book a lot so I know that's his
choice so I'd also like to point out on
the issue of being kind of nerdy and
geeky you were married on super pi day
now I know what that is if everyone at
home knows what that is could you
explain what that is super pi day
everything so at PI is 3.14159265 three
and then etc etc it goes on for yeah
2015 March 14th was super pi day because
it was 3.14 0.15 and my husband and I
got married at 9:26 in the morning and
we like to say it was nine 26:53 and we
got it exactly on the dot which it's
totally true so March 2015 3 14 15 and
then the time also matched I had to get
up very early in the morning yeah I'm
sure it was worth it so how did that go
the wedding was very carefully planned
we got married at Castle Rock on top of
Boulder and then we went wine-tasting
afterwards ate a lot of pie everything
was kind of like last detail was planned
and then when we went on our honeymoon
the best laid plans really didn't fall
apart on that one we were supposed to go
from Oktoberfest in Munich to Venice via
overnight train and we had booked like
sleeper compartment Oh fancy and it look
yeah looks super fancy the pamphlet made
it look amazing and our tickets and
everything was all set and we got an
email kind of at 8 p.m. and our train
was supposed to leave at 11 saying that
our stop was cancelled which was kind of
mysterious and not very important so we
went to the train station and asked it
information you never stopped it's
canceled what does that mean and the
gentleman at the information station was
like well you have to go pick it up in
size burg and you have four minutes to
get to platform ten and that's where the
train leaves from so go good hightail it
so we ran across the train station got
on the train and then it turned out that
all of the borders were actually closed
in Germany because it was during the
refugee crisis and that's why our stop
was canceled so we ended up hopping on
this train to the border of Germany in
Austria then go via bus across the
border and then wait until 2 a.m. when
the train actually left from from
cybergun Austria and the whole time that
were on this train we have really no
idea what's going on the conductor of
the train in Austria is like this is an
Austrian train and these are German
tickets you know like you stupid
American and then it turned out our
sleep
compartment and actually come over
because of the borders being closed so
we just had to kind of find a random
place to sleep and but we we made it to
Venice and and it worked and you know
it's kind of firstworldproblems yeah you
make all the plans and not everything
works out the way that you want but as a
tech writer you still you still have to
make plans and you probably have some
sort of a process involved to plan for
fire-based documentation so could you
tell me a little bit about what you do
to plan for that yeah typically when we
have a new feature is launching or an
update that's launching for a product
when you go to write documentation for
it you look at what the actual user
journey is going to be like so if I'm a
developer and I'm working with this
product or working with this feature
what is my process going through it and
then kind of documenting that try to
imagine what the user will be trying to
do or accomplish what their goal is yeah
exactly
so and then you start to think about
like other developers and like how they
would approach it and and you try to
cover from all angles and put together a
dock plan an outline of the process and
outline and the steps and then as you're
actually documenting it use the feature
use the tool a lot of times tech writers
are the ones who kind of spot really big
these your experience there is because
you're you're going through it and
you're just like this really doesn't
work this actually is kind of broken in
the product and so you can funnel that
back which is really satisfying and then
most of the time it it works really
great and and then you get to talk about
it oh that's great yeah
so I noticed that we get a lot of good
feedback about our documentation so it's
good to know who's contributing to that
now one thing that's interesting about
technical writing that you told me
earlier is that you're not allowed to
use slang words right because that's not
appropriate
like maybe you would in more or less
formal writing or you know for creative
writing you can kind of play fast and
loose with a yeah in technical writing
you can't really do that so one of the
things you told me earlier about tech
writing is that you're not really
supposed to use slang in your writing so
like for creative writing you might play
very fast and loose with the English
language but you can't really do that
for technical documentation because it
just doesn't make sense you lose readers
right so but the fact that matter is
English speakers around the world and
even within the United States use
different words for the same thing it's
just a matter of fact right it's not
that it's slang it's just that they just
use different words so it was warning if
you would play a little game with me to
explore that a little bit so I'm gonna
ask you some questions and I'll ask for
your opinion what you would say not that
it's right or wrong but we'll compare
that with to what other people in the
United States might say so let's do the
first one how do you address a group of
two or more people I'd say you guys
because I'm from California because
you're come from California just because
it sounds natural so you'd say you guys
other people might just say you or in
the South it's y'all or as you said it's
also just you guys so I think that is
what most of the US would say is you
guys very very sort of on the norm for
American speaking alright let's do the
next one
what do you call it when several roads
meet in a circle and you drive around in
that circle around about it's a
roundabout okay so you chose roundabout
that's very common in the West so right
here in California that's the West in
the East it's called a traffic circle
and in the Far Northeast it's a rotary
so I'd never really heard that word
until I lived in the Northeast think of
it oh yeah they're like rotary dial
phone exactly yeah
alright let's do the next one what do
you call a long sandwich that has cold
cuts lettuce and other toppings on a bun
a sub a sub okay so that's what most of
us would say it's a sub however in
Pennsylvania and Philadelphia in
particular it's called a hoagie also a
hero some people we use the words
grinder or torpedoes wow yeah so I had
heard most of those living at Ohio
that's where I grew up but yes sub is is
what most people would say all right
let's do the next one what apparatus
sometimes attached to a wall do you use
to get a drink of water Oh drinking
fountain drinking fountain okay drinking
fountain is again what most people would
say in the west of the United States so
here on the norm for the West in the
East in the south it's a water fountain
that's what I grew up saying mostly but
the really interesting thing is in
Wisconsin and Rhode Island it's called a
bubbler that's amazing I heard that
before
now I had a friend from Wisconsin and
she told me that and I was genuinely
shocked that's a thing okay interesting
all right next one what is the most
general term for shoes you might wear
for athletics sneakers sneakers okay so
you deviated from the norm for for
people in the West so tennis shoes is
most common in the West United States
sneakers is a very New England thing
that's what a lot of people would say
where I lived in Boston for a while and
other parts of the world you just might
say gym shoes so alright let's do
another one what is the road with
multiple lanes where traffic moves
quickly freeway freeway okay so that's a
very Western in the East it's highway
and some people would go further and say
that freeway in a highway or two
different things freeways wider than a
highway okay another one what are you
referring to when you say the city New
York New York oh that's what you mean
really okay cuz most people around here
in the area would say San Francisco yeah
but most in the United States refers to
New York as the city my husband's from
Jersey and that's a huge pet peeve of
his really that's interesting yeah so if
you yeahjust okay you can change the way
you think about it that's fine
so people who live near Boston would
also say Boston in Chicago also has a
following but uh that's interesting that
you adopted a different way of saying it
looks like you speak very much like a
West Coast ER with a few exceptions of
course so thanks for playing and thanks
