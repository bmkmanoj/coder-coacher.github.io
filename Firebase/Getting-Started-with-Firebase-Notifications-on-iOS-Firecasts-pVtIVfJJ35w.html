the firebase team and welcome to another
episode of fire casts on today's episode
I'm going to show you how you can
receive messages using firebase
notifications on iOS then you can be up
and running with this feature in just a
few minutes so let's get started the
first thing that you'll need to do is to
make sure that your app is ready for
firebase let's create a single view
application we'll call it iOS firebase
notification 1 I'll just put it on my
desktop before doing anything else I
need to close the project and open a
terminal from here I change to my
project directory and I do a pod in it
once that's complete I'll have a pod
file that I can add it in the pod file I
add the firebase core and firebase
messaging pods I then run pod install
and the SDK will be added to my project
creating a workspace from now on I just
open the workspace in firebase console
you need to link your iOS app with a
project you do this by clicking add app
within your project select add firebase
to your iOS app you then specify the
bundle identifier and optionally the App
Store ID I had done one previously so
I'll just cancel out to download the
plist select manage you'll then see a
button to download it this will give you
a Google service info.plist file you
drag this to your project in Xcode
you're now ready to get coding now that
your app is ready for firebase you're
going to need to get an Apple push
notifications token a certificate from
that and a firebase project to link it
with let's do that next you get your
APNs certificate from the Apple
Developer console select certificates
IDs and profiles if your app has been
configured for APNs you'll see your
certificate here click to download your
certificate file this can then be used
to generate a dot p12 for more details
see here once you have your certificate
you can upload it to the firebase
console select your project
pick your iOS app and select manage
select the cloud messaging tab then
select the upload certificate button and
upload your p12 now that you've set
everything up let's build a simple app
that receives messages from firebase
notifications and we can send it some
messages from the firebase console the
code to get remote notifications in iOS
is very straightforward to get a
notification do the following in your
app delegates did finish launching with
options add this code this simply
creates the settings for notifications
that you want to get and registers the
app to receive them it then initializes
firebase next you need to create a did
receive remote notification handler this
gets a user info object as a dictionary
in that there's a key called a PS and
this contains an alert value you just
read this value to get the contents of
the notification let's run it and see
I'll add a breakpoint then from firebase
console I'll create a new message I'll
send this to my iOS app and when I
return to Xcode I can see that the
breakpoint has been hit if I step
through and look at the console output
you can see that the message has been
received successfully and that's it for
this forecast please leave your
questions in the comments below or reach
out on Twitter or G+ will be dropping
new forecasts every week so don't forget
