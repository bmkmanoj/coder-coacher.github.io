secure hosting for your web app it works
with static content but that doesn't
have to be a limitation with powerful
JavaScript frameworks you can build very
rich websites using only static files
I'm Laurence Moroney and in this video
I'll show you how to use firebase
hosting to build a powerful website that
lets you view extremely high resolution
images with a very smooth zooming
experience for example here's a finished
site that I built using an image that
has 100 million pixels in it you can
visit this link to play with it for
yourself as you can see when i zoom into
her eye you can actually see what was
behind the virtual camera causing that
reflection in her eye or if i zoom into
the monitors behind her you can actually
see the text that was written on them
all of this was implemented using static
files and hosted on firebase hosting now
how would you do this first of all
you're going to need a firebase project
create that in the firebase console in
the usual way and then make sure that
you select firebase hosting and go
through the steps to deploy files to
hosting you will need the firebase
command line interface or CLI and in
order to get this you'll need NPM which
is the nodejs package manager if you
don't have this already you can get it
by following the instructions on node.js
org once you have NPM you can install
the firebase CLI on your system as part
of the firebase tools with this command
now create a directory on your
development machine and this is where
you're going to store your static files
move into that directory and run the
fire-based in its command the first
question is what you want to do with it
do you want to use firebase database
cloud functions are hosting click
hosting and then you'll be asked which
project you want to associate with
earlier in the console I created a
project called fh screencast so i'm
going to pick that the CLI will then ask
you a bunch of questions just select the
default answers to all of them note in
particular the public directory free
web files it defaults to public once the
initialization is complete take a look
in that directory there's going to be a
bunch of files in there as well as a
public folder which contains the basic
HTML files that you'll use to get
started and that's it put your static
files in the public directory and then
use the firebase deploy command and
they'll be uploaded for you let's take a
look at an example now the sea dragon
baizhu mning app that I showed earlier
on this zooming works by slicing your
image up into tiles at different zoom
levels there's a python-based tool to do
this for you you can get it here of
course you'll need an image so if you
want to use my 100 megapixel one you can
download it at this link so when you run
the tool to slice up the image you're
going to get lots of tiles and an index
file called a Dzi which is used by the
JavaScript libraries to link them all
together then all you need is a static
HTML file that uses the seadragon
javascript and which points to this Dzi
here's what the script on that page
would look like and once you have all of
that you put it in the directory and do
a firebase deploy command files will
upload to your firebase hosting space
and get deployed for you you can see in
the firebase console that previous
versions are archives if you ever need
to rollback
you can also map a domain name to it if
you want and that's it it's really that
easy to build a website manage and
deploy it on firebase and it's free if
you have any questions please leave them
