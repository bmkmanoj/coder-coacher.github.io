episode of the ask firebase show my name
is Frank or for those of you who follow
me on Twitter puff and I'm gonna be your
host for today the first question is
from Stack Overflow is from Wonka and
it's how many concurrent reads and
writes does the firebase database
support that's actually a very
interesting question Pankaj
let's have a look at the answer that I
gave and I'll sort of explain a bit
about it in firebase it's not really
about concurrent writes but you always
have to consider the number of writes
that you do in certain time interval so
say the number of writes in a second
right because any disk has a maximum
number of i/o per seconds that it can do
with the iOS as you call them the
firebase database is not different but
you are on a shared infrastructure so of
course the numbers are not guaranteed so
you might wonder what happens if you
reach your maximum number of writes per
seconds well at that moment the firebase
database will start to queue up the
writes that it can't write to disk
straight away so you'll be building a
buffer of depending writes and then if
the right volume goes down it will start
catching up with the buffer and of
course your next question is gonna be
but how do I know when this happens how
do I know that I've reached the capacity
of my database that's she really easy
you can attach a completion listener to
your write operation so if you're using
javascript then i've written an example
in the answer here and you add a
completion list name and then you can
see and if the time between when you
start the write operation and when it
completes if the time goes up then you
know that most likely you're being
buffered and you're being cute it's a
great question and it requires a bit of
code but you can definitely detect you
can sort of get a feeling for what
performance you can get and how many
write operations you can do at a time
there's been so many good questions
today maybe the next one is yours
this next question again is from Stack
Overflow and it's from a vine gallows I
think I'm not sure if I pronounced that
correctly
yes yeah that sounds about right I think
Evangelos is asking that if I retrieve
data from the database
in a certain order then the snapshots
come back in that same order is that
actually by design and that's a great
question Evangelos let's like he dive
into my Stack Overflow answer so that
you can read along as I explain why this
works the way it does this is indeed the
expected behavior when you fire a
request to the database and you fire a
bunch of requests they actually are sent
to the database over a single connection
and that's new to a lot of developers
they're not used to that right many of
us think that you fire one HTTP request
and fire another one and fire another
one but that's not how the firebase
database works
we literally have one open connection
then we simply send your first request
your next request your next request and
that's also the order in which the
server receives them the order in which
the server answers them and that
actually is the reason why you are
guaranteed to get them back in the order
in which you requested them actually
let's follow this link where I have
another answer that is sort of related
to how this works in firebase and
another consequence that you might not
realize so this was a question where it
was about if I'm requesting like 10
items in a row why can I do with
firebase the same thing that I do with
SQL which is write an SQL you would say
select star from table where ID in 1 2 3
4 5 up to 10 right you would send one
query and get 10 results but with the
firebase database that's not how it
works with my base database you actually
send 10 queries it's like give me item
one gave me item two and then all the
way up to item 10 and your initial
concern is probably that that's going to
be slower but remember what we just
talked about where all the requests are
going over a single connection and that
means that we're actually going to be
quite fast at returning these items so
if you look at the answer that I've
given here now you can see that I drew
some beautiful ASCII art there the first
one is probably how you think this works
right you ask item come from the
database request goes to the database
the database looks up the item and it
returns it and then you request item 2
so you send it to the server the
database looks it up and it returns item
2 and you continue that one until item
10 so you're gonna be waiting for the
response 10 times right that's actually
not how to fire
database works if you scroll down you
can see how our database works with
firebase database we have a single opal
connection so when you request item one
item two item three up to item 10 they
are essentially all sent to the server
immediately after each other they become
a sequence of requests that the server
retrieved us then it looks up item 1
item 2 item 3 until item 10 in the
database and it returns it to the client
which then gets them back in the same
sequence that it requested them
here's response 1 response - response 3
up - response 10 this is a concept
that's known as pipelining and it's a
part of the reason why the firebase
database is probably going to be faster
retrieving these items than you
sometimes think if you ever have a
concern about performance in the
firebase database my recommendation is
to actually run a little test because it
might be faster than what you realize
great question thank you
next question next question is from
Twitter where let's see
Danyelle tag the question with hashtag
as firebase is it possible to use
wildcards on firebase rules like write
off not equal zero altered email ends
with at company difficulty that's a
really great question then I really like
it but what I like even more is that
todd has already answered it for me
because indeed you you cannot do a like
type match with the firebase security
rules but we can do regular expressions
those are very powerful so what we do
here is that we actually write a regular
expression that does the same string
comparison I really like your use case
because in this case you're essentially
only allowing users from your company's
email domain to have access to the
firebase database you might actually
want to make sure that the email address
is verified in that case for death in
the security role you would say oh god
email verified equals true so you have
the same as you have with Alice's answer
where you use a regular expression but
then you also add off dot email verified
equals true and with that you can secure
write access to just users in your
company domain it's a great question
than you and a great answer Todd yes I
like it I have no idea do we actually
have any other questions out there maybe
one of you this next question is from
Stack Overflow again and it's from
sank so sank has a question that we get
regularly which is can I use firebase
security rules to check for unique
values of a child let's actually have a
look at the question on Stack Overflow
because it's a bit involved this one so
you can see that society wants to check
whether you're ELLs are unique in the
firebase database and the answer is well
you sort of can't so firebase cannot
check whether a value is unique because
values are yeah they are lower in the
tree but if you go one level higher in
any collection the keys in your firebase
collection are guaranteed to be unique
right if you think of the JSON tree
there's no way you can have the same key
twice under that single collection so
knowing that you can sort of flip your
collection around so what you now store
s values how about storing them as your
keys so if I look at your example you're
trying to store URLs which makes it a
bit tricky because your else contain
characters that you cannot use in your
firebase collection but if you for
example think of a collection of users
right then you could take the users
email address that quite often people
want to be unique and then instead of
storing the email address as the value
you store it in a separate collection as
the email address as the key that means
that you're guaranteed that each email
address can only occur once in that
collection you don't have to write any
code or even security rules for that it
just works automatically because you're
sort of using the firebase data model to
enforce it for you
so no code to be written now like I said
for your use case using your else that's
slightly more difficult because a URL is
quite complex to store what I would
recommend is that either you remove a
lot of those characters from your URL
and I included a function in my answer
to do that because I actually really
needed that myself also but you could
also use the hash code of the URL and
use that as the key and then you know
that since your hash codes are pretty
much statistically guaranteed to be
unique that the URL that you base that
hash code on it's also going to be
unique this is a great way to use the
inherent properties of the firebase
database to implement your use case
requiring that certain values are unique
it's a really great question I really
like it thank you so much that's all we
have time for this week if you liked
this episode be sure to LIKE and
subscribe at the bottom here because
then we can keep you up to date if you
have
it's compounds be sure to check out to
Udacity course fire base in the weekends
it's actually the most comprehensive way
you can learn about fire base for iOS
and for Android finally we have a link
here that will point you to the firebase
for sequel developer series I think
that's a great introduction for firebase
for anyone coming from a sequel slash
relational database backgrounds and if
you have any questions post them on
social media of your liking with the
hashtag ask firebase with that I'm gonna
leave you for this time around thanks
for joining I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
