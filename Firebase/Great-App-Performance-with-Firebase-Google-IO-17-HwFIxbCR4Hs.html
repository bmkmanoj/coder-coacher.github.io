have you here today I'm Nolan and I'm
the product manager for firebase app
quality and I'm a LeeAnn product manager
on firebase performance monitoring so
today we're going to talk to you about
how you can build great app performance
with firebase and our new tool
performance monitoring so a story today
starts with Jane Jane is the lead mobile
developer for an e-commerce startup and
her team have been spending the last six
months building the iOS and Android
versions of their app and now they're
finally getting ready to launch and Jane
knows it's important to release a high
quality app if you want happy customers
in fact we did a recent analysis of
Google Play Store reviews and we saw
fifty percent of all one star reviews
are mentioned stability and bugs so the
data here really speaks for itself if
you have a slow and crash Yapp your
users will notice now since Jane is
focused on building high quality apps
she's using firebase and firebase is
gonna let her test her app on a variety
of devices before launch but she knows
no amount of testing will catch all
these issues so it's important that she
monitors our app in production after
launch so we're going to do a quick
review of testing and crash tools and
then Ollie's going to do a deep dive on
performance monitoring which is why
we're all here today
now since performance is a conflated
term I want to point out that when we
say performance monitoring we're not
talking about business performance tools
firebase does have business performance
monitoring like Google Analytics or
firebase that will give you insights
into your revenue conversion metrics and
user acquisition channels but today
we're going to focus on monitoring the
code performance and speed of your
application so let's take a look at how
Jane is going to use firebase to ensure
a high quality app now the first thing
Jane needs to do is test her app before
she puts it in the hands of our users
but so far Jane hasn't any hadn't had it
hasn't had any time to write any test
scripts and she's only tested on a few
handsets that they had in development
that's where fire based test lab saves
the day so fire based test lab is a
device lab running on Google cloud that
has physical and virtual devices and
Jane can choose from a combination of
devices OS versions and even up to 172
different languages to test their applet
and we're continuously adding new
devices that are popular from around the
world to the test lab in fact today you
can even get Developer Preview oh I'm
running on a pixel device in our test
lab so you're probably thinking that you
know there's all access to all of these
devices is great but if you don't have
any test scripts and Jane doesn't then
what's she going to do about it well
this is exactly why we built Robo so
robos an intelligent app crawler that
will explore your app and attempt to
find crashes and layout issues without
writing a single line of code
Jane simply upload their apk and select
the pixel running developer Android re
Android developer preview oh and then
Robo is going to go through and crawler
application it's going to record a video
of everything that it does capture
screenshots captures the device log and
even stat traces for any crashes that
might find and this lets our sanity
check her application on a real device
that she doesn't have without writing
any code at all now Robo also powers the
pre-launch report in the Play Developer
console which is available at no cost to
all developers using the alpha beta
channels yesterday we launched a new
feature in firebase test lab that lets
you see performance metrics for all of
your test runs so whether using Robo or
your own test scripts you can get
insights into CPU memory network and
frames per second and the really great
thing about this feature is that the
metric timelines are synced with the
video that means if you see a CPU spike
or a drop in frame rates you can click
at that point in the timeline it'll seek
to that portion of the video so you can
kind of diagnose and see what's
happening now it's important to note
that fire-based test lab gives you
performance insights before you launch
and the performance monitoring that
we're going to talk about for the bulk
of our discussion today gives you
insights after you launch in production
so Jane knows that no amount of testing
that she does is going to find all of
her issues and she really needs to keep
a pulse on our app in production and
she's particularly interested in finding
crashes and you know severe issues so
she's going to use crash reporting last
year at i/o we announced firebase crash
reporting and developers love how easy
it was to get alerts into new and
redressed issues and not only that but
stack traces to help them identify the
problem now when we built this product
we really wanted to help developers not
only identify the crash but also
reproduce the crash
so we integrated with Google Analytics
for firebase so you can see exactly what
your user was doing prior to the crash
so you get an event log from everything
in your analytics prior to the crash to
see how you can actually replicate this
locally and this year we're really
excited with some even bigger news so
firebase was join forces with fabric and
we're working really hard to bring the
best of both platforms together we're
really excited about crashlytics in
particular from fabric because it's the
leading crash reporting tool on the
market used by over 500,000 developers
and we're going to be bringing it to the
firebase community that means you're
going to get the entire crashlytics
experience right from the firebase
console so if you're thinking about
innovating a new crash reporting tool we
recommend crashlytics but if you use
firebase crash reporting you don't have
to worry we're going to continue to
support that we'll upgrade you
seamlessly when the time when we're
ready
so James an early adopter she wants the
latest and greatest she's going to use
crashlytics and install the fabric SDK
and finally Jane wants to understand
what parts of her app are slow and why
so these are often the hardest problems
to diagnose and even harder in
production so she's going to use
firebase performance monitoring alright
so let's get to the fun part
in this demo we're going to see how Jane
uses firebase performance monitoring to
progressively enhance their app over the
course of a month in some cases James
going to use out-of-the-box capabilities
like networking sites and apps startup
time and in others we'll see how she
uses custom instrumentation to find a
solution and with that take it away
ollie
thank you all right so we'll get back to
Jane in a second but before we do that
it's probably a good idea to mention why
we build firebase performance monitoring
and quite simply the problem we're
solving here is that the world has a
short attention span we already know
this from the web the longer page
low-stakes the more likely for users to
bounce but with mobile we're actually
seeing this just as much if not even
more as a matter of fact 60% of
five-star reviews we see on play make a
mention of speed design or usability so
we know that good performance is
critical for our success the other
reason we were excited to build
performance monitoring is that it turns
out to be an interesting problem from a
technical perspective and one that is
more challenging than doing the same on
the web with the web we have page loads
and page will sent the map quite well to
user actions so anytime you get a
business or sorry a performance metric
you kind of have a good way of mapping
into what the user was doing on your
website mobile on the other hand is a
bit of a black box so even if you have
performance metrics it's a difficult job
to understand what was happening at the
time you took that metric so we set a
challenge for ourselves to build
something that not only gets you a lot
of data but a lot of data that is
contextual and the results was firebase
performance monitoring we were super
excited to announce that yesterday in
the keynote it's available to everybody
in beta and the SDK supports both iOS
and Android and as we build this SDK we
wanted to accomplish a couple of things
first of all we wanted to make it super
simple to install so if you're on iOS
you get the cocoa pods if you're on
Android you pick up the Gradle plug-in
off you go and even if you do just that
you get a lot of value out of the box
data like network and app start and
we'll see an example of that but if you
want to instrument things that are
specific to your implementation we also
give you as the KPIs that allow
to do just that and that's the SDK the
other part of performance monitoring is
a beautiful console that we built to
allow you to dig into the issues and
understand performance metrics from the
point of view of your user so going back
to Jane and the absolute vision that she
builds and this video generalizes to any
kind of app out there we think that
performance issues that can impact you
as a developer fall under one of two
buckets the first one has to do with
your ass growth performance so this is
things like what kind of delays your
users see as they interact with the app
or how much frame drops they see in the
animations and so on and to monitor that
we build a feature called traces the
other category of issues is about
network activity between your apps and
the backends that it uses whether it's
your own back end or backends or
third-party SDKs you have in your app
and for that we monitor Network requests
so let's get started with stretches
first the easiest way to define a trace
is it's a performance report between two
points in your app so imagine you have a
record one and a stub button and in
between these two points you just pick
up metrics right so these two points can
be anything in your apps anything that
you care about anything is worth
monitoring so it could be something like
the time between the user taps on one of
the shoes until they see the full
product details page it could be as
fine-grained as a database fest to get a
piece of string and put it on the screen
or it could be as long as the full
checkout flow right it could be between
the time the user taps on the checkout
icon until they fully purchase the item
it's really up to you all you need to do
is create a trace name or a trace object
give it a name start it and stop it and
that name you give it becomes your
context so now which when you're looking
at metrics you understand what was
happening in the app at that time in
terms of metrics by default you get the
trace duration so how how much time took
place between the start and the stop
so essentially you can use it as a timer
but it's actually more than that because
you can attach custom metrics using our
counter API which you see an example of
here
so here think of any example of
countable events that are relevant to
your performance how many times we call
the local disk how many times you call
the GPS how many times you drop the
frame how many times you made a network
call and so on any one of these events
you can just give it a name you can
count it increment it and we'll tell you
of those events and report them as
custom metrics attached to your space so
this gives you an idea on how to
instrument your own traces encounters
but even if you don't do this and just
install the SDK you still get a few
out-of-the-box traces the most important
one being app start this is the time
between the app code starts loading
until the app is responsive to the user
and we also have a trace that monitors
the foreground session so any time the
app is available to the user and we do
the same for the background as well and
that's racist nicely simple all right
so network is even more simple because
you don't need to write any code it all
comes out of the box will monitor HTTP
and HTTPS requests that your ass makes
between the time they are sent from the
app until their response is fully
received and when we do that we report a
bunch of metrics including response time
including the requests and response
payload size and success rate where
success here means any request that
comes out and comes back with an HTTP
code that is not a 400 or 500 go and
then for any of these metrics network or
traces you have the ability to slice and
dice the data by the app version which
device the user was using which country
they were in and so on and this is
really helpful to eliminate variables
and to understand the contributing
factors for some of these issues
actually the best way to explain this
would be to get back to Jane and talk
about how she used performance
monitoring over the course of four weeks
to get rid a lot of performance issues
and fix them very very quickly so we're
going to do this by monitoring what she
does on her iOS app and so far the only
thing that Jane has done is install the
performance monitoring SDK and used the
out-of-the-box capabilities so she did
not write any code okay so
on the first week
Jane gives up for the first major
release so so far she's been building a
bunch of experimental releases and this
is the week she releases version 1.0 and
the e-commerce actually works on
operates in the u.s. in Canada and we're
off to a rocky start
we have a bunch of to star reviews and
the complaints that we get the music
seems to be about app start is just
taking too long some people are getting
frustrated and are given up on the app
so the first thing she does is jump into
the firebase console you can switch to
the council please perfect and she check
out checks out the brand new performance
section in firebase and the first thing
she sees the dashboard tab so this here
gives you high-level data form for both
traces and network aggregated for the
app and keep in mind she hasn't written
any code so all the data you see here is
out of the box so let's take a look and
see what we see the first cards here
gives us the most frequent races so in
this case the out-of-the-box ones app
and foreground background and app starts
an app start has a median latency or
duration of more than three seconds so
that does seem to be a bit high we'll
get back to this but let's keep going
next one here shows me the network
success rate now we always want this to
be 100% but when we start saying 400 and
500 that line goes down and I can
actually hover or some of these points
to see what the success rate for an
individual day was like next card here
is network latency by country and since
we only have data from the US and Canada
we see that on the map and if I hover
over it the u.s. is about one second
Canada is even less than that so we're
good on this one everything is in with
their normal normal ranges the next one
here is a card that gives me the
breakdown of network volume based on
mine sites and you can see that the blue
here is represented by images which
makes sense it's an e-commerce app and
there's a lot of images here so it makes
sense that the majority of my natural
volume is images and the last cards here
shows me a comparison of app starts I'm
version over version now this is
interesting here
I see that v 1.0 which is the latest
release changes put outs has a much
higher absurd duration than the previous
ones so by the way what you see here is
the dark dot is the median and then the
lighter blue line around this is the
range of percentiles from 59 v and i can
actually hover over it and see what it
looks like so sorry I can see that my
95th percentile here is about 7 seconds
which is very very high now this is
useful information and so far this is a
strong indication that something went
wrong in this version but how do I know
that there's no other contributing
factors if I actually click on view a
star duration I get a breakdown of this
metric by different slices by different
dimensions so I see how AB star duration
compares version over version in
different devices countries and so on
and this allows me to understand that
there's anything that stands out and
again you see the median and you see the
percentiles around it so I already know
that V 1.0 is much higher for absurd
duration if I look at device here I can
see that the iPhone 6 is a bit higher
but this is expected it's an all the
device is going to be added slower so
let me keep going here country is
comparable OS level is kind of
comparable so it's carrier ok so at this
point Jane knows that to fix the a start
issue she has to do something about v1
point 0 so that's enough information if
we jump back into the codes and get the
side please thank you she takes a look
and realizes that there's a blocking
call here to load a bunch of cash items
there's no good reason for this to be
made as a blocking call so she switches
this to an asynchronous dispatch and
that they scared the issue go all right
so she passes up the six releases
version 1.1 and this is the end of our
first week now the second week is a
pretty interesting one this is the week
we spend our operations to India which
means new users and new behavior so the
first thing Jane does is jump back into
the console
and she takes a look to see how things
are so first thing she looks at is a
start seems like the median is a bit
down that's a good sign and if I scroll
down here I can see that one point one
has a much lower or shorter app starts
than one point zero so it looks like we
fix this issue this is great news the
bad news is that now that we have some
data from India it seems like Network
latency is very high if I hover over it
I see a 7.2 second median latency so
this is definitely high so how do I
investigate this I'm going to go ahead
and click on the network request stub
and when I do that I see a bunch of URL
patterns right I see a call to and lytx
service I see a bunch of back-end
services for fetching images for the
product that's touching product details
adding something to the cart and so on
and by the way anytime you see one of
these asterisks it means that there's a
dynamic fast segment in the URL so it
could be something like an ID what we do
is collapse all these IDs into the same
URL pattern so when you see a metric you
see it's based on the level of the
backend functionality as opposed to
looking at individual URLs all right so
for each one of these URL parameters you
get the response time you get the
success rate and you get how many
requests we have actually collected and
if you look closely here you see that
there's a couple of warning icons one of
them is complaining about latency here
it says that we recommend to keep our
response time under two seconds and the
other one says that my success rate is
below 90% and that this is problematic
in fact I can see that my success rate
here is 87% for the checkout service now
this is unexpected
so I need to investigate a little bit
more so I'm going to go ahead and click
on the URL and I get a bunch of metrics
we talked about this so you get the
response time payload size and you also
get the success rate and if I click on
View more not only do I get a breakdown
of the dimensions like we saw for the
trace for the app starts race but I also
get a card here that gives me a
breakdown of 400 errors and 500 errors
so this way I can understand what's
caused the failure so I can see that out
of my approximately 12% failures a very
tiny basis for
hundred heirs the majority of the heirs
are 500 including 500 503 Spyro twos and
so on and the vast majority of those is
500 I can also scroll through the
dimensions to see if there is anything
that stands out so so far it seems like
my success rate is pretty evenly
distributed uh-huh
but if I look at country I can see that
all these failures are coming from India
the success rate is zero okay so this
gives me a lot of information it's 500
errors that I need to fix and they are
happening only in India so and by the
way I can switch to the overtime version
of this data I see the same metrics only
by time slices so I see how they change
over the last 30 days and I can see that
my 500 errors in blue here spiked around
the same time Jane released her
operations to India so that confirms the
theory that I had great now if I click
back the network and look at the other
warning that complains that my latency
is too low or too high I think that this
has also something to do with my users
from India because I didn't see this
before but the way I can confirm this is
by filtering by the country so here any
of the dimensions that we collect you're
a you're actually able to filter by them
so I'm going to go ahead and choose
country India and now I see the same
data only filtered by Indian users and I
can see that the image service is way
way way higher it's about 20 seconds on
median that's obviously something we
need to fix all right so this is a lot
of information we have a couple of
problems we need to fix here so we'll
switch back to the codes and Jane takes
a look at the 500 server error in this
case she realizes that she mishandled
the Indian locales Hindi which is the
predominant locale in India was
misspelled so that's an easy fix this is
good she goes ahead and fixes that and
for there was slow response time she
realizes that the way she's getting
images for those products is using her
own service and the actual server sits
in the US now this was fine for North
American users but for Indian users is
not going to cut it so what she does is
instead use
firebase hosting which gives you a CDN
and takes care of edge caching for you
so you don't have to worry about that
she goes ahead and puts the assets on
the CDN she switches the URL called the
called the firebase hosting service and
that takes care of that issue and she
packages up all these fixes releases
version 1.2 and that's the end of week 3
now week 4 sorry that was the end of
week 2 now we see we're seeing things
starting to get better so we're seeing
four star reviews but there's one issue
here there's this Indian user
his name is Nitin and he seems to be a
bit upset that he's 50 percent or 15
megabytes of his data plan on this app
now keep in mind data is expensive in
India so there's something that we can
fix about this so Jane gets concerned
about this switches back to the console
to see if there's anything that can help
her with that and she realizes that we
have this card here that gives you a
breakdown of your network volume by my
site and we already know that the
breakdown tells us that the vast
majority or that leaves the majority of
our data is images and this current
hasn't changed in the last few days even
more actually so at this point she
realizes that she has a problem all
these images she touches in the app she
never stored them locally she doesn't
catch them and this is a problem for
e-commerce apps so imagine that you're a
user on one of these apps and you want
to compare a bunch of products you're
likely to switch back and forth between
the same taejun's
and fetch the same images there's no
good reason to keep going back to the
city and to fetch it every time so she
realizes that she needs that logic so
let's switch back to the code now the
first thing that she needs to figure out
is the cache size right we're going to
essentially build a cache on the local
device and she starts by doing something
like this she hard-code the cache size
to 20 megabytes now this is okay but
there's a problem with this what if you
realize a couple days later that this is
not the optimal cache size and it should
be 25 megabytes instead now you have to
redo the same thing you have to release
a new add version you have to wait for
people to pick up the latest version
it's inefficient instead what she does
is she uses remote config which allows
you to set up
to set a parameter in the console you
can set the value for it edit it and you
can just publish it and it gets picked
up by your app so this is a much much
better way to do it so she she switches
to the console and now we're using
remote config instead we're going to add
a new parameter give it a name cache
size and give it a value of zero to
start with so it's as if we don't have
any caching okay
we'll add the parameter publish the
changes and that was it okay so this
parameter is set now switching back to
the code again instead of the hard
coding J and changes code so that she
reads the value from remote config and
that takes care of the cache size we can
tweak that layer now she adds the logic
to do the caching on the device and that
takes care of the implementation of the
feature itself but how do I know that
this is running efficiently I need to
monitor this so what Jane does is create
a custom trace in this case so she
creates a new trace give the name image
fetch she started before this logic
started after and then within the
caching logic itself she does a couple
things she creates one counter called
the cache hit and this gets incremented
any time we find the image we're looking
for on the local device and then she
creates another counter called the cache
misses and this gets and this gets
incremented any time we don't find the
image we want on the local device and we
have to go get it from the TDM okay so
this takes care of the monitoring and
this is all the code that she needs
ready to monitor this so she goes ahead
packages up the latest code and ships
version 1.3
now week 4 we want to check on things so
Jane goes ahead and jumps back to the
console grace we can see that India's
not slow anymore so this is fixed but
since we just added a brand-new trace
we'll go ahead and click on the traces
tab so here I see the ones that come out
of the box but I also see the image
fetch 1 which is a brand new
instrumented resets Jane added so I'll
click on this and I get the duration
metric which I always get but I also get
the counters here as metric
so cash hits and cache misses are there
and as we would expect there's no cash
hits because the cash side is zero so
Jane goes to remote config and now
editors value makes it 20 megabytes
instead updates it publishes the changes
and she left a few hours go by so that
this change is propagated to the phones
and that we have enough data on
performance and then when she switches
back this zero here for cache hits when
she refreshes the next time is not a
zero anymore we're starting to see cache
hits and in fact if I switch to overtime
I can see that my cache hits are going
up my cache misses are going down so
this is the direction we want to take
and just like that she starts tweaking
the value of the cache size to find the
optimal use for most of her users
without having to ever released a new ad
version we switch back to the slides
please so people start noticing this and
they notice that the performance is
getting much better and they start
sending amazing reviews and Jane is so
happy look at the smile okay so
hopefully by now you get an idea of why
it's important to use performance
modeling and the kind of things that you
do with it and I think one of the key
advantages to having something like this
is that it makes you aware of your blind
spots the kind of issues that you have
in your app that you wouldn't
necessarily expect and this is something
that we see with our partners all the
time I'll give you an example this one
is based out of China WPS office is a
popular Auto office productivity app in
Asia and they use firebase performance
monitoring and using the network
monitoring feature realize that one of
their ads banners takes more than 2.4
seconds to load which is way higher than
they had expected they optimize this by
20% and they see an increase in their
click-through ratios by 3 to 5 times
think about this kind of impact all they
had to do was install the SDK and they
got this much increase in CTRs I'll give
you another example gasps this is a chat
app based out of Indonesia they use
performance monitoring and realize that
one of their biggest performance
bottlenecks is the opening of the chat
window it's a point five seconds in
something
something they did not expect they
optimized it and because of that they
have a much better user experience so
this allows you to do things like this
but it also opens up the possibilities
for things that weren't possible before
this is one of my favorite examples is
the Senate which is a video ad based in
Turkey even though they haven't been
using performance martyring for a long
time they already have customized
treatments for their users based on the
combination of device and OS level this
is the kind of thing that would have
been difficult in the past but because
of the insights and the deep insights he
gets in the console you can do this kind
of things and there's many other
examples we've been actually working
with our partners from around the globe
big ass and small apps that make sure
that what we have here is useful and
it's something that is going to add
value to your everyday development and
that is it so recapping here we thought
about a qualtiy today we talked about
why it's so important and why we care
deeply care about it in firebase we
talked about the test stage of things
and how you can use Tesla for Android so
that you can squash these bugs before
you get out into production we also
talked about how you can use crash
reporting in production and keep an eye
on stability we showed some exciting
news about joining forces with
crashlytics
and finally with like a deep dive on
performance monitoring and we saw how
jane used it to turn around her app and
go from two star ratings to five star
ratings again performance monitoring is
