when you get to meet the Googlers that
make firebase happen my name is Doug
Stephenson and we have a very special
show today
last week at Google i/o 2017 thousands
of developers descended on Shoreline
Amphitheatre and as part of that they
get to hang out with the Googlers that
make some of the products they're
interested in if you weren't able to
make it
that's okay we've got great news for you
today because we've taken our camera
crews out to catch up with some of the
Googlers that make firebase happen let's
take a look hey everybody my name is
Doug Stephenson I'm coding Doug on
Twitter and I'm here at Google i/o it's
day 2 and I'm in the firebase sandbox
and my mission here today is defining
the Googlers that make firebase happen
why don't you come along with me
how's eioping going for you so far I
opened great this is one of my favorite
things to do every year I've been des
and attendee but I'm here as staff for
the first time which is so cool I love
hanging out with the Android community a
lot of friends here I only see at i/o
and so like a long awesome party oh I
was great the weather is great like I've
had a lot of great conversations with
people a lot of good feedback I'm
excited to take that and help enhance
our product it's a really exciting event
a lot of energy I just got off stage the
adrenaline is still flowing and I'm
really juiced up and pumped up what sort
of announcements are you most excited
about it IO today oh there's been so
much sensor flow hardware and Google
home with in firebase enhancements to
analytics are really exciting some of
the things that I've personally worked
on or firebase Cloud messaging a ton of
different things that's that's all
really exciting all happening all at
once thanks for chatting with me John
right on what's your experience been at
i/o so far but it's amazing the clock-in
announcement obviously took all
developers I really hood excitements I'm
really looking forward to working with
the communities on that I gave my talk
this morning and so I'm excited to see
the other talks I just came back from
0to app which was super exciting
it's been fun it's been a very exciting
meeting all the developers for the first
time and even meeting all the five races
I didn't know the team was a big it is
pretty big team yeah what announcements
at i/o are you most excited about today
I'm really excited about all the new
releases about android ole and firebase
especially now firebase past lab has the
sports for games
I'm so excited one of my personal
favorites was like where all the battery
performance improvements are making with
Android I I'm in that user group at 4
p.m. I have battery anxiety every day
the Kotlin announcement was also super
exciting anything from a developer
really terms and a developer products
point of view just lots of exciting work
ahead for that so what's that on your
arm there oh this is a firebase headband
that I'm wearing around my wrist that
would be good to represent both the
fabric in the firebase brand so yeah
awesome
I'm really excited about all the
announcements around fabric and firebase
crashlytics is going to be the main
crash reporting tool that's recommended
going forward it's been great being at
the the fabric booth and seeing the
excitement when you actually get to talk
to the customers
so what announcements here at I are you
most excited about well I think I ablaze
test lab the games is a really great
product we've been trying it out with
one of our sample games make a ham stuff
and you know it's just great results out
of the box so we're able to be able to
demo a test loop for the game and then
once you've run the game we got FPS
state a bag like frame rate they are we
ended up getting a memory usage CPU
utilization back and determining whether
or not really quickly whether the game
would crash crash or not and so it was
really good yeah it sounds like to be
very helpful for developers so what's
your experience been like at i/o so far
it's been great I had a talk just this
morning and that was with my friends
Posten and Mike huff Frank Frank and
what was your talk about our talk with
our live timing demo where we coded on
web iOS and Android gen actually ported
it to Colin last night after the
announcement that call him out supported
so it was a lot of fun so what's this
game over here what's going on this game
is a cooperative game in which three
people have to work together to fly a
spaceship they answer trivia questions
in order to get more fuel and they have
to dodge dodge the asteroids which is
why they keep yelling blast okay that
sounds very interesting I think I want
to play it and how is it built it was
built using firebase imagine that
what's your experience been in IO so far
today so far I've been manning apps just
three thousand our fire based game and
it has been absolutely amazing we've had
people coming in flying rocket ships all
sorts of craziness
what announcement at IO are you most
excited about today I'm actually really
excited about one of the new hosting and
functions innovations that we announced
so if you have HTTP functions from
Google Cloud functions for firebase you
can put those behind farter by toasting
get caching and get all sorts of cool
new features there and that's super
exciting yeah I'm definitely gonna give
that a try after IO is over what kind of
announcement if I are you most excited
about today oh I'm excited about I guess
all of our firebase and testing
announcements like we announced new
performance metrics I think that's
really cool where you can see you know
we do a video every time we do a crawl
or run one of your like espresso or UI
Automator tests and now you can see in
that video like where are their
performance issues with memory or with
CPU you know exactly what's happening
I'm sure they'll be very helpful for
developers so it's been pretty great you
know basically geek Christmas it's my
first IO ever and I've been wanting to
come here for a long time I'm pretty dad
it has been fantastic for me I think
from a product management perspective
it's really an awesome opportunity get
to talk with our users so I've actually
ended up learning quite a bit quite a
bit of things today what are you most
excited about well for the iOS community
is like we are open sourcing a lot of
the part by size DK and which is very
very exciting and benefit a lot of
external developers I think ok Google
let me talk - I owe photobooth well it
was really great catching up with the
team thanks for watching and be sure to
subscribe right here to the firebase
