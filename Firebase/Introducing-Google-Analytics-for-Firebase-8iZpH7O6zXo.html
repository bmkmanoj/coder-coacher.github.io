SPEAKER 1: Analytics--
we all know
they're important to building
a successful app, which
is why there are many different
kinds of analytics tools
for app developers to use.
There are in-app
behavioral analytics,
which measure who your users
are, what they're doing,
and so on.
And then you've got
attribution analytics,
which you can use to
measure the effectiveness
of your advertising and
other growth campaigns, not
to mention push notification
analytics and crash reporting.
But quite often,
this work is being
done by completely different
analytics libraries, which
means you've got reports
living in various tools
across the web.
And trying to understand trends
across these different reports,
much less get them to talk to
each other, isn't always easy.
That's why we've created
Google Analytics for Firebase.
It's built from the ground
up, to provide all the data
that mobile app developers
need in one easy place.
And it starts by giving you
free and unlimited logging
and reporting.
That's right.
No quotas, no sampling, and
no paid tier to worry about.
Simply by installing
the Firebase SDK,
Analytics automatically
starts providing insight
into your app.
You receive
demographic information
on who your users are, how
regularly they use your app,
how much time they spend
there, and how much
they've spent in your app.
But not all apps are alike.
And you can get
detailed information
about what your users
are up to by logging
events specific to your app.
These can include common
events that Google Analytics
for Firebase has
already defined,
like when your users add
an item to their cart.
And then there's support
for custom events
you create yourself, like
when a user completes
a workout in your fitness
app, or when they take
a selfie in your photo app.
Cheese!
But it's not just about seeing
what your users are doing,
it's also about discovering
who your users are.
So in addition to
demographic information,
you can discover how
your different users
behave differently by setting
custom user properties.
Have a music app
and want to find out
whether your classical music
fans are browsing more albums
than your jazz fusion bands?
That's the kind of data you
can easily break out, thanks
to custom user properties.
And Google Analytics
for Firebase
doesn't just measure what's
happening inside your app.
It lets you combine your
behavioral reporting,
what your users are doing,
with attribution reporting,
or what growth campaigns
are bringing people
to your app in the first place.
So if you want to know which
ad campaigns are bringing you
users who spend the most
money, or are sharing
the app with their
friends, or have unlocked
the last level in your game
and are ready for the sequel,
you can do all of that in
Google Analytics for Firebase.
But don't stop there.
Once you have all
this information,
you can take action
on it using Audiences.
Google Analytics for
Firebase gives you
the power to build up groups
of users, or audiences, out
of just about anything you
can measure in your app.
Want to target users in Brazil
who have visited the sports
section of your in-app store?
It's as easy as a few clicks
in the Firebase console.
Once your app has
built up this audience,
you can then send
them notifications,
using Firebase
Notifications, or you
can modify their
in-app experience,
using Firebase Remote Config.
Or you can target them through
Adwords, Google's ad platform.
And then, because
that impact can
be measured using
Google Analytics,
you can confirm you're getting
the outcomes you expect.
Google Analytics
for Firebase already
comes with a dashboard
that lets you view
answers for common questions.
But if you need more
specialized analysis,
you can export all your data
into BigQuery, Google's data
warehouse in the cloud, where
you can run super fast SQL
queries to slice and dice
this data however you'd like.
You can even combine it
with other analytics data
that you might be capturing.
And this is just the
tip of the iceberg
of what Google Analytics
for Firebase can do for you.
