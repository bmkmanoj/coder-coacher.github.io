SPEAKER: Analytics are
great for knowing what
people have done in your app.
But there are some
things you might want
to know before they happen.
Wouldn't it be great
to anticipate which
users are likely to churn--
when they disengage
with using your app,
and an app a user
is disengaged with
is one that's forgotten
about, and then possibly
one that gets
uninstalled in future?
Or wouldn't it be
great to know which
users are likely to make an
in-app purchase, or the users
who are not likely
to make one, so you
can come up with a
strategy to build
a best experience for both?
Nobody can read the future.
But based on their
past behavior,
we can create a
machine-learned model
that can predict
what users might do.
You can identify which users
might stop using your app,
so you can then
personalize your app
for them using Remote Config
to offer them something that
reengages them with
your app or rewards them
for being a valuable customer.
And not only that, but
predictions refresh daily,
so you can continue to
personalize your experience.
Beyond churning, another metric
that's really nice to know
ahead of time is which users
are likely to spend money
in your app and
which ones aren't.
This can help you decide
what to do with these users
to help you stay profitable
while optimizing their user
experience.
So for example, the
gamer who is predicted
to make an in-app purchase
can continue playing,
but the one who isn't
likely to make one
could get a rewarded ad
between levels instead.
Not only that, but if
you use custom conversion
events in your
app's analytics, You
can do a prediction
of these, too.
So for example, if your
app sends notifications
to its users and
you track this, you
can then predict
which users are not
going to interact
with the notification
and simply not
send notifications
to them in future.
That's Firebase
Predictions, built
on Google machine learning to
let you anticipate your user's
behavior.
