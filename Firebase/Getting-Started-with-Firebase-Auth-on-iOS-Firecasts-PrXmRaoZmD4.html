here from the firebase team and welcome
to another episode of fire casts on
today's episode I'm going to show you
how to sign in with Google using
firebase off on iOS and from that you'll
see how to sign in with other providers
- you'll be up and running with this
feature in just a few minutes so let's
get started first we'll have to make
sure that your development environment
is set up to get started with firebase
in iOS create a new app in Xcode make it
a single view app and give it a product
name click through to create it and here
you can see it's on my desktop using
terminal go to the project folder and do
the pod init command you'll see a pod
file is created edit this pod file to
add the required firebase components I'm
just using firebase slash core for this
demo
once you're done run the pod install
command and the components will be
downloaded and added to an XC workspace
work with this from now on
don't use the Xcode project I'll
remember the bundle identifier you're
going to need that on the firebase
console on here choose an existing
project or add a new one by specifying
its name once you've created your
project you can add an app to it to add
an iOS app just specify the bundle ID a
plist file will be downloaded to your
machine you can drag and drop this into
your app folder you now have everything
you need
to get started with firebase on iOS
great now that you have a working
development environment set up the next
steps will be to build a simple app that
lets you sign in with Google and iOS
you'll import the required files create
simple views set up the required custom
URL schemes and then finally code a
simple view with a sign-in button that
signs into Google and tells your app the
ID of the signed in person before you
can start coding your iOS app you'll
need to ensure that it's associated with
your firebase project on the console
you'll see it look for the little iOS
icon here you'll also need to ensure
that you've enabled the correct off
providers
to do this enter the auth section select
sign-in method and enable the desired
one here you can see I have Google
enabled as my sign-in method now let's
take a look at the code in Xcode if
you've set your project up correctly
you'll see a bunch of pods in the pod
folder on your info tab you need to
ensure that your URL schemes are set up
properly you can see them here on the
URL types the first one can be gotten
from the plist file that you got on the
firebase console you can see it in your
project here pick the reversed client ID
for the URL scheme as you can see here
the second one is just a bundle name and
that's easy to remember the storyboard
should have a view representing your
sign-in button you can't see this in the
designer but put a view on there and
take a look at the custom class to
ensure that it's the GID sign-in button
for signing out just use a generic
button and in the view controller you
can add an action to the button for sign
out clicked also add outlets for both
buttons and specify that the view
controller is a GID sign-in delegate so
on the view controller at South onload
we do all the setup specifying the
client ID and the delegates for the
different sign-in methods once the user
signs in you'll get the did sign in for
user callback if there are no errors it
gets the credentials from the user and
turns them into a firebase off
credential this is then used to sign in
to firebase and once it's successfully
signed in we'll get a user object back
we then generate a simple alert box
picking the display name from that user
object and showing it for signing out we
have an action which is called sign out
clicked and on that we create a firebase
author object and call sign out on it
let's see this in action the app is
running on the emulator and we can see
the button chrome has been created for
us at run time when we sign in we're
taken to the accounts google.com page
where I can sign in with my familiar
Googler account I specify my username
and password and then sign in and ask
for permissions for what to access and
if I allow that I'm signed in return to
the app and then the flow happens
my name is extracted and it's displayed
in the alert dialog
it's really as simple as that if I click
sign out I get signed out successfully
but if I sign in again I've already gone
through the credential flow so I just
signed directly into the app that's
firebase off sign in Made Easy there you
go
you've just built your first app that
signs in with Google and iOS in just a
few minutes now you're ready to
personalize your app or add other
service providers such as Facebook
github and more and that's it for this
