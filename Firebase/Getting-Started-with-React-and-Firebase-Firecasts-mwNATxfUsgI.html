episode of fire cast we're going to be
going over react and firebase and just
as a reminder this is just one episode
of an entire playlist of firebase in the
web so make sure to subscribe if you
want to keep up to date but today we're
going to be using the create react app
command line tool to freshly start a
brand new react app and then include
firebase so let's get started so to get
started with firebase and reacts I'm
going to use the create react app
command line tool and this tool is
created by members of the react team and
it's seriously one of the easiest if not
the easiest way I've ever gotten up and
running with react because all you have
to do is install the module globally and
then it's just one command to kick off a
new app so let's go to the command line
and type NPM install dash G create react
app so I already have this module
installed on my machine so I'm going to
skip this step but once you're done all
you have to do is type create react app
and then the name of your project so I'm
calling mine firebase react starter but
obviously you can use whatever name you
want and once you're done you hit enter
it's going to tell you that it's
installing packages and that this might
take a couple of minutes and in my
experience yeah this could take a bit so
get comfortable all right so all
installed now so all you have to do is
CD into the project to created so this
project gets generated with a local
development server that has hot
reloading enabled by default so to kick
that off all you have to do is type NPM
start so this will kick you out to your
default browser at port 3,000 and give
us this default page with this react
spinning logo then I'm just going to
stare at and we're back ok now that
that's done let's install firebase so
I'm going to go back to the terminal and
rather than killing my local server
I'm actually just going to open up a new
tab and install firebase so to install
firebase I'm going to do NPM install
firebase - - save and once that's done
I'm going to open up my editor so as a
web developer your first instinct might
be to open up index.html and here you're
going to look for a script file so where
is the react library and you might
notice that it's nowhere to be found on
this page and that's because this
project setup uses module bundling with
web pack so if you go out to the browser
you can see that there actually is a
script tag that gets injected during the
build process and this script is called
bundle j/s because it's all of your code
bundled into one file and that is done
through the magic of web pack and you
want to learn more about web pack I have
a link to the project in the description
so when you're using webpack projects
one file is the entry point and it is
usually either the index J or the main
J's file so we're going to click here
into index J s and you can see that it
has some syntax that some of you might
not be familiar with and that's this
import from syntax so a lot of you are
probably familiar with using the window
to attach objects too so an es2015 land
using the window isn't the preferred way
it's preferred is that you actually
import from these files rather than just
pulling them off this global window
object so you might be wondering how
does this app know where these files
live because these aren't like file
paths or anything and that is also what
webpack does for you underneath the hood
so web pack will take all of these
import statements and it will bundle
them into one file so anything imported
will be bundled so what that means is if
we go and import star as firebase from
firebase
it will automatically be included into
our bundled JavaScript file so with
firebase imported all we have to do is
type firebase initialize app and then
provide our config which you can get
from the firebase console and at this
point you are 100,000 percent ready to
get started with your react in firebase
app so as you can see using the create
react app command line tool makes it
really easy to get started and that's
all for this tutorial but if you want to
learn more make sure you stay tuned
because we're going to be doing another
firebase in react screencast that
actually builds upon this one it's going
to show you how react state management
works perfectly with the firebase
databases real time data synchronization
