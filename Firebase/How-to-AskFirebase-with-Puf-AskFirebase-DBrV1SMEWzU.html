to record bossy bossy bossy thank you so
much for being my first guest on this
new season of ask firebase and I brought
you here specifically because you answer
more questions than anybody else I know
on stackoverflow yeah when I first
started trying to get my score up and
answer some questions it's a challenge I
had to find the hours where you are
sleeping so I can get some points go
feel like typing and if like someone has
already answered this all refreshing you
mark your fingers to the pulse of
firebase and the questions that people
have now because this is ask firebase
I'm going to start by asking a question
that I have which is how did you end up
being part of the firebase team I
started out actually
and when firebase was in beta for the
first time and I started out as a user
of firebase as a developer using
firebase and then flow found that other
developers have questions about how to
use firebase so in my weekends I started
answering those questions I remember
very proudly the first time that one of
the firebase team members actually
complimented me on one of my answers
saying that's a great answer for any
campus like and one thing led to another
I kept answering questions and then a
year later they reach out to me and
asked if I wanted to join the team and
become a firebase or and I still answer
a lot of questions on Stack Overflow I
mean that's a remarkable story I think
that what we really want in order to be
able to answer your questions is you
know talk a little bit about how to ask
great questions so you know you really
increase your chances of getting your
question yes sir I often explain that's
the best way to ensure that you get help
is to make it easy for for us to help
you not just me but everyone who's who
is helping people on Stack Overflow and
that is a few basic rules that you want
to normally follow one of them for me is
always like and you have to describe
what the problem is that you have right
so what's to behavior that you see what
did you expect to see right so I see a I
expected
and sometimes I also want to know why
you think what you expected to see is
better but let's ignore that mostly it's
like what did you see what did you
expect to see very important they're
supposed to show the codes that
reproduces what you saw it could be most
often it's code when it's on Stack
Overflow cos it's a programming site it
could also be the steps to reproduce
like I clicked on this button in the
console and something happened that I
did not expect right when it comes to
code very important to give us a small
snippet of code that is definitely a
challenge I remember when I was getting
my nano degree from Udacity you don't
have questions it's my first inclination
was just like here's the link to my
github repo so figuring out the minimal
code to show to get your question
answered can take some practice know for
sure yeah it's a very common problem
actually right because you probably as a
developer when you are reaching out to
stack overflow right you you have been
trying to solve this problem for a bit
already and you're you've been stuck at
it so you're probably frustrated you've
spent time on it already but realized
that the person you're asking for help
has not Dave haven't suffered along with
you and right the easier you make it for
them to help you the more likely you are
to get help so and take a few steps back
from the problem where you are stuck and
try to reproduce actually the problem in
a minimal amount of code so if you have
the time and really consider if you
shouldn't make the time do file new
project and recreate just the problem in
the minimal amount of code this is what
it's called in Stack Overflow and MCV a
minimal complete verifiable example and
it means that the bus must be mouth both
minimal and complete right so don't just
take five lines from your entire program
and say here's the crux of it because
most likely that's not where the problem
is the problem is most likely in this
bit before and after it oh yeah when it
comes to the questions that I love to
answer and Stack Overflow if we're
talking specifically about let's say iOS
because that's definitely my jam I love
when I can just put it into a playground
if I can take your code and put it into
a playground and run it and that's gonna
make it much easier for me to help out
yeah I do a lot of JavaScript so Jay has
been is my playground and I just today
call
beat some code from stackoverflow
question into a J's bin and I was just
playing with it actually as we came into
the studio so I hope to figure that one
out later today okay so far we have that
we want to have what happened and what
you expected to happen and the minimal
steps our code to reproduce it yeah do
you know other things that you like
seeing in questions I like to see a
question mark oh I know that sounds
silly but sometimes I'll get to the end
of something and realize that I'm not
sure what the question is so you know
sometimes if I'm asking a question I
want to make sure that I get to the end
and I'm like if someone looked at this
really quickly would they know what I
was asking so if you have a question
mark then you know you're on the right
track to have your question no that's
that's actually a really good one we see
this Christ often and on Stack Overflow
write your question might get closed
sometimes and one of the reasons is it's
unclear what you're asking and a fairly
common reason for that is because there
is not really a question in there or
maybe there are 20 questions in there
and it's like yeah we can't really
answer 20 questions efficiently so try
to indeed make sure that the question is
clear and that it's it's a limited scope
of question and especially the title or
the subject of your of your question is
really important for that one of the
things I sometimes see is that people
right almost use it for tagging the
question it's like it's Android studio
it's Oreo it's firebase database and
real-time updates like yeah that's not a
title that's a list of tanks right and
we have a tagging system for that so all
good but move that into the tags now
write a question into the first part you
see oh yeah so that's it yeah if your
title is a question then I guess you're
yes off to a good start when it comes
specifically to ask firebase the kind of
questions that I love to answer are you
know ones that we can do mostly visually
so something like how would I use this
product in this setting or is it
possible to do something yeah for me
some of my personal favorites are how
does something work right I don't
understand because I actually often when
the question comes in don't know how it
works and then I get to dive into the
code or talk to the engineers and get
the answer from them so I learn a lot
from those questions
I love that our developers are so
excited to know when the next products
are coming out we do get a lot of those
questions but they're not going to get
answers no time lines no commitments
is it very unfortunate but standard to
answer it so certainly sometimes there
are questions that go beyond the realm
of something you want from a stack
overflow maybe the answer don't ask
firebase how do we know if something
belongs to support we'll put a link
below as well so you can find out how to
access that yeah that's a good question
I have to say that not every problem is
a good question for Stack Overflow right
and some of those are things like
certainly your app stops working with
firebase and you see all kinds of error
messages and you didn't change really
anything you didn't deploy a new version
yeah
chances that this is really related to
your code or small right so it's better
to actually first check the highway
Status page to see if there's a known
outage and if there isn't reach out to
firebase reports because they might know
more of what is going on and they can
also dive deeper into into seeing what
for your specific project might be going
on there oh yeah that's a really valid
point so if something was working and
suddenly it's not that would be a good
time to escalate it to support they will
of course still ask you to create one of
those minimal complete verifiable
examples that reproduces it but that's
mostly once they figured out that there
is no outage going on but but just reach
out if you're uncertain about something
like that because right your app being
down is something that we definitely
didn't want to take seriously and it's
not something that's well served on a
site like Stack Overflow or what about
maybe if there is a big change in the
usage of your app even though you didn't
change anything so maybe you had a
function that was only running a couple
times but now it seems to be running
like a whole lot more might that be
something you'd want to escalate as well
yeah for sure yeah we actually see those
regularly right where indeed there's a
sudden spike in usage and as a developer
you can't explain it now first start
asking around because what we see quite
often is that it's one of the other
developers on your team that might
certainly be running an administrative
process every night right that could be
but if you can't find it reach out to
firebase
or because they can see the statistics
of your project on a more like broader
level and so they might see it's like
huh we see this happening since that
date and it happens every four hours
that typically points to a back-end
process on your site most likely but
it's still something that we can help
you find so these are things that a
stack of flow is not going to be helpful
for you because the people on
stackoverflow right the other developers
that you're asking for help don't have
that information right can access your
No so um you might still end up with Jen
and me essentially but it will be
something that is purely focused on
helping you troubleshoot your project
instead of helping you with a
programming problem that anyone might
encounter great thanks so much for
coming on I couldn't think of a better
person to come talk about asking great
questions yep for sure and keep in mind
that right now that you know how you can
ask a better question on Stack Overflow
that means that you're gonna be asking a
better question next time it also means
that we can help more people on Stack
Overflow use firebase and that's what
we're all here for remember you don't
just have to ask questions if you know
the answer to a question you sure it's
more asteroids because who knows you
might be the next person answering
questions on the last probably base I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
