how's it going welcome to another
episode of ask firebase I'm your host
Jim person and today my co-host is
Laurence Moroney and we're gonna answer
your burning firebase questions okay
shall we just burning firebase questions
yeah get it I love a good fun I'd never
thought of that one myself
welcome to the show thanks for coming on
and answering some questions with me
today I'll do what I can let's see what
our developers are asking about let's
scroll scrolls let's start with this one
vibe of puke on YouTube asks if I am a
beginner to firebase let's assume should
I start with fire store or the real time
database well that's a really good
question I love that question the easy
on sense of that question is it depends
because it's like it really depends on
what you want to do yeah and you know
the piece of advice that I usually give
is that if you're used to existing
databases like relational databases
those kind of things that have you know
tables and indexes and structures and
that kind of thing it's probably less of
a bump for you to go straight to fire
store because it has that kind of
document collection thing if you don't
have existing database knowledge or if
you're used to like you know working
with data and JSON documents as like a
lot of web developers you know for them
real-time DB is just the perfect fit
absolutely you know having had past
experience with JSON documents if it
felt just really comfortable first
learning real-time database and it was
actually kind of fun to learn you know
all about D normalization so either of
them you can start with right they're
both very very easy they both work like
effectively in real time for me like I
come from a relational database
background so it was like kind of square
peg round hole for me to start using
real time DB but then I got to really
enjoy that but now that I'm going back
to like the firestore type stuff I'm
actually having a lot of fun with it
like querying and documents and all that
yeah yeah oh and we you know we have
code labs for both of them
so you could why not both yeah why not
both and they're both code labs you can
do like a half a day right yes I spend
half a day doing both of them and then
choose what suits you sounds good
what so let's see what we got next
keep going is okay we're gonna do this
one so our next question comes to us
from Twitter and Andrew Walpole wants to
know any way to link a single user too
often to multiple fire rates products so
the same user across multiple firebase
projects right now no right but there is
probably one thing you could do I'm
guessing what your scenario is and that
is like you have the you want to be able
to sign the user into multiple
applications and these multiple
applications each one is built with a
particular firebase project so if you
sign your user up and you're at they're
using like the Google ID and you're
using smart lock for passwords once
they've signed in the first time then
subsequent sign ins are invisible so you
could actually build it and like so they
sign in using their gmail ID like a
Google ID and then once you've like
there's a simple API for you to store
that in smart lock for passwords and
then subsequent times they open they
sign in right away so you can kind of
get the same effect like if you've got
10 apps you sign into one you're in you
sign into the next one your any sign
into the next one you're in and then
subsequent times you open them you're
just directly in so while it's not the
single user being synchronized across
multiple firebase projects we don't
support that yet at least you can have a
good user experience for a user being
able to sign into multiple applications
that you've built but I really like
getting these kind of questions too
because it shows us a lot about things
developers want to do with firebase and
gives us a good direction for the
project so like these are great great
questions that people have yeah and
that's how we drive the direction of our
products absolutely we can learn as much
from you as hopefully you can learn from
us great the next question comes from
actually from oofy who I was sitting
next to during the firebase dev summit
oh you were yeah yeah so hi where can I
find out more info on firebase and gdpr
this question comes up a lot from our
developers especially anyone who wants
to have their app in Europe yes it's
important to have that kind of
protection right so I know Francis MA
spoke a little bit about it during the
keynote at the firebase summit and I
believe there's there's a website and I
think we have a link in the comments but
oh yeah look at that now magically we
have a link so yes where can you find
out more
in the links below so the next question
comes to us from Stack Overflow and it's
pretty long one so I'll just summarize
that essentially we have a developer who
wants users of the app to be able to
submit quotes anonymously but they don't
want just anybody to be able to you
access that data they just want you know
users of the app so they want to know
how can they protect that without
forcing people to sign in yeah so we do
have the concept of anonymous users yes
that's what I was thinking exactly I'm
wondering if we could do something like
that so the idea behind an anonymous
user is that the user entity is still
treated as they are a user within the
database so security rules can be
applied to them that type of thing so
you know so they don't need to sign in
with a username and password or anything
like that but security rules can still
be applied to the concept of an
anonymous user so I think that kind of
thing might be able to be used yeah I
think that makes sense to me because not
every app necessarily needs to hold on
to so much of the users information but
it's still a good idea to be able to
know who's using your app so that's
where the idea of anonymous off is
really useful and I think this would be
a great way to make sure that not
anybody is using your app yeah yeah and
I'm another great use that we have for
anonymous off is that a lot of times you
want to give data to users of your
application who are signed in but you
don't want them to sign up before they
can have an experience of using your
application because if you ask people to
sign up they may go away so the idea is
that you can have one set of data from
your application that's available to
anonymous users and in another set of
data that's available to signed-in users
so now the anonymous users will get that
experience both when they're signed out
and after sorry before they sign up and
then after they sign up when they get
both sets when they're actually signed
in right yeah so you can actually
convert that too right so once they sign
in as a let's say with email and
password you can hold on to that data
exactly exactly so that's like kind of
for trial they did that type of stuff
because I mean how many times have you
gotten an app all right and it asks you
to give all your personal information
before you can even use the app and now
you destroyed it
exactly so it's like that's the one of
the cool things about this is like maybe
I don't know if it's a sports
application or something like that and
you want to see scores you don't need to
sign up
to be able to see the scores but if you
want to go into some details and like
see a box score or you know see details
of the players or something like that
then you have to sign up at least you've
had a like an experience before you sign
up for it and you know that's what
anonymous authentication gives you it's
pretty cool
absolutely I use that a lot when I'm
testing things are trying to answer
questions from Stack Overflow like again
if I have my firebase project that I'm
just testing things out on it's so nice
to just be able to do anonymous off
because I don't have to set up a whole
authentication scheme and all these
views that I'm not necessarily gonna use
I just boom be authenticated and still
know that's the data isn't just publicly
available so I have a question about a
new product firebase predictions and
you're my go-to guy for that so I would
like to know is it possible to set up a
prediction for any kind of analytics
event oh I see that's a really good
question because it can be a little bit
confusing the type of predictions you
would set up with before conversion
events rather than any analytics event
and a conversion event is something that
you can define manually so technically
it can be any analytics event but it
will only be the ones that you define is
a conversion event and the reason for
that is pretty obvious when you think
about it and that there are you want to
be able to predict the major things in
an application lifecycle so for example
if you're building a game and the game
has n levels but you realize that once
the user has played three levels they're
going to be hooked and they're gonna
play the game for the rest of the time
then it's a case of you would say once
they pass level three I'm gonna set that
as a conversion event and then I want to
predict you know which users are going
to hit that or many ways more
importantly which users are not going to
hit that and the ones that aren't going
to hit that then I can provide some kind
of encouragement for them to keep
playing the game until they hit that and
then once they've hit that I know
they're gonna continue playing the game
forever got it so you'd want to set up
some conversion events those would be
the major happenings in your app that
keep a user yeah the exact keeps them
engaged and it's just it's it's a little
switch that you hit on the far base
console for that analytic this is easy
as that I mean that sounds great I am
super excited about predictions I mean
that makes so much of the developers
work so much easier you don't have to
guess yeah what a time to be alive Oh
yeah we're on getting started yeah well
Lawrence thank you so much for coming on
and answering some of these firebase
questions with me always a pleasure
thank you and thanks for all the
questions if you have a firebase
question make sure that you post it on
social media or Stack Overflow with the
hashtag ask firebase and maybe you'll
see it on a future episode and if it's a
really difficult one don't tag me you
were tagged in one of those questions
yeah all right thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you next time see
ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
