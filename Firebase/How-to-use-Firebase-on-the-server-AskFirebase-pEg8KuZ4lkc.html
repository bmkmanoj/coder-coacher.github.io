this pattern you're using in firebase
might be killing you tonight at 11:00
what's up everybody welcome back to a
brand new episode of hashtag ask
firebase the show where we answer all of
your firebase related questions and just
as a reminder to you that we're having a
super duper awesome firebase developer
summit in Berlin on November 7th there's
going to be firebase team members there
and we have exciting product updates for
you make sure to stay tuned you can
check out the link in the description
for more I'm now adequately caffeinated
so let's answer some questions oh it's a
question this question comes from sander
on twitter and sander asks since when
does firebase hosting support htv-2 and
sander you can use http/2 today for
those of you don't know what http/2 is
it is the new version of the HTTP
protocol and it has a lot of seriously
awesome benefits one of them is the fact
that you can request multiple things
over one connection which is a huge
upgrade over HTTP one where you need one
connection per request and that really
speeds up your website and another thing
that firebase hosting supports is also
HDV to push what HDB to push allows you
to do is to proactively push assets down
to the browser cache so when the web
page loads it's already in there and it
doesn't have to go out and make the load
on the server and this seriously can
increase the load time of your web page
so sander if you want to get started
with firebase hosting in HDB - you can
do that today check out our blog post
the link is in the description great
question hey let's go answer another
question let me just do a shake it off
again it's not here but
Danielle on Twitter asks is there a way
to link a transaction event with the
products added to the cart in firebase
analytics well Danielle you can log
those parameters in the e-commerce
purchase event but for now bigquery is
really the only way you can get
reporting on it but rest assured we are
working hard on making the firebase
console better for that in the future
and if you want to learn more about
bigquery and firebase analytics you
should check out a blog post by Google
cloud developer advocate Sarah Robinson
who helps you learn how you can use
bigquery and Google Analytics to better
understand the data in your app the link
for that is in the description great
question Danielle I have a question to
answer
Ronnie asks is calling the database
observer over and over again on the
server-side a good idea and Rhoni yes it
is a good idea and it's totally expected
using the real-time database on this
server is really really powerful if you
want to connect out to your own back-end
or if you want to do a custom
long-living process the real-time
database sdk on the server is the choice
for you let's take a look at some code
right here so right here what we're
doing is we're going to build a chat
apps where we want to translate messages
to another language so right here the
first thing we're doing is we're getting
the node module that allows us to
integrate with Google Translate and then
on the next two lines we're going to
create references to list of messages in
our database so the first one is a list
of English messages and the second one
is a list of Spanish messages what we
want to do is you want to create a
real-time observer for whenever a new
English message is added so we can do
the on child edit event for our English
messages ref and every single time we
get a new message will unwrap the
snapshot and will pass its value into
the Google Translate API and then after
the Google Translate API does its
business expects us out the translated
messages so we can just push that to the
Spanish messages list and this will work
every single time someone adds a new
message to the list
yes Roni it's totally fine to have the
observer called over and over again and
it's also completely expected if you
want to learn more about using the
real-time database SDK on the server
check out the link to our documentation
that will help you get started great
question Roni
acting the people of the city need me to
answer their questions
cat ass hey hashtag ask firebase what
are the benefits of passing an activity
to a success listener on a task that's
returned from a firebase API well cat
you would pass that activity to the
success listener because when a user
leaves the activity it automatically
gets unregistered for you that means you
don't have to do anything which is
awesome what this does is this helps
prevent activity links this is a really
great practice to follow if you want to
learn more about how you can do that
with all the different firebase SDKs you
should check out a blog post series
called being a firebase taskmaster which
is written by Doug Stevenson and that's
on the official firebase blog so if you
want to read that the link is in the
description so cat you pass the activity
to the success listener and it
automatically gets unregistered for you
great question so that's all the
questions that we have this week if you
want your question answered make sure to
send us a tweet or go on YouTube or sack
overflow just leave the hashtag s
firebase and we'll try to get to it also
remember that the firebase dev summit in
Berlin on November 7th is happening
check out the link in the description
