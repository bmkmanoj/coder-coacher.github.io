Stevenson I am here to tell you about
how you can use firebase in your apps so
if you've seen so far throughout the
conference you noticed that firebase is
made up of a bunch of different
components you're free to pick and
choose any one of them that you want so
some people are interested in database
others and analytics you have this
amazing set of tools to use to build
your app you're free to use any one of
them pick and choose or you can use the
whole thing but what I'd like to tell
you today is that firebase is actually
an integrated unified mobile center
development platform with tools to help
you grow develop and earn money from
your mobile app there are 15 components
in total they are meant to work well
together if you adopt many of them
you'll find that the components have a
certain way of working well together 13
of these are part of the core fire based
platform to or what we call integration
so there's standalone products that are
have been modified and changed to work
well with a fire based platform now this
is some feedback received I put it in
quotes it's not actual feedback this is
sort of like aggregate feedback I've
been talking to developers all day
yesterday and the day before everyone's
been saying how much they love it
especially some of our early access
partners some of our partners have been
wholeheartedly adopting the firebase
platform for their apps and I'll give
you some more specific feedback about
that later but that's why my voice is a
little bit hoarse today I've been
talking to so many people who have
wonderful things to say and they've been
experimenting with it doing code labs
putting components in their apps and I
would like to tell you about a couple
app ideas I have and how firebase can be
used to build those out so my first idea
I've experiment with this little idea
called ride-sharing I don't know if this
would ever take off but my app idea is a
ride-sharing app called you got ride and
that name doesn't refer to anything in
particular but let's see how could we
build this with firebase well the first
thing you probably want to do is have
ios and android app this is a
mobile-first app there's an app for
driver so if you're a driver you
probably want to find out where our
passengers identify them locate them go
get them and take them where they're
going if you're a passenger you want to
hail a ride you want to find a driver to
get you where you're going so that's a
basic ride-sharing app crazy idea right
so the first thing you probably want to
do is get users logged into your app it
would be kind of crazy to have a
ride-sharing app where anonymous drivers
are giving peep to like anonymous people
that seems like a recipe for disaster
you probably want to get people logged
in and identified so they can have some
assurance that you know this this is
totally legit thing so you can do that
with firebase authentication people can
get logged in with minimal friction and
it's a federated login system so we'll
accept Google+ logins facebook twitter
and github of course regular email and
password and if you bring your own
authentication you can integrate that as
well now the good thing about this is
that once we have users identity we can
access their profile pictures so that
that can be used to help drivers locate
passengers and passengers locate drivers
but if the profile picture is
appropriate or missing what you can do
is you can use firebase storage to
provide a place for people to take
pictures of themselves and store that in
places so once you have a profile
picture stored then you can use that to
help drivers and passengers find each
other now firebase storage is built on
top of Google Cloud storage and as such
it scales to petabytes of storage now
petabytes was kind of a weird word it's
big right well that roughly translates
to billions of photos so you'll never
run out of space when you need it now
you probably want drivers to be able to
locate passengers wherever they are so
if a passenger happens to move that
driver needs to respond to that so what
you can do is you can use firebase
real-time database to write the users
latitude and longitude their coordinates
into the real-time database and then the
driver can actually receive that in real
time so you can think of like data going
into the cloud into the database and
being distributed in real time to those
who are listening to it so not only can
drivers pay attention to passengers
location the passengers can also see
where a driver is this is great this
makes for a great experience it gives
you some assurance that things are going
according to plan now if you're using a
indication along with the database and
storage what you can do is set up rules
so that the day
you store in your database and in your
file storage can be protected by
authentication roles and you write those
rules yourself you can determine who can
see what other content so you can be
sure that your passengers are drivers
data is secure and stored safely now you
probably don't want to be glued to your
app all the time so imagine you're a
passenger and your and you've hailed a
ride and the ride is like 10 minutes
away you don't want to stare at your app
for 10 minutes waiting for the driver to
arrive so what you can do is allow the
user to put the app away and then send a
message to them when the driver gets
here and you can use firebase Cloud
messaging for that so with firebase
Cloud messaging you can get users back
into your app at the time something is
important to them so for a passenger
when the driver arrives they'll need to
know that you can send them a
notification likewise if you're a driver
you might want to know where passengers
are if there's a passenger nearby who
wants a ride you could get a
notification for that as well now it's
worth noting these are event-driven
notifications so firebase Cloud
messaging is great for times when
there's something in the system to
change and you need to know about that
in the app there's a different kind of
notification called firebase
notifications and what this gives you is
a way to type in messages and send them
to your users in the console so in the
console you can say I don't know remind
users if they haven't used the app in a
while or you can say advertising
promotions so if you have twenty percent
off rides you can send a notification to
everyone and get them back into the app
now if you're trying to perform an
experiment you might want to you might
want to figure out you know is early
authentication better or as late
authentication better we do want our
users authenticated but you want to know
the right time in the app to get users
authenticated so a lot of people might
turn away if there's early
authentication they might you know not
want to bother with that so you might
want to experiment and say well I'll
test out early authentication and I'll
test out late authentication after the
user has sort of poked around in the app
a little bit and if you want to know
which works better you can use remote
can fire base remote config to perform
that experiment so you're essentially
doing an a/b test and this is a great
way to find out how your app works
better for your users now you probably
want to get the word out about your app
so the best way to do that is to hook
into relevance
searches so on Google know people might
be searching for say a taxi or airport
transportation in this case you can use
Google Adwords along with firebase to
hook into those search results and have
your app up here it's essentially a
relevant ad in search results to get
people into your app at the time that
they're looking for it another way to
get users into your app is with dynamic
links so you can think of a dynamic link
as a bridge between your web content and
your mobile content it's pretty easy to
get web traffic that we've been doing
that for a long time it's easy to hook
into searches that way everyone knows
how to use a web browser but you might
want to push people into your mobile app
for that unique experience so dynamic
links can do that it's great for
marketing promotions with a dynamic link
you can say have a special link that
people will follow then that links
directly into the app for a first time
experience that keeps them engaged and
also if they don't have the app
installed what dynamic links will do is
get you installed into the app and then
after that it will take them again
directly the content now in the past
deep links always had the problem of not
being able to survive this installation
problem process but with dynamic links
now you can you can get users installed
and directly to the content that you
want and now there's firebase invites
which is built on top of that this lets
happy users invite other happy users
this is word-of-mouth marketing this is
like the best way to get users because
glowing reviews from your from your
happy users are more likely to create
retention for the users that they refer
now invites are built on top of dynamic
links you get all the power of dynamic
links with the personalization that an
invitation gives and we found that this
increases retention drastically the last
component I'd like to talk about for
this app for the for the ride-sharing
app is analytics now analytics is the
core component this is the thing that
ties together the rest of the fire based
platform so with analytics the you know
the obvious benefit is that you can know
how your how your app is being used and
it's worth noting this is an all new and
it looks component this is not a remake
or rehash of something else this is
built specifically for firebase for
mobile applications you can know how
people are using your app you can also
measure the efficacy of your AdWords and
your invitations know how you know use
are in our interacting with your app
from external sources and it works
really well with notifications as well
so now with analytics you can define an
audience of users who you want to target
so say you want to target everyone who
took a ride in Boston say in the last
week or two now you can get them to get
back into your app and type a
notification and say hey we you know we
hope you enjoyed your ride would you
consider taking another one so that's
ten components I I promised 15 I showed
15 up here we only talked about 10 now
that's a lot of components this is a
great way to start building out a
ride-sharing app but what about the
other five components what do we have so
I have a second app idea and it's
totally unique it's a recipe sharing app
and I call it I chef I'm actually really
bad taking up mobile app names but run
with me with this so imagine you have an
app that's I Android iOS and mobile web
and desktop web your your scattering
your app as far as you can you're trying
to reach as many people as possible you
generally want your app to be used
anonymously so if people are just doing
regular web searches they might login or
they're not logged in yet but what
they'll do is find a recipe you know
search for other recipes enjoy the app
anonymously but if you want someone to
help like integrate their own recipes
into your app you might want to get them
logged in so that's how this app works
so the first thing obviously you'll need
a place to store all of your recipe data
right so you can use firebase real-time
database for that now it's worth noting
that recipes aren't really real time
there's nothing like terribly dynamic
like once you've created a recipe and
put its data in there it's not going to
change there's nothing really real-time
about it now firebase real-time database
can't handle that but which you can do
with real-time databases you could say
create a real-time chat associated with
each and every recipe so that everyone
who logs in can talk about it with their
friends and with the person who created
the recipe make your website and your
mobile app much more dynamic and much
more interactive is that a word
interactable interactive I think
interactive is a better word now of
course you want people who are
submitting recipes to take pictures of
their of their recipe may be at various
stages so you
want people to upload photos so you can
do that with firebase storage like I
said fire based storage scales massively
and you'll never worry about space again
now for the website of things you know
if you have a mobile app you generally
don't worry about deployment the app is
deployed on the user device but for web
apps you need a way to get your static
content out there so you have HTML CSS
and JavaScript all of that can be served
through firebase hosting firebase
hosting gives you a way to deploy your
static content out into the world in a
CDN over SSL so everything is SSL
protected certificates are deployed
automatically and you don't have to
worry about it there's a simple
command-line interface to deploy as
often as you want now it's also worth
noting that if you if there are some
graphical assets say that you don't want
to package into your Android or iOS app
you could also deploy those the firebase
hosting and then load those as needed so
that can shrink down your original apk
size if you're an Android developer or
the iOS app can also be shrunk down now
this is important in in parts of the
world where there's not very much you
know data the bandwidth is very low so
having a small initial app size is very
important deploy the rest of your
content onto hosting and load it on
demand now of course you do want to get
people logged in an authentication can
do that now what what advantage does
authentication provide well you're
essentially encouraging people to join
in and be social site login you know
have an identity have a space within
your app let them interact with each
other now you can do things like user to
user communications you can store
specific data per user so if users want
to favorite recipes you can store that
within their space if users want to
follow other recipe creators they can do
that you can store information about
them and help them navigate your app
better now I was trying to figure out
how might I use firebase Cloud messaging
so it's a it's an event-driven messaging
system but how might you use it in an
app like this well there's kind of an
unsung feature in Cloud messaging when
you send a cloud message it doesn't
actually have to contain text of a
message you want someone to read what
you could do is use cloud messaging to
ping the app to say hey there's new
content you should load this you should
cash it so that when the user opens it
up they
fresh content so for example if you have
a user logged in and they have favorited
some other users they want to know when
they've updated new recipes you can ping
the app the users app can say oh I have
new content I'm going to download it
cash it so that when they open it the
recipes are all there they don't have to
wait for this makes for a very pleasant
and a much more natural experience than
opening up and waiting for the content
that they were hoping to find now again
you can use remote config for more
things than just a be testing so let's
say you have you're doing a massive
redesign of your website so everything's
changing the look the feel the colors
the whole experience and you want to
launch this all at the same time for all
your users at say during like a
television event or some marketing push
and it's important that it's all
available right at the same time well in
the past you might have had to say
publish a new app to the app store and
wait for approval same thing with the
Play Store the Play Store doesn't give
you a guarantee about when that app hits
the market so it's been kind of hard to
make sure everyone gets the experience
that you wanted at the same time well
with remote remote config what you can
do is essentially create a switch in the
dashboard to say I want to switch from
the old experience to the new experience
immediately so you can be sure that
everyone who's using your app gets the
experience you want at the time that you
want it and as a side benefit if
something goes wrong with that new
experience say it you know it's causing
the app to crash what you can do is turn
it off right you can revert features
that are having problems with the flip
of a switch now for apps like I chef
that has content on the web and on
mobile apps and they're parallel right
you're generally looking at the same
thing in both iOS Android in the web you
can use app indexing and the advantage
to using app indexing is that Google
will naturally scan all of your web
content and index it and make it easily
searchable but you can use a penny to
get content in your mobile apps indexed
as well so all you have to do is write a
few simple rules to say how your web
content maps into your mobile content
and app indexing will now let users do
searches and link directly into your
mobile app deeply into the recipes that
they're looking for
if they're on Android they go to the
android app iOS to iOS and web the web
so it makes for a more much more
seamless and easy to use experience also
there's a benefit of knowing that usage
within your app actually promotes its
rankings within Google so if you have
active mobile users you can be sure that
that activity will help the ranking
within your overall search results now
with dynamic links one thing you can do
is link between the mobile version and
your web version so again like I said
it's really easy to draw traffic to your
website but what if you want to push
people into into the mobile app what you
can do is say if someone's looking at a
recipe in the mobile view and you want
someone if you want them to go into your
iOS app simply provide a link on the web
page to save you this on mobile and when
they do that they can get installed and
get right to the content and you can
drive them to a more pleasant experience
for their for their device so again with
invites you want happy users to refer
happy users but there's another benefit
so with an invite since they're built on
top of dynamic links what you can do is
embed some context in your invites to
say give people a referral bonus to say
I know invite a friend and that friend
then gets a five dollars off of their
grocery bill so if you have a like a
deal with a grocery store you could say
you know for everyone who invites one of
their friends will give them a coupon
and that makes for a great great first
time experience and uh greatly increases
your retention there we go so again with
AdWords just like before you probably
want to hook into search results for
things like recipe book and dinner ideas
the google adwords integration will
definitely help drive traffic to your
mobile app and of course you want to
monetize this thing you know you don't
want users to use this forever free
forever I mean you wanted to use it for
free but you need to get paid at the end
of the day right so AdMob bike by Google
is another firebase integration it's the
same AdMob that you already know that's
been monetizing great apps for years and
now it works great with firebase and
there's one new feature in an AdMob that
you should know about it's called native
Express and what it lets you do is
include ads
in your app that matched the look and
feel of your app so this is great for
putting ads in scrolling lists so if you
have an ad in a scrolling list that
looks like the other items in the
scrolling list I think users are more
likely to notice it click on it and then
that should drive more revenue to your
app so this is pretty exciting
developers have been asking this for a
long time it's also great for games
right games have their own very distinct
styling if you can put ads in your game
that match that styling it creates for a
less jarring experience and of course
analytics again the thing that ties it
all together you can measure the
efficacy of your invitations your
dynamic links your AdWords and
eventually we hope that analytics will
have even better and tighter integration
so I highly recommend you look at
analytics you over at the firebase tent
we have demos of analytics and you can
talk to people were very knowledgeable
about this now I've gone over 13
components I promise 15 that means
there's two left my counting is very
good I took math in school so there's
what's missing here well the 13
components I've talked about are great
for adding features and functionality to
your app but there's two more things
left and what we can do with firebase is
also tests are out so with firebase we
have fire based test lab for Android
with firebase test lab for Android you
can test your app on actual devices
hosted in the cloud so with firebase we
own the devices google owns that manages
them and you can test on them now this
is great because if you've ever done
Android development you know that you
could end up with stacks of mobile
devices on your desk and I had this
problem to where I had a cabinet full of
devices and the team I was working but
they would constantly go in there grab
devices they would get lost you could
never find the thing that you wanted you
had tangled cables on your desk if you
were ten if you were testing on
different devices this is a terrible
situation you should abandon that and
just do testing in the cloud so we have
phones small tablets large tablets
across a variety of OEMs they're always
ready and waiting for you to do your
test so if you're an Android developer
you probably know you can write
instrumentation tests it's a way to sort
of like script the interactions with
your app and you could run those on your
desktop but again that's not scalable if
you have instrumentation tests you can
deploy those to firebase test lab
and we'll run those instrumentation
tests against the set of devices you
selected and then we run them
concurrently you don't run them in order
we run them concurrently so you get very
fast very comprehensive results
immediately now if you're not into
writing unit tests and you know who is
writing test isn't fun you can also have
an automated test like crawl your app
for you and we call this a robo test now
this little robot here there's no actual
robot poking and prodding your app this
is sort of like an artists imagination
of what a robo test is like but with a
robo test what happens is we have
software that looks at the UI widgets in
your app and fills in text field pushes
buttons selects drop downs goes through
menu items it tries to discover
everything in your app and if there's a
crash you'll know about it it also takes
screenshots along the way so that you
can know that you know if everything is
rendering properly on the set of devices
you selected now this is an actual
device rack we had a photographer come
in and make some very nice photos this
sort of demonstrates how you know let
much like a server farm we can have
device farms now so I really want to
visit the device lab someday I haven't
been there yet we have one on Google
campus and one in Atlanta I think this
is fascinating we have a sort of a
lighter version of that over in the
firebase 10 so if you want to see what a
rack kind of looks like we have a demo
for you to see and lastly there's also a
crash reporting component so you know
you can do all the testing you want on
devices in the cloud but inevitably
users will find some problem so you can
use firebase crash reporting to observe
and triage those crashes so they'll be
grouped by type there's a clustering
algorithm where you can see similar
crashes and then we'll order them by
severity so you know which ones to
tackle first this should help your
overall app quality now the way I see
tests lab and crash reporting working
together is that during development
you'll make use of tests lab in the
cloud to make sure that all of your
tests are working as planned then for
Android when you publish to an alpha or
beta channel there's another test that's
front is we call this a pre-release
report this is a very simple robo test
and what this will do is give you kind
of a quick check to see is my app
actually launching and working ok on a
variety of devices then
course you're alpha and beta users could
then if they experience crashes that
will report back into the dashboard and
you can use that to create new tests to
make sure that you fix those properly
and then when you promote your app from
alpha or beta to production you then
have you know actual live production
grade crash reporting so this is a great
way to ensure app quality throughout
your development lifecycle so that's all
15 components again you can take as many
of these or as few of these as you want
I'm a big fan of using as many as
possible especially for new apps now I
understand that established apps may
already have solutions for some of these
in place and that's fine you can keep
using them but if you want to replace
anything that's fine or if you want to
create a whole new app on top of
firebase that's great as well I've been
very excited to talk developers who are
going to build holy things on top of
firebase now one of our early access
partners relying studio had some very
specific things to say about it so
here's what here's what they did they
built three apps 2day which is an
anniversary app so it helps couples plan
an anniversary day there's me time which
is a diary app and their school of rock
which is a school lunch appt now some of
these I believe are not in languages
that are English so beware that if you
download one of these it may not make
sense but you can see firebase in action
now what they did is they they showed us
this chart of how they use firebase and
you can see across the board they are
making heavy use of firebase and they
loved it so the more solid icons are
components they definitely integrated
the more faded out ones are ones that
they're planning on the future they just
didn't get to it yet now but they were
excited to tell us about how how well
they were able to use firebase that they
gave us some quotes the CTO mleng studio
said I feel that recent mobile
development is often or is similar to
putting Lego bricks together too often
some of the bricks don't fit well and if
you even become problematic but from
what we experience firebase feels like
the virginian Lego bricks set that
guarantees compatibility and stability
now I love this Lego brick analogy this
is exactly how we intended firebase to
work we give you these components that
you can build up your app create an
infrastructure that you don't have to
create you can focus on your users
experience and their CEO went on to say
our main goal has always been about
creating
products that people actually use rather
than product craftsmanship so we used to
concentrate all our efforts on our core
competencies and borrow competencies in
areas where we lacked a cutting-edge
google has gifted us with firebase which
has been a complete package for what we
used to borrow now what he's saying here
is you know it's an app developer you
might have to pull in all these
different components and sort of
assemble something from a bunch of other
components but with firebase you get one
thing that gives you all of the core all
of your infrastructure that you need
once you have that infrastructure in
place you don't have to worry about
server farms or scaling up or you know
creating revenue or drawing users and do
the app all of that is there you can
focus on the app and your users in the
experience they want to have so that's
all I have if you want to learn more
about firebase components there's
another talk here at 3pm Todd Kerpelman
will talk about how some of the
individual clusters of components work
really well together I like I like this
talk I like the idea that these
components are like Lego bricks so he'll
he'll provide that Lego brick experience
if you have any questions about firebase
visit any one of these URLs if you if
you want to get you know deeper into it
there's a code lab called friendly chat
with friendly chap you'll actually walk
through the integration of you know like
seven or eight of these components and
see how they actually work and then
there's friendly picks which is an
actual live app which will demonstrate a
lot of firebase features so I'm really
excited about firebase and I can't wait
