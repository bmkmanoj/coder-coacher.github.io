getting started with cloud fire store
the hot new database in the cloud for
mobile and web apps well it's a good
decision I always knew you were the
smart one so let's start saving our data
to the cloud on this episode of fire
cast so here's the deal I want to create
a little web app where we can help keep
track of one of life's eternal questions
is a hot dog sandwich more importantly I
want to save this information to the
cloud so I can look up the current hot
dog status at any point from any web
browser so using my amazing HTML skills
I have created this web page consisting
of a text field where we can record the
latest hot dog as a sandwich status band
next to it I've got a Save button where
you can save this information to the
cloud and a big old h1 tag at the top
where we can display our latest hot dog
status info now later we'll load
whatever data our user has saved in the
cloud and display it in the header tag
at the top if you want to follow along
go ahead and create your own version of
this index.html file it really is
nothing more than these three elements
in fact let's take a closer look at what
I've got set up
so here's my index.html page where I've
got all my elements created and up here
I'm loading the firebase library then
over here is my apps file where I'm
configuring my firebase project with the
values that I got from the firebase
console actually before I do anything
else I'm going to go ahead and include
the firestore component like so
obviously these exact URLs will be a
little different than what you're
supposed to use so do make sure you
check out our Doc's for the actual
correct version and if you don't know
what I'm talking about here go ahead and
follow our getting started video for the
web the link is in the description below
and probably in one of those fancy
YouTube info cards and then come on back
it's okay I'll wait now before we go
ahead and write some data let's take a
moment to understand how cloud firestore
data generally works frankly this could
be the subject of its own separate video
and it probably will be one day but here
is the executive summary cloud firestore
is a document database that means it
kind of stores your data in a big tree
like structure a bit like the original
real time database but everything is
placed into documents and collections
you can think of a document is something
like a JavaScript object it's got like
key value pairs which we like to refer
to as fields and the values of these
fields can be any number of things from
strings to numbers to binary values to
little JSON II looking objects that the
team likes to call maps and collections
are basically well collections of
documents so there are a few rules
around the use of these things the first
is that collections can only contain
documents nothing else no collections of
strings or binary blobs or anything else
here second is that documents can't
contain other documents but they can
point to sub collections so it's very
common to see a collection containing a
bunch of documents which then point to
sub collections that contain other
documents and so on in a workout app for
instance I might have a user's
collection and this collection would
contain a document for each user and
then each of these documents might point
to like a work out sub collection that
in turn contains a document for each
different type of workout that the user
has performed and these might then
contain a history sub collection that
keeps track of every time the users
perform one of these workouts along with
like their average heart rate or other
data now if you're coming from the real
time database land this kind of deep
nesting might be giving you heart
palpitations but don't worry this kind
of data structure is completely normal
in the cloud firestore
old Weir queries are shallow meaning
that when you grab data from a document
you'll grab just that document and not
any of the documents contained in any of
these sub collections which is nice the
third rule is that the root of your
database can only consist of collections
in a normal production app this is going
to feel pretty natural you'll have like
your collection of items and your
collection of users and your collection
of games or what have you the one time
it's going to seem a little awkward is
when you are creating a little test app
like ours and you want to save like one
string so looking at our app I think the
top level is going to start with a
collection that I'm calling samples this
will then contain one single document
called sandwich data and this document
will itself have one key value pair or
field called hotdog status make sense
all right let's start building so if we
jump back into my HTML page you can see
that I've already created IDs for my
header my text field and my button so
first things first I'm gonna jump into
my app J's file and create a few
variables to hold references to these
elements and I'll do that just by
calling query selector I'll do the same
for my text field and my Save button and
we're done okay next up I'm gonna create
a click event listener for the Save
button now I'll grab the text that I
want to save for my input text field
value and let's log in to confirm we
have some actual data now I just need to
save it to the cloud and to do that I
need to specify in which document I want
to put this data and we do that through
something known as a document reference
now it turns out I'll be using the same
reference a few times throughout this
project so I'm actually going to define
it up here at the top of the script
actually first let me just grab a
reference to firestore and now there are
a few ways of setting my document
reference I could call firestore
collection samples dot doc sandwich data
now I kind of like doing this because it
serves as a nice reminder that you're
always going to be alternating between
collections and documents but it does
start to look a little silly when you
get several layers deep so an
alternative that I sometimes like is
calling firestore doc and then entering
the full path directly here in our case
the path would be samples sandwich data
just again remember that in your path
you're always going to be alternating
between collections documents
collections documents and so on so now
that I've specified my document let's go
back to my event listener where I'm
going to call set on this document
reference
now this will take in a javascript
object to represent the data that we
want to save for this document so we'll
set hot dog status as text to save and
well that's all I really need this will
replace my current document if it exists
and it will create it if it doesn't it
also conveniently creates the samples
collection too so I don't need to worry
about whether or not that exists now
this set function as with most firestore
functions returns a promise which means
it's pretty easy to note when this call
is complete so I'll attach it then call
back at the end here and print out a
little success message and come to think
that I'll add a catch here to prune any
errors and we're done
time to load up our page and give this a
try oh whoops okay wait let's fix that
little semicolon okay now let's give
this a try so here I'm gonna enter not a
sandwich as the current hot dog status
because it's not I'll hit save and
whoops looks like I'm getting an
authorization error and this is because
just like the real time database my
cloud firestore implementation contains
a set of security rules that determine
whether or not a certain action is
permitted and at the time of this video
by default they are set up so that
nobody can read or write to the database
so the proper solution here would
probably be to add some sign in using
firebase auth and then create some
proper well-thought-out security rules
based on what information I'm willing to
share to each individual user that said
all that would make this a much longer
video than it already is
so I'm going to kind of do a bit of a
hack here and make anything in my
samples collection open to the public
so let's head on over to the firebase
console make sure I've got my project
selected and I'm in the database section
and then here I'll make sure cloud
firestore is is selected for my list of
database options and then I will click
on the rules tab and I'm gonna add this
here to allow reading and writing to
anything that's part of my samples
collection now this is a pretty terrible
idea from a security perspective but at
least I've contained the damage to just
what's in my sample collection
so I'll publish that and we're done okay
I'm going to wait a minute or two then
give it another try I'm gonna go back
into my app hit save and yeah looks like
it works and I can verify this by going
back to the firebase console well select
the data tab to view our data we'll
select our samples collection and sure
enough looks like we've saved our hot
dog status to the world whoo-hoo and
while it's great that we can see this
data in the firebase console we need to
show this important information to our
users too so next up let's learn how to
grab this data from the cloud and put it
into our h1 tag now like the real time
database cloud fire store lets me listen
to changes in the database and update my
app in real time however I know that for
some of you out there the idea of
creating a real time listener for all
your data is weird and strange and
sometimes you just want a basic fetch
call to get your data right so I'm going
to show you how to do that first and
then we can talk about getting fancy
with our real time listeners so let's
create a load button I'm gonna give it
an ID tag here and then in my app dot JS
file I will save that to a variable and
we will define its event listener now
getting this function to work is
actually quite easy I'm gonna take that
same document reference we created
earlier and instead of calling set on it
I'm just gonna call get instead this
returns a promise so I can attach a then
callback to it which will run when this
get call is complete I know that this
takes in a document snapshot that I'm
just calling doc here the document
snapshot is basically an object that
represents your document you can find
out it's ID reads some metadata about it
make sure the underlying document it
represents really exists and more
importantly grab the data that it
contains by calling data on it so we'll
see if this snapshot exists and if it
does we will call data to extract the
contents of that document as an object
and then
can set the text of our being output
header to my data hot dog status and as
long as we're here let's add a catch at
the end to catch any errors that might
come up so let's run this and there we
go I can still save our latest hot dog
status to the world it's it's still not
a sandwich and we can see in the console
this was saved now I'll click the load
button to load it and there it is on our
page hey that's nice so this is great
we've got our data successfully saved
and loaded from cloud fire store but
what if you are interested in getting
your data in real time what if this
explicit fetching seems quaint and
old-fashioned to you well let's show you
how to get your data in real time as
well basically the process is going to
work nearly the same let's create a
function called get real-time updates
and in there I'm going to bring up my
doc ref but then instead of calling get
I'm going to use the on snapshot event
listener this will fire the first time I
call it but then it will also fire
anytime thereafter when my data changes
then this call takes in a callback
function which accepts the document
snapshot as an argument essentially just
like my get call so in fact I'm just
gonna copy the exact same code from a
get call into here to update my label
and well that's it we'll call get
real-time updates at the bottom of our
script and that should be all we need
here let's let's reload the page now you
can see that thanks to my on snapshot
listener my text automatically gets
updated with still not a sandwich the
value that was in the cloud previously
so let me change my status to
potentially a sandwich I'll hit save and
you can see that my label gets updated
automatically without my having to even
touch that load button neat wow that was
fast
in fact maybe too fast right it looks
like my label got updated before that
data was even saved how'd that happen
well what's happening is that cloud
firestore is making my app run as speedy
as possible by notifying me of changes
that happen locally as if they had
happened on the server but in the
meantime it's still going ahead and
updating that data remotely in the
background now if you want you can also
get notified by the SDK when the write
actually happens on the server you can
look in the documentation for the
include metadata changes option but by
default the SDK will ignore the second
event because it's essentially a
duplicate of the first
and in fact with a little printf
debugging or I guess console.log
debugging for you web folks we can see
this here let me log my data to the
console in my on snapshot listener now
let's reload the page and take a look at
this object that gets returned in my
console here's the initial value that we
loaded from the cloud and let's expand
this data object here we can see that it
has a metadata property and by expanding
that we can see we have this value
pending rights
we're just currently set to false
meaning basically that it came from our
server so now let's save our data let me
write more like a modified taco
potentially offending millions of taco
lovers sorry now when I save it the
object that gets returned in my on
snapshot listener has pending rights set
to true meaning that this is the local
version of the data in my database
that's waiting to be written now if you
wanted you could have this event fire
even when just that little bit of
metadata changes and that's something
you could add in your listener like so
and you can see that when I make an
update now my on snapshot event fires
twice once for the local update and once
again when the server comes back with
that same update now there may be times
when this behavior is what you want but
honestly most of the time the default
behavior works just fine so I'm gonna go
back to that and there you go
congratulations you are now saving your
data in one of the most powerful and
sophisticated online databases in the
world and using it to store whether or
not a hot dog is a sandwich thereby
resolving what might be one of the
greatest controversies on the internet
you know until next month when something
else pops up now there's a lot more to
learn about cloud firestore including
more details on how that data is
structured how subcollections work and
how to run some more sophisticated
queries all of which are great topics
for future videos
in the meantime set your security rules
to something a little more sane be sure
to check out the documentation and try
using code firestore in your own app and
I will see you soon on another exciting
episode of fire casts
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
