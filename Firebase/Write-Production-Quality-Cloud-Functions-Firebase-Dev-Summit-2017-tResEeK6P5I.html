is Lauren I'm here with my coworker
Thomas
we are both software engineers that work
on cloud functions for firebase and
today we will be sharing with you how
you can write production quality cloud
functions code to do that we'll dive
into three different topics first I'm
going to talk about why you even want to
use cloud functions in the first place
next I'll invite Thomas up who will give
us some tips tricks and also walk
through some tools for how you can be
writing cloud functions code then I'll
be talking about how you can test the
code that you just wrote using some
tools we released recently so first why
cloud functions in the first place
at today you may have learned about some
of the other firebase products that
allow you to write an app without a
back-end so you learned about firestore
first drawing your data cloud functions
at sort of cloud storage for firebase
for storing pictures and videos and
these products allow you to write your
app without servers but sometimes you
actually do need a server for example if
you have secret code that you don't want
invisible to the client this could be
scoring logic if you're writing a game
you want to keep those things on the
server secondly if you are doing things
that are very computationally intensive
you want them on the server so your
clients can be performant and
lightweight and lastly if you're writing
multiple apps and multiple platforms for
example iOS Android and web you don't
have to update all of them to add a
functionality or a push of bug fix by
keeping code on the server you can also
avoid lengthy app review cycles and you
don't have to wait for users to update
their apps so you can host your own
server and in this kind of a model you
have to define an interface for
communication between the server and the
client typically the client would be
making HTTP requests to the server to
interact with it you have to come up
with an interface an API for these two
things to work together cloud functions
for firebase is a managed back-end
solution and it offers a simpler
programming model you don't have to
define an API based on requests unless
you want to you if you want to you can
run an event-driven manner and what do I
mean by that exactly so called function
is a snippet of code that runs on
Google's servers in response to events
happening in your app for example a new
user has just signed up or a node in the
database has changed values one of these
events happen that triggers your
function to run alternatively you can
still trigger these functions through
HTTP requests and this is a great way to
create web hooks web hooks our URL is
that third parties can hit so for
example slack Twilio and stripe are
three of many many external services you
can use web hooks with to integrate into
your app so what are these immense that
can trigger functions firestore our
database solution if something is
written into the firestore you can
trigger function with that as of today
you can listen to crashlytics crash
events with functions and trigger code
to run you can run code when there's a
new user that sign up you can listen to
an a database right in the real-time
database you can listen to an analytics
event being fired and you file upload in
a storage bucket or of course an HTTP
request one thing that you can also do
with HTTP requests is you can connect it
with hosting so firebase hosting is
another product we offer it does hosting
for your CSS and HTML files prior to
functions hosting could only host static
websites websites that didn't change
depending on who the user is
but with functions you can actually have
your else that trigger an HTTP function
to run which then gives content for
hosting to render this is great for
rendering dynamic visual content but
also great for creating internal API is
that your app can hit to get information
so why do you want to use cloud
functions to host your back-end code the
first reason is it scales up and
down so if you're getting a lot of
traffic to your app you can trust that
we will submit spin up enough servers
and serve all that traffic for you on
the other hand if you have downtime in
your app you're not paying for you're
not using secondly because it runs on
Google servers is already in a trusted
environment so with no additional code
you have a CENTAC ated access to
firebase and Google services so you can
do things like write into your projects
database you can access Google Cloud
api's such as our machine learning api's
lastly is fully managed by Google Google
operates at a planet scale and we do the
DevOps for you
so you're you and your team do not have
to be burdened with that so I just
talked about what are all the great
reasons for using cloud functions next
Thomas will dive into some concepts that
will really help you write quality code
Thank You Lauren so cloud functions lets
you write code that runs in node.js
which means the tips I'm going to give
you today will work in the future for
other languages but today we're going to
take a very deep dive in node specific
tips to remember when writing your cloud
functions
now the far B's design process exposes
us to a lot of customers and oftentimes
as customers give us their code to look
out to help them debug or redesign and
we noticed a pattern as we work with
customers first we noticed that
customers very often had an intuition
for how successful their code was going
to be in production some devs would
tinker a little bit they deploy to
production and they'd leave it just
still forever other devs could iterate
in their product and know with
confidence that when they deployed their
code it would work and then we're just
being foolhardy we noticed when we
looked at these customers but they had
high confidence because they exhibited
some very common characteristics we boil
it down to three traits of the most
successful developers using cloud
functions first of all these developers
were able to express complex thoughts
much more clearly when they asked us to
review their code it was so much more
easy to read especially their
asynchronous programming you see bugs
love to hide in hard to read code which
means simple code will have fewer bugs
second these developers tended to lean
more heavily on tools to develop their
applications and we're going to use
three of those tools today we're going
to use linters typescript and ID's and
finally I'm going to hand it back to
Loren later to talk about some of the
tools we've used to test code outside of
production we noticed that people who
felt confident about their apps working
production had actually tested it
elsewhere through unit testing which
we've already talked about in previous
talks through testing in staging apps
and through some of the tools that Loren
will show you later
so many developers struggle were they
thinking as programming we've boiled it
down to what we call the one-two-three
test how many of you here might think if
you're glossing over this code that it
prints out one two three well it's
understandable because these lines do
come in order one two three but this
line right here means that printing out
two isn't going to happen until the rest
of the code executes now when I call it
the bug in isolation that might be a
little easy but how many of you in ten
seconds can catch the incredibly
dangerous bug in this code did you catch
it
there's never return statement here
whenever an error happened this code is
gonna keep on running passing garbage
data utilities and calling the
developers callback more often bugs love
to hide in what we call the pyramid of
Doom it's when your code keeps on
nesting deeper and deeper as it
progresses this is a very very common
place to have mistakes in your code
which is why at firebase we've been
really pushing developers to adopt
promises in their code there's just one
problem
you're developers are so used to having
the Pyramid of doom that you've been
reinventing it in promises so here's
that same code incorrectly written with
promises this is not how you write
promises folks this still has that
pyramid of doom and it still has two
more dangerous bugs
did you catch these ones well promises
are return values so you need to return
them that way the caller can actually
interact with them this is how we know
to keep your cloud functions alive if
you don't return the promise we'll
probably shut down your machine early
now second there is a time and a place
for chained promises or nessa promises
but a simple sequence of events is not
one of them this catch block is attached
only to task three which means any
failure in task one and two is not going
to be handled so for everyone who's
taking a picture this is the correct way
you write that code
task 1 then tasked you then task 3 then
all one line no complex indentation no
pyramid of Doom this code is simpler so
it's much more likely to be correct now
there's two reasons that you should
write your code like this first this is
simpler the amount of bugs in your code
is directly proportional to the amount
of code you've written so write less
code second writing code with idioms
helps you write fewer bugs as well your
brain recognizes these patterns which
means you'll notice when the pattern is
slightly off and you probably have a bug
you'll also be able to quickly glance
through the code and extract the meaning
out of this pattern you start to
recognize idioms over and over again but
this can go overboard
here's code that I recognize you
shouldn't read it I don't either I just
see this blob and I write remember that
everyone's copied it from stack overflow
this is how you make a rest request if
you're really trying to do it the hard
way
so consider actually using some tools to
write your code here is that same code
using a native library request promise
this is much easier to read much more
likely to be correct so let's continue
our talk about tools and go back to that
sample this function is correct but it'd
be great if we could do better because
almost half of this code is boilerplate
wouldn't it be great if we could focus
on the things that mattered most well
today I want to give you a sneak peek of
the future note version eight adds two
new keywords a weight and async here's
how it works first you declare a
function as a sink this means it's going
to return a promise no matter what it
also lets you use the await keyword you
stick a weight before any command that
returns a promise and it tells note hey
I need a value here not a promise go do
something else for a while
and when that promises resolved
continue this code with the value from
that promise so now we get to write
lines like this that looks so much more
natural result equals a weight task one
not task one dot then result one so now
our code looks almost exactly like our
synchronous code you don't have to keep
on asking yourself about that one two
three tests there's almost no
boilerplate at all and a weight turns
rejected promises into real exceptions
which means you can use try catch and
finally like you have the last 10 15 20
years there's almost no boilerplate and
here's another example this code reads
fairly simply we're looping on an
operation until it's done
and printing out when we have when we
finished waiting if you wrote this with
raw promises it would be much more
complex that while loop would be
recursive try finally is actually pretty
subtle with raw promises we fixed a bug
recently in our own SDKs because we
implemented finally wrong so why am I
telling you about things that aren't
available yet why are we in this tool
section of this talk because today I
want to talk to you a little bit about
typescript now those of you who know me
know that I'm a huge fan of typescript
it's a language written by Microsoft
that extends javascript with type
information which helps you write better
apps first of all because we have type
information your IDE can give you great
code complete and when you screw up you
actually get compiler errors no more
deploying and finding something is not a
function if you've you've done that also
because we have type information our
linters are so much better if you've
ever return or fair forgotten to return
a promise
imagine having a compiler automatically
check that for you and finally
typescript gives you features of nodejs
that aren't available yet so i'm going
to do today's demo in typescript
and we have see some of these tools in
practice with an app that I like to call
alone together this demonstrates my
favorite mathematical paradox called the
friendship paradox it says that most
people are less popular than their
friends it doesn't make a lot of sense
but you can see an example here we have
a social graph with three people one
person knows too
the average person has 1.3 friends and
two-thirds are below average so I like
this example because for people who grew
up as loners like me it lets me know
that I'm not alone in being a loner so
to do this we're going to use a Twitter
API we're going to find out how many
people follow you find out who you
follow and how many people follow them
and do some steps so it's a bit of
complex code so let's go through the
architecture first we'll start with the
username and fetch the user's profile
another request can give us the list of
ID's of the people we follow now there
might be hundreds and thousands of them
and we want to turn that into the
friends follower account
well we can't make thousands of API
requests at once you're going to get
rate limited so Twitter's giving us a
batch API but that has a size limit as
well so we need to take our big array
and break it into an array of batches so
to do that before we call get user
lookup we will call chunk this will
break up our array into sub arrays of a
maximum size from there we can do this
lookup in parallel and use promised all
to wait for all the batches to complete
now the opposite of chunk is flat map it
will take our array of arrays and give
us one array of results and now that we
have our profile and the follower count
of our friends we can calculate some fun
and existential statistics so let's go
ahead and see this in action
so when we write typescript one of the
first things you'll notice is that
imports are a little bit different it's
because the requires team is very node
specific before JavaScript invented
modules now in JavaScript has and types
gives us access to the latest features
so we use things like import this is the
syntax that's equivalent to the require
statement you're used to but there are
some more advanced syntax as you can
look up later next we will initialize
the Emma SDK the firebase functions
runtime automatically gives you the
information you need to do that now
stylistically I like to write helper
functions for any API call that really
give us the meat of what we care about
to make our code more readable so I'm
gonna create one function that looks up
a profile and it looks up a list of ID's
a list of profiles and just extract the
IDS out of it
next the lookup of user since this was a
batch request my helper just extracts
the first one from the batch get
follower count we'll look up a whole
profile and just extract the follower
IDs so now with these the rest of my
code would be a lot easier to read and
each of these functions are easy to look
at independently and finally since I
believe in testing I'm going to make my
batch size and export this means when
I'm writing a unit test I can change the
value of the batch size and I don't have
to create mock data of over a hundred
users just to test that my batch batch
chunking works so let's get started with
the HTTP function here's how you write
an HTTP function in firebase functions
at HTTP to on requests now we had the
ability to handle a raw request response
Express object and because we use the
async keyword we can use a weight inside
this function which means I can have my
error handling with just a try-catch
block if any error happens log it so I
can check out the production logs later
and do a 504
now we're going to start with the
username from the query parameter
and I've written a small helper to
authenticate the Twitter API so now
let's go to our work or workflow first I
get my profile now I find the IDS of my
friends break them into batches and now
I'm going to map each batch into a
promise to fetch the results for that
batch so map then to get follower
account so now we have an array of
promises of results let's wait to get
the results now we can combine them with
that flat map and we can calculate our
statistics so now I have my friend count
my fames how people follow me the
probability distribution the number of
friends who are more famous than I am
and the ratio so if more than 0.5 or if
this ratio is higher than 0.5 more than
50% of my friends are more famous than
me so let's log that just to make sure
we have some interesting stats we look
at our production logs we'll save it to
the database
oops and since this is an h2 b function
we need to return something
we'll return a shorter version of that
so now we hand out the username and how
many or what percentage of their friends
are more famous than they are so that's
our HTTP function but you'll notice I
wrote this information to the database
the reason why is it's not fun to just
count how popular I am but how well I
fit in with the rest of the world so I'm
going to rate write a database function
that listens to this node here and it
will use that to update some aggregate
statistics so this is what a database
function looks like functions out
database dot ref I write a pattern to
match all the documents that I want to
match and then the event type on create
whenever a new user adds their
information will update the aggregate
statistics
so as I said before I am more famous
than my friends if fewer than half of my
friends are more famous than me makes
sense
now because many users are gonna try to
update the same node will use a
transaction and then we'll make sure we
initialize our variable in case this is
the first time that that transaction is
run well either update the more famous
than peers count or the less famous than
peers count always up hit the total and
always calculate the new ratio and just
make things mildly more interesting we
will log what the new stats are so now
we have our completed HTTP and database
function we're gonna hand it back to
Lauren to show you how you can actually
test this even outside of production
great Thank You Thomas awesome
so Thomas just walked us through some
tools and tips and tricks for how he can
be writing your functions next I want to
talk about how you can test and debug
these functions so there are two main
parts of testing the first is writing
unit tests and we don't have enough time
to dive into it today but after at the
end I'll give you some resources you can
follow up on later the second part of
testing is tinkering with your code
while you're still developing it and
this is what tom has talked about
earlier when he talked about playing
with your code before before production
so one tool that firebase offers for
this is a local server to emulate your
HTTP functions so this looks at your
project sees if there are any functions
that are lessening to a request and if
there are serve them up on local URLs
and you can go to a web browser to hit
these URLs use a curl command or if you
are doing a integration between hosting
and function we're hosting URLs are
getting redirected to http functions you
can serve them both at the same time and
any interactions you have with the
hosted site
we'll also trigger your local functions
the cool thing about this is your local
function will actually be talking to
your production app and make real
requests to external api's like the
Twitter API or using today how you use
this is through the firebase
command-line interface the firebase CLI
you run firebase serve - - only
functions if you're only serving up
functions or you add comma hosting if
you're using both of them at the same
time so let's see this in action
Thomas will actually help us out here so
we already ran the firebase serve - -
the only hosting functions command on
the terminal on the Left we see that we
have a local web site on the right as
well as a function at an URL that's
printed here so this is an our aggregate
statistics before this track we put in
some Twitter handles of firebase sirs so
yeah there were 12 people there are less
famous and their friends so these 12
people have less followers than half of
the people that they follow and there
were 4 people that were actually more
famous than their friends so these are
more popular firebase sirs among us and
they have more followers than half of
the people that they follow and you can
see that 25% of the people are more
famous than their friends so we build
this app by integrating hosting with
functions so Thomas right now is gonna
click on the add your stat button it's
gonna ask him to log into his Twitter
account so we can pull up his statistics
now when this login is done the app is
making a request to an internal URL the
slash rating URL which triggers our
local function to run and we can see
locks here on the left so everything
after info is from the function so we
can see that the function was triggered
it started execution we used a sent
occation that was the Twitter login we
printed the full stats so that was the
console log in our code the console
locks show up here we see his Twitter
handle is inlined
he has 800
69 followers and he follows 438 people
and there some more statistics but the
most interesting one is that 62% of his
the people that he follows have more
followers than him so Thomas is
contributing to our less famous stat you
see on the right that went from 12 up to
13 and the the line at the very bottom
here in orange shows him that 62% of his
friends are more famous than him all
right let's switch back to the slides so
we were able to test out our HTTP
function but if you remember there were
actually more functions in our file in
our in our directory there was a
database function so how do we test that
we have another tool called a functions
shell which will emulate all of the
functions in your project no matter what
trigger type they listen to this is a
full node shell that is interactive that
can use regular JavaScript code with how
you use it is again through the firebase
CLI by running firebase experimental
functions shell so let's see this in
action
all right so we already ran the command
here and it emulated two functions the
aggregate function as well as the rating
function which we already test is so we
won't test that again and if you
remember back to the code the accurate
function is a database function that's
looking at any new database rise to
stats for a user that just used the app
so Thomas just used it so let's actually
four test data use the data that was
just printed out from the previous
function so I'm gonna copy this so
remember this is an actual node shell so
we can declare variables here so we've
got data right here and in the shell
each of the functions that we emulated
the names of them actually becomes a
function we can call and calling that
function invokes the local function and
the parameter we would put in is the
test data so we see that the function
was successfully invoked and the console
box from our functions are showing up
here as well so we are including his
stats we can double check here that yep
our function pulled a write stat and is
C more famous and his friends false
unfortunately and because of that we are
updating our stats from 13 to 14 for the
number of firebase there is less famous
and their peers and that brings us to
the ratio of 22% all right let's jump
back to the slides so I'm sure you're
all very anxious to see how unpopular
you are so you can pull out your phone
your computer if you're on live stream
you can do this as well go to a loan -
together dot firebase app comm it's
going to ask you to log in with your
Twitter and so do that and it'll pull
your follower count look at people that
you follow look at their follower count
and calculate statistics
all right can we switch back to the demo
computer please
Wow nobody is more famous yeah come on
all right so I see that as an audience
they are 11% of us that are more famous
than our friends all right we can switch
back to the slides
so you've just learned why cloud
functions for firebase is an excellent
choice for writing silver code we talked
about some tips for writing production
quality functions such as avoiding
nested promises using your weight async
and using typescript we also learned
about how you can be testing your
functions locally through fiber a serve
and the functions shell if you're
interested in the source code of the app
we just played with you can find it at a
lone - together firebase app comm slash
source so I'll give you a second to take
a photo of that and if you want to learn
even more these are some resources to
help you out so I mentioned that testing
is something that also involves unit
testing which we didn't dive into today
there is a talk that Thomas actually did
at Google i/o earlier this year that you
can find on YouTube titled cloud
functions testability and open source
can go on our documentation page
firebase google.com slash doc slash
functions and both of us will be at far
the ask firebase lounge right after this
talk to answer any additional questions
you have thank you for listening
here are our twitter handles if you want
to help us beat the friendship paradox
