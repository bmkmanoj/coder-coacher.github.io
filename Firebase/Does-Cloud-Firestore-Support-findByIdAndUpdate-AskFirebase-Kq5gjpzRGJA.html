to another episode of ask firebase
I'm your host Jen person and today I'm
gonna be joined by Abe Haskins and we're
gonna answer all your burning firebase
questions so welcome to the show Abe
what is it that you do here for firebase
I'm a developer programs engineer on the
firebase team suite uh what's a
developer programs engineer I don't know
it basically means I build open-source
things to help people use firebase
helping people understand it better
so I write samples write examples
documentation things like that cool so
if anyone's checking out our code
snippets or samples and if they go on
github and check out firebase you
probably had your hand in some of that
yeah absolutely you can see me in
firebase projects way back for the past
like five years a lot of the ones that
were abandoned many years ago our
projects that I worked on nice so are
you ready to answer some folks I could
not be more ready cool so our first
question comes to us from Twitter from
Henry learned to rock he says what is
the cost of listening to multiple
firestore queries in terms of memory and
performance so how many is too many
specifically on mobile browser sure well
the problem with this question is that
there isn't really a solid answer what
you'll find is with firestore the same
as with real time database and the same
with really any database it doesn't
matter how many connections are are how
many listeners you have it matters how
much data are you processing on the
client so if you have 100 listeners
listening to a hundred bits of small
data that's going to be pretty cheap but
if each of those listeners is listening
to a stream of constantly changing data
that's going to get really expensive for
your client to deal with really quickly
and because mobile devices vary so much
it's really really difficult to know how
many is too many so if you're targeting
American users who tend to have really
high-end phones that's going to be a
different limit than if you're targeting
developing countries where their phones
are much lower powered so it really just
depends on your app as a general rule of
thumb though more listeners more
connections are very cheap and they're
not something you have to worry about
so connections are cheap data not so
much yeah exactly
okay I was gonna say five but I feel
like yes I mean five is a fine rule of
thumb too let's hit the next question oh
this is a it's fun to try to read this
Twitter handle you want to take a stab
at that as hereas alright everybody easy
does cloud fire store support find by ID
and update no so first or basically has
these operations that you can you can
put together to make this find by ID and
update depending on what exact database
you're talking about the implementation
of that that might mean a couple
different things but we have the ability
for you to find something by its ID you
have the ability to update or do a merge
set which allows you to update over that
data without changing the data you
didn't have a value for so you have a
bunch of options here and you can get
that same functionality but it might not
be just one method that you're looking
for might be you know I get and a set or
get in an update yeah I think that one
particular use case might be if you
let's say you have a series of like
objects and they're all under some sort
of randomly generated ID then when I
cast that into whatever object I'm using
if I make it into like a restaurant or a
person I've started just getting in the
habit of keeping track what that key was
because that makes it much easier to
update so if it's just inside the object
if it's like a POJO or you know add it
to your struct or classed and swift then
it's really easy to just make that
update because you'll already have the
information in you know yeah and yeah
and this depends on what platform you're
dealing with if you're doing something
in JavaScript it's a lot easier to just
kind of keep the raw data around and
then if you're dealing with typescript
you can cast it to the type that you
expect but keep the raw data around and
that your if you keep the snapshot
around that'll still have the key on it
if you can you don't use that later to
do updates you have a lot of options but
yeah if you're using on regenerated keys
you kind of gotta write them down
somewhere so you know what they are yeah
so maybe the answer isn't just no it's
that there isn't that specific function
but there's that functionality yeah for
sure oh well that was really fun I'm so
glad to have you on I've been collecting
questions for a while that I didn't you
know I knew I needed to bring so
also might know a little more about it
so great to have you of course thanks
for having me always happy to talk about
the future of the web and all the cool
stuff working on future future of the
web so thanks for watching and remember
if you have any questions post them on
social media Twitter Facebook put them
on Stack Overflow put them in a bottle
and throw them out to see can we get a
peel box Oh that'd be so royal like some
old school show yeah yeah I'd be like
here's my p.o box send me a printout of
your code with the hashtag nice fire
isn't it of course just tag us in there
and we'll take a look and who knows
maybe your question will also be on a
future episode of ask firebase thanks
for watching see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
