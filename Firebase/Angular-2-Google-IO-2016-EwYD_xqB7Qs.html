for developer relations on the angular
team here at Google I'm going to give
you a very high-level overview of what's
included in angular 2 and then Kara one
of our amazing engineers is going to
give us actually a live demo of some of
the pieces I'm going to talk about
working together
also for space is one of our developer
advocates Stephan will be posting links
throughout this session as we talk about
things that might be of interest to you
so first how many of you are angular 1
developers you guys aren't allowed
answer just kidding I already knew
awesome there's a lot of you great
so as we like to do here on the angular
team I'm going to start with talking a
little bit about our community because
as an open source framework angular
isn't just built by those of us here at
Google and you'll hear we're really
excited about some of the collaboration
we've been able to do with our community
so while we look at things like search
metrics or the number of contributors to
our repo account we actually have
traditionally used the number of 30-day
actives to visiting our doc site to
determine our community size so late
last year we announced that there was
about 1.1 million people visiting the
angular 1 site and then good and then
when we ran those numbers again this
month we saw a growth of about 200,000
people reaching 1.3 million developers
learning angular 2 learning angular 1
and since we put angular 2 into beta
we've been pleasantly surprised that
over 450,000 people are visiting the
angular 2 site we also recently moved
angular 2 from beta into its release
canvassing candidacy and during the beta
phase we worked with a number of
internal Google teams like the Google
Fiber team and the green tea team which
is actually our internal CRM system and
these teams have been providing us with
a lot of feedback they've been
validating our approach and they've been
validating the use cases that angular 2
is great in we've also worked with a
number of partners some of here are whom
are here today like meteor ionic
telluric our publishing partners our
training partners all to make sure that
dealer to ecosystem is ready for you
we've also worked with a number of big
customers like The Weather Channel
Capital One and lucid charts who are all
using angular 2 already where angular 1
was a framework that helps you build web
applications more easily with things
like easy data binding and testability
angular 2 is a platform that encompasses
a lot more we started with dependency
injection both making it simpler and
also more capable as it now supports
lazy loading and something that I don't
think we talk about enough is the work
we do in the community to bring with a
standards community to bring the web
platform forward and a couple examples
of that are the work we've done with the
Ember team on decorators which is an
extension of the JavaScript framework
trying to get out of that error which is
extension of the JavaScript framework
that allows you to add metadata to your
code and you'll see that was really
powerful for angular and also how you'll
create components in angular 2 and also
the work that Brian Ford and our creator
of angular michiko did on zones and
zones are what makes angular and other
frameworks be able to schedule the
painting we need to do improving speed
but for all of you angular one
developers out there you can think of
zones as the reason that you'll never
have to use dollar sign apply again we
also have a new compiler that is not
only faster but allows us to do offline
compilation which allows us to drop
large parts of the framework improving
our speed we have a new change detection
strategy that is 10 times faster than
what we were capable of with angular 1
we have a new renderer that again is
faster and also has a pluggable
architecture so we can render to the Dom
like we always have but we can also
render where there is no Dom like on a
server we have a bunch of libraries so
that when you're building real world
apps you have everything you need
we're working on angular material too so
you get a nice set of responsive rich UI
components the mobile tool kit that
helps you get started faster and Kara's
going to demo a little of this an
angular Universal that allows angular to
run on the server but a platform is not
just api's and the libraries it's also
about your productivity as developers so
we have a new angular CLI that allows
all the scaffolding from how you create
a component how you create routes to how
you
your test infrastructure much much
easier and we work with partners like
Microsoft on a set of language services
that allow you to have intelligent code
completion and refactoring in your
favorite IDE and for debug at runtime
and we have a tool called angular augury
and I'm going to actually show you a
little bit about that in a couple
minutes and finally we have a library
called ng upgrade ng upgrade allows you
to seamlessly mix and match angular 1
and angular 2 components even in a app
running and production so you can
migrate your apps at your own pace when
I join the angular team last year I set
out to see well what do we need to do to
actually make angular 2 awesome for all
of you and I talked to all of our
developers and our customers and our
partners and I worked with one of our
angular genies named Jeff Whelpley and
we developed a survey we took all that
feedback and we kind of rolled it up and
we found that we really had three places
that we need to just get right and the
first of those is being amazing
performance anywhere you want to use
angular the second is again developer
productivity so that you can write apps
and maintain them more easily and the
third is versatility which is actually
twofold its versatility of angular to
work where you want it to work and also
the versatility of angular to meet the
needs of all the roles on your developer
team from developers to designers so
let's take a look at each of those first
with performance you've heard me use the
word fast a number of times now our goal
was really to be small and fast in all
scenarios that you would use angular so
in the beta phase and we took a look at
how we were doing we analyzed ourselves
against angular 1 and what we found is
that on initial render we were 2.5 times
faster than angular 1 and when the
browser had already seen that view on
rerender we were about four point two
times faster and we thought this is cool
but we really wanted to be better and
remember I said we had a number of
internal customers well one of those is
a little product you may have heard of
called Edwards then AdWords was like
angular teams those are great but we
really want you to be faster and so with
this is where you really get the benefit
of all that internal testing because
with that requirement in our
Aires we went back and got a bunch of
research and we eventually set it on a
method to generate optimized code that
we can replace large parts of the
framework and when we tested this
approach we found we were five times
faster across the board
we're pretty pleased with that AdWords
is pretty pleased with that and how this
works is that an angular one we would
send the entirety of the HTML template
up to the browser to be interpreted but
in angular 2 we have this offline
compilation step so we're actually
shipping fully optimized JavaScript this
is JavaScript that you could write
yourself if you had the patience and
energy but we think we've made it much
easier to achieve this using our
framework this offline compilation step
also solved another big problem for us
when I was doing research on where we
were in the state of beta I read a lot
of posts about how big angular 2 was and
at 170 K you aren't wrong especially
when we compare that to angular 1 at 56k
but this week our team has gotten
together and we've been able to
successfully demonstrate a hello world
minified and compressed app at 22 K but
we're not going to stop there because
our engineering director Brad green
promised us a chocolate cake if we could
get to 10k and all of us on the angular
team really want that chocolate cake he
makes a really good one it has coffee in
it it's amazing
alright so it's not just about the size
of angular itself we also needed to find
a way that you could write an architect
your apps so that they would be smaller
for faster rendering and so we came up
with this method of automatic lazy
loading and so the way this works is
really routes have a natural demarcation
of their dependencies and so we can
infer from routes what you really need
to load and so we can let the router
manage lazy loading so when a user
selects route 1 you just get the bits
for route 1 and when a ruse just flex
throughout 2 you just get the bits for
out 2 and you can see where this is
going right so on and so on
and the next step in performance is
angular Universal which is a great
example of how we've worked with our
community because this is
sleek community-driven and what angular
Universal does is it allows angular to
do server-side rendering and so the way
this works is a user makes a request
angular is running on the server and it
does a full render there and it sends
down just HTML and CSS this is obviously
much smaller than your full application
and so it's particularly good and 2g or
low connectivity scenarios at the same
time we're getting that initial payload
down we start streaming the JavaScript
and there's actually awesome thank you
there's actually Austin also an optional
pre-boot script so you can record user
actions that occur during this time and
then replay and respond to them so you
never lose a user intention angular
Universal is available today for node
asp.net and we're working with others
like PHP to see what other kinds of
server environments we can bring angular
to and finally in performance a word
about web workers and some of the
experimental work we're doing here as
you probably know javascript is single
threaded and so this can create some
responsiveness issues in your app I've
often heard this called the infamous
scrolling stutter problem and so web
workers they're not new they've been
around for awhile but most people don't
use them because are really hard to use
and one of the key challenges when using
web workers is that you get separated
from the Dom so you as a developer have
to figure out how to make that
communication happen
but with angular 2 support for web
workers we can now move all of your code
and most of angular into the web worker
thread and we do this with one line of
bootstrap configuration value one line
no more infamous growing stutter okay
moving on to productivity one of the
things when I first learned angular was
learning angular or am learning angular
that I struggled with was how do I see
what's happening in this app when I want
to debug it I was kind of used to my
visual studio environment and all the
tools around that and so in angular 1 we
had a tool called Batarang and we worked
with a Wrangell team to move this into
angular 2 and we released it recently
called augury an auger is a chrome dev
plugin that allows you to see insights
into your app at runtime so we have this
little demo called kitchen sink and we
can open augury from the chrome
tools and we automatically see our
component tree we can see our inputs and
our outputs and we can even change those
in line so that we can see how data
binding works for example but the
coolest part is this visualization tree
when I open the visualizations for my
app I can see my injection patterns and
my routing patterns is really cool for
me as a developer but think about if you
were a new developer to a project how
fast you could get started by having
these kinds of insights into an app
another thing I heard a lot a lot a lot
is angular 1 developers we're spending
too much of their time learning angular
specifics
so all those directives that you need to
learn ng-show and ng-hide and ng cloak
we really wanted to make this more
simple for angular 2 so any other - you
have two things to remember one if you
want to data bind to a property square
brackets and if you want to bind to
event you use parentheses two things 43
extra bits in your brain to go learn
something fun that you love and all this
individual productivity talk is great
but we also heard that you never work in
teams of one that usually you have a
team that looks more like this with
release managers and testers and
designers and whatever is on your team
and we heard from you that you really
needed that whole team to understand
your app and how components get created
how services are architected and how it
all works together so again with our
community we've delivered angular 2
style guide and the style guide provides
explicit guidance on architecture and it
goes one step further because it will
give you reasoning why or why not you
might want to adopt a certain pattern
and if you're using typescript you can
take one step further in this journey
and we have a tool called code eliezer
that was built by one of our angular
gdes so again this is community built
and code eliezer actually does a static
analysis of your code but it's really
cool because it does it against that
style guide so that we can actually give
you feedback that's against our best
practices but my favorite part of our
developer productivity story is our CLI
I would come to work when I started on
the angular team I would come to work
every Monday I'd spent all weekend
writing code ignoring my family and I
would I would come in and I'd be so
frustrated and I'd say oh my gosh I
spent all this time doing configuration
and build and not enough time learning
angular so it was really awesome to be a
part of the team that brought a group of
contributors from our community and a
couple of our angular engineers and we
built the CLI and one of the first
things that we did when we took a look
at what we needed to do for a
command-line interface was what's the
natural developer workflow and we found
that it went something like this you
create a project you generate components
spin out your dev server probably put
some routes in there you might want to
clean up your code so use a linter
scaffold and run some tests maybe you do
some pre-processing before you build
into play so I'm really stoked to say
that the CLI we released a couple weeks
ago has commands for all of these things
and you're going to get to see Kara use
this live in her demo just in a minute
and it kind of takes you from something
like this where you create your project
directory you write all those config
files you install all the node modules
while you go get coffee to this ng new
ng serve that's it it all just works at
around time with those three lines and
our final category is versatility we
heard loud and clear and all that
feedback that it was super important to
you that we could take angular 2 to more
places than just the browser the first
step in versatility was decoupling
ourselves from the Dom and then we made
a huge investment in mobile yesterday
Jeff and Alex and Rob were all in the
room here today had a session here at
i/o where they went deeper into those
specific investments so if you didn't
get to catch that yesterday I hope
you're watching on the replay and Kara
is actually going to demo how the CLI
works with a mobile flag so you'll get a
little bit more about this in a minute
we had a particular focus on supporting
progressive web apps we got a lot of
feedback that it was really hard for
your users to find apps and install them
from an app
door and so with progressive Web Apps it
kind of works like this I'm sure you've
heard this a little bit over the week or
the few days which is a user source to
your website on their phone
it gets auto installed to the home
screen in the background so when they
come back they get a more user
experience that's more apt like and so
angular's taking advantage of a couple
of improvements in the web platform like
service workers so we can auto cache
your code in your data and server-side
push so we can push new versions even an
offline scenarios just like native apps
- and specific to angular is angular
universal for that really fast first
render web workers for responsiveness
and the CLI to get you started and
finally if you are still working and
installed mobile and that's what you
want to do we've worked with a number of
partners to make sure that we can
support that - so ionic who is arguably
the first adopter of angular - and has
been with us almost since day one they
have a solution where they use web views
so you can actually reuse your code
across iOS and Android and Windows Phone
you get you eyes that look native and
you still have access to the camera or
the GPS or whatever you need on the
device we've worked with a team at
telluric the native script team on their
solution so you can build in JavaScript
use all the angular goodness and then
leverage their renderer that uses native
UI and if you're a react fan we have a
contributor to our to our community
called Amadeus it's the largest travel
company in Europe and they are literally
the poster child for the value that a
big company can get out of contributing
back to an open-source framework they
actually built an angular 2 in react
native project and Steven is literally
right now posting links to some videos
where you can learn more about these
projects and finally the sort of new old
frontier of the desktop if you still
need to write apps for the desktop or
you want to reuse your code across the
desktop we have starter kits for
electron and Windows Universal so let's
take a look at that electron use case
because it's very similar to the Windows
Universal 1 electron if you don't know
what it is is a tool from github and if
you've used slack on the desktop anyone
you slack on the desktop
or vs code editor you're already using
an electron app so what electron does is
it gives you the pair of chrome for
rendering and node for processing you
can write an HTML and JavaScript but you
get installers for Windows Mac and Linux
and you still get native menus in native
notifications so your app looks and
feels just like a normal desktop app and
if you notice this diagram looks
remarkably similar to my web worker
diagram and so it's electron we can sort
of do that same trick and put angular
into the node process so that it's even
faster but you still get access to all
the platform api's like authentication
and hardware and you do this all without
going over HTTP so that's pretty cool
and I hope this gives you a nice
overview of everything that's included
in angular 2 but the magic is really
what care is going to show you and how
it all works together all right so I'm
Cara Ericsson I'm a software engineer on
the angular team and let's get started
so we've been talking a lot about how
robust angular 2 is as a platform and
now we're going to show you so I
prepared a live demo that combines a lot
of the tools that we've been talking
about like angular Universal the angular
CLI the mobile toolkit material
components angular material components
and more so we'll be building an app
together it's a very important app for
Humanity it's called puppy love so it's
a dating app for dogs and help your dog
find his or her doggy soulmate but the
cool thing about this is that it's going
to exhibit many of the features of a
progressive web app so it'll be
installed into the home screen it will
have an application shell that will
render immediately and it will leverage
the serviceworker to cache your files
and assets for a quicker be render and
at the end we'll also connect it all up
to a firebase real time database so we
can show you the really cool angular
fire
operation will be using typescript for
this demo but don't worry if you don't
know typescript is essentially just es6
with some types of it on top and we'll
post the link to the github repo after
if you're curious I want to look at it
more closely I'm recording a demo that
was previously done at Google i/o 2016
but due to some technical problems we
didn't capture the footage so I'm doing
it again for you now so we are going to
be combining a number of the tools that
we talked about in the first part of the
talk the angular CLI angular material
and Google Universal the mobile toolkit
and more so I recently created an empty
starter repo that angular CLI since I
have the angular CLI globally installed
I can just run ng new the project name
and then - - mobile to include the
mobile toolkit what this does is it adds
a bunch of files and folders that you'll
need for any angular project such as the
main app component here popula vo
component TS the index.html with all of
your script tags the main dot TS to
bootstrap your app component and also it
sets up all of the build rules for you
so it'll build your typescript into
JavaScript it'll set up your system GS
module loader so basically you can serve
right out of the box which is incredibly
useful for developer productivity and
since we use the mobile flag it will add
a bunch of helpers for us to create
progressive web apps such as all these
default icons here for the homescreen
optional helpers and some Service Worker
helpers as well I've also NPM installed
some of the tools that were going to be
using such as angular material
components firebase and angular fire -
and I've set up the config in the vendor
bundle and the system J's config but you
can find that in the gap repo later if
you want to see it I'm going to go ahead
and serve right now so ng serve and
we're showing this on mobile on the iOS
simulator but of course this works on
desktop as well since you this you can
see the skeleton app already running so
we're going to build this app in three
parts we're going to start with the
application shell which is essentially
just the application layout or scaffold
that will render immediately then we're
gonna move on to the dynamic content
such as the puppy profiles and then at
the end we'll hook it up to that
firebase real time database so our
application shell is going to be a
pretty iconic application shell it's
going to have three parts you'll have
the toolbar at the top with the title
you love a hamburger menu icon on the
left that will open up a side nav menu
to do this
we're going to use angular material
components so here in our root component
we're going to import all those angular
material components all at once here
we're also going to add them all to our
directives array at once and any
providers that were going to use so we
have the perfect angular material
component for the toolbar it's called MD
toolbar and you just wrap your title in
that and we can set the color to primary
here which is the primary color of our
theme and since we didn't set one it's
just the default material theme as you
can see we have this lovely tool right
here next we're going to add the
hamburger icon since we want this to be
a static thing that renders right away
we don't want it to go over a net
request so we're just going to use it
inline SVG having a snippet here and
then we're going to wrap this in a
button tag for accessibility since this
is going to open the side now and we're
also going to add this MD icon button
attribute so that it doesn't have any of
the default button styles that might
make the icon look a little funny okay
so here we have our icon next let's add
the side nav menu so since we're
creating a side nav flow you might
imagine that we have an MD side nav
layout component here can wrap
everything in and we want it to be full
screen and while we're in here we're
also going to add some inline styles to
give a background to that side nav
layout it's going to have a background
that is our GBA 50% and then for the
side nav menu we can use something
called MV sign up and if you tag it with
a local template variable like side nav
it'll give us access to its API so when
you click this icon you can just call
side now it's not open so we go over let
me refresh this you can see we have the
side nav it's pretty skinny right now
don't actually have any content in it
but this is our application shell so
you'll notice if we refresh this if you
continue to refresh this you'll never
see this application shell blank and
that's because it's rerender so quickly
how do we accomplish this so if you look
at our file structure here we have our
main duct ts file that you're used to
where reboot strapping or abnormally we
also have this main app shell ts file
and what this does is it passes our
app component into angular Universal
nebula reversal will pre-render our app
component into a static HTML page that
in lines all the styles in the HTML you
can actually see this if you look at the
disk older we have the generated
index.html right here you can see all
these inline styles that are pasted
right in here and also the HTML that
we've written here at the bottom which
is pretty cool
then after the first render we'll use a
service worker to fetch things from the
cache instead of getting them over the
network which is very fast but it's not
turned on in development mode for
reasons that you might imagine okay so
we have our application shell let's
focus on actually adding some content so
we have this empty side nav let's put a
list of navigation links in here so if
you want to do that let's go back to our
app component we can use something
called MD novelist and MD nablus allows
you to create lists of anchors so we're
going to have one for each view and then
each list item is going to have two
lines so have one line with the views
name and one line with the views
description then we're also going to
have an icon for each of these and we
can use something called MD icon which
is a really easy way to add material
design icons so if you have the material
design font loaded you can just load the
icon by ligature so if you write
something like menu it'll just turn into
the menu icon which is pretty cool
here it's actually going to be huge icon
though so let's go ahead and add our
views objects in here or array and it's
going to have two lengths in my account
link and the potential dates link but
before we look at this I want to point
out that we need to add shell no renter
here this is a directive that comes with
the app shell plugin so we get two
directives shell render and shell not
render shell render ensures that
whatever tag you put it on is only part
of the pre render and not part of the
real app and that's really great for
something like a progress bar that you
only want to show during the pre render
phase shell my render is the opposite it
will not be added to the pre rendered
pipeline but it will be part of the real
dynamic app so in this case for the
Navis we have these routes we don't want
people to click on them before they're
ready so we're going to shell in our
render them okay so if we refresh this
you can see that we have this lovely
list here on the side which is pretty
cool but we still have this big empty
space here in the middle so how do we
load things inside this existing
application shell well we can use the
router to do that so the router gives us
this directive called router outlet what
it is it's basically a hole that we can
load route templates inside and again
we're going to put shell and render on
this because everything that's going in
here is not part of the application
shell so what's going to go in here well
we're going to have our dog profiles in
here right so we need to generate a
component for this and also a route so
we can load the route inside so we can
do that with a CLI and just run ng
generate route and then the name of our
route and what this does is it creates a
number of files for that component and
also creates a route config for us so we
go in here we can see that we have this
route config here on the bottom we're
actually going to tweak it a little bit
because we want this to be our default
route and then if we go to our system
context our system config we can add the
route that we just added so app slash
dogs then if we reload this page here
you'll see that you have the boilerplate
Docs works and that lets us know that
the dog component is loading inside this
app shell okay so let's check out that
oops
that dogs folder here so if we open up
dogs to aquaponics yes we have our
component boilerplate here we're going
to use a number of new material
components for this so we're going to go
ahead and outlaw or imports it once this
once again and then we're also going to
add any directives that we're going to
use and any providers that we're going
to use so in our dog's HTML let's go
ahead and start adding some dog profiles
so each dog profile is going to be a
card and each card is going to have the
dog's name and for its card content it's
going to have the dogs tag line we're
also going to make this secondary class
nicer and it's also going to have an
image tag with the image of the dog so
it's all text here source is going to be
dog's image from Showzen website
okay so let's add this dog's array so
eventually we're going to load this from
the database but for this first
iteration we're just going to have this
array that we're going to paste in
here and then in our CSS dogs that CSS
we need to do two things
so first we need to add that secondary
class I talked about let's make this
gray and then for our md card component
we need to add the margin the reason you
do this is because none of our angular
material components actually have a
margin included much like native
elements just because we don't know
where you're going to put them and it's
really up to the user to decide what the
right margin is for their application so
if we look over at our app we have these
beautiful cards we have an angular team
dogs here the last thing we're going to
do for this first part of the app is add
some action buttons so if your galaxies
on the dog but here she likes they can
do something about it so let's go back
to our docs HTML page and we can add
some MD card actions here we're gonna
have two actions we're going to have one
if you want to sniff touch a partner and
one if you want to whoop your partner so
if you load this here we've got these
lovely action buttons here okay so we
have this app that seems pretty cool we
have our cards we have our list here on
the side but we're actually loading
these dogs from our class which isn't
very cool it'd be much cooler if we
could load them for my database so let's
go ahead and put in that firebase
integration so since we've already NPM
installed firebase and angular fire two
and set it up in our config in our main
dot TSS file we can go ahead and import
our providers right away so we need the
firebase providers and also this default
firebase function so let's go ahead and
add them right here and this default
firebase function is going to tell the
firebase integration where to look for
your database queries and I've already
set up the database here at popula biota
far be so calm so it knows to look there
so in our dogs component we can import
angularfire which is essentially the
helper that we renamed here and also the
firebase list observable which is the
type that we're going to get back from
the database
then we can now replace this really long
ugly dogs objects let's go ahead and
delete this and this is now going to be
a firebase list observable type if we
inject angularfire here we can set this
dot dogs to AF database dot list at
slash dogs and what this does is it sets
the set dogs to the angular fires
database list function that will look at
the restful endpoint dogs so I need to
do one more thing and that's to add the
async pipe here and you have to remember
that originally we had an array and that
means all the values are available
immediately but now we're using
observable which means the values become
available over time so we need to make
sure that ng four knows that this is
asynchronous so if we look back we can
see that now we have our dogs again but
there are different lists of dogs
because they're coming from our database
she's pretty cool the last thing we're
going to do is we're actually going to
add a form to add new dogs this database
so we can do that again with an MD card
so we can add an MD e-card title here
oops it's just going to say create a
profile
we'll have empty card content that's
essentially just going to be our form
fill in the second and then our card
actions are just going to be a post
button color it's going to be accent
change things up so let's say that looks
like we load this here we have to select
the form let's add some inputs in here
we have a material component called MD
input that can animate our placeholder
is in really nice way so we're going to
use that one for name we'll add another
one for the tag line here and then we'll
add a third for the image URL and once
again for this we're going to add some
CSS so we're just going to make this
full width but it looks right in this
context
okay so let's allow this to refresh so
now we have this wonderful form with
these animating placeholders but it's
not actually connected to anything so
let's connect
it up so in our dogs class we can create
a function called post dog that takes a
value of a dog and the beauty of the
angler for integration is we can just
run this dog push and then the value and
it will instantly be pushed the data
base it's really cool so now we just
need to let or actually pass that form
value into the function so we can do
this in our HTML we can create a local
template variable that's equal to the
form instance and then when we click
this post button we can just call post
dog with F dot value that's it so if we
refresh this here let's add new dog here
this react Porter and say I am a dog
everyone and then I have this over here
so not to memorize it so I'm going to
paste it in this is just going to be
porter dot PNG so i hit post and i
scroll down you'll see i have a new dog
here at the bottom porter just pretty
cool so this is our app which is awesome
but i want to show you a few more things
one thing is that you can actually add
this to the homescreen immediately you
notice we didn't actually do any setup
for this this comes right out of the
mobile toolkit it sets us up for you so
we hit add you can see we have this
lovely app icon here and if you click on
it it'll open into a native looking app
experience so we have everything that we
had before except it looks like a native
app which is pretty cool ok so that's it
for the demo so if you want to learn
more about angular 2 or any things that
we showed today we have a wonderful
dockside at angular's io we also had an
ng conference a few weeks ago so if you
want to learn more about this I highly
recommend watching those videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
