with the firebase team welcome to meet
firebase where you get to meet the
Googlers who make firebase happen our
guest tonight is with the firebase Cloud
messaging team his developer program
engineer and his name is Matt god Matt
would you join me on the show thank you
for having me great too great to have
you on the show so firebase Cloud
messaging for web just launched tell me
how did that go yeah it was great like
it was kind of interesting because it's
the first time the firebase SDK has been
used in service workers which is it's
kind of a new thing in the web world at
the moment where you can run JavaScript
without the browser or the web page
being open it's been really great just
working with the JavaScript team for
firebase and just figuring out how we
can add this in and working with them
and making sure everything works in this
like new service worker environment and
everyone was just like yeah we need to
do this we need to get it landed and
everyone was just super helpful is great
this is our first time actually meeting
in person so the first time I saw you
was with your video about FCM firebase
Cloud messaging for the web yes so when
you yeah yeah mark 1 yeah I want to ask
you about that later I've been living in
the san francisco bay area for a few
years now i moved here from boston but i
understand you moved here from where
from london UK what so that's a pretty
big move how's that going good so far
it's only been sort of three months and
it was kind of like out of one fire into
the other because we literally I moved
and then I started work on FCM that the
web SDK side of things almost
immediately Wow get to work well have
you been settling into the San Francisco
Bay Area good so far like America and
obvious english-speaking country it's
not like when you go traveling or
whatever else is this there's only
certain small cultural things that are
different but it's nice and doing lots
of random things like San Francisco Zoo
and seeing the red pandas there and
different different things like that
that probably if you lived here you're
like oh my god that's so touristy it
hurts when we talked last time you
mentioned that you were looking into an
activity called glamping yeah and that
was the first time I had heard that word
so tell me what is what is glamping so
glamping I
I think it's meant to be glamorous
camping or glamour camping basically
it's a cop-out for real camping where
you actually have to turn up in picture
and 10 it's like you just rock up and
someone has a tent there and then they
feed you food for breakfast in the
morning and it was really nice you when
the other weekend and you wake up and
you're overlooking the sea and it's all
nice and coastal and you just get to see
all the bright styles and everything
else at night because there's no clouds
like in London the worst fear was they
even had a fire and then they would make
the s'mores for you so it's just like
everything was taken care of you didn't
have to even think which is great now
I'll have to give that a try sometime
because i'm not very outdoorsy so you
know glamping might be for me if I if I
get to keep some of my my city and
trappings yeah it turns out because I
like to stay indoors and play video
games that I got pretty good at playing
plastic instruments through video games
but you told me you play actual guitar
is that right yes I used to play
electric guitar quite a lot like back in
college we have like a little mini band
and we did like charity concerts and it
was just all covers and basically any
excuse to make lots of loud noises I'm
pretty sure I've kind of damaged my
hearing quite savagely from this point
but yeah it's really good fun late
nowadays it's much more calm and I'm
just whenever I get a little bit of
downtime or my computer's playing off or
I'm installing like a new version of an
OS that's the point of the guitar and
just like oh just play a couple of
things it was just filling in time yes
exactly now okay I'm gonna feel a little
bit of time and I'm gonna play plastic
guitar right now you're gonna serenade
me yeah yeah I'm gonna put this thing on
right here I might even just stand up a
bit here so the way it goes is now I
have to picture like falling bricks on a
TV screen in order to be able to play
this that's how I that's how I get in
the move I'm going to start out I'm just
gonna play a little tune done the guns I
go down to get undone don't get out and
take it down around I gotta go something
like that and then I take it off and I
just setting up with it yeah nice that's
how I do it but it turns out we have a
real guitar here if you would like to
play that I think our audience oh there
we go
yeah so Matt would you would you care to
policin this is what the speakers for oh
yeah I don't want to do this but you're
you're doing it right now here we go
like I'm just gonna go for the simplest
thing because it's just easy yeah what's
that's very good thank you I think I
wanna kiss ya how about that maybe you
can teach something to our band director
Nate over here who's learning some
instruments what's wrong he has to work
on his musical abilities a little bit
drop far Reese long rows all good thing
aside firebase cloud messaging is
available for web apps now we're just
kind of a big deal isn't it yes so
basically like the backstory of all this
was they used to I was working with a
lot of the crime engineering team in
London and working with web person just
the native support and browsers which is
like still fairly new i think it's like
a year old which sounds like a long time
but you go go through spec process and
get all the browsers to implement it and
stuff and one of the biggest issues
there was you have to encrypt all the
messages that you send my any payload
has to be encrypted before you send it
and then you can only send it to one
device not too lots and you miss certain
features like topic support which FCM
has had baked in for like a long time
now so what the sem web sdk now has is
support where you can just register for
an sem token and it will use web push
behind the scenes but all the
complicated stuff happens on the back
end and you're kind of removed from it
to a certain extent and it makes
everything a lot easier yeah that's
great yeah and also FCM was only
previously supported on Android and iOS
and now for the web which brings all
three platforms closer and parody to
what we want to offer yeah exactly and
it's it's kind of nice because if you
have a back-end that's already like
taking fcm tokens and sending messages
now you can just add web on to it it's
rather than have to kind of worried
about building an entirely new push
infrastructure just for web instead you
can just put all three under the one
sort of same roof on your back end yeah
she's great that sounds I could be very
helpful for developers and
for those of you watching if you want to
watch Matt's video he'll give you an
introduction on how to get started with
FCM for the web yep nice quick simple
getting started intro I like the fact
that you're up selling my video again
more views views are good right so be
sure to click that link in the
description and I have a game to play if
you want to do that real fast oh yeah
cuz you haven't given me enough
surprising no no not enough surprises so
i called this game good cloud message
bad cloud message and here's a series of
questions let's do them one at a time
and we'll show them up on the screen for
everyone watching at home so your job is
to tell me I'll read it out loud you
tell me is this a good message or is it
a bad message don't don't read ahead
what okay but do one I to tell I was
gonna pick my ounces oh no I'm gonna ask
you for all these so imagine there's a
message comes up and it says there are
12 new updates from your subscriptions
tell me yeah send a good message or a
bad message uh I guess it depends on
what the subscriptions are like my gut
instinct is like maybe it would be okay
maybe so but subscriptions right the
user asked for yeah so I'm guessing is
good it's probably good yeah yes it is a
subscription yeah I imagine with an icon
and everything else I'd get it and would
be sweet yes okay so the next one is
simply says an error occurred and like a
frowny face well we all know this bad
because it's like it's completely not
for the user in any way shape or form
it's like great what do I do with that
information swipe clothes maybe even
deny permission to show me more
notifications so yeah yeah yeah so I
mean what happens if you click this I
don't know but it's it's not helpful
okay next question is your order is
about to arrive please be ready to
answer the door with the assumption that
the user did actually order something
using whatever that would be hella
creepy it wasn't this is like by the way
we're gonna come we're coming for you
it's like no yeah useful easily useful I
like it yeah yeah tells you exactly
what's happening at the time it's
happening presumably okay so how about
this next one is a celebrate with us at
Punk Lee its independence day through
exclamation points and then there's and
I'll break this down some party favors a
balloon a popped champagne bottle a
couple of 50 beers yeah a variety of
drinks two capsules who knows what's in
at a burrito also don't know what's in
that and a flashing camera is this good
message or a bad message I think I'd say
it's a bad message it feels pretty
spammy to a certain extent unless you
really friggin love punk Lee whatever
punk Lee is yeah we don't know what it
is but I'm gonna say no I think it's a
little bit spammy too I got this I
wouldn't know what to do with it you're
kind of like I know its independence day
it's like maybe if it was a special
offer for Punk Lee and it's like you can
get special entry with this voucher
maybe maybe but why wouldn't just say
that right if well exactly the other
thing this is a bad message if that's
the case yeah let's we'll just say it's
a bad message and the last question we
have or the last message we have here is
you have twenty three new messages from
nate I'm sure huge yeah I guess it's
okay i mean it would be better if I knew
well i guess it was twenty three new
messages then yeah they can't tell me
what the message is up but it's not good
for him to put that on the message so it
turns out this looks like a good message
but it's actually not a good message
because nate over there sends me all
these four words of funny emails and
Internet jokes and whatever i'm sick of
it I don't want it I don't want these
messages anymore but why was it madness
why isn't they sending me any messages
no get look you oh I'll give you I'll
give him your email address if you want
yeah his list I wouldn't recommend it
emails he also has great taste in
bananas gonna move I love it thanks for
being on this show Matt thanks is

all we have time for be sure to stay
