hey firebase developers welcome back to
another episode of ask firebase the show
where we answer all of your burning
firebase questions
I'm your host Jen person and today I am
joined by Gus Horwath know Gus tell me a
little bit about what you do here I am
on the marketing team here at firebase
so that means that I take care of things
like case studies which are stories
about developers and the awesome ways
that they use firebase suite which um
definitely is why when I had this
question come up the other day I
immediately thought about you because I
think this is something that developers
think a lot and that's why I was really
happy to have you on helped me answer
this question now also I'd just like to
say as an aside it seems like firebase
would just sell itself but you know we
really got to get the message out there
right it's true I you would think that
you know if you heard about firebase why
wouldn't you use it like you get it but
you have to have heard about it that's
problem number one and problem number
two is you know sometimes people have
one idea of what firebase does and we
have to help them understand that it
does more than that or different things
and so you know it's sometimes it's
about education you know I like to think
that that my main job as a marketer is
just to get the word out and make sure
that people know what the product does
and that then like you said it'll sell
itself at the end of the day right which
is why when I had a question online the
other day where a developer said you
know firebase is great for when I just
want to get a quick example of an app up
off the ground but when is it gonna be
big enough for let's say a real app that
we're gonna want to put in say the App
Store or the Play Store when is it gonna
be something that could be more
enterprise and I definitely told them
well good news that already is but
that's the good news
yeah I think that's a pretty common
question we get as people you know are
like oh firebase is great for
prototyping and you know launching an
app but then is which it is that's true
but it also works really
for apps that you know scale like we
like to sort of in say it's from your
first user to your millionth user and
beyond right um so yeah we've got some
really cool stories about large apps
using firebase should I tell you about
one of them why yes that's great so one
of the cooler stories that we had came
up last year um you may have heard the
story if you were at i/o I believe you
were and that's a company called Wattpad
they made it and their original app was
called Wattpad and then they made
another app called tap and tap is a
storytelling app but it's storytelling
for the modern age and so it's all done
through tapping and kind of text
exchanges that tell these cool stories
that unfold so what I want to launch
this new type of app and the used
firebase to build the whole thing start
to finish watch it and they reached a
large scale I don't exactly know how
many users we should probably figure
that out quite quickly uh yeah so we're
gonna figure it out and then it's gonna
appear somewhere in this area
yes there we go magic perfect they did
in fact use it for their original build
and launch and but you know they already
had a fairly large user base from their
first app Wattpad and so they knew that
they need to build for scale and that's
what they gave and tap has grown very
quickly been very well received and they
used firebase for everything from their
back-end to their analytics to you know
a lot of their sort of growth
experiments using remote can take suite
and yeah actually have it on my phone
right here what a coincidence
Wow how interesting yeah so you know I
had to really download it to figure out
what it is that it does and it is it's
really interesting it's kind of like I I
don't know maybe I'm speaking for other
people now but if you ever had like a
conversation where you like take a
screenshot of it cuz you're like this
really tells me a lot especially like
what I'm having fun conversations with
my mom I'll like take a screenshot cuz
it makes me laugh it makes me reminds me
of my mom and the funny thing she says
but this lets you sort of take a
snapshot like that and turn it into like
a complete story
yeah and it's it's a good point it's all
user-generated content right and so you
can write your own story that then
anybody else can sort of read upvote it
surfaces great stories and so another
important feature that
they wanted to make sure they had
real-time counting of all of the like
voting and how many think they call them
taps that a story had gotten and you
know obviously all that was very easy
with the real-time database you want to
talk about doodle sure yeah so doodle is
an app that helps you find the best date
and time to meet people and so all you
have to do is set up a poll with a few
times you send your poll to your friends
and they can click what times work for
them and so doodle wanted to redesign
their onboarding flow and but first they
decided that they needed to stabilize
the app to get rid of all crashes
because even with the best onboarding
flow in the world it doesn't matter if
your app is buggy right so they used
crashlytics which was brand new to
firebase at the time we got that win
fabric joined our team that's correct
right so fabric joined our team just
about a year ago crash Lakes helps you
find bugs in your app and do traces and
and understand very quickly and easily
what's going wrong and what's buggy and
so doodle set this really ambitious goal
to be a hundred percent crash free user
rate meaning that a hundred percent of
their users did not experience the crash
crash Linux helps you pinpoint where the
crashes are occurring and it also
aggregates them so you can see common
crashes and which ones are affecting the
most number of people so they could
really get it much closer to zero
because they're not just picking random
things that are happening they're
focusing on the bulk of where they're
finding their problems so after they
debug their app and got it you know
super stable and they decided to test a
few different onboarding flows using
remote config so remote config is as you
know a product that lets you sort of a B
test or a BC test your app without
needing to push new versions to the App
Store or the Play Store and and so they
they ran a variant test on a couple
different onboarding flows and
ultimately they were able to get 15%
more daily active users by implementing
this new onboarding flow which they
proceeded to roll out to their entire
user base and and so for them their most
important user engagement metric that
they track beyond just active users is
the number of polls created in the app
and so when I came to that engagement
metric they got 43% more polls and which
you know it's a pretty substantial
change for a large app like doodle and
so you know for them it was not about
building and launching something new
they already had this large
action scale app out there and so they
use some of you know our quality and
growth products in order to stabilize
and then grow and kind of impact some
Bo's metrics that large-scale apps care
about yeah actually it's funny because
as I was using the app and I saw that
onboarding flow I found myself wondering
what if there are still multiple
versions like which were looking at so
we have a couple different polls going
on right now one is we're gonna pick the
best time to go for coffee and yes it
was really yes indeed and then I thought
of making one for where to go for lunch
because every day I'm finding that it's
like a huge debate between my friends
and I about where we're gonna go now we
can just make a one serve a day boom
majority rules but it's much easier
great and it was cool easy to use and I
do think the onboarding flow helps so I
guess it worked
yeah great I think we have one more
example of an app that uses firebase
that we're gonna check out the game is
called Dan the man and it comes from a
studio called half brick half brick made
the game fruit ninja as well as jetpack
joyride and several other titles huh
doing all right yeah they're doing
pretty well um and so they decided to
use firebase in dan the man and so they
decided to test one of our newer
products which launched at the dev
summit in Amsterdam in October and there
that product is firebase predictions
mm-hmm so um quick recap predictions
uses machine learning apply to your
analytics in order to surface
intelligent audience segments based on
predicted user behavior so what I mean
by that in sort of simple terms is you
know we tell you firebase tells you who
in your app is going to churn who in
your app is not going to turn who might
spend who won't spend those are all
out-of-the-box predictions or you can
take conversion events that you put into
your analytics and create predictions
based on who is going to or not to
complete that conversion event so
basically based on if you can predict
someone's going to spend you can try to
change the experience that they're
having so that you give them that option
and those who might leave you
give them some sort of incentives that
stick around which is exactly what half
for it did and so they ran a variant
test in their app so they took three
groups a control group Group one and
group two and four control group there
was no promotion for group one they took
their existing heuristic for users who
were slightly more engaged which was
completion of level three okay so for
anybody who completed level three so
upon completion of level three anybody
in this group one got this promotion and
then for the group two they use
predictions and so anybody who is
predicted to churn receive this exact
same promotion so once they ran this
experiment they found that in group two
the predictions bucket died they had 20%
higher seven-day active users and so
after seeing the success from the
experiment they took this predictions
and they applied it to their entire user
race and so now they are predictions
running on an ongoing basis and anyone
who comes into this predicted audience
segments of firebase suspects this user
will churn receives a in-game promotion
of the same kind and they used remote
config to serve that in-game promotion
and so it's very easy to take this
audience segments from predictions which
is dynamically being generated and take
a different product remote config and
affect the user experience based on what
bucket they fell into so it's a great
example of how different firebase
features can work really nicely together
and it seems like it was very effective
for them yeah yeah exactly I think
that's you know sort of the the goal of
firebase is to not just help with one
part of building your app but to provide
a whole bunch of different products that
work really well together so that you
know you can continue to kind of
leverage all these efficiencies that you
get from using multiple products within
the platform beautiful well so now I'm
hoping in the future when I'm seeing
those questions that I see from you know
Twitter Stack Overflow where developers
are wondering is firebase going to work
for me when I have you know a million
users I can be like absolutely and let
me show you some great examples now is
there somewhere that people can check
out if they want to find out more about
these cases or any other cases that we
have yeah absolutely I mean you can head
right over to our YouTube channel to see
the doodle case study we turn that into
a
we talked don't link that to perfect if
you want to read more about the dan the
man case study you can head over the
website on the firebase predictions page
right down the bottom the page you'll
see a case study about Dan the man and
the topic case study we also turn into a
video which you can link to that Suites
and wouldn't it be cool if someone
watched this and then one day we were
talking about the case study that was
there we would love to hear more about
your case studies in fact you can tweet
with hashtag built with firebase and
tell us about how you used firebase to
build an awesome app of your own yeah
actually that's one of my favorite
things is when developers they're
telling me they're using I'm like show
me what you're building I really want to
know absolutely yeah well thank you so
much for coming on and talking about
some great cases that are using firebase
some awesome apps now if you have
questions for firebase make sure you put
them on your favorite social media and
on Stack Overflow and tag them with the
hashtag ask firebase and who knows you
may see it on a future episode of ask
firebase and of course if you're
building something I really want to see
it and you can tag that with the hashtag
built with firebase thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you on a future
episode
