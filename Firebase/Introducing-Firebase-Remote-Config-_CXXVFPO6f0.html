to having an app succeed than just
building a great app you want your app
to be dynamic and responsive by
delivering fresh content to users and
quickly reacting to their changing needs
you want to test out major decisions to
make sure you're doing the right thing
before you push them to your entire
audience and ideally you want to provide
a tailored experience for each user so
your VIPs feel like well VIPs but let's
be honest that can be a lot of work and
if you're a developer without a ton of
resources that's time you'd rather spend
on other things like building your app
that's where firebase Remote config
comes in firebase remote config is a
simple key value store that lives in the
cloud but don't let that simplicity fool
you because it lives in the cloud it
means you're able to deploy changes that
your app can read within a matter of
minutes for instance say you've just
pushed your app out to the world and you
suddenly discover that you're Swedish
text contains some offensive language
how are you supposed to know you don't
speak Swedish I don't blame you but
fixing that text the old-fashioned way
would mean creating a new build and
going through the entire publishing
process again that's something that
could take days which is an awfully long
time to have nine point two million
people cursing your name but if your app
uses firebase remote config you could
change that text in the cloud through
the firebase console kind of like this
the next time your users fire up their
app remote config will grab the latest
values update your apps text and just
like that you've averted a major
international crisis or let's say you've
got a puzzle game and you're hearing
complaints from your players that level
5 is too hard if you've configured your
app using remote config you could tweak
those settings to give your players a
few more turns and push out that change
to the world but hang on are you sure
that's the right thing to do what if the
silent majority of your users actually
enjoy the challenge of a more difficult
level and by making it easier you're
going to turn away your most hardcore
and potentially highest paying customers
how could you test whether or not this
change is a good one sounds like you
need an a/b test
that's where remote configs audience
segmentation feature comes in
this allows you to deliver different
configurations to different groups of
users simultaneously so you can try out
your new level settings with half your
users while keeping the old settings
with the other half but audience
segmentation isn't just great for a/b
testing maybe you've got a feature
change that could have a major impact on
your in-app economy or maybe you just
want to double-check that some new
networking code isn't going to set your
servers on fire you can use firebase
remote config to gradually roll out
these changes trying them first with a
small percentage of your users before
pushing them out to your entire audience
remote config can also deliver different
configuration sets to your users based
on all sorts of different factors from
device type or locale to any audience
segment you've defined in firebase
analytics so you can send out one
welcome message to your new zeland
customers and another to your Australian
ones or only show your review this app
button to people who use your app every
day or you can change your home screen
experience for your customers who have
spent large amounts of money on in-app
purchases so they feel special remote
config is backed by a client library on
iOS and Android that handles important
tasks like caching dealing with flaky
connections and keeping Network requests
lightweight which is always a good thing
to give remote configure try check out

see what you build</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
