aware of what espresso and economic
films are all about so espresso is our
daily briefing product that we launched
literally two years and one day ago
would give you like five five things
that will come up in the news today to
prep you for the day ahead and it will
also give you a quick rundown of what
happens in the last 24 hours when you
were asleep it's a it's a product launch
as I said two years ago when daily
briefing products were emerging left
right and center and despite a lot of
people going down the newsletter route
we went down a native app route that is
available on iOS and on Android
economist films is a project that we
launched last year to deal with the the
problem that we have around the globe
but specifically in the US where sixty
percent of the people that ought to be
reading the economist do not know do not
know the brand and a lot of people that
do know the brand have the wrong
assumption of it so it's really a brand
awareness and a brand perception play so
we produced longer form video pieces
that cover all the topics that everyone
always thinks that we don't cover so
most people think we cover economics and
financial news economics films covers
like the bigger stories as global
warming or the war on drugs or what's
going to happen in the future with the
series feature works so when Google
announced the firebase product
officially at Il 2016 we were quick to
implemented into into one of our
products because the in the current age
of digital publishing has especially
been challenged to sort of innovate
quickly and we've empowered our teams to
to make decisions to use data to make
those decisions and then based on that
pivot how products products are working
at the economist and we use the all the
capabilities we have as a resume the
firebase platform in developing a new
feature which is called daily watch low
about that a little bit more so what I'm
going to cover today is the use of
remote config to launch a new feature
use notifications in the 82 complete
discovery as well as dynamic links for
people to share your content out onto
social media and finally show you some
of the turnkey will show you a little
bit of the turnkey app analytics that
you get by implementing firebase into
your into your apps so introducing value
watch very briefly it's a it's a it's a
daily product two to four minutes it
covers various topics like what we put
on our cover but a coffee leader is what
happened like a week of a year ago in
the news things that are becoming
topical again in the news in that
particular time and it also allows you
to get a sneak peek behind the scenes of
what happens at the Economist so you'll
have an interview with our
editor-in-chief that explains you why
we've gone for a particular cover and to
do that to build a new feature we have a
three-step checklist that we that we
came up with as part of this process so
unfortunately firebase there's a lot of
things for you but it doesn't build your
features you still have to do that
yourself so once you go ahead have your
whole team come together you your ex
designers build a feature you put it
through QA and you release it into the
market using a safe deployment approach
or any of the other approaches that you
normally use for your apps and you can
let bed in you can really see if it
works if there's anything else in the
Edit doesn't behave as you've expected
and then when you're ready for a global
reveal of your new shiny feature you
flick the switch in remote config and
within 24 hours globally across all your
platforms your new feature will go live
then in addition use push notifications
that comment part of the firebase
platform to drive attention to your new
feature but also not just look at the
metric that Steve mentioned before like
open rates which are the old old ways of
measuring successful push notifications
link them to actual and
agent in the app so what's important for
us is that how many people make it past
the fifty percent mark of a video which
shows that they don't gates with the
contents in quite a way and the great
stuff about that about the way firebase
conversion events work is that I can I
don't have to determine at design time
what what success looks like for me
there's a whole bunch of events that
come out of the box there's a whole
bunch of events that i can put in and if
i send a push notification and say i
want to test something new or i'm going
to change the wording somewhat and see
if people play play the video versus
read an article or I don't know share a
video because there's some functionality
that I want to call out to them and I
can just send a notification select the
conversion event and see if I have
success and then in addition dynamic
links it's a it's a great way when
people get excited about your feature
and I start sharing it on their favorite
social network with all their friends
those people might not have your app
installed so rather than going to do a
dead end they might end up on the
website where they can still see your
new feature your new piece for Cobb that
they might have the app install that I
go directly into the app or if you
choose to you can use it as a an app
install kind of campaign and people will
go directly into their favorite app
store install the app and enjoy the
piece of content that you've made
available for them and this is my boss's
favorite but if we have data let's look
at data if all we have our opinions that
go with mine quad came from gym box
there who used to be the CEO of of
Netscape so how are we doing so far
we've got some easy to some some some
quick early results one that I pointed
out here is how it assists us with
decision-making during sprint planning
so we all sit there we've got a shiny
design looks really nice and someone
turns around the set but it looks
shipped on this device by going into
into firebase analytics straight away
within four and half hours and in the
next couple of weeks in real time I can
see how many people this will affect so
for economist films for instance there's
a bug with the extra player in
with four point oh three and four point
oh four how many people does that affect
not enough me to really care about that
so we don't have to really put any
additional effort into it into its to
engineer around it in addition push
notifications as everyone now product
feature releases you always run at a
time so the bit that we tend to forget
is training up a operational stuff to
sort of use the features unfortunately I
didn't have to because they were
presented with this new interface and
we're able to use it straight away and
then finally how this defeat you itself
actually perform we see a great uptake
in week on week daily average engagement
measured in time so people are spending
nearly twice as long in the app than
they were before the spike you see it's
this Saturday which is obviously when
people have more time and therefore look
at the videos that we've published
throughout the week and then the deepest
sunday cuz we done published on Sunday
and the thirty percent decline in red is
also day on day rather than we can week
which is something we need to talk about
tomorrow so key takeaways remote
conflict allows you to launch globally
across all your platforms in one go tied
into your marketing campaigns and social
activity that you might do notifications
aiding discovery aiding driving people
to actually perform the actions you
design the feature for and dynamic links
for people to have a good experience
when they share out your content which
you encourage onto social media and then
finally you get the turnkey app
analytics that provide you how your
product is doing if people are engaging
with your features the way you want and
all sorts of really other interesting
things so that was me
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
