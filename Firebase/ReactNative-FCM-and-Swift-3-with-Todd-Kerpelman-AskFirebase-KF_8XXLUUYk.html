show where you ask questions with the
hashtag ask firebase and do I gotta do
the thing yeah this is ashtag ask
firebase hi I'm Todd Kerpelman I'm on
the developer relations team I spend
most of my time eating snacks but
occasionally do some iOS stuff and so
with that let's get into some of your
questions this question comes from Sam
Matthews on Twitter and Samm writes hey
ask firebase I'm a huge fan oh well
thanks Sam that's really nice so great
question moving on we oh oh wait sorry
there's a second line here are their
official plans to create a data
persistence solution for react native
please say yes so what I can tell you
Sam is that there is a very good
open-source library out there called
fire stack written by Ari Lerner he's
basically bridged like all the firebase
SDKs with react native now I haven't
used it myself but David East has said
that ari is like this crazy genius who
has put all this stuff together and
David is already way smarter than me so
by the transitive property of very smart
people I think this is probably a
library worth looking into so it's
called fire stack and we will include a
link for it down below in the
description
great question Sam thanks for askin
looks like we got another question
coming in so this question comes from
asure Preet Singh on Twitter who writes
hey ask firebase how do I do word
searching in the database good question
so word searching is not something that
is supported right out of the box
however you can do this with a library
called elastic search and we have a blog
post that will link to below that's all
about how to do this apparently it's
kind of old I think it was written in
like PHP 3 but no ok it's not that old
it was written in ojs so hopefully you
can still take a look at it and it can
give you some information you'll need to
do this kind of thing hey great question
here's one more so this question comes
to us from vineeth on youtube who asks
hey ask firebase hashtag is there a way
to differentiate between debug time
analytics and release version analytics
on iOS or Android so very good question
there are a couple of ways you can do
this now by default firebase analytics
will allow you to filter any of
your events that it records by app
version so what you can do is if you're
incrementing your app version as you're
sort of testing your release version and
your debug version and you can start to
filter by app version just to make sure
that you're looking at sort of your
release numbers or make sure you're
looking at the ones in development now
obviously sort of as you keep
incrementing build numbers maybe this
starts to get a little confusing so
another trick that I sometimes like
doing is setting a user property on the
device for people that are doing
development or testing this would
basically be something that either you
could hard code in and then remove
before you release or through some
mystical key command on the device
itself kind of activate the secret mode
that allows you to sort of label a user
as a debug or test user once you've done
that you can then set a user property
that this is not a real person it's a
development or test person and then you
can filter all your events by that user
property as well so those are a couple
techniques that I've heard out there
give one of those are try very good
question
thanks for asking let's do one more
question so this so cool I got it right
up until the beginning this question
comes to us from Nick Chong on YouTube
who writes hey ask firebase how do I add
remote message delegate in iOS the
snippet of the docs is showing an error
in Swift three so thanks for checking in
Nick the answer is that basically try
the samples now and they should work it
turns out when we updated our samples
for Swift three there were one or two
stragglers that still loved Swift 2.3
and wanted to stay there but we upgraded
them so take a look firebase cloud
messaging the sample four for Swift
should now be on Swift three and
everything should be working thanks for
checking in hopefully everything's
working for you now according to my
watch we have time for another watch
cope this next question comes to us from
a Sean on YouTube who writes hey ask
firebase what if there are two types of
users in my app for example in a
ride-sharing app there's a rider and a
driver
how will I authenticate them and take
them to different UIs so good question
interesting question basically when you
authenticate a user using firebase off
all you really get back is is a user ID
that you can then use to identify that
user in subsequent visits if you want to
distinguish between them like say one is
a rider and one is a driver that is work
that you are going to have to do on the
server now this could be something that
you set up within the firebase database
for instance with an admin type of user
you can just put people in different
categories and then firebase can look up
within the database whether they're a
rider or a driver and then deliver
different UI from there or maybe you
have your own server that actually
records this kind of stuff
either way though basically this is work
that you're gonna have to do on the
backend all you really get back is a
unique user ID for that user it's up to
you to determine what UI that user
should be seeing
alrighty Shaun thank you very much for
the question looks like we got one more
question so this next question comes to
us from Benjamin on YouTube who asks ask
firebase I really need a tutorial on FCM
on iOS so a good question or statement
as it were there's a couple resources
you should check out first Laurence
Moroney has done a screencast on how to
get started with firebase notifications
on iOS definitely check that out because
it basically uses cloud messaging under
the hood
second I will be giving a presentation
at the firebase dev summit on November
7th in Berlin on some advanced topics
for your firebase on iOS and one of the
things I will be covering is what to
look for when things go wrong when
trying to implement firebase Cloud
messaging on iOS this will hopefully be
followed up very shortly by a blog post
that you can check out as well if you
prefer reading to watching video but if
you are doing now why are you on now
anyway good question or statement and
let's move on so thank you everybody for
sending in all of your questions if you
have a question that you would like
answered on a future episode of ask
firebase hosted in social media with the
hashtag ask firebase in the meantime if
you want to stay up to date with all
sorts of firebase related news subscribe
to our YouTube channel it'll be
fantastic and then you'll also get to
see the dev summit in Berlin which
should be exciting now if you'll excuse
me I'm realizing this brick wall behind
me is not earthquake safe at all so I'm
gonna get out of here I've been Todd
Kerpelman and make sure you stand tall
on the wings of your dreams
stand tall</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
