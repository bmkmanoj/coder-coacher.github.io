third day of Google i/o 2016 thank you I
haven't even done anything yet I hope
everyone has enjoyed the past two days
met a lot of interesting developers
designers and tech enthusiasts and
learned a lot about what's new at Google
if you're like me whenever you come back
from an event like this or a conference
your team and your boss always want to
know what you learned while you were
away they want to know they got their
money's worth and especially because
this is a developer conference not only
will your team want to hear about what
you learn I want to see what you learn
though in a demo of all of those cool
new technologies you learned while
you're here at i/o so when you get a
text today at five o'clock because you
all will from your boss or your teammate
asking you to demo 9:00 a.m. on Monday
how are you going to get from zero to
app if you didn't come to this talk you
might go home and start building
something that looks like this your
mobile client makes a bunch of rest
requests to some application server
maybe it's a rails app or an Express app
and you'll spend a few hours tonight
setting it all up and by midnight
hopefully you'll have an app that makes
them successful get requests now this
application server handles all of the
hard pieces of your app such as
authentication authorization and all of
your apps business logic you'll spend
Saturday adding passport for handling
auth and fighting to sign your SSL cert
so that your app is secure in between
your VMs going down and constant
maintenance updates because they always
strike at the wrong time by Saturday
night you should be able to log in a
user via Google or Facebook but you
still need to store app data you're
missing this huge part of your app your
database so Sunday morning you'll wake
up with a head full of database schemas
and immediately start creating tables
and because you don't always get that
right on the first time Sunday afternoon
and evening are going to be wasted
making schema changes and migrating data
by Sunday at midnight though you'll have
something that you're proud to demo to
your team
when you get in and demo on Monday your
team is gonna have some questions how
are you handling authentication and
authorization what happens when your app
goes offline and most importantly what
about performance and will it scale if
your team loves this concept how quickly
can you get your app into production
luckily you guys all came to this talk
so I'm going to teach you the secrets to
create powerful apps that solve all of
these hard problems fire based
applications are not traditional apps
firebase eliminates the middle tier and
lets your devices talk directly to
powerful managed services we handle
authentication and authorization so
there's no need to implement your own
ooofff or build middleware and firebase
scales automatically so the app you
build on Monday can go into production
on Friday our smart clients handle all
of the hard pieces so you can focus on
building applications that your users
love now we've provided several core
features that allow you to do this first
a real-time database that stores and
synchronizes JSON data in milliseconds
couple that with a serverless
authentication system that handles
complex social Roth flows and session
management with ease and our newest
feature a highly scalable file storage
solution that lets you upload petabytes
of user generated content but listen to
me talk isn't going to help you demo
come Monday morning because a low-end
duo weren't enough we're going to build
another messaging app yeah and since
firebase is fully cross-platform and
we're on stage at i/o like we're not
just going to build an iOS app we're
gonna also build an Android and a web
app but since I can't type on three
keyboards at once I've invited a few of
my friends to come out and help Frank
Alfonso and Kat let's build an app
clicker Frank thanks Mike
let's see where we are hey everyone so
what Mike said we're going to be
building a cross-platform chat app today
chat app because this is firebase right
so we're going to be building it for iOS
web and androids and that requires some
prep time from the guys so let's solve
our first problem we need a place where
we can store the data the check messages
that everyone types we're going to do
that in the firebase database now you've
heard a lot about it already in the past
two days and I see quite some familiar
some familiar faces who've known as
before so this is the executive summary
for your team on Monday the firebase
database is the first firebase feature
we built we release it over four years
ago it's the original magic it's a cloud
hosted JSON database let's break it down
for your team it's cloud hosted that
means that all your data is stored in
the Google cloud and all the apps will
be talking to the same database and
that's great because that solves problem
one right we can now share the data and
it's a JSON database and that really
just means that it's a tree of values
but that is great because it being a
tree
allows us to model the data very
flexibly let's look at our data model
for today so this is the Jason tree
we'll be using today at the top we have
a node called chat and under that we
keep a list of the chat messages for
each message we keep the name of the
user that sent it and the text that they
send now back to the database itself the
firebase database is not your regular
database with most databases you work
with a request response model so you
build a query you fire the query to the
database you wait until the messages
come back our database is different we
asked today the data
is to tell us when the value changes at
the location and that means that
whenever the value changes that change
is synchronized to all other connected
clients within milliseconds this is the
original magic of firebase we make
building collaborative real-time
applications effortless let's see how
can we switch over to the split-screen
please cool now you know why they put us
on the big stage okay so we're going to
be coding all these apps in parallel
it's sort of synchronized programming
that we're doing here and I recommend
that you follow along with with the
technology you're most comfortable with
at the top-left Alfonso is building an
Android app with Android studio at the
top right Mike is building an iOS app
with Xcode at the bottom left cat is
working on a web app I think she's using
atom right I think so okay we've already
done some prep work we've built the
basic outlines of the chat app so we've
created the layouts make sure that all
the elements are available in our codes
and we've even wired up the send button
to add the message to the local screen
so you see that all of them are
basically the most sad chat app you can
ever imagine
everyone's talking to themselves happens
a lot in tech
let's see if we can make it a happy chat
app by adding firebase the bottom right
you see the firebase console this is
where you manage all of your firebase
projects I've already selected the zero
to app project which is going to be the
backend for all of our apps today we've
also already taken the configuration
data and add that to all of our apps and
that means that these apps can now find
the firebase project thank you
so Alfonso to Google services so Jason
and edited to Android studio Mike took
the info.plist edited to Xcode and cut
to the snippet of JavaScript and edited
to our web project with that all these
apps are ready to connect to their
back-end we've already included the SDKs
in each of them so we added the Gradle
dependency did a pod install and a data
JavaScript snippet so we're all ready to
start writing the actual code are we I
think we are first thing we need to do
is wire up the services so we're going
to add some code that looks up a
firebase app and gets the configuration
data from the files we added then we're
going to get the three firebase services
we are using today so we're using the
database auth and storage service these
are the main entry points into the
firebase features if you're using more
features you would just wire up more of
these services that's it you'll see how
similar this is across all the platforms
unless you're only watching the one
platform you care about of course this
is a common thing in the firebase SDK we
make sure that the SDKs are consistent
across platforms we're going to be using
the database so in the console I'm
quickly going to switch over to the
database tab you see that we have a very
empty database here makes sense because
remember we were all talking to
ourselves you might remember that we are
going to use the chat node so that's
what we're zooming in on
okay let's make sure the apps are also
looking at the same location you've used
firebase before you know what we're
doing but the syntax is going to be
different from what you're used to
so we're taking the database surface and
asking it for the root of the database
then for the chat node under it we do
that in all the apps so they're now
looking at the same location in the
database with that we're ready to start
sending messages you remember from
before that we were actually showing the
message from the local screen when the
user clicks the send button we do that
by calling the add message helper
function it's really just a tiny
function that creates the layout
elements and shows them on the screen
what we're going to rip that out we
don't need it until probably in two
minutes now we're going to send a
message to the database to do that we
take the reference that we have to the
chat node we tell it to create a message
under it we do that by calling push or
child by Auto ID now we have a location
for a new chat message we're going to
take the message that the user entered
and send it there with set value this is
all that it takes to send a message to
the firebase database while the code is
compiling let's think for a moment of
all the things we didn't have to do here
we didn't have to check for network
connectivity we didn't have to spin up
any background threads and we're going
to be doing networking here and we also
didn't have to do anything like async
tasks this is the easiest you've ever
talked to a cloud-based back-end we now
send a message it shows up in the
database
a cookie wanna check who was first who
one cat cat always wins cat is the
fastest here thanks hold on who were you
clapping for a cat or me okay
this is pretty cool right and we have
half a chat app we went from talking to
ourselves to all talking to the clouds
which on Wednesday was a challenge for
today there's plenty of clouds for all
of us to talk to so it's chilly here so
let's fix this because there's nothing
shown on the local screens anymore let's
get the data back into the apps you
remember from earlier our database we
don't request the messages and wait for
them to come back we actually tell the
database I want you to tell me when a
new message is added to the chat node
and when that happens the database fires
the so called child edit event with that
event we get a snapshot of the data for
the new chat message so we take the name
of the user and the message that they
entered we add it to the local screen
you might recognize our old friend there
at message we essentially do almost the
same as before remember
when we click the send button we would
add the message to the local screen but
now instead when you click the send
button we send it to the database when
the database tells us that there's a new
chat message we add it to the local
stream we essentially added a little
loop through the clouds if we run this
app all the messages from the database
show up on our screen
notice how little coat is was also
notice that the existing messages show
up straight away so child added fires
for all existing data instantly but when
we add a new message it's added to the
database and child edit gets fired again
and the new message shows up on all
screens I think we have a pretty basic
chat app working there but wait these
are mobile applications right
firebase does a lot of things that you
might not even realize here for example
let's say that Mike is on the BART going
home tonight and the train goes into a
tunnel Mike are we going to cut the
Wi-Fi I like to live dangerously let's
try this this was the most debated thing
about our talk so okay so Mike is in the
tunnel he doesn't have network
connectivity because not even in San
Francisco is there cell coverage in the
tunnel okay so Katherine Alfonso can
continue chatting their messages will
show up in the database and on each
other screen but their messages don't
reach Mike you also notice that Mike's
message doesn't reach the database that
makes sense but it does show up in his
own screen so his child edit event is
being fired already this is great
because it means his app stays
responsive there's no error messages
about not having a network connection
this is all hidden from you it just does
what the user expects it to do the
messages are kept in memory and are
queued up to be sent to the server so
when Mike comes out of the tunnel I
think I see like Mike I think as he lies
head for the light I'm trying ok fingers
crossed everyone we need the network to
restore Mike's messages were sent to the
server and sent to Kate and Alfonzo and
the messages from Alfonzo and heads
showed up a mic screen he didn't write
any extra code for this just ghost works
out of the box this is a common thing
with firebase ap is we make simple
things simple we hide a lot of the
complexity for you let's switch back to
slides
can we switch back to slides really I
hope so cool so in the past what was it
10 15 minutes we've created a minimal
chat application it doesn't really do a
lot yet if you want to learn more about
our real-time database I highly
recommend that you check out the YouTube
recording of a talk yesterday deep dive
into the real-time database there's also
if you want to be more hands-on there's
code labs that we're hosting out sides
you easily find them if you get out of
the amphitheatre turn left or right and
you'll see a ton of computers and
Googlers ready to help you so with that
you'll be pretty well prepared to write
your app over the weekends and show your
team on Monday that you're at least not
at 0 anymore but they'll notice one
thing straight away because I've been
calling them Alfonzo Mike and cats but
the app calls them Android iOS and web
and that's not very friendly so we want
to use their real names in order to do
that they need to sign into the app and
Alfonzo is going to tell us more about
that
right take your Frank so going back to
our application in something like 10
minutes we built an application where
Frank Mike and cat can already send
messages to each other and they get
synchronized in real time this is
already pretty amazing but it's got two
fundamental flaws first as Frankie's
mentioned the application is anonymous
and if for example someone downloaded
your application for Android their
messages would be sent for the username
Android which is not very compelling for
an app for a chat application second cat
could go ahead now and edit Frank's
messages because they're not secure also
Mike could go ahead and impersonate cat
and there's no security and force to
protect from that so we need a login
system to help us fix all these problems
in the next few minutes I'm going to
show you how to use firebase
authentication to get your users signed
in very fast to your application without
any knowledge of all the intricacies
that authentication requires at the same
time we're going to see how to solve the
two problems I just mentioned on this
year's i/o we released a new version of
firebase authentication with a revamped
set of IP is some exciting new
functionality and built on top of Google
infrastructure let's see what firebase
can help you do with firebase you can
get your user sign in using multiple
options from Google login or facebook
facebook login to your own email and
password accounts no matter what sign-in
method you use to get their users either
in firebase we always create a unique
user record that represents them in your
database this is what we represent at
the bottom of the picture we go also as
a new update this year something that
many of our firebase customers asked for
now farva's users can have more than one
sign-in method attached to the same
account this is very useful for example
if you want to let your users sign in
with Twitter and later on you want to
attach other credentials such as an
email and password account now both are
stored under the same user record
with this we've got the basics and now
let's actually build an application that
can get or use a silent and personalize
the experience for them let's switch to
the console the first thing we need to
do we need to go to the console and
enable which sign-in methods or signing
providers want to enable in our
application for this demo we're going to
be using email and password Google sign
in and facebook login okay once that's
enabled we can actually go ahead and
write some code so for this demo we're
going to be using different sign-in
methods in each of the screens if you
look at the Android screen we will be
signing our users using email and
password accounts if you look at the iOS
screen we will be using facebook login
and if you look at the web screen we
will be using Google sign-in and we're
going to be writing the code in two
steps as a first step we will be getting
our users credentials and sign-in
sending them in in your application the
key function call to look for here is
sign-in with email and password in the
case of email and password standing with
credential which takes the Facebook
token in the case of iOS and sign up
with pop-up in the case of web which
signs you in with Google and with this
we will already be signing our users in
into firebase but we need to do
something else in order to do something
useful with this we need to detect when
your users sign in to our application
the way you do this with firebase off is
very similar as what we did in the
firebase database we're going to be
listening for changes in this
implication state of your application
and when in one of the event triggers
we're going to react to the event and
update the user interface to personalize
it for our users username or email
address and with that we're ready to run
our applications and actually get our
user sign
oh not myself
okay so we can see how now some of our
users have a username we're really
personalize the experience for our users
which was one of the two problems we
wanted to fix and this took us something
like three to five minutes
if you've ever implemented a sign-in
system for your application it will
appreciate the sheer amount of building
and debugging effort firebase saves you
you don't have to break your head with
complicated all flows or any of these
other things there's also another
problem we wanted to fix which is
securing access to our database using
firebase for that I'm actually going to
refer you at the end of my section to
another talk that really explains this
in detail also some of you in the public
I'm sure will be thinking these guys are
pulling our leg they implemented part of
the authentication system but they
actually hid all the complicated parts
of building your own UI interacting with
third-party designing SDKs and all of
that work well for that I'm also going
to refer you to another talk at the end
of my section in which we show you our
newest open-source components that help
you do all of this with a great UI with
a few lines of code so with that we
actually built an application and we got
our user signed in but in order to
actually present this to our boss we
actually should probably test and it
sure if everything is working so for
that I'm going to go back to the console
and see if your users are created we
built the users panels the users panel
in the firebase console to help you
especially when you're starting to build
your authentication system for your
application here you can see the user
accounts that have been created and you
can also create and delete test accounts
that that will greatly help you debug in
your application and with that let's
switch back to slides with that we've
actually built or or signed system but
there's many other things that firebase
authentication helps you with and I'm
eager to tell you about session
management
your users hate signing into your
application if every two or three have
to sign in again I guarantee you one day
they will not come back so you want to
keep their sessions alive for as long as
possible at the same time however if a
user's device gets stolen you better
clear the session and not leave it open
this is very tricky to handle on your
own but I'm very happy to announce that
the newest version of Argus
identification automatically handles
this for you no line of code required
password resets if you support email and
password accounts in your application
your users will forget their password
and what are you going to do about it
you're going to create a one-time code
you're going to email this code to your
user and then you're going to have some
UI in which the user has to enter the
code and somehow change the password and
this once again is a pain with firebase
with one line of code we trigger the
whole password reset flow we send an
email on your behalf which you can fully
customize to better match your apps
branding with your own email and
whatever you want and we also optionally
host your own UI for resolving password
resets under your own domain using
firebase hosting this is also very easy
and saves you a lot of time and finally
anonymous accounts with firebase you can
create user records which actually don't
have any credentials attached to them
these are very useful if for example
you're building an application where you
want your users to start storing
information into a shopping cart but you
don't want to ask them to sign in yet
later on when they check out then you
ask for their credentials and you can
attach those credentials to the already
created user record this way all the
data for that user will already be there
in the database and you don't have to
handle any data migration or anything
like that again this massively
simplifies simplifies your life you
should definitely check it out and these
are some of the features the targets off
offers to make your life easier and get
your user sign-in
with lots of ease with various if you
want to learn more of how to secure your
users data using firebase authentication
check out the key to Farva security
which is already included if you want to
learn more of how to build a full
authentication system for application
all the UI with best practices and
witness with as few as ten lines of code
check out best practices for a great
dining experience which will be hosting
today at 1:00 p.m. and with that I'm
going to leave it to cat who's going to
help us take our application to the next
level
thanks Alfonzo so now we can use the
authentication and the real-time
database to build a basic chat
application but what if I want to share
a picture of the weird fruit I ate last
night if it was a strawberries or
bananas I could use emoji but this was
an orange spiky fruit with green insides
this is where firebase storage comes in
with firebase storage the new feature
you can select an image pick a file name
and just upload it and if you're a fan
of the real-time database you're
probably thinking yes oh my god I no
longer have to basics before and code my
images and if you're coming from Google
Club platform you're probably thinking
wait I thought I already had Google
Cloud storage yes firebase uses Google
Cloud storage which means when your app
grows will scale with you if you're
uploading large files or a large number
of files it also means that you can do
cool integrations like use the vision
API from cloud platform to detect when
an image of food has been uploaded and
use kubernetes to add a filter to it by
using firebase you get the power of
Google Cloud storage with a simple API
and you don't even have to write
back-end code this means you can focus
on developing the features you want to
focus on to share photos videos audios
documents whatever files you have you
can even use it for application data
backup for your users so how can we
actually add photo sharing to our app
let's get down to the code
here we're first going to create a
reference to the folder we'll be
uploading to this if you're familiar
with the database is very similar to how
we created a reference to the chat node
we're selecting here the chat photos
folder then once a user selects the
image we'll go ahead and create a
reference to where we want that file to
live and we'll just go ahead and upload
it now if only there were some way I
could magically let everyone in my app
know of all the file names as soon as
they were uploaded I would be done with
my photo sharing feature good thing we
have the real-time database for that so
we're going to add one more piece of
code which checks when the file has been
uploaded and when that happens we'll go
ahead and grab the download URL and put
it in the text box this download URL is
a public URL that means anyone who has
it can download my image but it's
unguessable that means even if you know
I've downloaded and if I've uploaded and
stored the file kittens gif you won't be
able to access it unless I let you - so
let's go ahead and run the code and see
how this works we'll select an image
upload it that'll give us the URL to put
in the text box
we'll hit Send that'll use the real-time
database to transport it to all of the
other devices and on each one of these
devices when we detect that we've been
given it an image we'll go ahead and
display it as such it's just that simple
so what else does firebase storage give
us let's go back to the slides
we'll help you deal with user access by
default we'll check if your users are
logged in with firebase authentication
but you can configure this however you
would like you can make it so that each
user has their own private folder that
they can read and write to or you can
make it such that only images can be
uploaded and they have to be less than
one megabyte in size will also help you
deal with network failures and so when
Mike heads into the mountains and hits
those areas of spotty connectivity we'll
go ahead and continue the upload once he
gets connected again so that his files
get to firebase storage and shared
across the app and if you're interested
in learning more you can go ahead and
check out our code labs today that Frank
was mentioning and I highly recommend
checking out the key to firebase
security to secure access to your files
that Alfonso mentioned so Mike what do
you think of our app I think your team's
gonna love it
thank you
by building your application on firebase
you've saved yourself and your team
valuable time and money and when your
boss or your team member asks you those
they think they're tricky questions on
how you identify and authorize your
users and what happens when your app
goes offline and more importantly will
it scale to production you'll have a
single answer firebase with firebase
your team is able to focus on building
the killer features your users love but
the integration doesn't end with the
develop products firebase is a suite of
integrated products designed to help you
develop your application grow your user
base and earn more money and firebase
products are backed by Google
infrastructure so firebase scales as you
scale this ensures the app you demo
Monday morning goes into production on
Friday and scales a year from now and if
you get stuck along the way we're here
to help
firebase has a number of other tools
that will keep you moving quickly our
high quality developer Doc's teach you
the essentials and provide actionable
steps with lots and lots of sample code
in integration with Android studio puts
firebase directly in your workflow just
update to the latest version of Android
studio and you can drag and drop those
same examples and run them live and
lastly if you have questions that the
docs can't answer have a feature request
or just want to talk to someone on our
team we have high quality free and paid
developer support I actually see all
these people who I know answer questions
on the Google group answer the support
questions that you ask and we're very
active on Stack Overflow and lastly when
you go home and go from zero to app
reach out to us and let us know what you
