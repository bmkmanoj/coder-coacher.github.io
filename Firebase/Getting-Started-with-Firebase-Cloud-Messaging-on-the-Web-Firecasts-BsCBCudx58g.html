firebase team and in this fire cast
we're going to be looking at how to add
firebase cloud messaging or fcm as it's
known to your web app with the new
firebase web SDK and what we're going to
be looking at first is how you can get
an FCM token which you'll need to
actually send a push message and then
we're going to take a look at how you
can show a notification when a push
message is received so first up let's
look at how we can get an FCM token so
here we've just got a simple web app
it's just a HTML page and it's loading
this javascript file and here we've just
got the standard web SDK code that you
get from a brand new project and to
start using messaging what we need to do
is call firebase messaging this will
then give us access to all the messaging
service and once we've got messaging we
need to request permission from the user
to actually show notifications and send
them push messages now this returns a
promise which means one of two things
can happen firstly we actually get the
permission everything's good and we can
actually start moving forward the
alternative is the user denies it in
which case we get an error in which case
you have to update your UI or kind of
indicate to the user hey you've denied
this so we can't send you any push
messages and so here we're just going to
show an error so if i refresh the page
now what we're going to get is this show
notifications dialog and all this means
is the user then has the opportunity to
say yes or no so in this case we're just
going to say allow if i refresh the page
you'll notice we always get permission
granted which is great so before we move
on to the next step of actually getting
a token there's one thing we need to do
we need to create a serviceworker file
in this case we need to just put it at
the root of our domain and call that
firebase - messaging - swgs and at the
moment we can leave it is going to be an
empty file nothing is going to happen to
it but the messaging service is actually
going to look for that file so make sure
it's available so now what we can do is
we can go return messaging get token and
that's going to return another promise
so we can just add it to the chain and
I'm going to log it just for the sake of
this demo but normally you'd want to
send it to your server so you can
actually send a message to that token
later on so once i refresh the page we
get this token now this is what you'd
actually use for sending messages to the
user so like I said in this case send it
to your server and then later on when
you want to trigger a push
you'd be basically using the FCM API
with this token so now that we've got an
FCM token we pass that to application
server which will then send to the FCM
servers and their job will be to make
sure that message arrives on the user's
device so the next thing for us to look
at is how do we actually show a
notification when that message arrives
so the first thing to call out is that
there's two ways that the message is
going to arrive first
if the webpage isn't visible all the
browser's closed the message will
actually be received in your
serviceworker file that's the point they
actually need to show a notification if
the user currently has the web page open
the push message will actually be
received inside your web page and at
that point you can show a badge or a
toast whatever you want just to make
sure they know that the event has
occurred so let's see how we implement
this so now that we've got a token it's
moved to our server we can actually
start sending push messages how do we
actually deal with those messages and
actually make it do something well the
way we do that is we import firebase
into our serviceworker file and we do
that via the import scripts function so
here we're calling import scripts we're
using the firebase SDK like you did in
the page but rather than adding firebase
yes like we normally would we're going
to add five ace - app GS now the reason
for this is the only bit we actually
need is messaging so we import firebase
- app which is just bare-bones firebase
and then we also want to add firebase -
messaging it's exactly the same URL but
we're just pulling in just the messaging
bits which is all we need so now we've
got the firebase SDK inside our
serviceworker and it's all imported and
fine the first thing we need to do is
initialize firebase this is exactly the
same as we did in our page this is just
a firebase is ready than get to go
then we're going to call fibe a stop
messaging again and because it's inside
the serviceworker it can pick that up
and it's actually just going to set up
the SDK so whenever a push message is
received it can already start working on
it and before we actually send anything
there's one thing we're going to add to
the page which is messaging dot on
message now the reason we're going to do
this is because if the users already got
the webpage open it makes more sense for
them to basically receive the message in
the page than it does to just show a
notification because that's just going
to be super annoying if you're already
on the page and it's showing up other
random bits of UI it's not good so in
this case we're just going to log it to
the console but you could pretty much do
anything you want whether you show a
little notification badge or something
else it's entirely up to you so here
we're just going to log it and let's
show an example of what's going to
happen when we send a message with the
webpage open so here I'm going to send
notification payload and the SDK is
smart enough to know that when a
notification is sent it should Eva send
it to the page or it should just
generate a notification for you with
title hello and the body world so I'm
just going to copy a kokum and this is
going to make the API call to FCM and
make sure I've refreshed the page so
it's got all the latest changes and send
and here you can see we've got the on
message event being called and we've got
a notification data right there
so if you wanted to do anything with the
message in the page you could or
obviously you can just ignore it it's
entirely up to you but if I move away
from the page the page is no longer
visible we should show a notification at
which point when we send the same
message we actually get this
notification come up saying hello world
and icon which is super awesome and
there's some other fields you can
actually set on that which will link to
in the Doc's so the only other thing
worth covering at this point is data
payloads so if you only ever send
notification data you don't actually to
worry about this but if you do need to
send data and you actually want to
manage showing notifications at like
inside the serviceworker this is what
you'd need to do so here I'm going to
send another notification but I'm going
to send data with status
whoo-hoo air works so inside a service
worker to add support for this we need
to call set background message handler
and it's very much like on message the
only difference is this will only ever
be called if the users not currently on
your web page so all we need to do is we
need to show a notification and we make
sure we return the promise for show
notification so stuff that registration
dot show notification and this is just a
normal web browser API for displaying
notifications takes the title and some
options so the title in this case is
going to be hello world and the options
we're going to make it use some of the
data from the message that we're
actually going to send so we're going to
set the body to payload dot theta dot
status because that's what we're going
to send this is a really simple basic
example but you could do anything you
want just make sure you return the self
dot registration dot show notification
promise so once we've done this I'm
going to copy the code command like we
did before and I'm going to refresh the
page so all of our changes are in and
just send another message now just like
before we've got our own message being
called because we're already on the
webpage and the main difference is we've
got the data with status woohoo it works
this time and now if I go away so in the
same message this time we've got our own
notification showing up where we've got
complete control over it so that's it
