up your app for remote config but do you
know the best way to load up and apply
these values in a user-friendly way well
let's find out on this episode of fire
cast so when it comes to using remote
configure app generally performs three
steps before it can start using the
latest and greatest values from the
firebase console first off you supply a
whole bunch of default values locally in
your code second you fetch new values
from the cloud and third you call
activate fetched which tells remote
config okay go ahead and copy these
fetch values on top of whatever old ones
you might currently have then you can
start retrieving values from remote
config and you'll either get the default
value or a newer value from the cloud
now there are several ways you can apply
this fetch and activate strategy let's
go over some of the most common ones and
so option one and the option you'll most
likely see in our sample apps is the
activate and refresh strategy the idea
is that you can start by setting new
values and then in your completion
handler you can call activate fetch to
apply these values then send off some
kind of notification or callback which
tells your app to go ahead and update
itself now this works fighting both
demos and it's fairly straightforward
which is why you will often see it in
our sample code the problem is that you
don't really know how long it's going to
take for remote config to finish
fetching these values out in the real
world and you don't necessarily want to
get into situations where your app
changes out from under your user while
they're in the middle of using it that
could get kind of awkward so another
option a lot of developers like to go
with is to bring up a loading screen
instead of starting up your app right
away you'll just show a loading screen
and then like in the previous strategy
you can fetch new values and call
activate fetched in your completion
Handler then right after that again
using a callback or notification of some
sort you can dismiss the loading screen
and the user can start up your app for
real you might also want to add a time
out to remote config does have its own
but it's about a minute long which might
be too long for your users tastes now
this technique is nice and that you're
guaranteed to almost always have the
latest and greatest values from remote
configures get into the main content of
your app the drawback of course is that
your users now have to wait to start
your app and they're impatient plus you
now have to build a loading screen and I
don't know about you but I'm lazy that
sounds like work I'd rather not do
now granted if your app already has a
loading screen then go ahead do this
work alongside everything else that's
happening during that startup process
and you'll be fine
but if you don't already have a loading
screen in your app there's another
technique I like even better which
sounds a little non-intuitive at first
so bear with me
it's the load up values for next time
strategy and here's how this works
when you start up an app you immediately
call activate fetched and this would
apply any old values you've downloaded
from the cloud in a previous session and
is nearly instantaneous then your user
can start using your a plane or Mille
now in the meantime you also kick off a
call to fetch new values and this
happens asynchronously and then the
completion handler you do nothing your
app will basically keep those downloaded
values until you call activate fetched
on them the next time you start your app
now I really like this approach because
the user wait time is down to nothing
but it does mean your user will have to
run your app a second time to see your
latest remote config now in many
situations this is fine but you will
need to decide if this kind of trade-off
is right for you you can also look into
some kind of hybrid approach remote
config lets you see when you last
successfully fetch data and so you can
look at that value and decide what to do
like maybe if it was more than 48 hours
ago you throw up a loading screen and
force the app to fetch new values but
otherwise you can just apply the current
values and fetch new ones for next time
something like that say as long as we're
talking about loading techniques in
network calls and all that stuff let's
talk about caching as I mentioned in
previous videos remote config will cache
fetched values for about 12 hours by
default before it decides to go out and
fetch new values from the cloud and this
is one of the ways we're able to keep
the service free no matter how popular
your app gets now you can shorten this
cache value if you'd like but don't
shorten it too much or you might run
into throttling either on the client
side or on the server so for most uses
of remote config is 12 our cache is fine
if your users are using your app once a
day they'll still see your latest values
every time they start off your app and
you know honestly if you find yourself
in a situation where you want to be
changing these values every half hour or
something you might want to consider the
real time database as that might be more
suited to your use case but there may be
times when every once in a while you
decide it's really really important that
your app fetches updated remote configs
right away like maybe Billy the summer
turn uploaded a bad set of values
yesterday and it's killing your in-game
economy or causing some kind of crash
and you really want to get your new
values out there faster than usual so
what can you do well one technique you
can try is sending a notification
through firebase Cloud messaging to all
your devices and letting them know that
there's an urgent update to remote
config that they need to grab your app
could handle this incoming notification
by waking up and immediately performing
a fetch with a cash value of zero and
this would make sure that it's loaded up
fresh values from remote config and the
next time your users start up your app
but I'm not crazy about this approach if
millions of instances of your apps
suddenly woke up and made a background
fetch you'd probably hit the server-side
throttle so an approach I like a little
better is when your app receives this
notification rather than making a call
to remote config make a little note
locally that there's an urgent update
pending then the next time your app
starts off and gets ready to make its
fetch call it can check and see if this
local flag exists if it does well that
means there's probably an urgent update
and your app can go make a fetch call
with a cache time of zero and this will
ensure that every new session of your
app will get the latest values from Road
config but that fetch time is
distributed across the time period in
which your users open your app instead
of all at once meaning it's much less
likely that your cost will get throttled
of course when you're done fetching
don't forget to remove this flag to go
back to your usual caching behavior now
granted this is logic you do have to
have built into your app in advance but
if you ever think that you might need to
urgently change remote config policy to
have Oh Billy so there you go kids some
tips and tricks for how to best load up
remote config got any tips to your own
after the comments below and we will see
you soon on another exciting episode of
bio tasks thanks for watching did you
enjoy this video well don't miss some
other exciting firebase content like
like this one here or or maybe
this one's my favorite I like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
