how have you been joying I oh yeah it
makes you said it's almost over so we
have a few more sessions and then we all
go home those of us in developer
relations are going to have a party
tonight so it's going to be awesome
I'm looking forward to that my name is
Doug Stephenson I'm a developer advocate
on the firebase team I've been working
very closely with the cloud functions
team on getting that product up and
running we launched that back in March
at cloud next and I have some things to
say about that but first I wonder if
you've ever thought about how to build a
transactional multiplayer realtime game
trading system so just imagine how you
might build that in a standard
three-tier three-tier architecture
if you obviously have some sort of a
client app that users are using to to
perform the trade and then they're going
to be they're going to need to be
connected by some socket to some
middleware server and that middleware
server is going to have to negotiate
those connections maintain the state of
the trade generally keep things in sync
in this system since it's since it's
real-time we can expect that there are
changing conditions and so the client
kind of needs to stay up to date of
course if there's a game there's going
to need to be some persistence someplace
to store the state of the game so
traditionally that would be like a
sequel database or something but it
would have to have some sort of a
trigger system because the things are
happening in the state of the game
that's reflected in the database that's
those changes have to get proxied back
up into the client so the client can be
aware of the changing edition so in this
game trade maybe the users are kind of
figuring out which items they want to
trade or maybe the prices of items are
changing dynamically so there needs to
be something in it needs to be a way to
flow that information back and forth now
it's also important to notice that this
needs to be transactional II say if you
can't just you know float data all
around place and expect that the
transactions at the end of the day will
happen as you expect there needs to be
some way to account for data contention
going on so think about the system how
many lines of code do you think this
would be to implement this probably
probably a lot you probably also have to
worry about things like provisioning
servers so where did where does this
middleware come from where does the
sequel database come from how do you
scale it now if you scale it you have a
whole different set of problems it seems
like a lot of work this is actually
designing something like this as well
outside the scope of an i/o talk so I'd
like to sort of dumb this down to a
simple game of tic-tac-toe you can think
of tic-tac-toe as kind of a multi-user
transactional state-based system when
you come right down to it that's what it
is there are rules for engagement the
rules are pretty easy you probably
learned how to play this as a child I
did it's easy to intuit the rules
everyone knows how to play a game of
tic-tac-toe but I don't think it's very
trivial to implement if you wanted to do
something multiplayer on the Internet so
just that just to go over how the game
works in case you haven't played you
have to decide ever at every turn is
that even the players turn you know you
can't you can't play at a turn is the
move that they're making within bounds
obviously you can't go outside this 3x3
grid is it an open space you know you
can't move other piece of players pieces
out of the way and how do you determine
if the game is over well obviously you
stop when there's three in a row
horizontally vertically or in a diagonal
but the game has to decide this right if
you're playing in person you can kind of
informally agree on when the game ends
but if you're directing this through an
online game it's going to have to make
the decision so I would actually like to
play a game I actually wrote a
tic-tac-toe game using entirely firebase
if we could switch to the demo now
there's going to be a URL oh yeah
there's reminders all right so if you if
you load that up I'm going to try to
play and I'm going to get matched with
some of you and the audience maybe
you're on the livestream who knows I'm
waiting for an opponent someone typed
that URL n by the way you shouldn't play
this game if you don't want your name up
on the screen and forever recorded on
YouTube oh hey Stephanie Vasko hello are
you in the room today oh hi Stephanie
nice to meet you all right it looks like
it's my turn so I'm going to make a move
I warn you I cannot be beat in
tic-tac-toe Oh Stephanie's making a move
I got a block oh thanks for playing
Stephanie come and see me at the 10th
I'll give you a prize afterwards all
right so to replay you can refresh the
browser and I'll play again
avanti patil are you in the room of
auntie oh hi nice to meet you also in
the same row all right so your first
Avanti all right so I'll move up here
now notice that I can I'm actually
trying to move and the game is tell it's
rejecting my moves now a little bit
about this night so good job buddy see
me in the tent afterwards in the fire
basically I'll give you a prize as well
all right so can we switch back to the
slides please all right so like I said
this was implemented entirely in
firebase the client is actually quite
dumb it actually doesn't know how to
play it's just giving me the mechanism
to make moves and everything is being
decided on the server so what I did is I
use firebase hosting so all the CSS HTML
Javascript all of that is being served
up by firebase hosting it's an edge
cached CDN so when I deploy the better
where you are in the world you're going
to get good performance I use firebase
authentication to get logged in so for
those of you who played you notice you
went through a login screen and that's
how I was able to get your your name
your profile picture so so it's a few
lines it's how they get that in there
I'm also using firebase real time
database to store the state of the game
so all of the moves that you see all the
records of all the games is all being
stored in real time database now if
you're not familiar with real time
database it's basically a no sequel
database it's hierarchical key value
pairs and it's real time in that you
actually listen to the database for
changes so if you're interested in
something you figure out its path you
register a listener and that listener
will trigger whenever data changes so
that's fairly unique so keep that in
mind that's how real-time database works
and on top of that there are database
security rules that lets you determine
how users can read and write the
database if they can read and write it
at all
of this one other feature I used I'm not
I'm not going to say what it is it's not
a secret which one it is but I would
like to at least examine what is it
look like to build tic-tac-toe with only
those four components with only those
four and I think it could be done and
the secret sauce there is in the
database security rules so if your
firebase user you probably already know
something about security rules if you
don't I'll just give you a quick primer
so rules are specified in a JSON file so
you have this is what this is saying is
the rules and then at the root level of
the database there's a location called
users and then there's a wildcard under
that called user and I'm giving that a
dollar sign to say I want to use that
value later in determining the rules so
I can say that everyone in the database
regardless of their authentic ated or
not can read this location however I can
also say that only users who have been
authenticated can write here and their
user ID must match the user ID of the
location immediately under users so what
we've done here is create a space that's
writable only by one user and that user
only you can also do validation rules so
I can say that any value written here
have to be a string and it's length has
to be 100 so the write will get rejected
if any of these rules don't match and
you can do one other thing you can write
rules that indicate something should be
checked in another location of the
database versus some information you
already have so what this rule is saying
is users can write to the chat location
of the database but only if their user
ID is listed under another location
called joined so if you're listed if
your user ID appears under joined you'll
be able to write this right this
location of the database so between all
these kinds of rules it's actually kind
of powerful you can express some pretty
you know profoundly complex rules that
dictate how users can read and write
your database so if you do this if you
write fairly complicated rules what you
end up with is a bunch of security rules
that determine how users can read and
write the database and you end up with
client code that actually does the
reading in the writing they kind of have
to stay in sync you can't change your
security rules without changing your
client code if you change your client
code you need to change your security
rules so it's powerful but it's kind of
inconvenient it's it's just it's that's
the fact of the matter if your security
rules get very complex it becomes
inconvenient it's also not
cross-platform because you still have
all this logic in the client that needs
to be duplicated for Android iOS and the
web if you're supporting all those
platforms it's also kind of difficult
when the when the rules get complicated
long and they're difficult to test and
they're difficult to debug and they're
quite frankly difficult to read as well
and it turns out there's this open
source project called fire safe and fire
safe was written by one of the firebase
engineers before he became a fire based
engineer it tries to smooth out some of
these things so what's fire safe you can
express the the rules for engagement in
a multi-user transactional system it's
specifically transactional system it
will actually generate the security
rules for you this is kind of what they
look like now I think you would agree
this is kind of hard to read right it's
kind of a it requires a lot of
brainpower my brain is melting just
looking at it I'm not even going to
bother they're trying to unpack it this
is actually the second stage in a ten
stage step of doing an in-game trade so
you imagine this times 10 this is what
your security rules look like basically
you're saying there's a role for the
person doing the trade what state are
they coming from what state are they
going to what is the signal they're
sending to the next state and all the
rules that determine how you can
progress from one state to another this
is a lot I don't you know if I was
writing a transactional system would
probably not opt to do it this way but
if you ended up doing it this way you
would end up at the end of the day with
the state machine that determines how
clients interact with the server and
interact with each other essentially
through the server so they're using the
server as a middleman to kind of
negotiate these connections now there's
another problem here is if you implement
your transaction this way if one is if
one of the clients sort of disappears at
some point the transaction is basically
dead you kind of don't have a way to
recover you know so if something goes
wrong the whole thing is messed up and
what you probably want instead is a
single source of truth for all of your
logic you don't want to split it between
the clients and security roles you'd
rather have it all in one place so I use
cloud functions for firebase to
implement this all of the game logic in
that tic-tac-toe game is coded up in
cloud functions the client actually like
I said does not know how to play
tic-tac-toe it just lets you move as
much as you want anytime you want
everything is being controlled at the
server now cloud functions is part of
the Google cloud platform
but for firebase we have additions on to
that so for firebase it's called the
product is called cloud functions for
firebase you can do things like write
database triggers so if something
changes in the location of your database
you can trigger some function and have
it do some work
you can trigger on authentication events
so when a new user signs in you
know about that and do something or if a
file is uploaded to your storage bucket
you can do something about that you can
also write HTTP triggers so you can
write basic web hooks as well but the
best thing about it is it scales up and
down so when you first deploy your code
and you only ever deployed you don't
manage servers at all when you deploy
your code it goes to Google servers
it gets it gets published and it sits
there waiting for something to happen so
if nothing happens you don't pay for
anything there's no just no action the
moment users start to use it it will
scale up and it will scale up as much as
needed to support your app it will also
scale down so if your users drop off you
can scale down to zero and again you're
paying nothing if you don't have any
activity so what I did here is I
implemented with cloud functions for
firebase the state machine that
represents a tic-tac-toe game the way
that clients interact with this game is
they express intent they don't write to
the database directly they clients just
say I want to play or now I want to move
here or I want to you know I want to
check in and I'll talk about all this
later but like I said cloud functions
decides based on that intent what to
actually do the clients aren't actually
doing anything other than expressing
intent so what I have is a command
structure the way I ended up doing this
is I use real time database as a proxy
so you write into the database to say
what you want to do then the game up
state is updated based on that intent so
sending a command basically looks like
this it's a little pseudo Cody so what
the client does is it grabs a user ID
from the currently authenticated user it
builds a path to a location the database
that it wants to write to so here the
the path to slash command slash whatever
your user ID is and we create a
reference to that with that reference we
can then push data into that location
and a push is essentially saying I want
to write an object and I don't know I
know where I want to write it but it
needs to have some unique ID so push
will create some sort of unique push ID
which is a random time-based identifier
and you can find out what that is on the
client so for my commands a command
object has a property called command
which has the name of the command in
there and then some number of arguments
maybe a 0 maybe 2 now on this on the
firebase side there's security rules
that protect how users can write into
this commands area so again security
rules under
man's and then under that the user ID
and while wild carded user ID I can say
no one could read here but only that
authenticated user can write here so
this was protected only users can issue
commands on their own behalf
no one can speak in because it's
protected by security rules and in the
database what it looks like this so
there's slash command slash whatever the
user ID is slash whatever that push idea
is so I'll call it command ID and then
the command object itself so that's kind
of how the client says what it wants to
do and in the function itself so this
was pod functions code it's written in
JavaScript for the note environment all
you really do is require firebase
functions this gives you the ability to
express what what a function can do so
in here I define a command or sorry a
function called command and the
reference is it looks just like what is
being sent on the client-side so under
slash command slash some wild carded UID
slash some wild carded push ID if
anything happens that matches this
pattern this function is going to
trigger it's going to trigger with an
event object that contains information
about what the user is trying to do so I
can pull the user ID out of the wild
card I can pull the command ID out I can
pull the command object itself from that
locations database and I can find out
that that command name that says what
they want to do and then I can act on
the command name and then there's you
know hundreds of lines of code missing
in there of course and then I'll delete
this man when I'm done so the first
thing that you saw for those of you
played the game is you got matched so I
waited for someone to play you are all
waiting for each other to play there's a
player matching part so how does this
work well the first thing we need to do
is get two players who have expressed
intent to play and then we'll initialize
a game and that becomes their space to
interact and transact this game so
there's a simple command for that it's
just match there's no arguments the
client sends that up and say I saying I
want to play then what happens with the
database that gets pushed in so under
flash commands flash you IDs Flash
command ID this command is sitting here
now when that write happens cloud
functions kicks in and says I can do
something now so the way I implement
matching is that there's another
location of the database under slash
matching and it has two states there's
only two states that can be in it's
either empty meaning no one's waiting to
play or there's a UID there which
indicates that there's someone waiting
to play and what the code does is it
basically flips that toggle it either
accepts a new person into that waiting
room did this Lobby or it matches the
existing person with someone someone
else who wants to play
now after we've matched two players we
need to create some sort of game space
for them to play in so I've defined a
simple object that contains the player
one user ID the player two user ID the
user ID of whose turn it is and in this
game player one always gets to go first
and then there's a list of moves and
this moves sort of accumulates all of
the things that that both players have
done and then there's an outcome at the
end so that can be either player one win
or a player to win or it's hi and a move
is just a simple number of the player
the x-coordinate the y-coordinate of
vocation so this this is the game state
this this holds the state of the game of
tic-tac-toe so what I'll do is I'll push
this under yet another location of the
database under slash games because we're
pushing it will generate some random
game ID but you know we don't know what
that is until the push happens and then
the state object goes under there now we
have a little bit of a problem because
the clients need to know what's in here
in order to play they need to know so
you know so we could render on the
screen what the tic-tac-toe board looks
like so the question is how do we get
that game idea the client so they can
listen to it they don't know what the
game idea is the push happened on the
server not on the client so what we need
is a way to notify players that
something changed so the way I chose to
implement this was to create another
location of the database called Flash
Player underscore States and under there
there's some user ID that matches the
user that's playing so what happens is
the cloud function will write the game
ID into this location telling the user
hey you're in a game here it is and then
what happens is the clients can turn
around use that game ID to construct the
path to find the state so this is what
happens when you get matched you move
into the game the client is saying oh
I'm in a game now I need to transition
to the game screen and now I need to
render what's in that game state so the
player can see what's going on so now we
have to figure out how do the users
participate in this game they kind of
make sense to let people write their
moves into the database right that's the
first logical thing to want to do but I
don't actually want to do that I
actually want to assume that the clients
are malicious that they're going to send
me bad data that they're going to move
in Val they're going to move out of turn
I don't want to have to trust my clients
I don't I don't
I'm just fundamentally distrustful I
don't know it's something about me I
would rather have that decision being
made on the cloud function side so what
I'll do is actually
knocked down read access so that entire
games node no one can read it I'm sorry
no one can write it but everyone could
read it so this makes it so that every
game is essentially public if you know
the game ID now you can observe the game
if you didn't want that you could go
further and try to lock down access to
different players so if you have the
player it's so with p1 UID MP to UID you
can tell a real-time database only let
these players see what's in the database
oh you can do that if you wanted and the
security rule for player states is also
locked down to just that users user ID
so when we push data into that location
only the user who can see that right
it's locked down to that user ID and no
one else can read it so to actually make
the move now we need to start to
implement the rest of the state machine
and I won't go into detail it's kind of
I think it's kind of obvious like I said
you know you players have to take turns
they have to make valid moves we have to
check for a win and then we'll end the
game so there's a command called move so
when players are in the game their issue
a command called move and they're the X
Y coordinates for the location now this
was going to get pushed into the
database under commands flesh you IDs
push ID slash you know move and then the
college function is going to trigger and
handle this move the only way we can do
this safely is with a transaction
because we have to assume because the
clients not restricting you you can move
whenever you want you know you can do
what it you can you can try to cheat as
much as you want but this cloud function
because it's transactional because it's
basically handling the contention for
all those move can do this safely so
well-constructed 2d representation of
the lifts or of the move of the sorry of
the move list will check the validity of
the move will simulate the move in
memory check for a win and then update
the game based on that so if someone
tries to make an invalid move will stop
and not even update the game it'll just
fail and then we can actually send a
message back to the player saying you
know you can't move there so we do want
to notify the players after the move of
the of the state change that happened
now you might be wondering if clients
are listening to that game data if they
can see the game well certainly they saw
that there was a move but I want to
personalize a little bit I don't want I
don't want the player to have to guess
if it's their move and I don't want them
to have to guess why their move was
rejected they moved out of order so what
I want to do is use that player States
area over again and say we have the game
ID that's great but I also want to send
a message to the user and say it's your
turn now or it's we're waiting for the
the player or you made an invalid move
or the game is over you can't move
anymore so we can put messages in here
and again it's the server that's
deciding these messages it's not the
client we don't the client again doesn't
know how to play the server knows how to
play and it's telling the client how to
play now there's a more generalized
pattern here so in my system things come
in through commands and out through game
and the player stage you can think of
this much more generically so imagine a
system where you have a commanded
response cycle so say you push commands
into the database and cog functions fix
it up and then it writes a response back
now when you push that command and you
get a push ID the client knows what the
push idea is because it pushed it in
there that it can turn around and listen
to a known area for that response so
notice the command ID is the same you
can do this to implement kind of a
transactional system and you might be
looking at this thing
well this just looks like an HTTP
transaction right why don't I just do
HTTP request/response that's a good
question you could implement this this
way but I think there's a certain
benefit to using real-time database and
cloud functions it's sort of the
middleman here so this is actually
resilient to connection problems so I
don't know if you've ever encountered
this problem if you have an app that's
making HTTP transactions it wants to do
a write operation but the connection
gets cut off do we know if that write
finished well we don't we didn't get a
response
so do we retry that or is it safe to
retry that or can the serve a detective
it's a retry we don't really know that
that connections lost the context is
gone but if you're using real-time
database as a middleman here you're
pushing that command in the database and
then real-time database just
synchronizes and it synchronizes once
and only once you don't have to worry
about a retry so when you push that
command in there you can be fairly
certain if the user has a data
connection that it will hit a cloud
function once and exactly once and so
there's a benefit to that there's also
authentication built in here so you know
if you use the user ID as sort of a way
of filtering who can write at what
locations you you actually have
authentication built in for free so you
don't have to do that over like an HTTP
connection that you would normally this
is also helpful for Android apps so I'm
an Android developer I don't know if you
are Android developers web developers or
iOS developers but Android apps actually
have a very particular problem where if
you have an orientation change
activities get destroyed and they come
back
and now you've lost your context right
you have to figure out how to
reconstruct the state of the new
activity based on the old one again this
is a this is a problem particular to
Android apps but this losing of context
has to be dealt with you can't not think
about it so you end up using something
like a loader or a headless fragment or
you know I have some other scheme of
trying to figure out how to how to keep
the thing that was going on in the one
activity going again as a second
activity and those those are kind of
problem in it I just don't like to think
about those problems if you're using
real time database as sort of a
middleman for doing pushing commands to
clog functions all you really need to do
is remember that command ID once you
push a command in there just remember
that string persist that into your new
activity you can pick up where you left
off just listen for the response and
expect that it will happen so I think
that's kind of neat now that's basically
how the game works there's a problem in
this game with ghosted players so
imagine you're in a game you know you
can't win what do you do if you don't
want to chalk up a loss you might just
close the browser window or kill the app
that's kind of unfair the person who's
winning should get that win right so how
do you deal with this how do you know
when someone pulls out unfairly so
there's a couple things you could do
here you could do like a scheduled ping
so if you think in like maybe I can ping
the game every once in awhile and check
to see if someone's gone or they haven't
moved in a while you could do that it
turns out Club functions doesn't really
have a way to schedule like cron jobs or
act jobs would be really nice I think
that the team is working on that but we
can't do that today if you're using real
time database you might also be tempted
to use on disconnect handlers so with
real time database you can schedule week
you can arrange for a certain location
of the database to change if a client
connection goes away you could use that
to determine if they're gone but I don't
really like that either
I think mobile connections are generally
kind of flaky so I don't know if you
know but you know if you're on Wi-Fi and
then you switch to mobile or you're
switching between towers you you know
you're in the basement you don't have a
good connection for a while I don't want
that disconnect to sacrifice the game I
would rather you know let the user drive
through the tunnel come out on the other
side and still be able to keep playing
if you use a non disconnect Handler you
still have that problem so I would
rather not do that OOP I went too far so
instead what I did is I did a periodic
client check-in
so the idea is the game that the client
doesn't know how to play the game but it
knows how to say I'm still alive so
periodically it'll run a function called
check-in that will basically ping the
game and say I'm still playing I'm still
here I'm not gone yet and what happens
is again we'll create a transaction on
that game that the user is playing and
what happens is the player one check-in
basically looks at player two and says
that they haven't played that if they
haven't checked in a while I'm going to
make them forfeit the game it's the same
way for player two going to player 1
player 2 their check-ins will
essentially force player 1 out if
they've been idle for a long time so
this is kind of a way to work around the
inability to schedule something or the
inability to you know just run something
at an arbitrary time now this game
I would like to open-source I have an
open-source yet I kind of scrambled to
get this done at the last minute so if
you want to follow me on Twitter I'm
coding Doug and I'll I'll post that
there also for those of you at home
watching on YouTube I'll try to get that
link embedded in the description below
so be sure to stay tuned if you want to
see how it works the project is
relatively small I would say it's about
200 lines of JavaScript on the client
and I'm not using any frameworks it's
just straight JavaScript on the cloud
function side it's about 700 lines of
code which is not that much and a lot of
that is scaffolding and doing the
transactions it's actually not that
complicated and you'll see that the
client is so dead simple and it's great
because you know you know you don't have
to depend on the client being you know
compromised I just kind of assume that
people will hack clients I assume that
people will hack games you can see in
this game I'm not even trying to prevent
anyone from hacking anything everything
is controlled on the server ok so how
might we improve this so this is a
pretty simple game it was put together
in basically a you know a handful of
days how how might we improve this so
one thing we could do is implement a
leaderboard with a Web API so we might
have you might be able to remember what
users are doing in your app you can you
could create an HTTP cloud function that
can access that leaderboard data and you
can populate that in your website so
that might be kind of neat you could
also create an in-game chat you know
firebase apps are are very well-known
for big chat apps a lot of times
everyone wants to know how to use
firebase to put chat in your apps the
firebase did
from it came from roots as a chat system
so you could implement this as well you
could also post game results to a flak
via a web hook so say you're in a
tournament system is a very high profile
game going on and there's a lot of
people in a slack sort of chatting about
it you could use a slack API to post via
their web hook and notify everyone that
the game has completed and what the
outcome was you could also use cloud
functions to create some sort of
resistance to bots so like I said I kind
of assume people are going to cheat all
the time and that includes creating BOTS
that will try to play the game very
effectively maybe more effectively than
a human you probably want to stop that
if you're you know playing for money or
playing for points or playing for
prestige so you probably want to
validate that the user is a real user
the Google has some API is something
called reCAPTCHA you click that little
box to prove that you're human you could
wire that up into cloud functions and
make sure that no one can play until
they've satisfied their reCAPTCHA that
validates their humanity basically and
that's all I have for today if you have
any questions about Club functions or
firebase or anything I'm going to be in
the tent next door if you have any
comments or concerns about you know is
called functions right for you or is
firebase right for you up let me know we
have a bunch of people over there
firebase staffers myself would be local
would love to talk to you about how
firebase can work for you don't forget
we have documentation we have a YouTube
channel with a lot of tutorials we have
a blog I contribute to all those let me
know the kind of stuff that you're
interested in I could make material for
that and thank you very much I hope you
enjoyed the rest of your day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
