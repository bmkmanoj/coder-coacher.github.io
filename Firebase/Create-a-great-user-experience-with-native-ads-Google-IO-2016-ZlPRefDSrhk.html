AHA's and I'm a product manager on the
AdMob team here at Google and today
Andrew Robb Justin and I are gonna talk
to you about how you can create a great
user experience using native and
rewarded ads in your app but before we
get started
it's worth mentioning that all of the ad
formats that we're talking about today
are available on the AdMob platform
AdMob is the world's leading mobile
monetization platform powered by Google
and every month over 1 million apps use
AdMob to monetize their business native
and rewarded ads which we're talking
about today are just the latest
additions to the AdMob platform before
we dive deep into native and rewarded
ads it's worth taking a look at the
evolution of ad formats and apps over
the last several years
first banners emerged as the primary way
to monetize your app you place the 320
by 50 pixel ad at the bottom of your
screen and you'd probably leave it there
at all times and if the user was
interested they would tap on the ad to
learn more a few years later
interstitials came on the scene
interstitials would take up the full
screen real estate so they provided a
richer landscape for advertisers to
deliver their message and in addition
they provided publishers with increased
ad clicks and ad revenue the other nice
thing about interstitials was you could
place them in natural possible points in
your in your app for example in between
the levels of a game so you didn't have
to keep an ad on-screen at all times
today the latest evolution of ad formats
and apps really revolves around native
and rewarded apps so I'm going to talk
some more about native and then Justin's
gonna talk about rewarded you might be
asking what exactly does native mean it
seems like needed was the hottest
buzzword in the advertising industry but
everyone has their own definition of
what makes an ad actually needed for us
at Google it means that the publisher
controls the look and feel of the ad and
styles it in such a way that it matches
the rest of their content let's take a
look at a real app that's using AdMob
they're native ads to better illustrate
what this means so this is the simple
radio app by streamer and it's actually
built by our friends Franco and Patricio
who are in the audience today and this
act the simple radio app offers users a
feed of radio stations that they can
choose to listen to and the first
element in the feed is a native ad and
the native ad uses the same fonts colors
and styles as the other elements in the
feed so it really fits in and feels
natural in the context of yeah now why
is this valuable why would you actually
want this well we think there's three
main reasons why native ads are valuable
first it's better for users instead of
showing a one-size-fits-all banner that
might clash with your visual design you
can show a native ad that fits in and
won't be a drawing experience for users
second we found that native ads perform
better for advertisers in our beta
version of native we saw that
advertisers saw a 16 percent increase in
lifetime value from the users that they
acquired using native ads versus the
users they got from traditional ad
formats
similarly publishers our app developers
saw an increase in performance as well
again in our beta we saw that publishers
got three times higher CPM or revenue
per thousand impressions on their native
ads versus the non native ads in the
same apps that's pretty significant so
now let's take a look at one particular
app that we think really exemplifies all
these different ways that native ads are
valuable this is the happy fish app it's
a game by happy elements and it's a game
that takes place in an aquarium where
you interact with different fish and
different sea creatures and in
particular if you interact with this sea
creature whose name is yellow apple he
tells you that he's found a message in a
bottle and he asks if you want to see
what's inside and if you say yes he
opens the message to reveal an ad and
this is an ad that's promoting another
app and I really like this example for a
few reasons from a user perspective this
is awesome because your interaction with
the ad is the same as the types of
interactions you have with other
and some yeah in the game and it feels
really natural from an advertiser
perspective this is great because anyone
who interacts with your ad is really
engaged and interested in the content
and from a publisher perspective this
was awesome because the publisher who
used this this particular game saw a 6x
increase in their revenue per impression
which is pretty big so hopefully at this
point you're pretty convinced the native
ads are a great value proposition and
you're just wondering how can I get
native ads in my app today
well up until recently you have to do
something like what you see on the
screen where we'd send you a bundle of
assets like a title description and some
images and then you'd have to dedicate
engineering time to write the iOS or
Android code to render these elements
and put them in your app and then if you
wanted to make any changes to the look
and feel of your ad you'd have to push
out a new release of your app frankly
that seems overly complicated and too
hard and there has to be a better way so
today we're thrilled to announce and
introduce native ads Express native ads
Express is a really simple and easy way
to create native ads on AdMob you just
follow a few easy steps and you'll have
native ads in no time first you pick an
ad size next you choose a particular ad
template from a variety of different
choices and then you customize your ad
using CSS and here you can basically
make the ad look exactly as you want it
whatever your look and feel that you're
looking for and you can also pick what
type of ads you want to show for example
you can choose to show app install ads
which promote other apps you can show
content ads which from a website or you
can show video ads and you can mix and
match these different ad formats as you
see fit and once you're done doing that
you just add a few lines of code in your
app no more than you would for a banner
and voila
you'd have native ads and we're really
thrilled to announce that this native
ads Express is available to all app
developers on AdMob comm starting today
so please go check it out
and to prove to you just how easy it is
to use these native ads Andrews gonna
give you a live demo all right hi
everybody I'm Andrew Brogdon I'm a
developer programs engineer working with
the mobile ads SDK team and I'm going to
show you just how easy it is to code up
an implementation of native ads Express
full disclosure I rewrote and
re-recorded everything you're about to
see it like 3:00 a.m. this morning so
there might be some surprises in here
for all of us really we're going on an
adventure that's that's that's the point
I'm trying to get across and here's
here's the adventure we're gonna do so
there's three steps to getting a native
ads Express implementation going in your
app first thing you want to do you want
to make a new ad unit ID with a CSS
template you do that at apps AdMob comm
once you've done that you go into your
app you add a native Express ad view to
your layout and then you use that to
load an ad so let's take a look at step
one this is making an ad unit with the
CSS when you go to apps AdMob comm
you'll see this this is step one to
making an ad unit you pick a size for
your template we have three sizes small
medium and large and they're general
sizes they all have a range of Heights
and widths that work with them so you
pick one of these then you pick a
particular template we have a whole
bunch for each one you can pick one of
these it starts you off on your ad it's
the basic elements in there right and
then you get to the CSS editor alright
and the CSS editor like my deep fat
fryer at home is where the magic happens
okay this is where you can make the ad
presentation yours you can customize
fonts colors positioning things like
that sizes so imagine I I don't like the
size of the font here for the the link
on my ad I can come in and I can put a
font weight on it a bold and you'll see
I get a live preview right there on the
right so I can see my ad as I'm editing
it and at the end of this process you
get an ad unit ID that you can take into
the next steps of the process and I'm
going to switch the video right here
thank you so now I made Android studio
I'm going to do an Android
implementation
I have a very simple app here as you can
see just some blues and some greens
because you know I'm a winter that's my
color scheme and I just want a native
and adjective Express ad on the middle
there so the first thing I do is go into
my layout and there's my layout file if
you're an Android developer you're very
familiar with these these define where
your user interface looks like and we're
gonna add a new tag for a native Express
ad view there we go and it's got a
layout height and width of wrap content
so it'll flex with the content of the ad
and fit my layout now I'm gonna add an
attribute for an ID this is so I can go
find it in my activity later I'm just
gonna call it ad view yeah there we go
and I want the ad to be centered so I'm
just gonna put some layout gravity I'm
using a linear layout here so I'm just
gonna put Center horizontal in for my
layout gravity and now there are two ads
attributes that I'm gonna add first is
an ad size and if you're familiar with
banners one of the first things you're
gonna notice here is that I get to put
in a specific height and width that I
want with native ads Express you are not
required to use predefined sizes you can
specify the height and width that work
for your design and your layout if I
wanted 350 by 200 I can do that if I
want 497 by 152 I can do that and the
last thing I need is that ad unit ID
from before so this is the ad unit ID
that I made at apps AdMob comm with the
CSS template associated with it and
that's it
so one tag for my layout and that gets
my native ad where I want it all right
so let's go into the activity now and
see if we can load it in alright so
here's my activity and I'm gonna add two
lines here two in the first one is -
there we go
I'm gonna go find my native Express ad
view using fine view by ID this is again
a very common thing I'm going to use the
ID value that I gave it before and now I
have a reference to that ad view I can
make one call to load an end
and I'm already running it that's how
quick native ads works and so you can
see I have two lines of Java one layout
tag and I get a native ad that looks
this good so one plus two equals this
that's how easy it is thank you thank
you I wrote none of the stuff that makes
this possible but that took like two and
a half minutes who wants to see some mad
science we got a little time here okay a
few people in the back cool so the first
thing I want you to remember is how easy
it is a little code on the mobile side
it takes to get up and running with this
the other thing I'd like you to remember
is they those CSS templates that you saw
me make you can update those without
redeploying your app those are on the
server you can change those pretty much
whenever you want and 20 minutes later
you'll have a new ad presentation in
your app live so let's see what we can
do with that could IAB test that way can
I roll my own experimental sorta a B
testing maybe let's try it so there's
four steps I'm gonna do here I'm gonna
make a new ad unit it's the same size
and same template but with slightly
different styling I'm going to tweak the
CSS to make the button a different color
I'm gonna modify my app to show that ad
unit half the time so I'll show one of
the to half the time each then I'll
check my reporting and then afterwards
I'll update the losing template to match
the winner all right so let's see how
this works I'm gonna go make a new ad
unit I'm backing out Apps admin comm and
I'm gonna go pick the same size that I
was using before and I'm gonna use even
the same template I'm just gonna make a
small change there we go
and I'm gonna go over to the CSS and I'm
gonna mess with the button so I got the
C green install button you can see with
the call-to-action on it let's change
that maybe a nice salmon you know summer
is coming and I'm gonna bold up the font
I'm gonna put a font weight on the on
the install there the call to action
itself so I've got that change I'm just
scroll down I'm gonna hit the validate
style button this is at the bottom of
the editor it lets us know and lets you
guys know that your CSS is where it
needs to be and with that I'm going to
give it a very memorable name I'm going
to call it i/o ultra
it and I'm gonna save it so now I have
to add units to play with one of which
has that original button and what if
much has that pink button and we'll see
which one does better so I'm gonna go
back into Android studio now and I'm
gonna make it so my app shows this ad
this new ad unit half the time so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and make a
copy of my layout I'm gonna make it so I
have to I have a main one and an
alternate I'm just gonna do a
straight-up copy and paste here there we
go
and I'm gonna mark it up I'm gonna
change it from hello world - hello
alternate world just so you can see that
we're using that different layout then
I'm gonna go down to the bottom and I'm
going to swap out the ad units there we
go so now I have two layouts one using
my original ad unit one using my second
ad unit alright let's go put these to
work in the activity so I'm going to go
in here and my set content view is using
the same layout every time so let's
change that and I'm gonna get a random
boolean and if it's true I'll show one
and if it's false I'll show the other
and I admit before we get into the like
random number generators this is not the
most scientific way to do this but for
the purposes of an example it works out
great so half the time I'm going to show
one layout half the time I'm going to
show another let's run this and see what
happens so I'm gonna run it and so
there's my original ad that's the one
layout let's run it again see what we
have and there's my pink button so half
the time I'm getting one half the time
I'm getting another so that's one and
two now we let we put this out in the
world we let it go out a few weeks we
give it a chance and then we check the
reports and for me this is what check in
the reports looks like incidentally I'll
be appearing in home alone five coming
to a theater near you this holiday
season so we check the reports we find
that one of them is outperforming the
other and so we update the losing
template to match the winning template
and now we have if we want it a hundred
percent of our traffic using a template
that we verified performs better and
just to make a little bit of a point on
it you can do all kinds of stuff I'm not
a hardcore CSS guy but you can do all
kinds of funds
in here you can mess with fonts you can
mess with fonts sizes you can mess with
button colors background colors if you
want a day glow yellow add for some
reason because that's your thing you can
totally do it
and now I'm going to switch you back and
that's native ads express thank you
alright and so that's one of the two
rich formats that we're talking about
today the other is rewarded video
mediation and we have the very talented
Justin McKay he's going to talk to you
about that and away we go
nice gentleman also a product manager at
AdMob games today are amazing incredibly
rich immersive experiences actually just
came back from a trip to Asia we're
tapping games are all the rage so
basically you tap frantically on a phone
to bake bread to raise a plan to advance
a character in some way basically it's a
repetitive strain injury waiting to
happen and as you can see I've been
playing those games with my feet I
digress but as games have evolved so
have monetization options rewarded ads
have been one of the biggest tasks from
our developer friends for a while but if
you're not familiar here's a quick recap
I'm playing a game and I die I'm
presented with a choice I can wait for
10 minutes or I can spend my hard-earned
coins recommend the game to a friend or
watch a video and come straight back to
life when done well rewarded adds add
value for all parties they are opt-in
integrated experiences a quick recap on
mediation so mediation allows you to
call multiple networks from a single
platform this helps ensure there's
always an ad to show in your application
under that ad is helping you make the
most money at AdMob we want to build a
platform to support all of your
monetization needs rewarded has been a
gap and I'm pleased to announce that we
have closed that gap rewarded mediation
is now available in AdMob these seven
great rewarded networks have now been
added to the over-40 networks we already
include in regular mediation we want to
make it simple for you to experiment
with rewarded eyes we want you to be
able to try different networks in
different orders with different reward
settings as such reward and waterfall
settings are stored at the ad unit level
we store this information server-side so
you don't need to change your code in
order to experiment with new
configurations and we give you tools to
back
performance with our ad network
optimization product we automate the
process of fetching the ad from the
highest-paying network and optionally
you can use frequency capping to
preserve the user experience so they
don't get bombarded with ads constantly
so a little more on ad network
optimization mediation on its own isn't
quite enough see PM's across networks
fluctuate throughout the day many times
managing that complexity across multiple
networks manually is really difficult
and is frankly like spinning plates when
you enable ad network optimization AdMob
will automatically fetch the ad from the
highest paying Network and return that
into your application this helps ensure
you maintain a high level of revenue so
six of the seven networks are fully
supported with country level granularity
and that country level granularity is
actually very important
just taking a global average for a CPM
is not enough because the variance
across countries could be significant
you need that level of control and we
give you that controller so setup is
really straightforward on this screen
you can specify your reward settings you
can choose to preserve values your set
with third-party networks or you can
override them with values we store on
Google servers and you can set your
frequency cap to the day hour or minute
and of course measurement is critical so
you'll be able to see you rewarded
queries starts and completes in your
mediation reports so I'm really pleased
to say that we've worked with a lot of
publishers very large I'm very small
since we launched this at GDC two months
ago and adoption has been really
fantastic and I look forward to working
with as many of you as possible as we
grow the Babak going forward and I'm
gonna hand over to Ram he's going to
show us how simple it is to get up and
running with rewarded mediation in unity
thanks Justin
so my name is RAM and I'm a developer
programs engineer on the mobile ads team
and today I'll be continuing our talk on
roryd video mediation so roorda video
ads naturally a great fit for mobile
games and if you're a mobile game
developer chances are using some kind of
game engine for your mobile app
development unity being one of the most
popular options out there so just a
quick show of hands how many of you guys
here are unity developers or have used
the unity platform before at least a few
you guys so just be clear rawrr did
video mediation is supported for
standard implementations on both Android
Island and iOS excuse me by the Google
mobile ads SDK on both respective
platforms but for the purpose of this
talk I will be focusing on our unity
support so our Google mobile ads unity
plug-in completely open-source if you
guys want to take a closer look at its
inner workings just hop on over to our
public repo and you can if you'd like to
take more of a direct involvement
approach we do accept pull requests if
you'd like to see things like API
changes or you'd like to make feature
requests or github issue tracker is the
best place for that because it is
completely open-source you are free to
fork excuse me fork the plugin as well
if you have any kind of specific
implementation requirements now one of
the big mantras of unity has always been
build once deploy everywhere and our
plugin stays true to this we offer a
single c-sharp interface for you to
request and display ads on both Android
and iOS without ever having to write any
objective-c or Android Java code and
finally one of unities calls to fame has
always been its ease of use you can
rapidly prototype and easily deploy
great-looking applications with minimal
time invested and effort our plugin also
tries to hold true to this theme by
requiring minimal code and effort for
you to integrate ads into your existing
applications and just to drive that
point home I'm gonna quickly demo how
easy it is to
intergrate wrote a video mediation into
an existing unity application now Andrew
here was able to get native Express up
and running in two lines of code and
impressive feat and not something I'm
gonna be able to match here but in my
defense
Rorty video ads or videos they move
they're cooler i only kid so let's take
a look at our integration so this is the
app we'll be integrating our ads into
it's called the rollerball demo
application it's available as part of
unities intro tutorials the premise of
the game pretty straightforward you have
a ball rolls across the plane you pick
up game objects and in the lower right
of your screen you do have a score
that's reflected once the game's over
pop-up dialog comes up and you're given
the option to play again so let's
integrate absent here just start one
import the Google mobile ads unity
package this will get give us everything
we need to get up and running with ads
and once we've imported this package we
could dig into some code let's hop on
over to the script attached to our game
ball and will declare the Google mobile
ads API namespace we'll be using once
we've done that we need a reference to
our roar'd video object
because our roryd video object is a
signal tim has a consistent state across
all scripts in your unity application
that does mean you could request ads
from one script and display them as an
at another this is a win for you because
you're not forced to re-request ads as
your user moves throughout different
parts of your game now it wouldn't be a
rewarded video without the reward so
you'll need to know when to roared the
user we do this by hooking into the on
add rewarded event so we'll write a
quick event handler that hooks into this
event it will have a reward argument
which provides us information on both
the roared type and the reward amount
we'll take this reward amount and add it
to our existing coin count so once your
user watches our video their coin count
will increase so let's move on over to
implementing our actual ad request for
an ad request you will need an ad unit
ID those of you guys who are already
using AdMob or DSP are already familiar
with that unit IDs they define a unique
ad placement within your application
these ad unit IDs are platforms specific
so here we're using platform directives
to choose the appropriate ad unit ID
depending on whether we're deploying to
Android or iOS we'll also be using an ad
request object we use this to pass up
some targeting information for the
purposes of this demo I'll be using a
plain J an ad request object and our ad
unit ID pass to our load ad method
so when Rick excuse me by virtue of
being videos or did videos are larger
and require more time to download then
ad formats such as banners or
interstitials so it's always best
practice to download or to make these
requests as early as possible ideally at
app launch in our case we will be adding
our ad requests to our reset game method
this means every time we start a new
game at the beginning of the game will
request a reward based video ad
now that we've requested a reward-based
video ad we also need to show it as
Justin mentioned roar'd based video
should be an opt-in experience the user
should be presented with a clear option
to watch a video in return for an
incentive or reward so let's move on
over to our window function which
determines the layout for a game /
pop-up dialog we'll add an additional
button here we'll change the text to
watch video to make it clear to the user
that they'll be watching a video once
they press this button when pressing yet
we'll call the roared based video show
function
we'll also wrap this in a conditional
statement so this button is only shown
when our ad has indeed loaded we do this
by checking the is loaded method on our
roared based video object and there we
have it
roar based video ads integrate it into
our unity application let's take a look
at our finished product
as you can see I've gone quite good at
this and there's our popup dialog and
you can see our third button which
presents us with the option to watch our
video once we press it we get immersive
warded video add content and once the
ads over we can see our coin count has
increased by 20 so there you have it it
took us 10 to 15 lines of code less than
three minutes or so and I'm already
monetizing with roar'd based video ads
and now I'm gonna hand it back over to
Justin who's gonna finish off our
presentation for us thanks Ram it was
awesome to see how quickly he was able
to get rewarded mediation up and running
within the unity platform so I just
wanted to hit the main points so that's
great as developers why should you care
well because the user for the user it's
an opt-in experience users tend to be
more engaged with the content for
advertisers rewarded ads offer a rare
opportunity to have their content
consumed in full this translates the
higher value for publishers like SC PM's
tend to be fired but it's not just the
money so a lot of the partners we've
worked with have reported that when they
measure rewarded versus non rewarded
cohorts that there's a strong retention
and satisfaction among the rewarded
users versus their non rewarded
counterparts and in fact some of the
publishers we've worked with have
reported up to 5x increase in our poo
for rewarded users versus non rewarded
and so I hope this gives you a good
overview of these exciting new formats
how simple it is to experiment with them
and we hope you'll consider using them
as part of your broader monetization
strategy and that's it
sure honey so I think we have a few
minutes if anyone has any questions guys
will come back up and I also I'm gonna
put our resources on the on the screen
here I know somebody like to take
pictures so you can take pictures of
link and check them out later Wow and I
all right hi can i display put banner
and lady back in the same screen on the
same screen
I don't know if we actually have a
second I have a recycle view and I'm the
native app inside the like the item you
think of you but like when you have
users prone down the Nakia in where now
but at that time I want to display the
banner at the bottom of those wait you
know in separate activities for example
no Queen okay I think as long as you're
using different ad units and different
slots technically you can show the
different types of that so you can mix
and match the types of ads that you show
as long as they're in different slots in
different ad units
but sometimes it means to put native art
and the banner at the same time is it
violet
any like so as long as you're following
our policies as far as like how many ads
to show on screen etc at one time you'll
be fine you can keep a separate native
and a separate banner ad in the same
activity but you just have to follow the
existing policies for how many ads to
show on screen at one time okay me and I
can see you still have a question why
don't we I'll talk with you after we're
done and you can tell me exactly what
you need to know and we'll figure it out
no problem please
short so is there a recycler adapter
basically implementation of native ads
Express sure I don't have a sample right
now we're sort of this is the kind of
thing we want to know what you want to
see in our future samples we will we
will probably over the next month or two
have a sample that shows a ListView
implementation of native ads Express
using a recycler view so I don't have
one that I can give you right now but I
will have one that I can wait on be up
on github with the rest of our examples
in the meantime you you can totally do
that there's no nothing stopping you
sort of act similarly to a yes is that a
pure negative is going down
sure like will poke those sure so human
talk about the different state of
advancement there's there's another
product called native advanced the more
advanced version of native express and
that is what you're talking about where
it's not a webview you can control the
different assets yourself that's in a
limited beta but native express is
available for all publishers Rosanna is
that the WP program from Google no it's
both double-click has a similar product
and AdMob has it as well but both are in
in beta
thank you that's a question about memory
management so I think more in terms of
native and advanced you have any plans
to you possibly extra compression sorry
to do what like platform specific
texture compression so if you're on iOS
your 1pp RTC compressions if you're on
android you want specific platform for
rendering energy
sorry I'm I'm troubled you're saying
platform-specific compression of native
add assets yes sure
I can I can talk a little bit about what
we're doing in that regard I don't know
that we have anything to use we are
experimenting with different formats
there are a lot of formats for image
assets for example like web P and things
like that
those experiments are going on we also
have a whole bunch of stuff going on to
try and figure out what size of asset to
serve to which device which two goes a
long way I think when we first launched
we were serving very large assets even
two very small devices and so that work
is ongoing
I don't know but specifically we would
have something where it's a different
format per device but for all I know the
engineers are working on that like I
said it's it's this is something we've
heard before and we're definitely
working on it but there are some
partners that sometimes serve videos
that are really hard memories and that
could be potentially be killing our ABS
because we're pushing our
really close to a limit so you have any
way to kind of filtering the video a
space on the map memory that takes or
something similar yeah you're asking for
native specific we're for a reward in
deal in in in native ads or just in
general in general yes so we we what we
have is you can you can filter out video
ads entirely there's no like granular
control on filtering like specific types
of video ads but that's great feedback
for us to take back to our team and and
see if it makes sense to think about 50s
and for a mediation product we can't
there's nothing to the minute we do with
with that but we've heard feedback that
some developers want to because there's
a trade-off between how many videos you
can cache for the user experience versus
how much bandwidth you consume and so
this is feedback we got before that
perhaps you want a checkbox that says
actually conserve bandwidth so that's
something we're gonna look into I don't
think there's anything at the minute we
have but something we definitely want to
look at Thanks so far getting white
listed in the native program was like a
pic of ping-pong game with your policy
team now you're showing the Native
Express when you can change colors
layout however you like it
will there be like a authentication step
also on your policy team that will
approve or not this that's actually one
of the nice benefits of native ads
Express is that all happens
automatically so Andrew when he was
going through the demo there was a stage
where it's a validate CSS and when you
hit that it automatically does our
checks to make sure everything is in
line with our policies and as soon as
that invalidate like comes through and
it's immediate sort of review you can
you're able to go live
okay how long doesn't think the validate
is it's like happening in code it's just
a CSS publication the step with oh so
there's no like step with our actual
policy people it's it's all happening
automatically when you're creating the
add-in that my plant
you are you are welcome to go try this
right now
actually anybody in the room can try it
anybody any other questions okay all
right thanks for packing the house guys
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
