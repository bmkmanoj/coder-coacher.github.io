okay
yes well thank you all for joining us on
this beautiful IO morning my name is Jim
Anna I'm John and we're both product
managers on firebase growth perfect so
that's good to know this crowd a little
bit dumber do you think I think we
should what first IO is it so glad you
are not the only noobs in the house yes
perfect and who else here is a product
manager all right we've got a few
product managers that's great
how about engineers all right a lot of
engineers oh that's great who here wants
to know more about how to grow apps all
right almost everybody that's fantastic
well perfect because you're in the in
the right place you do this well Gemini
maybe I oh no we've been in your seats
before we've had to build and grow our
own apps outside of Google in games
entertainment and real estate and now
that we've joined Google we get to see
firsthand how a lot of the firebase
developers go about building and growing
their own apps on both iOS and Android
so today we're hoping to share some of
these learnings with you in the hopes
that you can apply it to your own apps
that's right so far base is a
mix-and-match mobile development
platform and the mission of firebase
growth is really to provide the products
in tools that work well together
so you can be systematic about how you
approach growth for your app we're all
about giving you the right tool for the
right problem and helping you work
smarter so before we go any further I
wanted to share with you
Mystikal framework it's if we talk about
a lot of product managers inside of
Google used to think about how to grow
their apps is pretty straightforward
framework one is understand how how your
users are behaving in your inside your
app 2 is identify different and
important segments of user inside the
app and the third part is experiment
with different ways for how to address
the needs of these different user
segments
to drive more user value and better app
growth so we're going to go through and
see how firebase maps to this framework
a little bit and how it helps you at
each stage and we'll start with the
understand part so still mentioned five
minutes is all about helping you work
smarter not harder
so by simply installing the firebase SDK
in your app you get the power of Google
Analytics for firebase at your
fingertips so what does that really mean
in practice that means that without
writing any additional code you get a
whole bunch of default events and user
properties to start understanding the
users inside your app you may be asking
what kind of info do we give you well
first of all you get a whole bunch of
demographic information to get to
understand who your users are so age
language interest country you also get
to know more about the devices so the
device category the actual device brand
model and even though s that the device
is running and some information about
the app itself so for example what App
Store did they download it from and what
adversan they're running we also tell
you stuff about retention so basically
how long are you able to hold onto these
users and when they are in your app how
much time are they spending inside your
app if you're monetizing we also tell
you some information about monetization
how people are spending aside your app
if you want to make these default
reports a lot more high fidelity and a
lot more useful for your business you
should consider adding our predefined
and suggested events what does that mean
so say for example you have a shopping
app we have events such as add payment
at the cart begin check out purchased
share and refund each of these events
also come with a host of suggested
attributes when you provide these to us
you can capture key moments in your user
journey the reason to use them really is
threefold
one it's less code to write to you don't
have to reinvent the wheel we're giving
you suggestions for what we think is
important and third and most importantly
it allows you to take advantage of
future improvement inside firebase these
are the events we enhance the report
based off of and we build new features
on top of so if you if you use them
you're kind of ready for the next thing
that we
beside firebase and if there are more
unique events to your app you can still
capture those you can capture those via
custom events and one thing we've
announced at i/o is that now you can
generate reports for custom events
inside Google Analytics for firebase
which was not previously possible the
other part that's really kind of
important to start to get that a little
bit more definition about your user base
is to start using user properties so to
go back to our shopping example say that
after not a certain number of purchases
you start tagging people as frequent
shoppers now every time they log any
event this user property gets
automatically logged with every event so
what does that mean in practice it means
that at the end of the day you'll be
able to go back to your analytics
reports and slice and dice them based on
these user properties and custom
audiences so that means you can start to
develop a little bit more nuanced
understanding do frequent shoppers have
different behaviors throughout the app
than other than other users inside your
app so you've got a lot of signals
coming in you've got default predefined
custom events as well as user properties
and all of this information coming in it
helps you identify important user groups
in your app so you can take the
appropriate action so if you treat your
user base like a single monolithic
entity the user experience is going to
suffer users are all different and they
should receive different experiences so
they're going to maximize the value that
they get from your app as an app owner
you need the flexibility to split your
overall app audience into subgroups that
are going to receive different
experiences with firebase you can build
custom audiences using events like
session start or level up or with user
properties like age gender and language
you can combine events parameters
properties to define almost any subset
of users that you might like and your
custom audiences connect across firebase
and with other Google products like
AdMob and AdWords for example let's say
you wanted to use audiences to easily
set up notifications for only your
paying customers well you can do that
and you could have a different set of
notifications for everyone else
so here's an example of a firebase
developer that has some great results
from using custom audiences and
analytics and that's cookbook so they
built custom audiences based on location
and they use that those audiences to
drive custom onboarding experiences for
those different audiences so so those
audiences would have a an onboarding
experience that is unique to their
locale and a little bit more friendly
and familiar and all of this was powered
by remote config and we're going to talk
a little bit more about remote config in
a second but when all was said and done
with this use of custom audiences
cookbook found that they increase their
signups by two hundred and seven percent
so fantastic results so I think we want
to do a little demo to showcase the
power of targeting we do we do so the
nice thing about targeting is all about
delivering the Lightspeed users by
giving them what they want when they
want it based on what they're thinking
about yes you want to help me
demonstrate this yes don't worry no
one's gonna get hurt a cool I would like
a firebase t-shirt all right Oh what's a
t-shirt I'll try to avoid you in the all
right we have a large audience here of
folks who are looking for t-shirts
all right I've never used this and we're
going on here before yeah first time
people on the front row have to like
guard their face a little bit so up yeah
protect your glasses if you're wearing
glasses yeah there we go
all right okay so we can go this told us
not to go high with the pressure
obviously we can go a lot higher and go
a lot higher hit the ceiling expensive
stuff in the scene once again all right
we have actually like a lady's shirt
here no over there oh I almost got her
perfect let's see more a few more a few
more just for fun yeah it's important to
highlight yes just until this canister
is done oh the value of targeting here
good yeah important delight through
through target oh wait I'll go one more
they need to go farther all right um
okay
oh okay well I'm glad it didn't but you
can still get it see that what happened
when you are delivering to their own
couple more a couple more couple more
you want to do one I want to do one the
old the old fashioned hand cannon for
the hollow everyone over done okay last
one aim at fire but don't hit anything
all right
eyes closed whoa I'll get the camera
that one was yeah pretty like they're
not happy with me right now that's okay
all right put the launcher away it's a
little okay all right we'll forgive us
for the cilium I bet it is it is really
about delivering delight by delivering
what your users want when they want it
um yeah that's what targeting is all
about right you can't just go down the
street blasting people with t-shirts I
have to I have to want it or with
notifications so we'll talk about that a
little bit more right well the power of
firebase growth is really that in
addition to great analytics you get a
powerful set of products tools and
integration and they all help you test
out different experiences and you can
see what works best for you and for your
app so in the next section of the talk
we're going to walk through some
examples of how you can use firebase to
drive all the things that you care about
acquisition retention and monetization
so we're going to take it from the top
with acquisition sounds good to me
so for acquisition firebase can help you
with both paid and organic acquisition
so let's start with paid so far this can
help supercharge basically your adwords
apposition campaigns which are becoming
the most popular of these nowadays are
the universal app campaigns and they're
popular because they automatically
optimize way to display your a position
ad across search YouTube Google Play and
more the way that firebase can help your
adwords paid acquisition campaigns it's
because these conversion events we
defined earlier in the talk now you can
import these into Adwords and let the
power of Google machine-learning
optimize what users to show your ads to
based on the likelihood
perform the same conversion event for
organic say social sharing and referral
acquisition campaigns we also have added
bytes a dynamic list that you can use so
app invites are pretty simple it just
provides a very intuitive UI that allows
your users to just focus on on selecting
their friends it smartly Auto sorts
between the devices that are locally
available on the device and the sorry
the contacts that are locally available
on the device and the contacts that are
available in their Google account and
all they have to do is select the
friends and then app invites will decide
whether to send an SMS or an email based
on the contact information that's
available on the receiver side firebase
dynamic links receives that invite and
that means that the receiving friends
can can receive and and use that invite
link on iOS Android or web and it'll
work just the same and dynamic links are
going to forward to the app to the deep
linked content if the app is installed
if the app is not installed it will take
you through the app store and if you
have set attribution the attribution
will survive the installation process if
you want to generalize the app insight
solution that is entirely possible we
have just released API is build an API
for dynamic links for iOS Android is
coming soon and so you can from within
your apps dynamically create these links
whenever you want to so I wanted to
highlight fabulous because they're one
of our developer partners and they
actually took a crack at implementing
app invites and dynamic links and so
pretty remarkable results the AP tested
these results against organic and
against implementing their own their own
solutions and so quite a remarkable
uptick in install via referrals clicking
on shares because it's a much more
streamlined experience and acceptance
and retention rate so we're really happy
with the with the results we saw with
them speaking of retention talk about
that let's talk about retention so
you've got some users obviously you need
to retain them and firebase provides a
number of tools that help you with that
today we're going to highlight three
products first fire firebase cloud
messaging
also app indexing and of course AdWords
so let's start with firebase cloud
messaging which is our no-cost
cross-platform messaging solution fire
bans Cloud messaging lets you send
targeted messages via API and UI and
these messages can be used for lots of
different purposes but we find that
they're especially good for driving
retention and engagement but we're going
to demo a lot so you can actually see
how how interesting and useful firebase
cloud messaging can be any of them on
this time I will do a demo no let me get
not anyway so as you may recall I am a
product manager and I've never
professionally written code before in my
life
but here we are looking at my code that
I wrote at i/o up on a big screen so
nothing could could possibly go wrong
this is actually based on a demo that
Lawrence one of our great developer
advocates put together took it all off
of the web page and liberally copied and
pasted so you'll get to see kind of how
firebase Cloud messaging works to
deliver messages to a device so fcm
consists of three important parts first
of which exists on a device like these
two devices you see here my Android
device which I forgot how to wake up Hey
and I'm going to I'm just going to open
this up here so we can see my really
sweet Android app that I built for this
demo called IO demo it's really cool
what it lets you do is register with FCM
and get messages and that's about it
so not the most exciting app but really
useful for showcasing showcasing the
power of FCM so what's happening here is
that this device is talking to FCM it's
getting a token and it's sending that
token which identifies this device it's
sending that up to my app server which
is a second part I want to talk about so
this very simple webpage over there is
my web server and it also doesn't do
very much it's not the very it's not the
most exciting apps or
in the world but what it does do is it
sends messages to my two devices here
which I've got registered and I don't
know which is which so I'm just going to
type a message into this box which phone
is this which is this phone which phone
is this I'm going to click send and one
of those phones is going to light up and
it was that one it was my iOS phone so I
know it's that one so by process of
elimination this must be my android
phone I really hope so and it is my
android phone cool and I could even send
a boat right so I don't know if you find
this as cool as I do because I've never
written code before but I find it really
cool that I can make messages fly on to
either of these two devices using a
webpage that didn't exist a few hours
ago so that's really interesting to me
what's going on behind the scenes is
this so curl command didn't know curl a
couple of hours ago it's calling the fcm
server the FCM HTTP API here the send
API is using my key and the two tokens
that these devices provided and it's
sending a message payload that goes the
F step FCM and FCM sends the message to
my devices easy peasy lemon squeezy so
if you don't want to write your own app
server you could actually go to the
firebase console and we built one for
you I'm skipping ahead a couple of steps
because you'd have to create a project
and so on but I've already created a
project and this one has two apps in it
this project is called the IO demo we're
going to go here it's got my two apps
it's got my Android example app and it's
got my iOS example app I'm going to go
to this little notifications tab here
which is my easy-to-use console and I'm
going to type in a little message here
I'm so at a loss for what to actually
say demos are so fun demos
are not stressful okay and I'm going to
target my two apps I'm going to target
my my Android app there and I'm going to
target my iOS app and I'm going to send
and it's a race which let's see which
one of these phones lights up first with
my message okay looks like the Android
was just a hair ahead of the iOS but as
you can see FCM works equally well
across both of these platforms and yes
even web this is mostly about apps but
you can use FCM to do web notifications
and it's fantastic for that too also one
question we didn't asked at the very
beginning do we have any iOS developers
in here all right a minority but an
important minority and iOS actually is
very important to us at firebase you'll
be happy to know that we've added some
great features for FCM that relates to
iOS we've cleaned up and improved the
SDK a ton and we've also added support
for the new token-based authentication
so if you've ever had to struggle with
certificates that problem is no more so
exciting times oh one last thing this is
a live internet webpage out there in the
world so anyone who wants to can now
send me message and blow up my phone for
the rest of the presentation if you're
interested so fire away
I think maybe back to slice well
children I bought away their live
fingers at home trying to figure out
what's the worst thing they could send
to me no perfect that was a great demo
Thank You Jon all right well don't take
my word for it a real-world example
where a customer or a firebase developer
is used FCM to great results is Myntra
which is an e-commerce app and website
for branded apparel in India and they
use analytics to define target audiences
for notification when they did that
notification rates went up by double or
they doubled and they had three times
the conversion rate when they moved to
those targeted audiences so great
results from intra
gM perfect so how do you reach users if
they're elsewhere on their device or if
they have disabled notifications
altogether that's where things like app
indexing can come in handy and come into
play
well app indexing is you've configured
it correctly with your app allows you to
do it surface your app when users are
searching for the kind of content or the
kind of product that your app provides
they can be searching in either Google
search or through the Google assistant
and as your app indexing is is
configured correctly your app will show
up in the search results and the more
that your app is used by your user your
ranking can actually improve in the
search results based on app usage
another oh yeah one developer we wanted
to highlight that use app indexing quite
successfully was the Daily Mail
newspaper out of the UK I mean this
awesome got boosted impressions and
stuff like that but the numbers that
caught my eye were the numbers about the
improved engagement so that what that
tells me is that basically they were
able to recapture people who are already
heavily engaged with the content whether
or not they were heavily engaged with
their app at that point so it kind of
allowed the rekindling between those
users are engaged with that type of
content and the app that maybe they had
forgotten about if they had not
rediscovered it through search another
great way to also recapture your user
base is again through Adwords
especially the reengagement campaigns
and going back to how firebase helps you
here to go back and think about our
shopping app example if you did go ahead
and define a custom audience for these
frequent shoppers then you can import
discussing audience right now into
AdWords as a remarketing list which
means you can now target your frequent
shoppers say with an ad campaign for
when that like next summer sale comes
around and you want to bring them back
into your app so speaking of sales and
purchases let's talk about every PM
favorite topic which is of course
monetization so many of the tools that
we've already talked about can be used
to drive monetization but intersection
the talk I want to dive deeper on one in
particular and that's remote config
so remote config is another incredibly
powerful fire based tool which allows
you to put parameters into the cloud and
these parameters can be used for lots of
different purposes what you get with
these parameters is really the ability
to modify your app remotely without
doing a deployment so incredible
flexibility here it's also antegrade
integrated with analytics so you get all
the power of analytics audiences and
targeting and you get this just
fantastic ability to remotely configure
your app to drive monetization which is
exactly what our next group of examples
used remote content for so in the gaming
world it's often a problem to figure out
how many video interstitial ads and how
many display ads
you should you should display you want
to have a great user experience and you
want to drive revenue and you want to
kind of find the right balance of both
of those well both Konami and gadgets
used remote config and Google Analytics
for firebase together to drive a great
user experience and a lot of revenue so
Konami they tied the frequency of their
ads to some remote config parameters and
kind of played around with them until
they reached a great new equilibrium and
they found that when they did this they
increase the rewarded ad views by 20%
and their advertising revenue as a whole
by 18% so really phenomenal result for
them gadgets ran a really similar
experiment with remote config they found
that they were able to drive both
session lengths and simultaneously
advertising revenue by getting to a new
optimum so really great results all
around there so to sum up what we've
been talking about Google Analytics for
firebase gives you powerful analytics
and custom audiences that can help you
understand and segment your app audience
and in addition to great analytics
firebase gives you a bunch of powerful
tools and they're all in one place they
work together super well and they help
you drive growth across the dimensions
of acquisition retention and
monetization in short firebase helps you
unlock opportunity and success for your
app
so before we leave you today I wanted to
invite you all to join the firebase wide
Alpha program this is going to give you
pre-release features and products in
alpha stage meaning they probably are
going to have some some issues but the
reason we want to give you access to
these products is that you can help
shape the direction of the product from
the get-go we want to hear your feedback
we will know what's important to you and
this is our way of giving you a sneak
peek what's about to come around and
give you a chance to influence it before
before it hits market so this is for all
high risk features not growth features
only and you can sign up today by going
to firebase at google.com forward slash
alpha and while you're at i/o what a
better time to keep learning about
firebase and and growth overall so I
wanted to point you to a number of cool
other cool talks that are going on at
i/o
some of them you can catch live some of
them have already passed but you can
still catch them on YouTube and and they
are YouTube right yeah you can catch
them on YouTube and if you have any
questions
John myself and the rest of the firebase
team we have a sandbox across from stage
7 so please do come by say hello ask
your questions and let's just kick out
about app development together thank you
so much for your time thanks everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
