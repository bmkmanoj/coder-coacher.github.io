where you can meet the Googlers that
make firebase happen my name is Doug
Stephenson we've got a great show for
you today Nala natal is joining us on
the show thanks for being on the show
Nolan thank you tell us Nolan what do
you do with the firebase team so I lead
app quality at firebase which includes
crash reporting and test lab okay so it
sounds like between crash burning and
test lab those are two things that
firebase provides to help you maintain a
high quality in your app yeah that's
right the idea is with firebase test lab
you're able to ensure the stability and
and quality of your app before you
release it by testing it on a variety of
devices and then with crash reporting
it's an SDK that lets you monitor your
app while it's in production to make
sure that no major issues are happening
to production users okay I understand
firebase crash reporting had a big
announcement recently when I'll ask you
about that later but first I want to
hear from you what do you do outside of
work
most of my time is spent with my four
year old twin boys I'd say 90% of my
time until we go to bed but I do like
getting involved in this organization
called the last mile which we do at San
Quentin prison and the idea is to help
inmates learn real life skills and we
teach them entrepreneurship especially
focused around tech and technology in
the internet so that's something I've
been doing for a few years the idea is
to give them a lot of curriculum and
coursework as well as having them meet
with people in the tech industry and
eventually they actually write a
business plan and pitch it to venture
capitalists at a media event which is
really exciting for everyone cool sounds
like you're giving these inmates
something to do something to do with
their lives after they get out so
there's you know they don't end up back
in the prison system later yeah that's
right yeah as we all know it's it's
their opportunities are limited once you
get out of prison and there's a
perception that the person's not
qualified and oftentimes that's true but
what we're trying to do is give them
skills that are
applicable right away and very relevant
right since the world has moved on a lot
of these guys have been in for 15 20
years so you know the exciting thing is
we've had I think six or seven graduates
that have come out of the program and
some of them have gotten jobs at
startups and other ones you know are
looking to do that some of them are
starting their own businesses so it
seems like it's been fruitful so far and
it's a it's a really great program if
you haven't heard of it check it out
yeah it sounds like it's really
rewarding work absolutely so with all
this work though certainly you must feel
like you need to get away I understand
you told me before you had an
interesting experience at running of the
balls now could you tell us what is that
and what was your experience yeah sure
Running of the Bulls is a race that
happens in Pamplona Spain basically
thousands of people run through the
streets of Pamplona at the beginning of
the race they let seven wild Bulls run
through with the with the participants
so you're kind of racing with other
people and these Bulls it's it's pretty
dangerous but it's absolutely thrilling
the goal is to get you know from the
start to the stadium without getting you
know hurt oh yeah that's that's a good
goal in life is to get from point A to
point B without getting hurt so what
happened though I mean did you did you
make it okay yeah everyone made it out
okay there were other people that were
maybe less fortunate but no no serious
injuries so an exhilarating experience
yeah well you know it was a good
experience for those of us who went to
the firebase summit recently we met up
with a bunch of developers and had a
bunch of news for them
firebase crash reporting had a big
announcement there as well could you
tell us what's new in firebase crash
reporting yeah so we fully launched at
the Berlin event which was really
exciting we had done a previous beta
launch at i/o for our launch we
introduced a bunch of new features so
first thing is we reduced our latency so
before we had 20 minutes before you'd
find out you had a crash now it's less
than a minute so it's pretty much
real-time and you also get alerted so
you don't have to check the dashboard
repeatedly you get email notifications
when there are new crashes and then you
have the ability to mark a crashes
closed if you fixed it and then
if we see that again in the wild we'll
give you a regression email to let you
know that this is happening again for
some reason and the thing that I'm most
excited about is that we're really
trying to help developers diagnose and
reproduce issues not just identify them
right so we've integrated deeply with
firebase analytics so you're getting
events from firebase analytics in your
crash logs so you can see what the user
was doing prior to the crash so the
whole idea is to give you more
information and more context so you can
solve this problem instead of you know
spending all your time researching and
diagnosing it reproducing it well it
sounds like some really good tools to
for developers to help find and fix
problems in their app so I'm excited to
see how people are making use of that
now speaking of crashes tell me about
the worst crash you ever had to diagnose
to track down yeah it's kind of
technical but we basically were parsing
numbers and in this app it was not one
of the first mobile apps I had made we
built it for a u.s. audience but it had
like international exposure pretty much
from day one which we weren't expecting
so in our number parsing that we were
doing we thought all of the numbers
would be kind of US formatted numbers
with decimal points and you know when we
put it out there we started seeing that
a lot we were started hearing from a lot
of our users that there that the app was
crashing and we couldn't figure out why
we finally realized it was from certain
South American countries but we couldn't
figure out what's going on turns out
that if the locale on your phone is set
to a non-us locale or even specific
locales to South America then this crash
would happen because I was using this
library improperly we would test on a
few devices in our dev shop and we would
test on different versions and we would
go back we try to we would try all these
different permutations we spent a lot of
time on figuring out you know different
behaviors that maybe a user took to get
to that spot but we didn't realize that
you know like 100 percent of these
crashes were happening in certain
locales and once we realize that and
we're able to reproduce that issue on
our own devices we were able to resolve
it very quickly so that's that's
something that firebase crash reporting
will tell you is that where in the world
or what locale the users on so those
kind of patterns should be easy or
easier to track now yeah absolutely yeah
we we tell you the geography of your
each crash and we're working on tools to
even you know surface these insights for
you so you don't have to do any digging
so great well I hope that means that I
don't have to do any hard work now when
it comes to tree hunting bug reports
because that's one of the worst parts of
engineering is having to dig into those
kinds of things
Wow you know and everyone else at home
knows that crashes are kind of a pain
we often have some memories about crash
computers and the screens that we see
and so I want to play a game with you to
see if you can identify some of those
screens from computers through yeah
let's do it
all right cool so I have a tablet here
the way we're gonna do it is I'll give
you the tablet you can see the screens
here at home everyone we will be able to
see the screen on their screen so would
you take a look there and we what you
think yes this is a classic blue screen
of death so this is Windows I'm not sure
which version but maybe Windows 95 or
earlier than that yeah it's classic blue
screen of death that's right okay let's
do the next one this is interesting so a
bunch of different languages I don't
think I've ever seen this before
this may be like a ear in the airplane
like a loon oh you mean like an airplane
entertainment console yeah yeah
unfortunately it's not it's actually Mac
OS X more recent Morrow I've never seen
that I used to have those all the time
when I was doing a Mac development and
the like
mid 2000s wow that's crazy next one this
one is a classic Mac screen that's
crashed like a old Macintosh I've
definitely seen that before
yeah old Mac the name for that icon is
the sad Mac so that's for obvious
reasons it said very sad let's do the
next one ah yes this is the Twitter fail
will I've seen this many times I've used
Twitter since you know I think 10 user
when I first started so I remember
seeing this a lot back in the day it was
a big deal yeah yeah a lot of people
talked about that fortune we don't see
that much anymore I'm happy for that
yeah let's do the next one this looks
like Mac from the brand
I don't know exactly which device I've
never seen at an iPhone I would say
maybe even earlier than that look at
Newton or something well okay yeah it
actually is an iPhone so if you look at
the shape of the of the device it has
something you know the iconic iPhone
buttons yeah it's a it's an iPhone let's
do the next one this one is crazy it
looks like there's an ASCII cow on it
there's no idea what this is so it turns
out this is a Linux kernel oops
which is like a it's like a kernel panic
except it's recoverable so the idea is
if something went really wrong but not
too wrong you might see something like
that it's an interesting variant on the
panic let's do the next one all right
software failure press the left mouse
button to continue
guru meditation I have no idea what this
could be yeah this is an interesting one
guru meditation I don't know what that
means but this is an Amiga crash so
going way back into like the 80s that's
when we're looking at here got it so
okay let's do one more this looks like
if you have a bad cable to your like old
CRT monitor or something like that
yeah it does look like a graphics
problem but it is actually a trick
question this is a load screen for a
commodore 64 game yeah it's not a crash
turns out our tolerance was for what's
acceptable to see on the screen is has
changed since the 80s so yeah that's a
load screen but I would consider that to
be a crash in my opinion so it does not
look good all right let's take a look at
your score up on the board there I think
I stumped you with a lot of those well
there's no pass or fail there's only
there's only entertainment here so looks
good thanks for playing now thanks for
being on the show and thank you for
sharing about last mile and your
experience with running the Bulls
