LAURENCE MORONEY: Google
Analytics for Firebase
is a powerful part of
the Firebase suite,
giving you a free
app measurement
solution that provides
insight on app usage and user
engagement.
Like any analytics
suite, it helps
you understand
how your users are
interacting with your product.
And from the data
it gathers, you
can derive which parts of your
product delight and excite them
and which parts of your
product need to be improved.
But what if you
could go further?
What if you could
learn ahead of time
which users are most
likely to become inactive,
or which users are likely to
make a future in-app purchase?
And what if you could create
a dynamic user group of them,
which you could then use
with other parts of Firebase,
such as notifications
or Remote Config?
And what if that user
group was updated
for you on a daily basis?
Well, that's what Firebase
Predictions is all about.
It uses advanced machine
learning algorithms
on your app data to determine
who is likely to churn,
who is likely to
spend, or who is
likely to meet custom analytics
criteria in the near future.
Let's take a look.
Here's the Prediction screen
on the Firebase console.
The first, Churn,
detects which users
have a likelihood of churning
in the next seven days.
In this case, 26%, or 2,300
of this app's users may churn.
Over a quarter of
the app's users
are likely to stop engaging with
the app in the next seven days,
and that's information that
you probably want to know.
Predictions creates
a dynamic user group
that's updated daily.
You can target this group
using a notification
to encourage them to stay
with some type of incentive.
Or you could use Remote
Config to personalize
the in-app experience
for this user group
by setting a global
value in your app.
Maybe it's a standard
discount in an e-commerce app
or a difficulty level in a game.
Then this user group
would get that value,
and that could
entice them to stay.
Note also that there's
a risk tolerance setting
that you can use.
A high tolerance value means
that you broaden the net.
You'll be able to
reach more users,
but you'll have more
false positives.
Similarly, a low tolerance
means that you tighten the net.
You'll get fewer users,
but of course, you'll
also get fewer false positives.
The other two
default predictions
are Spend and Not Spend.
As their name suggests,
these will give you
groups of users who
have been predicted
to either spend money
through in-app purchases
or not to do so.
Again, this gives
you a great tool
to enhance your
users' experience,
as well as to grow the
revenue of your business.
For example, for
the user group that
is predicted to make
in-app purchases,
you could use Remote
Config to show them
higher-value purchases.
And for the user
group that is not
likely to make an
in-app purchase,
you could, for example,
show them ads instead.
Or you could send
them notifications
with offers and discounts that
might encourage them to do so.
You aren't limited to these
three cards, of course.
You can create your
own custom predictions
based on any custom
conversion event
that you log from your app.
So for example, if I have a
game that has a lot of users,
and I have analytics tracked
in this game, such as maybe
users that have retried a
level and which level they've
retried, I can start creating
predictions for that.
And here's how I would do that.
Here you can see I create a
prediction on this analytics
event, and I'll
call it Retry Level.
It will give me a collection of
users who Predictions deems are
likely to retry a level.
Now, with that group of users,
I can do something interesting,
for example, maybe tweak the
difficulty via Remote Config
so that they don't
have to keep retrying.
Then I'll have a
card on my console
that I can use to act on, and
over time, using analytics,
I will see what's
happening to these users.
A lot of people are
retrying levels in my game,
or maybe most people
are progressing smoothly
through my game.
So that's Firebase Predictions,
an analytics-driven product
that uses machine
learning to segment
your users by predicted
behavior so you can make
product decisions that
enhance your growth strategies
and your users' experience.
