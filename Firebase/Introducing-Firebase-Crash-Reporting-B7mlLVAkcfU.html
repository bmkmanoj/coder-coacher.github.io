an invitation to your users to rate it
poorly and uninstall it this can spell
disaster for the new app that you just

having problems and you need this
information quickly so you can correct

crash to further enhance these details
you can log additional information as
the app is running all recent log

help your diagnosis in the event that
you're able to handle and recover from

simply by integrating the firebase
Gradle plug-in into your bill with no

iOS there's a cocoa pod which requires a
few lines of code for initialization
when the app launches to learn more and
get started with firebase crash
