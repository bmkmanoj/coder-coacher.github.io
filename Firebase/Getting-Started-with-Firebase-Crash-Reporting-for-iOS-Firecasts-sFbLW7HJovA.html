you can find out about crashes in your
app you can read helpful crash reports
and App Store reviews like this one
yes that's helpful thanks for that or
you can get detailed and useful crash
reports using a crash reporting tool
like firebase crash reporting let's
explore that second option in this
episode of fire cast so this here is my
fun little app that I wrote for
calculating prime factors of any number
it's a great app but I've been hearing
complaining out in the internet that
it's been crashing which is weird
because I'm pretty sure I write perfect
code huh well we better get to the
bottom of this and I'm going to do that
by adding some firebase crash reporting
so I can see where things are going
wrong now go ahead and feel free to
follow along with your favorite apps the
process should be nearly the same so
I've already got my app set up to use
firebase by creating a project in the
firebase console downloading the Google
service plist file and adding it to my
Xcode project and then installing
firebase through cocoa pods if you don't
know what I'm talking about you should
check out this video first and then come
back okay ready let's get hacking so
first things first I'll need to get
firebase crash reporting installed which
I can do by going into my pod file and
adding the line pod firebase slash crash
now I'll save it run a pod install and
well technically I'm done as long as I
have the library installed and I'm
calling for app configure firebase crash
reporting is up and running but there is
one other step I need to do to run
useful crash reports as you might know
when you build an app for iOS Xcode
takes your thoughtfully written method
names and turns them into machine code
that looks a little more like this and
while this is useful for building more
efficient apps it means you end up with
stack traces that look something like
this which is not particularly helpful
they can fix this through a process
known as symbolic ation basically Xcode
builds a list of each of these machine
symbols and the original names in your
code by uploading this list to crash
reporting it can turn these confusing
looking stack traces into something a
little more readable oh that's better
let's do that next so to upload our
symbols file to crash reporting I need
to download my service account info from
the firebase console this contains a
private key which is basically a
password that will give our script
permission to upload stuff to fire
on our behalf so I'll go into the
firebase console select my project and
I'll click this gear icon and select
project settings and now I'll head over
here to service accounts and select
crash reporting I'll click on the
generate new private key button and this
will download a JSON file that contains
the service account information
including that all-important private key
now go ahead and put this in a folder
somewhere you could put this in like a
common folder for all your projects but
you also might want to stick this in a
subdirectory of your Xcode project if
you're sharing it across your team it's
kind of up to you just don't go putting
this in any repository that's going to
be shared publicly on github or anything
these things should be yet private
amongst your team next we need to make
sure that we run the script and for that
we'll jump into Xcode I'll select my
target make sure I'm in build phases
here I'll hit plus here and select new
run script phase to run a script let me
rename this to something more useful
like upload symbols to crash report okay
now I'll jump over the documentation so
I can copy and paste the actual script
because it turns out I don't know it by
heart
all right and now I'll need to replace
this placeholder with my actual google
app ID I can do that by going into my
Google service plist file and copying
and pasting from this line here I do
make sure it's this google app ID line
here with like the colons and the
numbers and stuff don't don't grab this
project ID they're totally different
okay so I'll paste that in and then down
on this line I'll need to provide the
path to that JSON file I just downloaded
now you could do an absolute path like
this or you could take advantage of the
project during environment variable to
define a path that's local to your
project again do whatever makes the most
sense for you and your project setup but
you'll know pretty quickly if you have
the wrong directory because your project
won't build all right so well cut and
paste our file name because I can't
memorize that and we're done okay so now
that this is all set up I'll build and
run my project and well everything kind
of looks the same as before but if you
head on over to view report navigator
and Xcode and look at your latest build
results you should see that it's run our
custom shell script all right cool
so this means that in theory crash
reporting is up and running in my app
but I don't know about you but I'd like
to test this and see it in action to
actually confirm it
so here's what I'm going to do I'm going
to hop into my viewcontroller and I'll
add a button in our navigation bar that
calls a a test crash reporting method
alright and now in that test crash
reporting method we'll just call a
certain false and now we're ready to
test so for crash reporting to work
you'll need to run your app twice once
for it to crash and then a second time
for the crash reporting library to
notice that your app crashed last time
and upload your stack trace to the
firebase servers so first off let's get
our app to crash but here's the deal if
I were to just build and run the app
from Xcode and click this crash button
this crash would actually not get caught
by firebase crash reporting and this is
because the Xcode debugger is going to
jump in and grab the crash first before
anything else which you know if you
think about it is generally what you
want most of the time just not when you
want to be testing crash reporting so
instead after I've built and run the
latest version of my app I'm going to
stop it from with the next code okay now
I'm going to go and run it again from
within the simulator without having the
Xcode debugger attached and this time my
app properly crashes and now I'm going
to run it a second time to upload the
crash report to the firebase servers for
the second time I can also just run it
directly from the simulator or I can
build and run from Xcode either way
works although if you run it from Xcode
like I'm doing you'll be able to see
this crashes uploaded successfully line
in your console to confirm that your
crash has actually been uploaded now I'm
going to wait about a minute or two and
I check out my project in the firebase
console so I'll go down here to crash
reporting and hey it looks like we got
ourselves a crash today here up on top I
can see a graph of the crashes that have
occurred over time at the bottom I've
got all my crashes grouped by cluster a
cluster or issue as it may appear in
your version of the UI is a group of
crashes that have the same root cause
based on their stack trace so by
clicking on this one here I can see some
more details about our crash if my
symbols have been uploaded properly my
crash report will look something like
this where I can see the methods in my
stack trace including this view
controller test crash reporting method
well looks like that's the culprit maybe
I should fix that okay so we've got
basic crash reporting working let's say
I start seeing some crashes like this
where I'm getting crashes resulting from
my ask for input method well I tried
this out locally and of course
everything works fine on my machine so
what could be going on well maybe what I
need to do is start logging what our
users are actually inputting here
maybe there's something weird with their
input that's breaking my app and there
are two ways I can do this first is by
doing something you're probably already
doing in your app and that's logging
events with firebase analytics see
firebase crash reporting will
automatically add any analytics events
to its crash report logs when you
experience a crash and this is a good
way of seeing what your users been doing
with your app before it started crashing
which is really helpful because very
often your users will be using your app
in ways you just didn't expect so for
example here I'm going to go ahead and
add a firebase analytics event in my ask
for input method I'll call the event
generate prime factors and I'll store
the value our users are submitting as
one of the custom parameters for this
event
let's cast this as an NS object okay
done and then in my crash report I can
see my stack trace here just like normal
but then here at the bottom I now have a
log section that shows anything I've
logged through firebase analytics and
not just the name of the event but any
set of custom event parameters that have
also been sent along with it so in fact
if I expand this event here I can see
that my user asked for the number 12
spelled out as a string as the initial
value well that certainly seems like it
might be the culprit but I can't be
entirely sure at this point
unfortunately one issue I've seen with
firebase analytics is that it doesn't
always get a chance to record any events
that happen a few milliseconds before a
crash in this case it looks like it had
a chance to record it in time but I
would like to be sure so in addition to
just using this Analytics event I'm
going to go back into my code and add a
Fi our crash message call this will
immediately log any messages I specify
to crash reporting so I can get a better
understanding of what happened right
before the time of the crash and I
recommend using this whenever you need
to add some extra logging around too
hard to nail down crash but it's also a
good way to record any info that you
might not want to store as a firebase
analytics event but still might be
important for crash reporting purposes
like putting them inside my guard else
blocks or if error doesn't equal nil
blocks or
well basically anywhere my code has
comments like this should never happen
do keep in mind anybody with access to
your firebase console can see this so
be careful before you start logging
anything that might contain sensitive
user information
don't start logging like you know credit
card numbers or anything okay so now
that I've added in this logging I can
see what input might be causing the
crash by looking at the details of the
event down in the logs and yes I can
confirm that it looks like our problem
is due to our users passing an initial
value of the string instead of a number
well that certainly wasn't something I
was expecting and sure enough if you
look at my code it would appear as
though this force unwrapping will break
if I pass in something that isn't an
integer so I should really do the right
thing here and we'll make this an if net
statement instead okay yeah that's a
little better while I'm at it this does
seem like the kind of thing I should add
to my unit test since I clearly didn't
catch it the first time around and once
I've done all that I can mark this
crashbug as closed as an indication that
I fixed it so I can focus my attention
on some of the bugs that haven't been
addressed yet it turns out I also need
to watch out for people entering
negative values that causes a different
kind of crash and infinite recursion
loops which happen when my users enter a
value of zero note that infinite
recursion loops like this don't usually
get captured when you're on the
simulator I had to run this on an actual
device to get back this report wow so
many bugs
I guess my code isn't as perfect as I
thought it was well good thing I'm able
to start tracking them down so that
there's the basics for getting started
with firebase crash reporting if you
want to find out more you can always
check out the documentation and go find
out what crashes are lurking in your
apps
hey there everybody thanks for watching
did you find this video useful well then
like and subscribe to our YouTube
channel and maybe check out some other
videos like this one here this one it
feels pretty good this is one of them
has me and if you watch that one first
it will be better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
