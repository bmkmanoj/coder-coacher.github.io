today's episode of fire cast I'm gonna
show you how to set up your get up repos
to deploy to firebase hosting after a
successful push and just as a reminder
this is just one episode in an entire
series on firebase in the web so if you
want to stay up to date make sure to
subscribe but now we're gonna go set up
our get up code to deploy to firebase
hosting so let's get started
so the amazing thing about firebase
hosting is that you can deploy your
website with one command firebase deploy
and this works because you're usually
logged in locally so you have access to
deploy to your website but what if
you're in an environment where you don't
have access like if you're doing
continuous integration like with Travis
and a github repo well in those cases
the firebase command line actually has a
flag called - - token and what - - token
takes is a firebase token and how do you
get this firebase token well you can get
it by using the command firebase login
colon CI and this will make you go out
to the browser and login and then after
that it will print your token to the
console and from there we can set it up
in Travis and after that you just push
to your github repo and then Travis will
kick off and if you're successful it
will deploy to firebase hosting so for
those of you not familiar with Travis
it's just a continuous integration
service so essentially when you send a
pull request or you push to a repo it
will do a build and make sure that your
test pass or whatever you want to do
succeeds and then if that succeeds you
can do something like push - firebase
hosting so I'm going to set up a project
on my local computer and then that's
going to be able to push to github which
will trigger off Travis which will then
be able to deploy to firebase hosting
so since I don't have any files I'm just
going to do a firebase in it and that's
going to give me this amazing emoji art
seriously it never gets old
and then after that I'm going to say I
want to do a hosting project and I'm
gonna select my project name and then
it's gonna ask me what should I use for
my database rules and I'm not using any
so I'm just gonna use the default file
and then now this is a really important
part it says what do I want to use as my
public directory so your public
directory is where all of your app files
are contained and specifically your
index dot HTML so in my case I like to
make this pretty easy so I just name my
public folder public so the rest is just
gonna ask me questions about single page
app configuration and other things and
I'm just gonna go and skip through these
and now have an initialized firebase
project so I'm gonna open up my editor
and I need to be able to tell Travis
what to do when I push to the github
repo so to do that I'm gonna create a
file I'm gonna call it dot Travis dot
yeah mol and this is essentially a
configuration file that tells Travis
everything it needs to do when you push
so the first thing I'm going to specify
is the language I'm going to use in the
environment which in this case is going
to be no js' and then I'll also specify
the nodejs version I need to use which
for this case I'll just use 4.0 and now
I need to specify the actual script to
run and in this case I'm just gonna say
echo deploying but in your case this is
where you'd want to do something like
npm install and then npm test or
whatever commands you do to run your
unit test and and test or what you find
important and the next thing I'm going
to do is specify this install command
which allows me to install things like
the firebase tools so once the firebase
tools are installed I can use them to
deploy to firebase host
thing and now this is the very important
part the after success look so after
success will run if our scripts were
great and then also this install worked
as well so I can say after success do a
firebase deploy - - token and then we'll
provide a firebase token now if you
remember from the beginning of the video
to get a firebase token we need to run
the firebase login CI command so here in
the command line will write firebase
login colon CI and this takes us out to
the firebase console where we're going
to allow the CLI to have some
permissions to create this token so now
you can see in this blurred out token
and it's blurred out because this is
private information and we can actually
go and copy this token and then head out
to Travis where we will create an
environment variable so here in Travis
you can see I'm in the settings section
you can see that there is a space for
environment variables so I can come down
here and create one for a firebase token
and then paste in my value and then I
click add in it is saved to Travis so
now that Travis has this value all I
have to do is I get push
so you can see right here it ran our
script of EKKO deploying and then below
ran the after success command of
firebase deploy - - token firebase token
so now our app should be deployed to
firebase hosting so let's go and check
out the URL so I've gone out to the URL
of my firebase hosting project which is
get up deploy - a 4 a 1 B dot firebase
app comm and then you can see right here
we have the blank firebase hosting
project that firebase beam it created
for me so just like that we created an
entire continuous integration process
from github to Travis the firebase
hosting so that's all you have to do to
set up your github repos to deploy to
firebase hosting if you want to check
out more awesome stuff that you can do
with the firebase hosting command line
check out the links in the docs but
before I go I have a question for you
what kind of apps are you two pulling
out the firebase hosting and what are
you using the firebase CLI for so that's
all I'll see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
