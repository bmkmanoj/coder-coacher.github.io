pleasure to be here with you here we go
we're live we have a lot of experience
building some of the world's most
popular applications and we've learned a
thing or two about what it takes to
build an app and we found that it's a
pretty difficult process a lot of your
time goes into running infrastructure
instead of building the features that
make your app your app it has to be a
better way that better way is using
firebase we're now up to over 750,000
developers using the product to use
firebase your apps code talks directly
to our powerful managed back-end
services we take care of security and of
scalability so that you can focus on
building features that your users love
today we're launching firebase UI 1.0
it's an open source library it has
customized theming and it works for web
and Android and iOS so you can go ahead
and drop that in and you'll have all of
the UI's that you need is my app set up
correctly which events are being
captured by the SDK are you receiving my
events and parameters we've built
something the ideal tool to answer all
of these questions in these pain points
app quality leads to better user
attention better your app is and the
more stable it is the more likely for
users to come back and for your business
to be successful and sustainable and
that's where we come in
so we're really looking forward to get
the feedback from the community as
always to help us continue to refine a
product and to work together to help you
build a better app and we want you to be
able to spend all of your energy on
bringing innovation and creativity
something new to the world that's really
what we're trying to achieve here is
making all the infrastructure pieces
simple for you and I'm really excited
for you to engage with firebase and see
how it can make you more successful all
right let's get back to the code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
