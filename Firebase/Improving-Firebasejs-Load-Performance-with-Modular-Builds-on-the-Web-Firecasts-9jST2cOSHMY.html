with special guests have a house party
who is a guy working on Chrome and today
we're going to talk about progressively
loading firebase in your web apps
speaking of firebase why is my timeline
on fire dated um I wrote the code I see
I see so we're in timeline I'm using
Chrome inspects check out your app on a
real device and I'm seeing is that
there's a whole lot of JavaScript here
that is necessary before you become
interactive at all and if we dive into
the network panel and sort this by size
what I see is a firebase JS file that's
324 kilobytes yeah I specifically went
out of my way to make sure that it
served on gzipped so you're
intentionally being slow yes but it's
also your app okay I got it all right so
let's see if we can fix this because I
think that you can do a little bit
better before we do that I want to talk
about pie
ah this is this is a firebase pie that
I'd put a lot of effort into this just
for you thank you
if I were to give you a hot pie right
you got a hot pie what would you do that
I probably just eat it you probably just
eat it and you get scalded right now
imagine that a user goes out and they
check your app you know they see
something loaded on screen and they try
interacting with it if you've got a
whole bunch of JavaScript on their
particular on a real device that's going
to need to be you know downloaded parsed
executed and so on before they can
extract and a lot of the time if you've
got like a really big bundle they're not
going to be able to do that really
quickly they're going to be waiting and
waiting and waiting they'll try to
interact nothing's going to happen and
they'll be sad
so like 324 kilobytes is that that seems
big oh great that seems big so there are
a few key moments when it comes to
loading performance these days and it
looks a little bit like this some of
them you may have heard before like
first paint first meaningful paint
visually ready so you know it looks like
the thing can be interacted with maybe
it can and times interactive is that
point where like the JavaScript on your
page is mostly settled you can start to
interact with the UI and do something
useful with the page now you might be
wondering well how do I actually track
that at all it's a great question used
to be very manual process we've recently
been working on this tool called
lighthouse comes available as like a
Chrome extension and a CLI and last is
really good for just checking that your
progressive web apps or
are sort of using best practices and
also that you're performing performance
best practices - if you generate a
lighthouse report against an app it
looks a little bit like this so it's
also got a section for page load
performance and the one thing we want to
keep an eye on is your times interactive
in there now our goals with us are to be
interactive on unlike a real device in
about five seconds that seems reasonable
under what network conditions 3G ideally
so and if you happen to be using a
service worker because service workers
are awesome being interacted in about
two seconds so you know person has
launched your app they've already viewed
it before so hopefully you've got a good
amount of a cache and they're pretty
instantly interactive that's that's the
goal this is what it looks like if
you're doing things right this is the
polymer SHOP app it's interactive in
under two seconds so it'd be kind of
neat if we could get your app sort of
yeah I think I think I might have
something for you thank you it's almost
as if we scripted this out okay so most
people using firebase today are probably
dropping in this one file firebase that
is or referencing her from the CDN and
if they're doing that it's probably you
know around 107 kilobytes gzipped
so not that 3:24 monstrosity a little
more sane you were trying it but the 107
it's a little bit more sane um and
they're including it this way they're
initializing firebase but firebase also
has modular builds right nice little
broken apart pieces so just the pieces
that you might actually need for your
app so you've got firebase app off
database storage and we found in our
apps it's like we're usually using app
and database for some of the simpler
stuff and those pieces themselves are a
little bit smaller so I've got I've got
an app I was using just you know the
firebase NPM package I like using you
know common jazz for my stuff and before
I learned all this stuff from you I had
a really big vendor bundle it was a
slightly bigger than I was expecting
and my dependency graph looked a little
bit like this I've liked a lot of
firebase in there I was using all the
pieces at once probably not ideal but
then I followed your advice and I went
for the modular builds and I ended up
like so a bundle it's like less than
Phillip 50 kilobytes in size yeah thank
you thank you David ease you did say
thank you I wrote it down you wrote it
down yeah it took screech great oh
that's nice it's nice and my bundle
after that looked a lot smaller so it
looks a little bit like
this in my dependency graph now which is
really nice but we're going to look at
how you do that with your app right so
you you did this for the app that you
were working on before and it looks like
this so what are you doing here
so it would include the script tag for
firebase and this comes from a vendor
folder but it's pretty much if you are
going to use it from the known modules
so it's totally uncompressed the really
big firebase j/s and once it's done
loading which you can see is actually
taking a good while we had our 324
kilobytes and it took 4.5 one seconds so
like you're saying it's kind of slow so
rather than do that what I actually can
do is you can get rid of it and I'm
going to include firebase from the CDN
and so this is the whole kitchen sink
and the reason I'm doing from the CDN is
because CDN will automatically gzip it
for you and if you upload anything to
firebase hosting it will also
automatically gzip it for you but if
you're doing something on your own
server you want to make sure that the
firebase you're uploading is gzip
because that right then and there will
have a huge performance benefit that was
a good prick tip yeah it was good now
load this in again and you can see that
firebase J's loaded on to point to one
second so you can see that this also is
on regular 3G but we can do better so we
will go back and we'll actually break it
out to firebase app then firebase
database and then you can see if we need
it off or storage or even our new
messaging library you could include
those as well but that's pretty much
cleaning the whole thing all over again
so I'm going to get rid of those and
only include the two that we need and
now when we go back to the app refresh
the page and you can see right here is
that firebase app loaded in just 500
milliseconds in firebase database and
one point two two seconds again on 3G
which is a lot faster nice so again
you've got that nice under 50 kilobyte
bundle for the two pieces that you
actually need and so we can even get
better because you can see that we have
a serviceworker and what we can do is we
actually can go and register our
firebase app and our firebase data
base into the cash and then also if we
were using you know storage or for using
auth we could include those in there as
well and then when we'd actually get to
those pages then we would actually have
you know start cashing them as well so
now when we go back into our app and we
load up the app we can see right here
that on the first reload it looks
exactly the same but then serviceworker
has been installed we refresh again and
then everything coming from the
serviceworker our load is in 112
milliseconds even on regular 3 P it's
pretty nice so it was pretty instantly
loading up there yeah I think that gets
within the 5 oh yeah yeah yeah it does
definitely get it within the five-second
mark so thanks for David thank you all
right so what did we learn today
use the firebase modular built they're
pretty awesome progressive loading is
pretty neat so you know if a user lands
on a route in your page only load what
they need so maybe firebase app and
firebase database if you're on say an
image upload page maybe you could lazy
load in your firebase storage part use
the CDN because it gives you gzipping or
you can gzip on your own server
serviceworker caching totally worth the
effort especially if you want to get
that nice instant loading feel you know
when a person visits you're out for the
second time in lighthouse pretty baller
too so Chrome extension CLI check on you
know your performance best practices and
PWA best practices it's pretty neat well
that is awesome and that's also all we
have for today so if you liked this
video make sure to LIKE and subscribe
and also check out this guy's show
called totally tooling tips over on the
chrome developers Channel yeah in Matt
gaunt and I cover the bleeding edge of
tooling over in the JavaScript world so
yeah make sure that you profile your own
firebase apps and see that you're doing
those five tips and see how much
JavaScript you're including and could
you benefit by gzipping or the modular
builds or serviceworker
so five tip 5 - PI 5 just like we
practiced just like we practiced
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
