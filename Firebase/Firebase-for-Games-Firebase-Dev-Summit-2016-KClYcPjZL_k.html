my name is Abe I'm an engineer on the
firebase team I'm here with Damian a
developer advocate on games and first I
want to say how amazing it is to be here
in Berlin I'm super excited it's been an
amazing experience so far I feel super
welcome especially once I realized that
the UX team put that tiny drawing of me
on the beanbag in every single
presentation so now I feel like I'm
really the focus of everything and
that's absolutely amazing
so I'm here to talk about firebase for
games and then in in smaller text pew
pew pew that's like a game noise you
know see we're bonding already
this is going great so if we look at
firebase you've probably seen this slide
before you literally saw it in the
previous presentation this is the 15
products that come together to make
firebase the suite of tools we put
together for building mobile apps but
I'm not here to talk about mobile apps
today I'm here to talk about games and I
think if you look at these products some
of them work really well for games just
obviously like firebase authentication
you know you want your user to log in
with Facebook you don't want to write a
bunch of code to do that if I based
authentication makes perfect sense or
something like a firebase real-time
database you want to be able to store
data synchronize it between users it
just makes sense but as a whole I think
in order to make firebase for games we
have to take a unique approach we are
really really serious about making
firebase work great for games and so
when we started talking about this I did
what I always do when we start you know
talking about building something for a
different audience or building something
different I started talking to our users
so I was at GDC last year and I went
around to a bunch of people and I'm
always wondering how can I make my users
users lives easier that's really you
know what makes them successful if their
users have a better time and that makes
me successful and everyone's happy
so I went up to a game developer and I
said how can I make your users lives
easier and the first thing he said was
well they're called players for one and
I was like fair enough good point and I
went up to another person and I said
alright how can I
take your players lives easier and he
looked at me and he was kind of confused
and he didn't really have an answer for
me I spent all day doing this like I
hung around the Google booth and I kept
asking people how can I make life easier
for your players and no one could really
give me an answer and it wasn't until
the end of the day when someone he was
wearing a top hat and overalls because
game developers are like that sometimes
and I said how can I make life easier
for your players and he said I don't
really want that that's that's when I
clicked for me personally that games are
not like apps we're not trying to make a
life easier or more productive or
anything like that
we're trying to make an experience
that's really unique that you're
passionate about that you're engaged
with in a different way then you'll ever
engage with an app these are completely
different experiences and if we want
firebase to work really well for games
we have to take an entirely unique
approach we can't do a half quality job
so I want to talk about this quote from
a guy named John Carmack if you know
about games you've probably heard of him
he was a lead programmer on doom now he
works or runs armadillo aerospace I
forget but he programs Rockets now
because that's a normal career
trajectory I guess and he once said that
the game designer should be building a
world in which the player is not just a
small part the player is a boss and I
think this is true outside of games it
really doesn't matter if you're building
an app or you're like working in a
company you don't want to be a small
part of anything you want to be the
focus you want to feel like the
experience that you're interacting with
the world around you is interacting with
you and that it's really rich and
connecting with you as you are at
firebase the core of this beautiful
graphic is analytics and the core of our
philosophy is analytics because this is
a representation of your players you
don't just have players though that's
too is too general it's too vague we
have your players in Maine the ones are
really good at the game because they
played the sequel the ones who got
through the first ten levels in minutes
because they're just really excellent
and with analytics we have those players
in Nevada who have never gotten past
level four they're really horrible at
your game they're literally the worst
players but they're having fun and they
keep trying again and again at level
four and this is the power of analytics
because if we have a user we have this
guy and he is a power user out in Maine
he is the really exceptional great
player and we release a hardcore level
pack this guy is going to want to know
but if we released it if we just like
you know shouted it out send a push
notification to every single user of our
app and said hey we've released this new
hardcore level pack a bunch of them
would be intimidated those level four
players who are stuck on that same level
they're going to look and say I can't
even get past level four I didn't need
to know about the uber hardcore death
mode ultra pack it just wouldn't connect
with that and it might even make them
shy away from your app so if we know who
these people are and we can target them
and say hey you know this app this
package this experience is for you we
can get them more involved so we shoot
him a push notification with an audience
we created in analytics and now he's
more engaged this is an experience made
possible to cloud messaging and firebase
notifications both of these up there you
go I think this clicker might be dying
both of these are products we've talked
a lot about today and this philosophy of
firebase being good if use one comply
just Cloud messaging alone is fine if
you want to set up your own server and
send individual messages to individual
devices that's great
but if you want to use it with firebase
notification so you want to use it with
the power of analytics you can and
that's really where you get this
compounding value effect of firebase
let's take another example a sign player
it's really a really great player he he
is one of the best players we've ever
had his his gummy clan is level 200 he
is just really really top of the
leaderboard excellent player but it's
it's frankly not all skill he has been
spending a ton of money on fire coins on
this in-app currency and just buying
everything he possibly can and but but
he's a great player he's super engaged
with her game he's having fun
he really is passionate about this
experience we've created and he's so
passionate that one day he spends all
his coins he's run completely out of
fire coins and what well what can he do
in a normal situation you might have to
wait for you know 24 hours to pass so we
get some more fire coins or you might
have to you know spend some more money
buy some more in-app currency
both firebases opens up new
opportunities that not only help him get
more engaged with the game but also
brings us new users so imagine we give
him a beautiful link and a nice little
short length that he can share with his
friends
those friends come into the game and he
gets rewarded with you know some fire
coin so he sends out that link he waits
a little while and he's a hundred
thousand five coins richer this is great
because now his friends are sharing his
experience
he's not just some lone nerd building
his gummy Kingdom up he's a he's one
part of a bigger group of people who all
love this game who he can he can talk to
about he can share this experience with
and it's just richer for him and at the
same time we get a better experience as
a developer because we potentially found
people like him who will also love our
game and that's our end goal and and yet
and he's just having a good time he's
back to spending all his fire corn this
is an experience made possible by tying
together a bunch of these firebase
features so we used invites to say
alright were your friends who should we
contact we use a dynamic link to give
him that custom link he can share we
used cloud messaging to tell him when
he's received his viral coin and we use
real-time database to track how many
fire coin he has this is great though
because it's not just one feature and in
firebase in gaming we support a bunch of
these features today this isn't a new
thing that we're announcing you like
this has been possible in the gaming
world via the C++ SDK since Google i/o
when we leave release the C++ SDK we
were super excited because we knew game
developers who are writing in C++ we're
going to be immediately able to start
building richer experiences for their
players and people have really really
loved the C++ SDK so to talk about it a
bit more I mean I hand it over to Damian
will talk a little bit about the code
and how to use the C++ SDK damn it hey
thanks I so I'm Damian and I joined
Google about two years ago before that
I've been doing game development during
seven years six years and a half
something like that for us on the raid
and other platforms concepts so yeah
change is at chances are if you are
doing video games you are likely doing
C++ either you are writing your own
unjoin on doing C++ directly either you
are using a none giant that is itself
written in simple
Plus so if you want to have a plug in
for that online you are likely want to
have a C++ API and and well I keep
quitting John Carmack here like focus is
a matter of deciding where things you
are on going to do and I feel that it
fit quite well what firebase is about
like if you are a game developer it's
likely you don't want to spend time
doing back-end development what you want
to spend time and is your gameplay
experience how happy you make your user
what are the feelings your user are
going to express when they go through
your game
and again like firebase is something
that will help you focus on what you do
best which is doing I play live doing
gameplay the development and well we can
clearly see that if we show some simple
code for the C++ API like for example
that's the initialization of firebase on
Android it's more or less the same API
in the u.s. like in an Android side you
give your Glu environment and JVM
information to the C++ SDK so he can
communicate with the Java side of things
but that's one line of code and it's not
that difficult right after that if you
try to initialize firebase analytics
it's one line of code to initialize
firebase analytics and out of that you
already get all the default analytics
information from surveys analytics like
your session time your first pan when
the user open and dynamic link receive a
notification etc if you want to then
track an event it's again one line of
code with the event name your parameters
and the value of your parameters well if
we go through remote config there is no
big surprises there one line of code to
initialize and then you will get one
line of code to fetch value from the
server and one more line of code to
activate the value from the server we
already talked about remote config so I
won't go through how it works but yeah
when you once you fetch the value from
the server if you are in the middle of a
game and you are changing one of the
parameter of the remote config will be
the color of the sky you might not want
to switch the color of the sky from blue
to green in the middle of the game you
might want to wait for the end of the
station to activate your value before as
they take effect and so yeah if you look
at a pin right it's again one line of
code to initialize a pin right and then
a couple of line of codes I describe the
content of your invite on one line to
send Z
right and displays the UI to the user as
game developer you probably doesn't
really love making UI for your user so
for your base take care of displaying
your content your contact list so you
can select which user you want to share
the invite with if you look at firebase
messaging if you just do the first line
of code the initialization part you
already get notification to work in your
C++ game or C hour or game engine and
well right after that you can go in your
firebase notification dashboards and
your notification then it will appear in
your game if you want to receive
notification while the game is in
foreground you can then register a
callback if you want to be able to
display the notification when the game
is in program if well and simplest place
is great lots of games are made just in
C++ but there is more out there there is
other game engine and I will give it
back to a to talk about unity awesome
thanks Damian yeah like Damian said C++
is amazing if you're building young
something that's an engine or you're
just building in C++ because that's what
you like to work in but when we started
talking to game developers we realize
that yeah a lot of them love C++ and
that's great and we want to support them
but a lot of them don't we have amazing
new games coming out every day that are
written in these new engines and in this
new technology and we wanted to support
that it's not only that but C++ and our
SDK doesn't have to be used for games
it's a general-purpose programming
language any mobile app you're building
can be built with the C++ nd SDK in the
Android NDK and all of that stuff and we
wanted to tell people we're we're so
serious about gaming we're going to
build an SDK that is specifically
integrated into a gaming technology into
a gaming engine that wasn't just a
library you imported but an entire UI
that becomes in part of the IDE that
feels natural and makes mixture you know
that we're serious about gaming and
that's why we released the firebase
unity SDK and this is something that I
personally am extremely excited about
because whether you are like me and
you're the type of game developer who
hangs out on like our slash rogue like
dev and like is a horrible game
developer or
if you're a top 100 company who's
building the next gigantic you know
whoever app featured featuring
celebrities that's going to get up
trillion downloads or if you're someone
in between like my friend PIM who is
running a startup based on based on
firebase powered games and anywhere in
between you can use this unity SDK and
it will support you and when you use it
it's going to feel good it's going to
feel natural installing it in unity is
as simple as dragging in an asset
package just like you'd get from the
Unity store anywhere else and then once
it's installed you get this beautiful
sidebar that has links to documentation
options for configuring and setting up
individual firebase features and
basically everything you need to know to
get up and running so you don't have to
Google anything because it's really
great when at Google we can make you not
have to Google anything so to talk about
what we can do with this unity SDK we'll
go back to damien to show off this live
demo that we put together using the
firebase unity sdk and the survival
shooter demo from the unity website so
yeah just before the the presentation we
started making this live demo so if I
can see my screen I have notification
integrated because on unity it's
basically linking a plug-in and you have
zero line of code to put there so you
link the plug-in and you can reduce
engine send a notification when you
click on it you can launch the game
there it is nice and blurry okay that's
better I don't have sound so I should be
right and that's based on the tutorial
project by unity called survival
shooters where you have the small
character dreaming about scary puppies
oh yeah you can see it really well and
you can see that when I am shooting I
have a blue regen oh that's a big
elephant sorry so if I if I die you will
see the color of the rice that lives
again switch to okay today demos are
failing it's because I am in airplane
mode because I am a stage I also care
for a cure so I can fetch data with the
free mode configure remote configure the
pyramid
ourselves the color of the FZ again so
let's try to die again it's so difficult
when you're such a talented gambled all
right yeah hopefully the controller are
quite Hardware new when you are not
handling yet I have no legs there well I
will skip see this part of the demo but
I am fetching the colors again from from
remote config so it should change the
color at the end of the gameplay and I
also have integrated a pin right so you
can invite people from from your contact
list in in the game and like now I will
switch back to the slides
the idea is doing like remote config
analytics notification and a pin right
took me about maybe one hour to do in
unity it was fairly quick and really
really easy to do and I will go through
just some sample code about it so if you
look at just initialization of firebase
it's two line of code it's not as good
as C++ but we are getting there
and if you look at firebase analytics
it's one line of code for the
initialization and then one line per per
events in the game I added two events
when when the player died and another
one where you actually take down an
enemy and in the console it looked like
you can see it a bit like the first
event is when the player died and the
second event is how many enemy you
killed and you can see the values of the
enemy killed is 102 I think and the
value of how many people were killed
when you before player died is 101 so it
looked like there is when one enemy that
actually was killed on the players
arrived so yeah it's it's again like
very easy one line of code to do it if
you look at remote config it's a bit too
bit different because well remote config
has default value when you can't fetch
the server the first time like it was
the case during the demo because I had
no internet so during the initialization
you need to give the default value of
each variable you have and then it's
again one line of code to fetch and
activate the values
and the console side you really saw it
in the presentation before so I will go
quickly sweet but you can have all your
variable names and values that are based
and various audiences in firebase
analytics if you want to or if you want
to do a/b testing you can use remote
configures for that and if you look at
firebase messaging for notification I
looked quite hard for sample code
because as I said you just link the
firebase plugging for notification and
it just works
you have zero line of code to put there
however if you want to support a message
that are receiving foreground when the
game is is displayed on the screen you
can had add an optional called call back
there but that's again only if you want
to use support notifications that use
the user receive when the game is in
foreground and on the console side you
ready so it in the in the presentation
before it's about being able to send
notification to your all your users or a
subset of your user based on audience or
filtering an user language country add
version platform etc finally if you look
at the firebase app in write it was like
one line of code to create the in write
a couple of line to get the content of
the design setup and then one line to
send it it's quite nice in unity to be
able to do quite complex and a TVI
integration with just a few line of code
without writing any Java code complex
plugging to interface with unity etc and
now I will give it back to a to talk
about cross-platform awesome like I said
before one part of firebase if you're
using remote config is made richer by
analytics and analytics is made richer
by authentication and we have all this
connection inside of firebase inside of
your unity game that makes the
experience richer for your users but
things get even better once you get
outside of a single app so imagine you
have you know a really great mobile game
and you really want to have a web
leaderboard for that game this is
something firebase makes possible with
our web SDKs or if you have a web
word game or some other desktop game and
you really want to have a CA mobile
interface for a user to manage their
inventory this is something that just
feels natural because we've put a ton of
effort into each of these individual
SDKs so each SDK feels natural it feels
like normal Android code or it feels
like normal JavaScript but it's also
very firebase II so the things you learn
in the experience you have building and
unity will apply in speed up development
on every single platform but the value
of integrating doesn't stop here it goes
outside of firebase to the rest of
Google firebase is powered in in large
parts by Google cloud this amazing
platform for building anything your
heart desires you know firebase is a
bunch of specific tools and features but
if you say I'm building a game and I
love firebase I heard my chat and my
matchmaking off of the real-time
database and all my users get
notifications with remote config but the
gameplay of my game is a first-person
shooter this is something you can't
really build entirely on firebase so you
need some awesome you know enterprise
grade infrastructure to power this this
is where Google Cloud comes in and the
cool thing about Google cloud and
firebase is that they're really close
siblings so if you had for example
firebase analytics and you had all of
these events coming in through firebase
analytics all of your player dust is on
everything like that you can route those
directly into Google cloud platforms
bigquery and in bigquery you'll have the
ability to slice and dice the data in
any way you want you can export it to
data studio like we talked about use
those new templates anything like that
and really dig into your data or if you
have other data for example if you have
an existing game and you have some you
know one of the many other analytics
tools out there and you're like okay
that tool is great but I really would
love to mix that with this firebase
analytics data you can do that in
bigquery and then you can pull it back
out through datastore or if you just
want a dump of all your data you can do
that because firebase integrates so
tightly with Google cloud another
example of this is like firebase storage
firebase storage is backed directly by
Google Cloud storage so if you're
uploading a bunch of files and your
users are manipulating them and doing
whatever and you want your server to go
and access these files or you want your
cloud VM to do
some interaction on these or run it
through the cloud vision API see if
there's a you know a labradoodle or
whatever in the image anything like that
you can do that very easily because
firebase storage is back directly by
Google Cloud storage and that this is an
amazing experience if you want to
integrate out if you want to connect all
these little pieces but at the end of
the day you don't really have to
firebase itself stands alone and every
single one of these features stands
alone so if you're thinking man like
remote config sounds really cool I'd
love to give that a try you can do that
you can go and grab just remote config
grab just that asset package import it
and give it a try without needing
anything else that you don't want and
I'm pretty sure once you try these
things you'll realize that it works
really well and you'll probably like
well I wonder how much better it works
with everything else and you'll see the
power you get from integrating
everything together and once you do this
as we're focusing on our players and
we're building richer experiences you'll
find that that same player who used to
be sort of engaged and used to have fun
with your app becomes like truly truly
in love with it and and keeps coming
back again and again
so some resources firebase platform as a
whole is firebase Google com the C++ SDK
is a slash slash CPP and the Unity SDK
is Docs unity setup I really would just
like to say in general we've we've been
working on this we've talked to a bunch
of unity developers and really put a lot
of love into this SDK because personally
I really love unity and I want to build
really cool things with it so if you can
if you you know go play with it even if
you build like a two hour game or
something that you build on a weekend or
whatever please tweet at me and show me
because I'm just super super excited to
see what you guys build with this so I'm
at Abe is great on Twitter Damian is at
Y indie I believe is how that is
pronounced and yeah thanks for thanks
for listening
