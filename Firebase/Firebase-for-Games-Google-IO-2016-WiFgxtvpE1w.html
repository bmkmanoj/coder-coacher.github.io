games and I guess the first place to
start with this is firebase what is
firebase does anyone know has anyone
heard of firebase before
okay there's perhaps half the rooms out
of firebase before so what is firebase
firebase is a suite of integrated
products designed to help you develop
your app grow a user base and earn money
where does that make sense to everyone
all right yeah well yeah well let's dig
in what does that what does that mean so
we've got a whole suite of different
products and the idea is that you can
pick and choose mix and match the
products that you want to use within
your application and these products are
busted into different groups that are
neighbor you to help you know speed up
the development of your application grow
the user base of your application or a
money from your application so that's
all good stuff right so for example we
have the remote config product unless
enables you to you know deploy an
application then perform a be testing
without redeploying a new version of the
application very very useful we have
cloud messaging and notifications so
this this you can use to re-engage users
try and bring them back into your
application very relevant for game
developers app invites and dynamic links
so these these products when they're
working together can lower you to like
potentially organically grow your
application reward users there's a whole
host of different things that you can do
with these and then finally when you
will actually earn some money we have
AdMob the that you can use to
advertisers in your applications and try
and earn some money from them and then
trying to inter in terms of trying to
measure the effectiveness of all of
these different features in your app or
how well your app is doing in general we
have analytics that ties everything
together and this covers this is
integrated into all of the firebase
products so you get a lot of implicit
signals when you're when you're using
any one of these features okay so games
who plays games in here almost there
free one almost at who develops games oh
my god it's game developer audience okay
you guys might find this boring but for
the people who are watching the video
let's go into it so forty-nine percent
of American adults play games according
to Pew Research that's a pretty big
audience so might be worth getting into
the business
it generates about 10 to 15 percent of
YouTube views at the moment are
associated with gaming in some way
that's pretty massive again in terms of
audience VR is a massive market that's
growing right it's gonna be it's the
next big thing everyone wants to get in
there it's very sexy very interesting
and then there's also just you know
developing join games can be joyful can
be fantastically fun after you suffer a
lot of pain of like grueling hours and
you know all of that sort of sort of
stuff is actually trying to build the
game in the first place so it's a pretty
attractive industry to get into if you
if you're not already a game developer
I'd highly recommend it as a career path
ok so right so you're all sold on that
now right you want to go out and build a
game so how do you go out and be able to
game
well you've got to think about you know
you've got come up with an idea so idea
requires research research involves
playing games you like playing games
that's great we've got that right and
then the other thing is that you have to
figure out how to build the game alright
there's there's a whole host of
different technologies out there and to
build the game and so you know you've
got choose one Andover's you to reach
the audience that you're interested in
so you know if if you just think about
just iOS and Android there's a potential
audience out there over one and a half
billion users that you could you could
get to play your game
so how do you reach those they're two
different operating systems right sounds
like it's gonna be really hard
well actually there's some there's some
old language that you know a lot of
people still use that is actually
cross-platform and you could use to
target both iOS and Android and this is
C++ so c plus plus it's a great great
language to use you can build really
really performant games and you can also
compile for both iOS and Android so
that's fantastic right that's great
there's also a whole host of middleware
out there that you could use to build
your game so you know you I've got a
couple of pieces on the slide here
you've got Coker's to the axe on one
hand if you want to be able to simple
2-d game
there's a whole lot they've got a
platform abstraction layer they have
tools to author content they have ways
for deployment really really cool really
easy to get started with and then on the
other end of the spectrum we've got unit
and I'm real then they wish you to build
really big triple-a titles you know
really fantastic stuff but you know at
the cost of higher complexity so there's
plenty and there's a whole ton of Alpha
middleware out there just have a look on
Wikipedia there's a ton of stuff
available for you to use the other
option is you could roll your own engine
the advantage of doing this is that you
know you can really optimize for your
use case at the expense of having to
build all of the technology yourself or
even pick and choose pieces of
technology so here we've got a screen
shot of pioneering that was built by our
team at Google we built all of the
different pieces and you know the
adviser of it was that in the end we
ended up under understand the entire
stack and we could really optimize for a
use case so right you can go out build
and C++ cross-platform great you know
you've got we want to target multiple
platforms and we're going to use C++
because we know that we can compile our
application c++ application for both
Android and iOS that's great
but all of the platform API is and all
of the SDKs that you see like you know
for example like firebase things like
that they're typically written for app
developers we target in the languages
the first PI languages for those
platforms so it's like objective-c or
Swift for iOS or an Android it's Java
alright so well you know we can work
around this let's see what that looks
like so you know if I was to just try
and retrieve a link from an application
that's just starting up in Android these
three lines of code it's super easy
right so I can find out what your which
URL opened up my own right the first
time I'm getting the intent the thing
that the data that was passed to my
application to figure out what happens I
get the action from it which tells me
whether it was whether someone was
trying to view some data or in my app or
something like that and then finally the
data which is the oriole so what happens
well I'll try and do this in in C++ well
you know I've got to do all this
horrible j'ni there's a bit of
reflection in there as
well this is the first set of code I've
been got a cooler method to retrieve the
string this is the action string and
then if I've got an action string I'll
go and retrieve the array from it and
after I've retrieved an array of got a
copy it and then I'm going to clean up a
load of stuff and on and on it goes all
right so what you're probably wondering
right now why am I talking about C++ it
just sounds like a real pain right
especially when you're talking about API
is that target you know just iOS or
Android and they've written on Objective
C or Java well we thought about this all
right and we built a C++ interface for
firebase so you don't have to do all of
that crazy stuff to use our API you just
you know include our libraries you add
all the appropriate dependencies and off
you go you can write some simple code
that's great we're ready to build a game
now so now I'm ready to build game you
know so what I'd usually do you know try
and get some inspiration I'd have a cup
of tea I'm English I like to perhaps get
some biscuits don't some biscuits or
cookies as you like to call them here
and you know I'm sitting there drinking
my tea having my cookies I know I can do
I can make a game about cookies that's
going to be really cool it's gonna be
super easy right so I come up for you
cookie tap oh you've never heard of
anything like this before surely right
so what are you doing this game right
you tap the cookie you earn points and
you impress your friends we're going
look how many cookies I have great game
all right so this is so this is the code
from my game I've written it in a
library called flat UI and construction
with FPL base they're open source so
basically all this does is for each
frame and till the game exits it renders
a label that says cookies converts the
score to a string renders that in the in
the top right corner and then displays a
cookie and when the cookie buttons
tapped on so where it says you know even
up it anchor increments the score so
they won't display an increase in school
cool I've done my game that was it
some publish it to the Play Store for
example and I'm seeing some installs I
can see it in the play still that's
great
okay so then I'll go and sit down I have
another cup of tea and then you know I
realized well okay I've got my game out
there how do I make any money out of
this no one is gonna pay to download my
cookie tough you know even though it's
obviously the most awesome game out
there right they're not gonna pay for
just tapping a cookie so perhaps I could
earn some money through some advertising
so what do we need to do so the first
thing we need to do is just initialize
firebase it's pretty much one line of
code there's some conditional code in
there for Android because Android is
Android is Android and then and then
after after I've initialized firebase I
then initialize the AdMob API create a
banner view wait for it to start up a
load and add wait for the ad to load and
then finally show the banner that that
was it right how many lines of codes
that that is how hard is that it's so
easy so now I've unlocked advertising
great excellent all right apart from not
seeing any money coming in that's not
very cool I'm gonna have to just live on
tea and no cookies soon so you know I
know people are installing the game but
I don't know how big my audience really
is right so how do I figure that out
well you know as I mentioned before
firebase has a nun League's products
maybe I could use that one line of code
I just initialize the analytics API and
I'm done I've I've enabled analytics
that was it that was the very lowest bar
that I could do you know I we I could do
a lot more but I'm just too lazy on
another cup of tea so I go back and I
offer I've enabled analytics so now from
that I can figure out how many people
have opened the game where the game
install came from whether it was and is
still from the Play Store whether it
whether is an organic install from the
web and whether people are returning to
play like how you know how how good is
my retention for this game how long are
people play in it that's really cool so
I look at I look at the firebase console
and I'm losing cookie tappers people
just
they play the game initially and then
then they're off you know they don't
want to play anymore right
so how can I improve this well I end up
talking to a few of my friends some of
them back there in the corner of the
room and they tell me the cookie we
don't have enough cookie we want more
cookie some way well I interpret that as
obviously we need a bigger cookie right
it's this that's what I need to do so
what I can do is I could run a test all
right so I initialize I'm going to use
remote config for this so initialize the
API
I set the default cookie size to what I
had before which is this magic number
300 I fetch my remote config my remote
configuration and then I get the cookie
size that it from the remote
configuration now if I've done nothing
this will be exactly the same as before
and also a right at the end there I'm
logging the size of the cookie there's
being displays to users all right so
this is this is all I do so I do add
this to my app I redeploy my game and
now I'm gonna be able to remotely
configure my cookie size and then from
the firebase console I can go into the
remote config panel and I can set my big
cookie parameter in there all right so
I've got now I've got a small regular
sized cookie is size 300 and a big
cookie is size 400 and then what I'm
going to do is target that big cookie
around about half of my audience I'm
saying about 49% of my audience so you
know people like half of my players
would get a big cookie and about half
the players will get the regular size
cookie and because I'm looking the
cookie size I should be able to see
which players are seeing which size
quickly finally so you know here I'm
crate and cooks toys and if and what I
do here is I associate the cookie size
that I'm login with an audience in
firebase analytics so I have these two
groups of users that I can then segment
my reports by ok great so now I've got a
big cookie in my game with our update in
it so I could go I could you know try
over cookie size if I wanted without
redeploying the app you know I can and I
can also measure the impacts the cuckoo
size through the firebase and later on
so as well so let's go and have a look
at that so look at my regular cookie I'm
still losing users people don't like the
normal sized cookie and then well look
at the big cookie people like the big
cookie big cookies are here so if I know
the big cookies are hit finally I'll
just set the default size to the big
size and my experiment is done right and
I can just leave that code in my app if
I wanted to change it later okay so now
I want to figure out how to increase my
audience size so I could use I could use
my cookie clickers or I could use the
people who are to share the app with
their friends so I can add app invites
to my cookie tapping application so here
I create an ascender which is a way to
send an invite to their friends to
people's friends I've added a button
which is a share button when the button
is tapped I'm creating a send message
the tire always cookie tap I'm tapping a
cookie and then you know the down the
the link into my app which tells which
tells me where that came from
alright so this it's got this share link
and then finally I send the invite and
what this will do is when when a user
taps on that link that will then ship it
will open up a dialog that will enable
them to share the application with their
friends they can select the friends that
they want to share with and when their
friends click on that link it will
install and open the application in that
with that link associated with it so
here we go here's my share button it's
really pretty and then you know as I
said when people open up the app they
can press that share button and it will
create a dynamic link that installs and
opens the app and then I could take
actions on that link potentially like I
could say when someone opens that link
perhaps they get a rainbow cookie or a
cookie with milk or something like that
okay so then I look at my analytics
dashboard did that make a difference
well I see that it you know resulted in
some more users which is great more you
means more eyes more eyes means more
people potentially clicking on ads more
ads means more cookies for me so I can
dunk um in my tea but I'm seeing low
retention people come and tap my cookie
for like perhaps a week and then they're
done right they're fed up with the game
um perhaps they just forget about the
game there's so many different things
they're vying for your attention so what
I could do is try and bring them back
into the app and so for here I'll use
firebase cloud messaging so what I do is
in my app I create a listener which
waits for messages to be sent to the
application so here when it receives a
message it retrieves some data from the
message called a reward and this could
be an arbitrary string you could you
could do whatever you want here and from
that rewards I end up converting the
value of that reward to a number and
that's my message open Award alright so
what I end up doing in my game loop is I
initialize the messaging API oh you know
with my listener that I created and
every time they tap a cookie now they
get an additional reward for the session
that they opened up that message right
so I can then go to the firebase
notifications console well I could do it
or I could ask my mom to do it because
it's super easy right you do all you
have to do is click in them and fill in
a few fields you could send them you
know of author the message here the
message is more cookies per click
available right now
the label is extra cookies so that was
that's what would show up in the little
notification bar on Android or iOS and
then I schedule a time to send this out
to my users and what I'm going to do in
this particular experiment is just send
it out to Android users and then finally
if someone clicks on this message and
open the app they'll get an extra five
cookies per click more cookies is great
right so I take a look at the impact of
that and now people I actually play
coming back to the application because
they get more cookies fantastic so
what's next
what should you do so I recommend if you
receive bus developer to go and check
out our documentation also check out the
rest of firebase and you can also come
to our support
during the conversation okay thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
