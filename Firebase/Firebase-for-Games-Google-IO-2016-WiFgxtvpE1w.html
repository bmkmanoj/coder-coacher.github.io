games and I guess the first place to
start with this is firebase what is 5
ice does anyone know has anyone heard of
firebase before I've heard of my voice
okay there's perhaps half the rooms out
of firebase before so what is firebase
firebase is a suite of integrated
products designed to help you develop
your app grow a user base and earn money
where does that make sense to everyone
all right yeah well yeah well let's dig
in what does that what does that mean so
we've got a whole suite of different
products and the idea is that you can
pick and choose mix and match the
products that you want to use within
your application and these products are
busted into different groups that are
Nabal you to help you know speed up the
development of your application grow the
user base of your application or a money
from your application so that's all good
stuff right so for example we have the
remote config product unless enables you
to you know deploy an application then
perform a be testing without redeploying
a new version of the application very
very useful we have cloud messaging and
notifications so this this you can use
to re-engage users try and bring them
back into your application very relevant
for game developers app invites and
dynamic links so these these products
when they're working together can lower
you to like potentially organically grow
your application reward users there's a
whole host of different things that you
can do with these and then finally when
you want to actually earn some money we
have an AdMob the that you can use to
advertise in your applications and try
and earn some money from them and then
trying to int in terms of trying to
measure the effectiveness of all of
these different features in your app or
how well your app is doing in general we
have analytics that ties everything
together and this covers this is
integrated into all of the firebase
products so you get a lot of implicit
signals when you're when you're using
any one of these features okay so games
who plays games in here almost everyone
almost at who develops games oh my god
it's game developer audience okay you
guys might find this boring but for the
people who are watching the video
let's go into it so forty-nine percent
of american adults play games accordance
pew research that's a pretty big
audience so might be worth getting into
the business it generates about ten to
fifteen percent of youtube views at the
moment are associated with gaming in
some way as pretty massive again in
terms of audience BR is a massive market
that's growing right it's going to be
it's the next big thing everyone wants
to get in there it's very sexy very
interesting and then there's also just
you know developing gen games can be
joyful can be fantastically fun after
you suffer a lot of pain of like
grueling hours and you know one of that
sort of sort of stuff is actually trying
to build the game in the first place so
it's a pretty attractive industry to get
into if you if you're not really a game
developer i'd highly recommend it as a
as a career path okay so right so you're
all sold on that now right you want to
go out and build a game so how do you go
out and build again well you got to
think about you know you gotta come up
with an idea so idea requires research
research involves playing games you like
playing games that's great we've got
that right and then the other thing is
that you have to figure out how to build
the game alright there's there's a whole
host of different technologies out there
and to build the game and so you know
you've got choose one enables you to
reach the audience that you're
interested in so you know if if you just
think about just ios and android there's
a potential audience out there over one
and a half billion users that you could
you could get to play your game so how
do you reach those they're two different
operating systems right sounds like it's
going to be really hard well actually
there's some there's some old language
that you know a lot of people still use
that is actually cross platform and you
could use to target both ios and android
and this is c++ so c plus plus it's a
great great language to use you can
build really really performant games and
you can also compile for both iOS and
Android so that's fantastic right that's
great there's also a whole host of
middleware out there that you could use
to build your game so you know you I've
got a couple of pieces on the slide here
you've got cocos2dx on one hand if you
want to be able to simple 2-d game
and there's a whole lot they've got a
platform abstraction layer they have
tools to offer content they have ways
for deployment really really cool really
easy to get started with and then on the
other end of the spectrum we've got unit
unreal their neighbours you to build
really big triple-a titles you know
really fantastic stuff but you know at
the cost of higher complexity so there's
plenty and and there's a whole ton of
alpha middleware out there just have a
look on wikipedia there's a ton of stuff
available for you to use the other
option is you could roll your own engine
the advantage of doing this is that you
know you can really optimize for your
use case at the expense of having to
build all of the technology yourself or
even pick and choose piece of technology
so here we've got a screenshot of
pioneering that was built by our team at
Google we built all of the different
pieces and you know the advisor of it
was that in the end we ended up on the
understand the entire stack and we could
really optimized for a use case so right
you can go out build and C++
cross-platform great you know you've got
we want to target mobile platforms and
we're going to use C++ because we know
that we can compile our application C++
application for both Android and iOS
that's great but all of the platform api
is and all of the SDKs that you see like
you know for example like firebase
things like that they're typically
written for app developers who would
target in the languages the first pie
languages flows platform so it's like
objective-c or swift for iOS or Android
it's Java all right so well you know we
can work around this let's see what that
looks like so you know if I was to just
try and retrieve a link from an
application that's just starting up in
Android these three lines of code it's
super easy right so i can find out what
your which URL opened up where right the
first time I'm getting the intent the
thing that the data that was passed to
my application to figure out what
happened I get the action from it which
tells me whether it was whether someone
was trying to view some day tour in my
app or something like that and then
finally the data which is the oral so
what happens well try and do this in C++
well you know I've got to do all this
horrible jni there's a bit of reflection
in there as
well this is the first set of code I've
then got a cool a method to retrieve the
string this is the action string and
then if I've got an action string I'll
go and retrieve the array from it and
after retrieving the right I've got a
copy it and then I'm going to clean up a
load of stuff and on and on it goes all
right so what you're probably wondering
right now why am I talking about c++ it
just sounds like a real pain right
especially when you're talking about API
is that target you know just iOS or
Android and they've written an objective
c or java well we thought about this all
right and we built a C++ interface for
firebase so you don't have to do all of
that crazy stuff to use our API you just
you know include our libraries you add
all the appropriate dependencies and off
you go you can write some simple code
that's great we're ready to build a game
now so now I'm real game you know so
what I'd usually do you know try and get
some inspiration I'd have a cup of tea
I'm English I like to perhaps get some
biscuits aren't some biscuits or cookies
as you like to call them here and you
know I'm sitting there drinking my tea
having my cookies I know I can do I can
make a game about cookies that's going
to be really cool it's gonna be super
easy right so I come up for you cookie
tap oh you've never heard of anything
like this before surely right so what
are you doing this game right you tap
the cookie you earn points and you
impress your friends we're going look
how many cookies i have great game right
so this is so this is the code for my
game I've written it in a library called
flat UI and construction with fpl base
they're open source so basically all
this does is for each frame and seal the
game exits it renders a label that says
cookies converts the score to a string
renders that in the in the top right
corner and then displays a cookie and
when the cookie buttons tapped on so
where it says you know event up it n
Korea increments the score so they won't
display an increase in school cool done
my game that was it all
publish it to the Play Store for example
and I'm seeing some installs I can see
it in the Play Store that's great okay
so then I go and sit down I have another
cup of tea and then you know I realized
well okay I've got my game out there how
do i make coming money out of this no
one is going to pay to download my
cookie tapping out even though it's
obviously the most awesome game out
there right they're not going to pay for
just tap in a cookie so perhaps i could
earn some money through some advertising
so what do we need to do so the first
thing we need to do is just initialize
firebase it's pretty much one line of
code there's some conditional code in
there for Android because Android is
Android is Android and then and then
after after I've initialized firebase I
then initialize the AdMob API create a
banner view wait for it to start up load
and add wait for the ad to load and then
finally show the banner that that was it
right how many lines are codes that that
is how hard is that so easy so now
unlocked advertising great excellent all
right apart from not see any money
coming in that's not very cool I might
have to just live on TM no cookies soon
so you know I know people are installing
the game but I don't know how big my
audience really is right so how do I
figure that out well you know as I
mentioned before firebase has a nun
leagues products maybe I could use that
one line of code I just initialize the
analytics API and i'm done i've i've
enabled analytics that was it that was
the very lowest bother i could do you
know i could do a lot more but i'm just
too lazy on another cup of tea so I go
back and I offer I've enabled analytics
so now from that I can figure out how
many people have opened the game where
the game install came from whether it
was and is still from the Play Store
whether it whether it's an organic
install from the web and whether people
are returning to play like how how how
good is more attention for this game how
long people play in it that's really
cool so I look at I look at the firebase
console and I'm losing cookie tap was
people just
they play the game initially and then
then they're off you know they don't
want to play anymore right so how can I
improve this well I end up talking to a
few of my friends some of them back
there in the corner of the room and they
tell me the cookie we don't have enough
cookie we want more cookie so I'm like
well I interpret that as obviously we
need a bigger cookie right it's this
that's what I need to do so what i can
do is i could run a test all right so i
initialize i'm going to use remote
config for this so i initialize the API
I set the default cookie so as to what I
had before which is this magic number
300 I fetch my remote config my remote
configuration and then I get the cookie
size that it from the remote
configuration now if I've done nothing
this will be exactly the same as before
and also a right at the end there i'm
logging the size of the cookie that is
being displays to users all right so
this is this is all I do so I do add
this to my app I redeploy my game and
now I'm going to be able to remotely
configure my cookie sighs and then from
the firebase console I can go into the
remote config panel and I can set my big
cookie parameter in there right so I've
got now got a small regular sized
cookies sighs three hundred and a big
cookie is size 400 and then what I'm
going to do is target that big cookie
around about half of my audience I'm
saying about forty-nine percent more
audience so you know people like half of
my players would get a big cookie and
about half the players will get the
regular sized cookie and because I'm
akin the cookie sighs I should be able
to see which players are seeing which
size quickly finally so you know here on
create and cook so as an if and what I
do here is I associate the cookie size
that I'm log in with an audience in
firebase analytics so I have these two
groups of users that I can then segment
my reports by okay great so now I've got
a big cookie in my game with our update
in it so I could go I could you know try
alva cookie sighs if I wanted without
redeploying the app you know I can and I
could also measure the impacts the Keuka
size through the firebase analytics com
so as well so let's go and have a look
at that so look at my regular cookie I'm
still losing users people don't like the
normal sized cookie and then when I look
at the big cookie people like the big
cookie big cookies are here so if I know
the big cookies are here finally I'll
just set the default size to the big
size and my experiment is done right and
I can just leave that code in my act if
I wanted to change it later okay so now
I want to figure out how to increase my
audience size so I could use I could use
my cookie clickers where I could use the
people who are to share the app with
their friends so i can add app invites
to my cookie tap in application so here
i create an ascender which is a way to
send an invite to their friends to
people's friends I've added a button
which is a share button when the button
is tapped I'm creating a send message
the tire always cookie tap I'm tapping a
cookie and then you know the down the
the link into my app which tells which
tells me where that came from alright so
this it's got the share link and then
finally I send the invite and what this
will do is when when a user taps on that
link that will then ship it will open up
a dialogue that will enable them to
share the application with their friends
they can select the friends they want to
share with and when their friends click
on that link it will install and open
the application in that with that link
associated with it so here we go here's
my share button it's really pretty and
then you know as I said when people open
up the app they can press that share
button and it will create a dynamic link
that is tools and opens the app and then
I could take actions on that link
potentially like I could say when
someone opens that link perhaps they get
a rainbow cookie or a cookie with milk
or something like that okay so then I
look at my analytics dashboard did that
make a difference well I see that it you
know resulted in some more users which
is great more you
means more eyes more eyes means more
people potentially clicking on ads more
ads means more cookies for me so I can
dunk um MIT but I'm seeing low retention
people come and tap my cookie for like
perhaps a week and then they're done
right they're fed up with the game when
perhaps they just forget about the game
there's so many different things out
there vying for your attention so what i
could do is try and bring them back into
the app and so for here i'll use
firebase Cloud messaging so what I do is
in my app I create a listener which
waits for messages to be sent to the
application so here when it receives a
message it retrieves some data from the
message called a reward and this could
be an arbitrary string you could you
could do whatever you want here and from
that rewards I end up converting the
value of that reward to a number and
that's my message open award alright so
well I end up doing in my game loop is i
initialize the messaging API you know
with my listener that I created and
every time they tap a cookie now they
get an additional reward for the session
that they opened up that message right
so I can then go to the firebase
notifications console well I could do it
or I could ask my mom to do it because
it's super easy right you do all you
have to do is click in and fill in a few
fields you could send you know of author
the message here the message is more
cookies per click available right now
the label is extra cookies so that was
that's what would show up in the little
notification bar on Android or iOS and
then I schedule a time to send this out
to my users and what I'm going to do in
this particular experiment is just send
it out to Android users and then finally
if someone clicks on this message and
open the app they'll get an extra five
cookies per click more cookies is great
right so I take a look at the impact of
that and now people I actually play
coming back to the application because
they get more cookies fantastic so
what's next what should you do so I
recommend if you receive what bus
developer to go and check out our
documentation also check out the rest of
firebase and you can also come to our
ball and during the conversation okay
thank you very much
