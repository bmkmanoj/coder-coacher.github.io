about pirate metrics and Amparo soui
from the developer relations team pirate
metrics is a framework for going your
business that's based on acquisition
activation retention referral and
revenue that's right
in this episode we'll be looking at the
first of these acquisition acquisition
is all about getting users into your app
or site getting them to sign up and
getting them to engage but it's easier
said than done
firebase gives you some technologies
that makes this part easier let's take a
look at some of them first up is tap
indexing now this technology allows
users to discover your app through
surfacing its content in Google searches
that's right so if your app has details
on the best model of eyepatch and there
are people out there looking for a new
eyepatch they can end up in your app
thanks to app indexing it's a great way
to acquire new users and you can learn
more here trance tell friends about
great apps so you can help users of your
app share their app with their friends
using app invites if you incorporate
this in your app then your users have an
easy way to share your app with their
friends it's smart enough to surface the
most relevant contacts and allow them to
send a link to your app via email or SMS
and it won't cost you anything dynamic
links are smarter than old Davy Jones
they bring users directly to content in
your app that they were originally
searching for but here's the best bet if
they don't have your app already
installed it's no problem they'll end up
at that content after installing the app
and not only that once your users have
installed your app the dynamic links are
smart enough to allow your users to be
delighted with personalized promotions
and messages you don't get a second
chance to make a great first impression
and of course there's also traditional
advertising of your app to acquire new
users with AdWords you can automatically
link user segments that fit what you're
looking for with ad campaigns so you
optimize who the ads are delivered to
with firebase analytics it's then easy
to track their performance and tweak it
to improve it when you need to you can
learn more here so that's it for
acquisition and as you can see firebase
has lots of great stuff for you
