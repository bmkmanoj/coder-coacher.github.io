hello do you want to grow your apps do
you if the answer is yes you need a BTS
B and that's why we are here today so
welcome everyone thanks for joining us
in this beautiful city and I'm Marta I
lead the a B testing and remote config
teams with firebase and I'm Lawrence I'm
a Google developer advocate for firebase
and as you saw in the keynote earlier we
announced this new product called a bee
testing did anybody watch it yeah what
do you think about a/b testing I see a
lot of ones this is good this is good
you guys have figured out the paddles
but we're gonna be using them a little
bit later but in this session we're
going to go through a little bit about
what a/b testing is all about so the
goal of this session is to really help
you to get from a place where you're
saying I think or I feel or I guess to a
place where you're gonna say I know and
that's what a/b testing is all about and
helping you to grow your app so when our
agenda first of all we're going to talk
about what really a/b testing is what
it's all about we're going to show a
scenario around a/b testing with a
little bit of audience participation in
it then we're going to do a tour of a/b
testing in firebase so that you'll see
how the product actually works we'll
show you some early adopters and some of
the cool stuff that they've done and
then finally we'll show you how to build
and monitor your own a/b tests are you
ready okay let's go so at Google i/o
2016 we released this product called
firebase remote config and if you've
ever seen me talk at conferences it's
one of my favorite parts of firebase I
geek out about firebase config all
remote configure all the time and since
day one when we put it out we've been
really amazed that the kind of things
that people have been doing using remote
config and one of the creative ways that
people use remote config almost-- right
out of the gate was to do a/b testing
you know it's a perfect technology to be
able to do that but it was also it had
some limits and when we looked at what
people were doing to be able to achieve
a be testing or remote with firebase
remote config we realized that you know
we could build a much more powerful tool
so that you can use this powerful tool
to continuously grow your app right
arter right so
since then we have been working really
hard to put together a tool that lets
you do true a/b testing a tool that lets
you not only to make changes to your app
but also to track and compare the effect
of those changes and today we are really
happy to announce the firebase a/b
testing as a public beta so what's an
a/b test right in a nutshell it is just
comparing two versions of something to
each other to see which one performs the
best of course there are some variations
to it for instance sometimes there are
more than just two versions of that
thing right so it becomes a ABN test and
sometimes the difference between those
versions include more than just a single
parameter change then you end up with a
multivariate test I'm pretty sure some
of you are already running such
experiments with your apps right but
others might be wondering why they
should care about this like what's the
point
well a B testing can actually help you
in many ways first of all it can help
you eliminate the guesswork and make
data-driven decisions as Lauren's
mentioned earlier it will help you
replace I guess or I think with I know
it will let you try different ideas to
see what your users like the best and
sometimes it will help you discover that
maybe they don't care that much about to
change that you have been overthinking
so there's something that you can learn
from every single experiment sometimes
you learn something by learning nothing
but sometimes you learn by realizing
that something that you were predicting
it's something that you're guessing
isn't the truth but we thought it's a
lot easier for us to show this rather
than tell it so we came up with this
simple example so meanwhile in the not
so real world there is this famous
website that you may have all have heard
of and it is Simon's stash store has
anybody visited Simon's stash store
where we sell the finest fake mustaches
you know and you know we're the fight
with the purveyors of the finest fake
facial hair on her Majesty's green earth
and I'm celebrating today because as the
CEO of Simon / store
I've actually updated our website today
and I've built it today
all by myself and I've seen sales grow
by 300% today alone isn't that awesome
yeah so what did you do to get that
growth - well it's not actually real
hair oh no not that one I meant to miss
who say oh that was just simple genius I
went and I edited the website and I made
some changes because I know what people
love and particularly people buying fake
mustaches I know the kind of things that
they really love so it was just simple
genius I just went and changed the site
right maybe let's look into that in more
detail do you mind if we run a quick a B
test an a/b test yeah okay sure let's
run our Navy test see why we're selling
three times as many mustaches okay so in
order to do this we're gonna need some
audience participation so I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna divide you right down the
middle okay and you people in this side
you folks
I know these seats are staggered so it
makes it hard so if you're kind of in
the middle you can pick but everybody on
this side you're gonna be team a okay
you got it your team all right cool and
everybody on this side guess what team
you are baby yes firebase developers are
a really bright people on this side
you're gonna be team B okay so does
everybody have a paddle yeah okay
perfect
so when it comes next slide so team B
what I need you to do for the next few
moments is close your eyes
okay and no peeking that means you sir
no peeking I see people like they're
speaking between their fingers now okay
so team B you're gonna close your eyes
and team a we're gonna test the site and
you first and in a few moments team B
it'll be your turn okay right so team a
here we go this is what our website was
like yesterday isn't it gorgeous okay so
in a second I will show you what it
looks like today and using your pedals
we want you to tell us if you are
feeling happy or sad about this change
so as you might have guessed green side
is happy the right side is sad ready
this is what it looks like today so let
us see your votes
oh okay he's gonna grab the compliment
that's interesting
all righty okay so Team B now you can
open your eyes some some people on TV
are voting
I guess not having you yeah so TV you
can open your eyes and now team a it's
your turn to close your eyes okay and or
you can hide behind your paddle and
again no peeking all right so team B and
if you here giggles definitely no
peeking so team P in the same way we're
gonna ask you to vote we're going to
show you the website before and then
we're going to show you the website
after and we're gonna vote if it makes
you happy or sad okay right so team B
same deal this is what the app looked
like yesterday now this is what it looks
like today
show your pedals good inside as happy
red side said isn't this design genius
okay all right so everyone you can open
your eyes
thank you for your cooperation you guys
are awesome so for the folks who really
close their eyes this is what we showed
team a which didn't really have any
changes in it and this is the version
team B so so yeah so team B thank you
for voting on that side okay let's get
the results yeah let's look at the
results all right like your change made
such an impressive improvements but but
why did we like increase our sales by
300% if it wasn't for the cats
I don't know does anyone have any
guesses considering we built the site
just today and we had like a 300%
increase anyone close how about a little
hint it's Halloween this fight right so
well thanks for helping us out with that
little vote and you know while this
scenario it's a kind of a flippant and
it's a fun one you know hopefully it
begin to show to you the power of a/b
testing so me thinking that
you know putting cats would make this a
much much better website obviously
didn't work and I thought I was an
expert but no matter how much of an
expert we are the wisdom of our
customers and the wisdom of crowds is
far better than the wisdom of an
individual and the theme of moving from
I think and I guess and I feel - I know
is something that's really then made
very very powerful when individuals can
use your application and individuals
based on their behavior and based on
their votes in this case can help us
understand you know so that we can
observe behavior we can change our our
app or our site on the fly we think it's
pretty cool and powerful stuff and that
ultimately is what a/b testing is all
about right order right so every test
thing is not really anything new right
it has been actually around for more
than a century now what we're trying to
bring you is a simple way of performing
them so let's go ahead and look at what
firebase a/b testing can do for you as
we walk through the common steps of an
a/b test so we start with your app and
it's entire user base right then using
the targeting conditions you specify
which subset of your users you want to
run an experiment on you can say 5% of
my dutch-speaking users or you can say
10% of all the members of an analytics
audience for instance as we announced
earlier today you can target with the
new firebase predictions as well so you
can target the users who are predicted
to turn divided them into health and see
if offering a free item in your game for
instance will help you also tell us
about your goal aka the metric that you
are trying to improve so then you define
what it is that you want to experiment
with and this is called defining your
variants and this can be one or more
remote configuration parameters that
you've defined in your app such as the
color or location of your Buy Now button
as you can see in this slide or it can
be the message text in a push
notification that's performed using
firebase cloud messaging so the users
that you choose will be randomly
assigned to the variants of your
experiments and they'll all be roughly
the same size that's the variance not
the users right that's great so well
they said they would laugh at that one
but
it happens so when you start running
your experiment these users and their
engagements with your app will be
tracked by Google Analytics for firebase
the data will then be processed to
present you with the statistical
analysis of your experiments results
this is the same robust stats engine
that has been powering Google optimize
which is Google's free website testing
and personalization tool so you give
your experiment some time to run and
then you check back to see the results
to see which one of your variance was
the most helpful in achieving your goal
it's also important to note that this
isn't like a pure standalone product
it's really integrated with the rest of
firebase so for example with things like
remote configuration that we're going to
be showing and notifications that were
going to be showing in a moment
firebase AV testing integrates really
neatly with these and even with
predictions
so you've seen predictions earlier on
and predictions can define these audited
can they find these user groups that
you're going to use based on a predicted
model and they can be used for a/b tests
too so it's really really cool and so
one of the neat things that I love about
firebase is that while so many products
in it you know you can choose which ones
you want to use but they also integrate
together really really neatly but should
we explore a couple of scenarios where
we use them let's do it
so say you want to increase the rates
that users refer your app to their
friends and one of the things that
always comes up in discussions like this
is like okay not enough people are
touching the refer button so maybe we
should like make it pop a little bit
more has anybody ever heard that
expression for a marketing person make
it pop you know so we thought okay let's
make it pop a little bit more by
changing the color so here you can see
we have our application and like you
know we have the basic refer button on
the left and then we thought would try
red green and blue variants and I
personally like the green one because
it's like it referred it's like life
it's warm it's it's I'm from Ireland
it's the Irish color so I think
everybody would go for green and oh
thank you so how about you are the color
I would go for the red one
you're a red big red button you know big
red button the people of Persia okay so
that's just thinking and feeling but
should we put it to the test
yeah let's look into how you can do this
with five ways they'd be testing so if
you can switch through the
machine right so we're gonna start with
the home page of your firebase console
and we are going to navigate to the
remote config sites here we are greeted
with the parameters that we have already
defined right but on the right hand side
of the page I'm hoping that you will
notice the new a be testing button with
a little bigger icon clicking on there
will take us to a side line the new
sideline sidebar sorry
which is going to show us all our
current and pests a be tests so right
now is saying like we don't have been
running experiments so let's go ahead
and create one so experiments are
created in three stages the first one is
just entering the experiment basics so
we are gonna give a name let's call
different tests there's an optional
description field that we are gonna say
trying out different colors then I'm
going to choose my app there are other
targeting conditions being offered here
but for the sake of the demo I'm gonna
skip that and then it's asking us what
percentage of these users do we want to
run this experiment on I'm gonna put 10
there click on next we come to the
variant definitions so in the example
that we showed you there were four
variations right we started with the
white one which is the current one in
our app and then we had three more
variants so I'm gonna use the add
variant button to add two more variants
so that is four total and this became an
ABN test we are gonna rename them
accordingly as well then it's time to
specify what we want to experiment with
clicking on that parameter button will
show us our existing remote config
params you can also search here here you
can also search here too if you have a
lot of parameters this can be helpful
and if you wanted to you can even create
a new parameter directly from this page
for the sake of this experiment we are
gonna use the refer bottom color event
which is a custom event that we are
logging to our Google Analytics for
firebase and I'm gonna name I'm gonna
give the colors
aliens as well I'm gonna leave the
control group empty which means use the
default in defined in remote config
which was white for our case and finally
we get to the gold stage this is where
we tell the tool what we are interested
in improving we said we start by
selecting our primary goal and this
brings up some built-in objectives
firebase a/b testing is providing you
such as engagement revenue and different
retention periods as well as all your
conversion and regular analytics events
for this experiment we are interested in
increasing the number of people
referring the app so we are going to use
this custom events then we also give you
a chance to specify a few additional
metrics as secondary goals so that you
can keep an eye on this for this
experiments we are going to use
retention two to three days there are
also some advanced options that you can
set such as an activation event for your
experiments we are going to skip those
one or two then clicking on the review
button will create this experiment in
the draft States here you are supposed
to review what you have entered to make
sure everything looks right you also
have the option of clicking the manage
test devices which will let you send any
of your variants to your development
device that way you can test if you are
breaking anything or if the colors look
good on your app then if everything
looks good you will click the start
experiment button and your experiment
will start running just like those
cooking shows on the TV we have run this
experiment for you so I'm gonna switch
there and here you can see like on the
right hand side on the completed tab we
have the experiments and the results are
just as delicious yeah so now with this
experiment the tool is telling us that
there was no leader in achieving your
primary goal so I want to look at the
results and I'm gonna look at the in
detail so I start with the improvements
overview section here for each of my
variants the tool is showing me how much
they improved like what was the
improvement range over the baseline the
control group then if I want to see even
more details either by clicking on one
of these columns or using this drop down
box
I can switch between my goals to see the
detailed view so let's scroll down and
look what that looks like I'm gonna use
the blue button example on the left hand
side you will see how many unique users
were exposed to this variant that's what
1823 that is correct okay and on the
right hand side you will see how many of
them actually converted how many of them
lock the custom event that you are
looking for then the stats engine behind
this is telling us with 95 percentile
confidence interval or 95 percentile
probability what the actual conversion
rate is gonna be so it is saying with 95
percentile confidence the real-life
conversion rate will be somewhere within
this range we also provide like the 50
percentile and the median for you to use
then for all the variants other than the
control group
it will show you what the again 95% self
confidence improvement over the baseline
will be so for blue variants it is
saying like it's gonna be somewhere
between minus 2 to plus 3 so we are not
exactly clear if it's gonna really
improve or not then along with it it
will give you the probability of meeting
the control group the baseline and maybe
the most important metric of all it
shows you what's the probability of this
variant to become the best
and now this experiment didn't end up
with a leader but that's still very cool
we learned something so as a next step
we might want to try out different
colors or maybe we will play with the
location or double off the button or
maybe the shape so based on color alone
it's a flat bar chart so I mean didn't
win is what you're telling me yes slice
again thank you so in this case you saw
when we ran this test we had the four
buttons of four different colors and
typically you'd use remote confit to do
that and any remote config developers
here by wave of paddles okay if you cool
and so if you haven't used
configuration before this is what the
code looks like in Android so the parts
that we've highlighted in yellow in this
case of the important parts so like a
remote config variable you get a string
in this case we got the string which is
a referral button color and in this you
know we would we pass that to a parse
color so it turned red into a color and
those kind of things and then in
analytics we log an event to that so we
love the refer button click so if you've
ever written a remote config code you
know that it will look something like
this and very similar in iOS okay
now a lot of times I go to developer
conferences and usually when I go to
developer conferences I take a camera
with me because it's really hard to
write down code and I might forget like
later on so like whenever there's
something important and cold I always
like to take a picture so if you if
you're would like me and you like to
take a picture I guarantee that the next
slide with the changes that you have to
do to be able to get a be testing is the
one you want to take a picture of so
I'll give you a minute to get your
camera's ready okay everybody's ready
let's take a look at the changes you see
it oh I see ones good so you know that's
it's really there are no changes at all
if you're currently using remote config
you know and I strongly recommend even
if you don't want to do a be testing
remote can't figure it's such a powerful
tool and if you're currently using it
then to be able to take advantage of her
for a be testing is you really don't
have to make any changes at all you just
have to update to use the latest
firebase SDKs
so should we look at another scenario
sure okay another one of my favorites
firebase cloud messaging I love to speak
about firebase cloud messaging and I
love to geek out about it but I don't
have enough time and this talk to do
that well I'll give an example of like
using for our based cloud messaging is
like a great way to increase engagement
with your users of course is to send
them notifications a great way to turn
your users off is also to send them
notification so you have to be really
careful about sending notifications to
users and crafting the notifications
once you do using something like
predictions you can start getting an
audience of people who are likely to
respond favorably to a notification and
then you can start thinking about the
notification that you would send to them
but then instead of just sending them
all the same notification a be testing
is something that you can use here so
for example we thought okay like for an
application like this
what would work better would a plain
text message like saying check out the
new Halloween themed levels work or
would something with like you know a
little bit more enticing and some
graphics in it where we say spooky new
levels to play in which of these would
work better and should we take a look at
how you'd build that into remote come
into notification sir so let's please
switch to the demo machine again and
let's look at what it looks like for
notifications so this time we are gonna
navigate to the notifications page again
we are presented today be testing option
here and we are gonna go out and create
our first notifications a/b test again
we start with the basics so we give it a
name I'm gonna skip over the description
for now I'll choose the app I'm gonna
leave it at 5% this time so here we had
three readings
two of them are gonna get different type
of messages but we also want the third
one which will not receive a message to
be present in the experiment so that we
can wire level 8 in which message is
gonna do better we can also take a look
at whether if we are better off not
sending a message right so we are gonna
say let's call this the normal text and
this one the team text
I like spooky text I won't say no all
right so with normal text we're just
gonna get say check out and for the
spooky one do anything spook jungle or
spooky levels as you're typing life can
i all right and again we are leaving the
control group blank which means that
variant is not gonna receive a
notification then we go to our gold
stage this time I'm gonna go in go for
one of the built-in objectives and I'm
gonna select the daily user engagements
and then let's keep the retention four
seven and also add purchase revenue here
again you are presented with the
Advanced Options if you are using
firebase notifications already
you should be familiar with those they
are gonna be available through a/b
testing as well so let's go ahead and
click the review button again we will
check to see if we entered anything
wrong by mistake if everything looks
good then we can go ahead and start the
experiments or we can use the manage
test devices button to send one of these
variants to our development devices
assuming everything looks good let's
switch over to the cooking show
experiments and would get the results so
this time the tool is telling us that it
actually declared the leader the team
text or the spookie test was the clear
leader in our primary goal the daily
user engagements so looking at the
improvements overview we see that both
of the cases where we sent a message
actually improved over the baseline
which was a silent message case however
the team texts outperform the normal one
so it was declared as a leader with high
confidence in this case as I found a
leader I can choose to roll out the
experiment to all my users using this
overflow menu here one thing to note
there is firebase a be testing will not
send this message the leader message to
the users who have already received one
or other notification within this
experiments because we don't want to
annoy them right we all love
notification spam right all right let's
please go back to the slides now so I
think that's pretty cool stuff and I
think it's really neat how the console
has all of this integrated with it and
so you can do things with remote config
you can do things with notifications and
firebase cloud messaging and of course
predictions as well and so just want to
talk a little bit about a couple of
people that we had in our early adopters
and what they did and so there was this
palco mp3 was built by studio sol and
they had the same problem that many
people who make apps that present
content have that if you want to
maximize your engagement it always
always ends up in an a/b decision
between do we show what's trending now
or do we show curated content for users
and it's like I've been in rooms like
discussing these kind of things and
there's passionate arguments for both
sides
but when you can a be test it with your
actual audience to see which works then
you can actually start really gaining
intelligence from your audience and
build a better app for your audience and
what they've been doing is they've been
running a b test to provide these two
options to their users and then the
results of this they've been able to
feed into their ongoing design and
content curation process there's no such
thing as finished software right so the
you're able to when you're able to have
the wisdom of crowds continue to inform
your design process then you can
continually build a much better out for
their users and then Zampa that these
they make it's an app for like finding
rental apartments and they launched a
new thing about like ants arm it's like
a concierge service for finding
apartments for you and they've been
using a/b testing in it but there was
one quote that came out of them that i
just really wanted to highlight because
it was very dear to my heart and that
was that the power of this kind of a/b
testing you know a/b testing has been
around for a while but the power of
doing this type of a/b testing wasn't
available to smaller app developers or
smaller publishers and when they started
using it and they saw that hey you know
they're not a giant company and they
were able to do these kind of
experiments to really improve their app
to grow their app and to build a better
app that you know they gave us this
quote and i just think it's beautiful
that you know where they say it helps
really level the playing field and
that's ultimately what firebase is all
about we really want to help every
developer level the playing field by
giving you these powerful tools thank
you
so as you like it so much how about some
tips for running your abs are some tips
for running with ABS so first of all
your radians need to be exposed to the
same type of users selected in a
randomized fashion over the same time
periods otherwise you usually end up
with what is called a bias in your
experiments which will lead to sometimes
wrong results firebase a/b testing
already takes care of this for you so
you don't have to worry about your ball
with an experiment is to reach
statistical significance which requires
enough time and enough users so while
running tests make sure you have a good
sample size if you realize that you are
not getting enough people into your
experiments our tool will provide you
with a quick and easy way to increase
the distribution also make sure your
experiment has enough time to run before
you reach your own conclusions recency
bias is very real and also usually very
dangerous as well choose your goals very
carefully don't cause damage towards one
goal while trying to improve another for
instance don't crash your retention
rates while you are trying to improve
the purchase revenue with firebase a/b
testing we let you choose a primary goal
and then to specify some secondary ones
to keep an eye on but it's also
important to note that it's usually not
a very good idea to look at too many
metrics as it will create some noise
having clarity around which metrics are
important for you will always always
lead to better decisions so so how do
you get started since two ways you can
do first of all is you can meet me
outside with a big pile of cash now it's
just kidding or secondly it's actually
the beta is available today and so if
you if you have a firebase project it's
available for you to get started with it
today but in your application the first
thing that you'll need to do is to
enable analytics in your app we'd
strongly recommend this anyway Google
Analytics for firebase is a no-cost
product and some of the things that I've
seen people and the type of intelligence
that people have been able able to
gather from their apps using this is
fabulous
so enable Google Analytics for firebase
in you
app enable remote configure
notifications if you're an Android
developer it's a simple single line and
your build our Gradle to do that and
with iOS is just a pod file that you add
very very simple to do so enable these
things and then start thinking about the
type of things you would experiment on
do you want the cats on your website or
do you not and start setting up these
experiments and you know using the tips
that Arda was talking about earlier like
you know just be careful about the
variables that you're choosing and then
continually as with everything evaluate
measure redesign and continue to iterate
you know a single a/b test probably
won't give you the solution to all of
your problems but it will start gaining
that intelligence of crowds to come into
your application and you know it's
something we've made a start we're
releasing it to you today as a beta and
we just love to hear your feedback on
how to improve it alright let me ask
again do you want to grow your apps so
we think firebase AV testing is going to
be right for you it's simple powerful
does not require any code changes and
can run different types of experiments
regardless of your experiment type you
almost always have the same underlying
goal and at firebase we share this goal
with you let's grow your apps grow all
those apps
food that without just want to give you
all a great big thank you for being here
thanks for listening out to our a little
bits of silliness and to listening to
the product that we have we were going
to be at their asked for our bass lounge
if you've got any questions for us and
you can also check out the developer
site on firebase google.com there's lots
of great stuff on a/b testing there and
Todd Kerpelman is producing a fabulous
video series on it so go check that out
and please stop by if you've any
questions for us thank you Ron</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
