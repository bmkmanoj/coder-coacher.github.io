UX designer at Google and I'm here today
together with Steven Alfonso and John to
talk about online identity experiences
and how to make them better but first
I'm gonna need a volunteer from the
audience and you taking a picture what's
your name
Libby highly with nice to meet you I'm
Sarah that one there so that is pretty
normal everyday identity experience just
ask somebody their name now we know each
other now I can refer to her now I can
even make this presentation better can I
use your name to make this person
excellent thank you so let's see if I
want to do the same thing online let's
say I have an app about food and Libby's
trying to use it and she will have to
decide if she already has an account or
not she kind of heard about that before
but she's not sure so she's tried to
sign up for the app so she'll have to
enter the email and password the Ducks
are the password counters by the way so
how to type two times her password and
the account already exists she forgot
that she already signed up some time ago
so she tries to signing she typed surf
password that you use everyday living
please don't use the same password
always it's not safe by the way well
anyways she tries and it's not the same
password that she used last time so
since Libby is my based client ever and
she's gonna keep pushing to use this app
she's going through the recovery flow so
she'll have to type her username check
her email go click here and then she
will be back to reset your password
she's going to type two times again her
password and
success the passwords who said she tries
to signing thank you leaving by the way
your best so she sizing types another
password and finally maybe it's in she
can use my app but you never noticed
that you're signing into the website not
to the app because the recovery flow
isn't up it's a wet flow so you have to
switch and finally another password and
you're in Thank You Libby you're the
best
please believe it so as you can see it's
not very easy for Livi to remember first
vs. or even to remember that she had an
account or how they sign in you can use
passwords you can sum phone number you
can use IDPs and it's quite quite
frankly very different difficult and
also in my kind of shame to say this 17
years of experience in designing
websites and apps I never had the client
asking me or telling me this or magical
experience is going to start by asking
everybody to sign up type of password
that doesn't happen usually goes like we
have this happen this technology is
gonna do days it's gonna be awesome and
it's gonna be great and live he's gonna
love it and so every erase so you have
to sign in users oh yeah and you have to
sign up you create the account
oh yeah well after that's gonna be
awesome it's gonna be great and we're
gonna do this and dad blah blah blah and
to be honest this happens a lot and it
is how it should be you should not care
about your authentication system because
it's not your business so your core
functionality but the downside is that
without that nothing works and here said
no one ever said that so it's also very
difficult for developers to do it
because you have to cover all these
cases you have to keep it secure all the
time and you have to cover all these
platforms that Levy uses like foam
watches computers blah blah blah and
it's very difficult to this so we
believe that it should be simpler it
should be easier and today we're going
to talk about these three products that
we are working on to make that thing
happen John thanks Emma I'm John I'm a
Anjali it on identity platform and if
you went to Sabine and the Chrome web
security teams talked yesterday one of
the interesting details that you might
have learned is that the top password in
2015 one two three four five six and of
course this has followed very quickly by
the number three password which is two
orders of magnitude more secure seven
eight and if you take a look at the top
20 passwords you'll see that six of the
top 20 actually are simply just number
sequences between one and four and one
and nine and most of the rest of them
are just character sequences straight
down the line as well
QWERTY things like this and of course we
have the illustrious number two of
password now there's two ways that we
can look at this and one is as of course
a problem statement that we talk about a
lot of the time this is a huge problem
when people secure their lives their
online communication their payments
information their financial information
and so on online and I think that's been
pretty well documented but the other way
we can view this is as an opportunity
and that's what we see with identity
platform as well the opportunity is
engendered in the fact that each one of
these passwords the salient feature of
them is not that they're bad is that
they're simple users demand that degree
of simplicity and it's our challenges
identity platform and is the developer
community overall to present an equally
simple user experience that increases
the users security and that's the theme
underlying our work with Google sign-in
in the last year now Google sannen is a
product that we're all familiar with it
helps users sign in using their Google
accounts to your app or a website so
what have we done to help simplify this
for users as well as for developers in
the last year now I'm sure that
everybody has seen a consent screen
which is the first thing you see when
you tap Google sign-in or any other
identity provider that looks something
like this it's a wall of text there's a
bunch of stuff to read and understand
and you might ask yourself what actually
am i sharing with the with this site
does the site even really need it are
they gonna spam me what
actually is here it's not especially
clear and every moment that the user
pauses to consider any of these
questions is a moment they could just
bail out of your app to begin with now
not everybody is quite as persistent as
Libby so what did we do to help counter
this we created the account ship UI
based on the concept that what you see
is what you give account ship UI shows
exactly the information that will be
shared with the website in this
particular case and in general we focus
around the concept that we call basic
profile which is what we've focused our
SDKs around overall to the core
information that we found in surveys
with developers that is necessary to get
you into an app or a site proto URL name
and email address it's just that simple
let's take a look at what it looks like
with one of our partners doodle open the
app tap sign and connect with Google tap
the account information and you're in
doodle can sign assign you in or sign
you up using that information pretty
straightforwardly I'm happy to announce
that while we while we released a count
ship for Android at the during last
Google i/o within the next couple of
weeks we're going to be rolling out this
functionality on web and iOS finally
such that you have the same experience
no matter which platform you start on
but that's only half the experience
because we've also wanted to work to
simplify the integration process for
developers as well and to make it a
faster and more robust and we did so by
focusing all of our SDKs around the
concept of ID tokens ID tokens are jots
JSON web tokens which is encoded JSON
which includes a bunch of information
including the profile information that I
just mentioned you before and that's
partnered with a cryptographically
generated signature signed with Google's
private key but which can be verified
using Google's publicly on your backends
using libraries that are both open
source as well as provided as part of
firebase authentication server side SDK
to illustrate how this helps simplify
the sign-in process for your site let's
talk about the old flow and this is the
old flow wherein you call the sign-on
API and in response you'll get an access
token or a code both of which you'll end
up at either of which you'll end up
having to send it to your app back-end
if it's a code you add even more
complexity exchanged again for an access
token but in either case you have an app
back and the venn needs to make a get
info call or a user info call to the
identity providers back and actually get
the user in from
that you translate the into an account
record now this is alive this is
important to note that this is a live
call that happens while the user signing
and so it has latency a bunch of things
can go wrong and it's actually not
standardized either over identity
providers so you need to implement
custom code to be able to pull pull this
stuff apart actually get the information
you need name email address and so on
and translate that into user record
which is represented as a cookie or
session info now as developers we know
that less is more and any complexity is
bad complexity due to Murphy's Law
anything that can go wrong will go wrong
so ID tokens are great because they help
remove this entire middle stretch we
have to make a request to the get info
endpoint figure out that what the
information is and return it so let's
take a look at what the ID token flow
looks like now you call the sign-in an
SDK and in response you'll get an ID
token that ID token can be sent to your
app back-end and can be decoded by
verifying its signature once the
signature has been verified the
information within it can be trusted and
as I mentioned before that information
contains all the basic profile
information we included before which can
be used to translate into a account and
account record on your back-end as
simple as that let's take a look at what
this looks like on the client as well as
the server side on the client you'll
notice here on Android as an example
that our default setting is now simply
just to request basic profile
information you've built the Google API
client you fire an intent and upon the
sign-in response you'll end up being
able to pull out the ID took and just as
simple as that now the firebase
authentication server side SDK is has
been launched with the rest of the
firebase authentication product which we
announced two days ago it exposes an API
that you can see right here called
verify ID token which does all the heavy
lifting for you of decoding the token
verifying its signature and doing a
bunch of additional security checks too
once the code my token has been decoded
it contains all the information that you
need so javascript looks very much the
same as well wherein you call signed in
and in the response you have an ID token
which you can send to your back-end we
support nodejs
in the firebase authentication server
SDK - which exposes the same method and
verify a ID token in this response
you'll have access to all the
information that you need but that's
only half the story as much as we love
Google sign-in and I do we have to
knowledge that there's a number of
password accounts out there as well
and to talk about how identity platform
helps improve matters for after that I
introduced Stevens honest thanks John so
my name is Steven I'm a product manager
on the Google identity platform and
today we're gonna talk about what
happens next
so once you've taken John's advice and
you've added a Google sign-in button to
your app you might have a sign-in screen
that looks something like this and let's
see what happens to Livie when she comes
across this experience so now there's a
few buttons at the top and you have to
remember which one it is that you picked
last time and have to sort out what will
happen if you pick a different button
next time there's still problems of all
those legacy existing users who have a
username and password and then there's
this perennial problem about having
different forms of sign in/sign up UI
and the confusion between them and it
gets even worse as we go to mobile where
you have to type all this information in
on a phone and it can be really painful
so all of these pieces add up in studies
that we've done and industry research
that we've looked at we find that nearly
half of people who see a sign up or sign
in screen don't actually end up
completing the action successfully so
this can range from all manner of things
from picking the wrong button and
getting into a confusing situation to
remembering having to remember your
password and recover it to be confused
about trying to create an account when
one already exists probably an
experience that you've seen yourself and
so if you put all these little pieces
together it can be a really major
drop-off in the users that you see to
your app that if potentially half of the
users who are trying to complete a
transaction or signup or subscribe to
your app are dropping off in one of
these flows that's as many as twice as
many users that you could potentially
have if you can smooth these flows out
and so that's what we're going to take a
look at today is the smart lock set of
api's provide ways that can assist the
user to make it easy to create an
account to sign up or to be able to sign
back in automatically
now we've launched google smart lock on
android last year and some of the new
things we'll talk about this year are
the ability to automatically sign in the
web in Chrome new api's that we offer to
assist in signing up and most
importantly I think what we really want
to look at is some of the great
implementations that partner
developer as many of whom are in the
audience have done and some of the great
performance that they've seen so let's
do a quick recap of the main pieces of
functionality that the smart lock API
provides so imagine you're at i/o and
you're standing in line to pick up the
ticket when you get here and you pull
the ticketing app that you use out of
your pocket last year we showed
Eventbrite and here's Ticketmaster and
we have new apps like CT coming soon you
open up the app and instead of having to
remember your user name and password the
app simply shows you this blue bar and
your tickets right away there's no
fumbling having to recover your account
while everyone's waiting in line behind
you probably reduces the stress a lot
when you're in a tight situation so
that's really nice to be able to sign
people in automatically and it would be
even better if we could do it on the web
so let's walk through an example here
with hrs this is a hotel reservation app
that Google actually uses for our own
reservations so I'm happy to see this
available on the web if you start in the
native app here you can create an
account do some searches basically you
set up your entire itinerary and then
once you've created an account you're
offered to save that password or save
the account that you've used if you've
logged in with Facebook or with Google
and then the idea is that once you visit
the website and maybe this is where you
want to complete your transaction where
you're entering credit card information
for example you can visit the site and
instead of having to find that login
button and remember to be logged in
you'll simply be automatically signed in
and this is live on the web right now so
you can even try this on hrs and we also
have alibaba's Express app LinkedIn and
a number of others who are who are live
right now like the Guardian with this
functionality on the web so that's new
this year and just to take a look at how
this would be implemented in an app that
you're building it's pretty straight
forward and that's one of the nice
things that you can do this purely with
a client-side change in your app or on
the front end of your website so when
you need to get somebody signed in
perhaps when your app is starting is
what our recommendation is you construct
a credential request so credential
request has a few properties you
basically specify what types of
credentials you can support on this
platform so whether it's the username
passwords or whether you'd like a
pointer that says hey this person has
signed in with Google or with Facebook
and it's that provider you need to talk
to to get a token to authenticate this
user
so once you've constructed their
you pass it into our request API and
then you'll get called back you'll get
called back with any results that are
available or you can just proceed to a
normal sign in if there's nothing so if
you get something back you can look at
what you've got it'll have the
identifier so the username or the email
address or maybe even a phone number
that you've saved previously or the user
has opted in to save in Chrome and then
it comes with it an account type so if
it's a Facebook sign-in you can look at
that and say I need to talk to Facebook
or if it's the password you can just
take that password submitted on behalf
of the user as though they typed it in
themselves set up a session and at that
point you have an authenticated user you
can show them the relevant signed in
content right away as soon as they open
the app and that's really valuable
because if we look at some examples here
one on the web that I think is worth
calling out in a second is the Guardian
we're calling this request API in Chrome
they can do the same thing have a
someone who's a web user automatically
signed in and it's very valuable for
them that they now have this huge bump
in cross-device signed in usage and you
can imagine for apps like The Guardian
or the New York Times who we showed last
year how valuable this is to be signed
to have signed in users across your
platforms as a publisher to be able to
do cross-device analytics to keep users
signed in show them relevant content
maintain their subscription information
without having to provide the support
around getting signed back in or
recovering from forgotten accounts so
that's the automatic sign-in
functionality but to get there we should
take a closer look at how this
information is saved and I'll show an
example here in a second that I really
want to call out and that's saving non
password information but first looking
at an app like Skyscanner the
traditional flow is you enter the
password you get this save dialog in
fact over the last year we've seen
across all the apps that implement this
a 65% save weight about two and three
users will opt in to save this
information and those users can then be
automatically signed in so to take a
look at it what it looks like now
without a password if you're clicking
for example the Facebook button here
agreeing to the consent and then getting
a token from Facebook New York Times
will offer and you can try this in the
live app right now offer to save the
account and what it's doing here is
instead of saving a username in a past
you're saving username and a string that
says with Facebook so you know what to
look for next time when they come back
you'll see that the app will open this
is on a brand new install completely
different device the blue bar shows they
go to Facebook get the token sign you in
and you never even had to see the login
screen so let's take a look at how
that's implemented so in this case
you'll create a credential object that
you need to save and you can see the two
variations here on the top you create a
username and password account or if it's
a non password account you can set other
types of usernames so for example an
email address or a phone number and then
set the type so whether it was with
Facebook with Google or some sort of
other type that you support like phone
numbers then you pass the credential
object into the Save API you'll get
called back with a result and the result
is either successful if we can update an
existing credential or we can
automatically save an on password
credential to for example Google account
for Google sign-in or if you need to
show a dialog to have the user interact
and opt in to save and on the web it's
very similar you construct the
credential object pass it in as a
federated or password credential and if
you'd like more information on this you
might have seen the talk from the chrome
team yesterday about how to save all
types of information how to handle the
responses that come back submit forms or
handle federated credentials to make
automatic sign-in on the web possible so
taking a look at some of the really
impressive performance numbers that
we've seen in the last year we have
Netflix one of our big launch partners
from last year whose growth has been
really impressive over the last year
expanding to new markets they have a lot
more people using their app but at the
same time by being able to automatically
sign people in they've in fact seen less
enquiries for support around account
recovery or forgotten passwords so it's
really impressive to see their growth
going in one direction but their support
cost going in the other as people opt in
to save this information and can be
signed in automatically this could be a
huge money savings if you have a sizable
support system right now and it's a
subscription or pay based service where
people will definitely contact you if
they can't get in so the last big piece
that I want to talk about here is how to
make signup
easier and this is a new API that we've
added in the last year the ability to
get as we call a hint to show a dialog
that looks like this with previously
used email addresses with accounts that
are on the device and by showing this
dialog first there's some really
interesting user interactions that are
possible I'm showing an example here
from the Zillow app and you can try this
out yourself they show this the email
picker dialog first which allows the app
to intelligently steer the user to sign
in to sign up or even remind you they
need to use Facebook or Google to log in
because they don't have a password
they've even gone as far as offering to
create an account without a password one
tap account creation which we'll look at
more closely and so for an example here
let's play the video and we'll see the
assisted signup experience so on the
Left we have alibaba's Express app user
registering with email now the dialog is
being shown but through the smart lock
API that allows the user to one tap fill
the name the email address and then just
have to create a password and that's
purely a client-side addition that
without having to do complex UI rework
or big back-end changes they were able
to assist the user to fill 3/4 of the
information and as you can imagine they
just have more people successfully
completing the signup flow with just
that little client-side change and so in
fact we can even move forward well the
other person hasn't even finished yet
and see how what the implementation work
that's involved here is and it's pretty
simple so I think this is perhaps one of
the highest ROI investments that you
could make in your app one of the best
learnings you could take out of i/o is
by adding a few lines of code
assisting sign up you can see much
better completion of the account
registration flows and so to make it
happen you construct a hint request as
we say you specify what type of
identifiers you'd like to see you pass
that into the API and you'll get an
intent back so that's the dialog that
you can show to the user so when the
user initiates that signup flow or
sign-in flow potentially if you've
merged the two together then you have
the opportunity to show them have them
pick an entry and you'll get called back
on on activity result with the
information they selected it's the name
it's the email address
it's even more importantly something
like an ID token a verified email
address that you can use to skip things
like email verification okay and looking
at some of the numbers here
LinkedIn ran this as an experiment on
the millions of users they have seeing
up to 15% more successful signups with
just the client-side work and we've even
had reports from other apps like kamut
who might be in the audience seeing an
a/b test as much as 20% higher
conversion on signup so to find out more
about all the partners we've mentioned
check out this link and the last
shout-out I want to give is to one of my
favorite apps we go which is a travel
app from Singapore who's taken a lot of
this advice to heart
they've taken account registration out
of a little menu in the corner and put
it into one of their primary flows with
one tap account creation seeing over
tenfold increase in user registrations
so we hope to see what you can do in
your apps too and maybe you'll be up
here next year and with that I'd like to
hand things off to Alfonzo who will tell
you about not just improving an existing
sign and system but building a brand new
one with firebase off Thank You Steven
my name is Alfonso and I'm the product
manager in firebase authentication not
long ago though there was an application
developer as I'm sure many of you are
today in the audience and I remember
spending sleepless nights fighting with
the authentication system of my
applications some of the problems that
Jon Stephen and Sebastian mentioned
today I kind of relate to but the
biggest struggles I had with
authentication were much more
fundamental I never really know knew if
I was properly securing my users
information I remember spending lots of
time integrating with third-party
signing as the case or all protocols and
all the stuff and I never got to manage
my user sessions in an effective way the
truth is that authentication is hard and
is something that at least I didn't care
that much but
when you're building your own
authentication system you'll be going
through some steps that look some more
or less like the ones that picture below
you will begin by setting up your
authentication back-end and you'll end
up authorizing your users into your own
back-end resources when setting up your
authentication back-end you want to
insure it first that it's secure because
if not your user's data may become may
get compromised and second it has to be
up all the time if not your application
will probably go down with it
handling users credentials is tricky as
mentioned before you have to integrate
with all flows or signing as the case if
you handle passwords there's a lot of
trickiness involved in that and finally
you also have to handle the cases where
your users forget their credentials then
managing users sessions if you want to
do this effectively you want to ensure
your sessions are long-lived so users
don't have to sign in every few days
they come back to your application but
at the same time if your users device is
stolen you want to ensure that their
session is revoked
and finally when you've implemented all
of that you have to implement all the
authorization logic to take
authentication information of the user
and do something useful with it in your
back-end in general all of these steps
are pretty involved and I pretty sure in
most of the cases this is not the core
business of your application you want to
focus on on other things such as making
your application awesome for your users
firebase authentication aims to make all
of these problems easy for you in the
next few minutes I'm going to show you
how you can get very easily your users
signed in into your application with
just a few lines of code and no deep
understanding of how authentication
works in this year's i/o as you may have
seen before we released a new version of
firebase authentication with a revamped
set of api's some exciting new
functionality and built on top of Google
infrastructure let's see what service
authentication offers some of you may
have seen this picture before this is
wonderful colorful data centers at
Google Farva services our cloud services
that run an infrastructure like the one
picture in the picture here
Google takes care of making sure that
these services are always reliable and
available for your application and the
you need to do is implement against the
client or server side is the case to
user services with firebase you can get
your user sign in using a wide range of
options from Google sign ID that we
mentioned before to facebook login or
your own email and password accounts I'm
doing so is very easy this is a snippet
of code over web using our web as the
que JavaScript where we either create or
assigning a user using email and
password credentials this first line of
code here does all of the following
let's see if I get it right
it gets the email and password of the
user and sends it to our secure Channel
up to our back-end there it performs
integrity checks on the email it ensures
that the password is strong enough then
it makes sure that there's no existing
pre-existing user it hashes and salts
the password it creates a new just a
record in our user database it meant a
pair of cryptographic a sign tokens its
sense of tokens through a secure channel
back to the device and finally
persistence tokens in the into the
interior client application and with
that you've got a user sign in but the
important thing here is that you can
forget of everything that is mentioned
because all of that is done by firebase
and the only thing you need to learn is
these two lines of code that's much more
simple and now let's say you want to
support third party identity providers
such as Facebook the first thing you
need to do you need to go to a virus
console which is very easy to use and
enable them and once you've got that you
ready to write some code in this snippet
we're using our iOS SDK with Swift and
we're taking a facebook access token and
signing a user interaction the second
line of code here in the bottom it's
like that something very similar is what
they mentioned for its second the
Facebook access token
sending it's through our secure channel
12 again it's making sure that the token
hasn't been tampered with it hasn't
expired and make sure that the audience
is correct if someone is not trying to
hack you it checks and prevents account
duplication it creates a user account in
your database it means and cryptographic
assigns a pair of tokens with your user
session information for sisters tokens
in your client device and finally your
user is signed in once again the only
thing you need to learn are these two
lines of code very simple okay
so let's say you've got some user sign
it the next thing you want to do is you
want to make sure that this is actually
working for that reason we especially
designed this console of users that you
can access the rest firebase console
which is especially designed for those
initial steps when you're starting to
build your authentication system I want
to see your accounts as they're being
created here you can also create and
delete test accounts and also perform
some other basic admin functionalities
let's pause a second and take a look at
some of the information that you can see
here if you look at the right you see
the user UID in firebase every time you
wonderful users sign in for the first
time to our application we create a
unique user ID that identifies them
across your whole application also take
a look at the second column which is
called providers in that column you will
see with which sign a mechanism the user
has sign it and neon this version this
year's version of firebase now your
users can have more than one sign-in
mechanism attached to the same account
this is very useful if for example you
want to support allowing your users to
sign in one day with Twitter and later
on add email and password credentials to
the same account so they can later
access their account with any of those
mechanisms okay so we've got our user
signed in now we have to do something
useful with them this snippet of code
here is from our Android SDK in Java
what we're detecting when the user signs
in and personalizing the experience for
them the way that you do this in
firebase is you set up a listener on
changes on the authentication state of
the application and once the event is
triggered you'd react to the signing to
the change in the sign-in state to
update your application in this case for
example we could personalize the user
interface of our application by using
the display name that comes from the
sign a user so this is useful with this
you can personalize the UI and make the
application feel better for your user
but the most compelling use case of
authentication is actually authorizing
into your own back-end resources or
services doing that is also very easy
with firebase this diagram more or less
explains the steps that you need to take
if you want to do this first give user
signs in into your application then you
extract the token with one line of code
in the client
which represents the user session and
it's signed so you can trust it then you
send that token up to your server and
you use one of her server is the case to
validate the integrity of the token and
to with this you can really tell that
the user that is calling your
application is who they claim to be and
once you've got that up in your server
then you have to apply your own
authorization logic to give access to
your own resources so this is very easy
and much simpler if you had to implement
it on your own but still it does require
a little bit of plumping and you have to
implement your own authorization while
you get your back in so we can actually
make this even simpler as you know five
is services work better together if you
use firebase authentication with farva's
storage or firebase database for storing
your users data all the plumbing sending
up the token to the backend and then
performing all the authorization logic
it's actually done automatically for you
the only thing you hate to do you need
to write declarative rules we specify
this user can access this resource and
no single no single line of code neither
in tech science nor in the back end to
make this happen again massively
simplify it compared to if you had to
implement this on your own so let's do a
quick recap privacy authentication is a
managed authentication back-end and
which we offer six different sign-in
methods we have client there's a case
for Android iOS and web and we also have
a C++ wrapper for a games developers out
there we also have servers the case that
aid with token verification and token
minting for nodejs and Java and many
more languages are coming soon and we
have a console for easy setup and user
management and there's many many more
functionalities that I couldn't cover
today but you can check out in our
website in our samples and YouTube
videos so we took virus authentication
and we actually went there and spoke
with different startups that they were
either building the authentication
system for the first time or they
weren't happy with theirs and they
wanted to replace it and here are some
of the things they built and some of the
things I told us Malik studio built
today almost in two days it took them
two weeks to build
beautiful application that you should
check out and the authentication for
authentication they use firebase
authentication with Facebook and Google
and it took them literally and afternoon
to build it and it was production-ready
after then quaver beautiful music
collaboration app also use firebase
authentication and they really liked the
fact that you can link multiple accounts
to the same sorry multiple credentials
to the same account check out their
application for the clear use case it's
really good
then also we mesh fabulous and reveal
all existing applications implemented
for the first time or modify the
existing authentication system and they
all called out how we say it was using
firebase general with firebase
authentication we've tried to make
signing experience as easy as possible
for you so you can forget of all the
details of how authentication works and
just focus the experience for your users
with that I'm gonna leave it to yan to
do a quick recap and maybe show us a
little bit in my life great so this is
fantastic firebase authentication
provides an end and hosted
authentication backend for you and we've
seen that it's very easy to build a full
out stack on top of that so we're pretty
much done right well unfortunately we
still need to actually do a bunch of
additional work in particular this is
this talk is called best practices for a
reason we've talked about a number of
different tools and techniques to help
users get signed in really efficiently
securely and quickly so let's I'll put
that together into an app which can't be
too difficult right all right so let's
start let's start out and for the
purposes of discussion let's say you
know people understand user name and
password flows so we create one of these
things in our actual app we wire it up
to firebase authentication no big deal
that's not quite complete because we of
course need to be able to create a sign
up flow so we pull out the username a
piece of that so that we can determine
the difference between the existing
account and a new and a new account from
that we either fork to the account
creation flow or to the sign-in flow and
now we're thinking to ourselves we're
getting closer to ship ability but not
really because we know from personal
experience and from anecdotes from our
users we're gonna forget a password
from time to time fortunately firebase
authentication implements a recovery
flow for metaphor passwords but we still
need to implement the UI that triggers
that and communicates expectations to
the user but as we talked at the
beginning of the discussion to uplevel
security in general and to increase
simplicity and usability for our users
we want to implement Google sign-in and
maybe because users are familiar with
Facebook sign-in or other identity
providers we toss that in there as well
now there's quite a bit of client logic
that's getting involved in the mix here
and we've just introduced yet another
problem which is that I might have
signed in to this particular application
using my Google account yet my Facebook
account has the same email address
associated with it and that's really
confusing we do not want to actually
create a duplicate account in this case
so we need to implement account linking
logic where we detect that we've got a
matching identifier and we want to
either direct the user toward the
mechanism that they use to sign in
before or - and possibly to actually
link a new provider to that same account
fortunately the backend provides us for
us but as we can see there's quite a bit
of client logic now we're done we're not
quite done Steven mentioned earlier
today there's a number of things that
smart lock for passwords can help do to
help get your users in the door
automatically signing them in easing the
signup process and so on so we add a
little bit of additional logic to that
and by the time we're done we've got
quite a lot of code but fortunately okay
this is a one-time cost it's out the
door we're completely finished right
well once again not quiet in the modern
age we need to do it two more times at
least web and iOS as well as Android are
all equally important so let's toss in a
web implementation and an iOS
implementation simple right no big deal
so we happen to know that it's quite
complex because we put all this together
ourselves and we had to keep it updated
in good working order over cut over time
as as well the lines of code we we found
that it took to implement these entire
flows for web iOS and Android number in
the thousands up to 16,000 lines of code
to manage and maintain all the logic
that we just mentioned so long as you
support all of them all the
functionality that we just support it or
that we just described which is not
always required but definitely something
that we recommend so what's the better
solution I'm happy to announce today
that we have firebase UI authentication
which is a full stack of UI
that implement the entire flows that we
just mentioned for you on web iOS and
Android in only a handful of lines of
code to implement the flows exactly as
described in in the chart so let's take
a look at what some of this actually
looks like on Android as well as all the
other environments the pattern is very
much the same create an auth UI object
configure it with the providers and
other configuration information that you
want and then display the UI wire up
your results such that when you get the
result you get a user object or an error
code here on Android you can see that
we're doing that for email Facebook and
Google and a non activity result we'll
get a success status indicating the user
is signed in from which we can obtain a
user object if we want to or just
transition to a sign in the state iOS is
very much the same create an auth UI
object set your providers maybe your
Terms of Service URL then from that
generate an auth view controller
you can use that as your root view
controller or you can show that on top
of your existing view controller you
wire up a delegate method such that you
get the results and web no surprise is
very much the same as well configure it
now the providers that you want and then
configure a call back your callbacks for
sign-in success as well as air show the
UI and you'll get called back upon
completion of the flow that's not quite
all because we know that even though
it's a couple of lines of code to
implement everything I just showed you
we want to make sure that the firebase
UI off is customizable as well now basic
theming is one of the things that we
support as you can see right here which
is great to just get you out of the door
in a line or two of code but on a
platform by platform basis we support a
number of different types of
customization as well in particular on
Android you can update you can override
it strings that XML files or layout XML
files to arbitrarily update all the
strings or layout details in your
application on iOS we offer a sub
classing model for the home screen such
that you can arbitrarily customize that
as well and on web all rendering occurs
within a container of your specification
such that the surrounding context can
show whatever branding colors and so on
that you like this is still early days
and we're working on additional
customization mechanisms as well but on
top of all this I'm happy to report
today as well that this entire
implementation on Iowa
Android is open sourced and we're going
to be open sourcing the web
implementation soon as well you can
inspect all the code that you like as
well as downloading it implement
integrating it into your application
customizing it all that you like and
please do submit bug reports feature
requests and so on we also have a web
repository at the same URLs suffix to a
stash web for reports and bug bug fixes
and we do plan on open source in the
implementation there too
so to recap firebase UI off provides all
the UI flows for all the conditions that
I just mentioned straight out of the box
in just a few lines of code implementing
a number of the best practices that
we've learned over the course of years
at Google and we continue to sort of
plan to support is in a further fashion
as well as more identity technologies
come come out the door and more
innovations keep getting added we offer
simple customization as well as
arbitrary customization by open source
and you can inspect the code all that
you like so let's recap all of what we
just talked about today if you're an
existing developer Google sign-in is a
great way to succeed it's a securely
uplevel your users security by allowing
them to use their Google account to get
into your app or a website smart lock
for passwords helps them remember how
they got in the door to begin with
whether it's their existing password or
using a federated identity provider
it also helps grease the wheels on your
signup flow and really potent ways and
helps reduce your support costs and
finally firebase authentication is a
full hosted authentication solution
paired with UI that helps get your app
and get you from zero to app in record
time in just a few lines of code here's
a couple of lengths to get you started
you can learn about everything that we
just mentioned and more in this talk by
