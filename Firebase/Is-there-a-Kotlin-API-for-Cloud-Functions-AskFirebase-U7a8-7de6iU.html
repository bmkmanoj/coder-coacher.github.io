name is Doug Stephenson coding Doug on
Twitter and fun fact about me I'm not
wearing any pants under here so lil
breezy for those of you who haven't seen
the show before you ask the questions
and I give the answers and hopefully one
of them will be right so without further
ado let's get to the first question this
question comes from Doc wheeler on
YouTube hey there hey there back at you
doc can Google Analytics for fire days
be used during development I'd like to
show stakeholders what the analytics for
the mobile apps would look like doc I
have two things to say about that first
tell them to put down the stakes it's
not very sanitary
second thing is you've probably noticed
that Google Analytics for firebase in
the console doesn't look very exciting
if you only have a couple of users you
can use it during development but it's
just not going to give you a very
accurate view of how your development
users are actually using your app
instead why don't you send them to the
firebase console there's a demo app
there that has very rich analytics it
comes from a game called flooded you can
download that from the market you can
also watch a brief presentation I gave
about that at the firebase summit in
Berlin the link to that is in the
description below but when you go to the
console there's a box there with a plus
sign on it that you use to create a
project just below that there's a box
that says explore a demo app click that
that will take you to the firebase
console where you can see all the rich
analytics from flooded just thousands of
users who are using it it's really cool
to look at send your stakeholders there
but only after they wash their hands
thanks for the question doc next
question this next question comes from
Mike on the firebase slack how do I
write code that deserves security roles
when using the admin SDK I'll tell you
why he's asking this normally when you
initialize the admin SDK you do so with
admin privileges which means you get
full read and write access throughout
the database regardless of any security
rules or validation rules that might be
in place what Mike wants to do is he
wants to use the admin SDK to do writes
that observe those rules so if write
would trigger a violation of a security
rule that should fail it turns out you
can do this if you initialize the admin
SDK with the database auth variable
override property and the initialization
object that's a lot of words but the
result of that is if you give it a user
ID to simulate that you
your ID will then essentially be
simulated for all the read and write so
at that point if you trigger a security
rule that would cause the right to fail
it will fail and you'll know and so
that's what you can do to make sure the
admin SDK observes security rules
great question oh if you haven't seen
the firebase slack sign up for that
today if you go to firebase community
that's a weird URL you can type it in
your browser
do that you can sign it for the firebase
slack and you can chat with lots of
people who are using firebase and even
some of the staffers it's a lot of fun
check it out I'll see you there
a next question so addictive the next
question comes from Martin on Stack
Overflow is there a way to perform a
transaction than writing data to
real-time database with the REST API now
this is a great question because up
until recently there was no way to do
that so let's unpack this a little bit
more in real time database a transaction
is necessary to prevent two clients from
clobbering each other's data if they
both want to write it at the same time
we obviously need a way to prevent that
with the way real-time database handles
it gives you a transaction mechanism to
allow the clients to go back and forth
with the server to negotiate what the
value should be at the end of the
transaction you might use this if you
were say incrementing a counter you have
two clients that want to increment but
they need to do it in a certain order so
the transaction will help prevent both
clients from incrementing incorrectly so
that's a transaction but you couldn't do
that with the REST API in the past but
as of today now you can do transactions
with the REST API as you know REST API
goes over HTTP and this new feature
allows you to use the e tag header of
the HTTP request to go back and forth to
the server to manage let the correct
value should be go read the blog post on
that the link is in the description
below it should come pretty handy if
your user of the REST API great question
thanks Martin next question this next
question comes from Alexandre on YouTube
and Alexander asks is there a Kotlin API
for cloud functions the answer is kind
of as you know
kotl is a language that you use to build
Android apps and maybe server apps as
well it compiles down to byte code
normally but it turns out Kotlin also
compiles down to JavaScript as you know
javascript is a language that you can
use to build cloud functions and if you
can use cutland to build JavaScript and
JavaScript can be used to be able to
cloud functions it stands to reason you
could use Kotlin to build functions you
can totally do this
played with it earlier it works but it's
not exactly the most pleasing experience
it turns out you need this extra tooling
in place to do this transpiling of
Kotlin javascript which is you know
extra work extra maintenance also you
end up writing what amounts to code that
looks exactly like JavaScript just in a
cutland file which it's not a whole lot
of advantage to doing that so what I
recommend instead is using an editor
like vs code which is JavaScript where
many of us here on the firebase channel
on YouTube use vs code for our
JavaScript presentations you'll notice
it has fun things like auto completion
and code help so the very JavaScript
aware very smart it's a blast that's
what I recommend you use instead of
Kotlin for now great question thanks for
the question this next question comes
from de measure on youtube where can I
get a firebase Tripp and a lot of people
ask this question especially when I post
pictures of the shirts that we're giving
away at various events so we have a blue
shirt like this one or a black shirt
both very fun very comfortable to get a
shirt you will have to go to one of the
events that firebase sponsors or that we
speak at if you want to know what events
are coming up follow us on Twitter we'll
let you know what's coming up thanks for
the question to measure time next
question this next question comes from
agus on YouTube hi firebase smiley hi I
guess I'm building an Android app with
firebase and I want to send a
notification to the app when something
changes in the database how can I build
that it turns out you can do this with
cloud functions for firebase what you do
is you write a database trigger and you
specify in that database trigger the
location of the database that when it
changes should trigger your function and
then after that you can use the admin
SDK to send the notification it's
actually pretty easy and it's very
commonly requested in fact it's so
common that we've actually written some
sample code for you to get started
there's a link to github in the
description below that will take you
right to a sample project so get started
with that
great question agus thank you this is so
much fun I can't put it down it's so
hard to sit down I'm going to put it
down right I need it I need to get that
out of my hands I need to put it down
all right this next question comes from
Armour also on YouTube on our ask could
you please explain the phone number of
indication in a video I'd be happy to do
that armor except it's already been done
by my pal Laurence Moroney Lawrence or
my pal right you're my buddy awesome
I'll high-five you later Lawrence has
done a number of videos right here on
the firebase channel on YouTube that
described how to get phone the birth
indication up and running in your app
web Android iOS it's all there watch
those videos let me know how it goes for
you thanks for the question armor take
it easy
well that's all the time we have for
this episode be sure to keep sending in
your questions with hashtag ask firebase
you might also be interested in my other
show called neat firebase you get to
meet the Googlers that make firebase
have phoned all right here on the
firebase channel on YouTube and I'll see
you next time now I'm going to keep
playing with this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
