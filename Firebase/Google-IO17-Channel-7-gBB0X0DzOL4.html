 At this time, take your seat.
Our session
 will begin soon. 
 And we're ready to &amp;gt; Okay, 
everybody we're going to&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Go 
ahead and
 so much
 Welcome.  Thank you.  I think 
the weather has been okay, 
right?  like it's been a good 
day to be outside.  Anyway, 
thank you for joining us at io. 
 for joining at one of our 
session.  I'm Ben Galbraith. 
Francis Ma. product Firebase 
along with a big team and we're 
really happy to be here to talk 
about what's new in Firebase.  
This is our agenda -- what we 
thought we would do is give a 
bit of an overview of the 
Firebase for those of you who 
are new in the platform and 
we'll spend a few more minutes 
on fabric what you can expect 
from fabric and Firebase working
 together and then we'll spend 
our time on a whirlwind tour on 
what's new across the wide swath
 of Firebase.  We have a lot of 
material to cover so we're going
 to keep it high level but we're
 going to point you to more 
detailed sessions happening 
after this talk that will go 
into various more levels of  So 
since day 1, our mission has 
been to help you build better 
app and grow your business by 
providing many of the tools you 
need and solving some of the 
common problems throughout an 
app development lifecycle.  For 
example, if you're just starting
 out looking to build a new app 
or build new feature you'll need
 some back-end infrastructure 
like having your own log-in 
system or a database to store 
and sync data.  Or let's say 
you're looking to build an app 
and you're looking to fine-tune 
the stability of it and you need
 a tool and a way to monitor 
whether errors are happening out
 in users' hands and if you're a
 service developer looking to 
run a business, it's important 
that you have insights how users
 are using your app and perhaps 
to rerefine and tune your app 
experience in able to engage.  
to solve these tools so that you
 can channel more of your more 
precious time and energy into 
building a differentiated 
business and app and focus on 
running your app to be  So the 
vision that Francis talked about
 comes together in two basic 
categories in Firebase.  Tools 
that help you develop your app 
and tools that help you grow 
your business or grow your user 
base.  And, um, all of these are
 designed to help with common 
problems that we found in our 
own careers as software 
developers and that we've 
learned from you as we 
participated closely with the 
development commuting to look at
 what problems you're facing and
 what you would like to see us 
address.  We also find 
opportunities to base off 
Google's internal tools to help 
us develop its scale and release
 some of the billion user 
applications that we talked 
about earlier today.   to have 
all these tools integrate really
 well together and with Google. 
 Some of the integration is the 
Google Cloud platform, many of 
our development tools are built 
right on top of Google Cloud 
which gives you that scalable 
foundation that the you get to 
planet scale as you made it.  is
 Google analytics inside of 
Firebase which is built by the 
Google analytics team and 
AdWords and so all of these 
integrations give you these 
on-ramps into these sort of 
scalable growth paths as your 
app gets better but Firebase 
gives you this great way to get 
started in a really easy way. 
 general they are available on 
I/E S and destroyed and test lab
 which is Android-only and we 
introduced other STKs for adword
 and unity we had claim members 
in mind in C plus, plus when we 
talked about  Let's hear from 
one of our partners. 
 Right now we're working on a 
brand-new storytelling program 
which is called tap which is all
 stories told through text 
messages and through chats.  The
 tap team started out really 
small.  We didn't have a lot of 
resources to test our libraries 
to help us grow really quickly. 
 allowed us to take what we done
 in many other places and 
integrate from many different 
services all in one place in one
 convenient package.  And it 
allowed us to integrate that 
package and just get going with 
our development almost  The real
 time database allows us to have
 storage which means the team 
and ask himma whatever we want. 
 We want to have the tap 
counters on the stories as the 
users are browsing through them 
so you could get a sense in real
 time what people were doing and
 what they were reading and with
 Firebase this is a trivial t
hing to implement.  You 
basically just add a watcher 
onto the count nodes and it 
comes back to you
 Since our app is with a lot of 
firms Cloud functions come in 
really hand when user makes and 
publishes a story.  The Cloud 
function gets triggered and we 
send notification to all the 
friends of the user so that they
 know they made a story and 
published  There are times we 
don't know whether or not to 
build a feature or roll out a 
feature and so we would use 
remote config and test it out 
with a smaller group of users 
first and then we would look at 
the analytics dashboard and when
 we see the feature is actually 
performing really well we would 
deploy it at a really large 
scale.  Remote config made it 
really fast to make these 
important decisions. cut it in 
half and that allowed it to go 
from effectively zero to a 
working product in production 
and that time span was -- was 
just phenomenally fast for us.  
The app has been really, really 
well received in both Google 
Play and the I/E S app store.  
We had 1 million taps storiess. 
 We had in the first weekend 
that we launched our story 
writer 25,000 people wrote 
stories.  Firebase gives us the 
ability to focus on what we know
 best, that's storytelling and 
that's giving users the ability 
to immerses and to react and 
participate with stories in ways
 that were
 So congratulations to the watt 
pad team on the success of tap 
and thank you for building and 
growing with Firebase. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So we just highlighted 
one-story and we feel really 
privileged to have as many 
partners from around the world
 taken our journey through  In 
fact, 1 million developers have 
build apps with Firebase.  It's 
in himible momentum in expanding
 Firebase and we just want to 
say thank you for all the 
developers who have partnered 
Thank you for starting the And 
it's through these inspirational
 stories as well as the feedback
 from developers like you that 
help our teams continue to work 
hard and expand the platform.  
Over the last year, we've made 
40 major releases and over 100 
updates to continue to refine 
and expand the platform, some of
 which you have heard today and 
also we're going to go into some
 of these in more detail.  Now, 
as we walk through each one of 
these sections we're also going 
to be mentioning additional 
sessions that you'll find
 at I/E with some of the topics 
over the next coming  All right.
  many of you know in January we
 joined forces with fabric they 
previously had been with 
Twitter.  Fabric is a mobile 
platform that provides great 
tools for app teams to build and
 understand and grow apps.  
We're both really similar and in
 the beginning it has been a 
really, really great arrangement
 coming together we long admired
 the team and the impact that 
they've had over 5,080 partners.
  And they have been with crash 
analytics and we're working hard
 to bring the best of the 
platforms together we'll talk 
about progress we've made in two
 The first is to bring 
crashletics into our flagship 
crash littics solution.  It's a 
tool that provides real time 
insights into the stability of 
your app with solutions like 
crash littics and errors in the 
field and provides info like 
stock traces and device notices.
 to showing these errors, it 
also shows you how these errors 
impact business metrics like 
user retention so that you can 
prioritize and fix these errors 
accordingly.  If you're an 
existing user of crash littics 
or Firebase crash reporting 
we're going to be bringing these
 products together and paving a 
smooth transition path forward 
over the next coming months.  
And if you're eager to get 
started right now with the 
industry-leading crash reporting
 solution, we recommend crash 
littics. 
 All right.   to talk about 
digits.  Fabric pioneered this 
crash solution the digits team 
and the Firebase teamed up to 
create Firebase authentication 
-- phone number authentication 
features.  So you start out with
 a screen like this with 
Firebase authentication you 
could use third-party 
authentication providers as well
 as your own email 
authentication and it manages it
 for you and you have sign-in 
with the phone number.  sign in 
with the phone number and then 
we verify this is a new user or 
an existing user and then we 
generate a one time code and the
 user sent the code with the SMS
 and entered the code in the 
phone and once we've done that 
we verify the code is right.  We
 handle all the logic for 
possible resending and we meant 
to send user token and process 
the authentication on the device
 and you got a new  This is some
 of the best learnings from 
digits and also add some 
additional benefits for
 auth is based on the same 
information that is used by 
Google's own log-in system and 
in many of its own products.  
Second, we are providing a 
headless API for you to fully 
customize the UI of that log-in 
experience, so this isn't just a
 template where you can 
configure a couple of 
parameters.  You can implement 
the entire UI layer on your own 
using this headless API and to 
make it easy for you to get 
started, we have an open sourced
 UI library that implements some
 of the best practices of the 
sign-in experience that we've 
learned over the years so that 
you can use that as a quick way 
to get started and since it's 
open source, you can go in and 
tailor specifically that to the 
look and feel of your app.  The 
third update that we've made -- 
third upgrade to this is 
improvement on the Android 
experience.  We deeply 
integrated with Android so it's 
a seamless log-in.  It's shown 
through the log-in experience 
we're able to automatically read
 the device's phone number and 
the verification code so the 
users don't have to manually 
enter those.  And also if the 
device has been verified 
recently, we wouldn't even send 
a verification code and what 
that means for your users is 
just a one-tap experience 
forward. 
 To get started on phone number 
auth we're making this free for 
up to 10,000 VAEFRGSZ per month 
-- verifications per month from 
our learning in digits, we 
expect that over 90% of apps 
will be able to use this for 
free.  Now, if you're wildly 
successful and you want to 
continue to scale, it's 1 cent 
per verification for users in 
U.S., Canada and India and 6 
 To help us focus and continue 
to innovate faster we'll be 
sunsetting the digits brand and 
the SDK.  For existing digits 
integrated apps we'll be 
creating a migration guide in an
 autoimport tool so that you can
 import your existing user base 
and auth tokens over.  What this
 means for your users they will 
not have to reauthenticate when 
you migrate systems so we're 
working hard to ensure there's a
 smooth path forward for you.  
Firebase auth is
 available today iOS and web and
 Android coming out within 
weeks.  And there will be 
migration tools in the coming 
weeks as well.  So you've just 
heard some updates on this front
 we're super excited to have the
 fabric team join can us.  It's 
only been 4 months but we're 
working really hard to bring the
 best of our platforms together.
  Now, we're also moving 
deliberately to ensure there's a
 smooth transition for our 
developers going forward.  If 
you have more questions and if 
you're interested to hear more 
about our vision, we'll be 
hosting a fireside chat right 
here at Stage 7 tomorrow morning
 with Rich the general manager 
of fabric and Julie one of the 
original cofounders of Firebase 
as well as Jason Titus, the VP 
and head of our developer 
product group.  PF      &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BEN 
GALBRAITH:  Okay.  get into our 
next category of dates to build 
around faster and easier 
statement.  This incorporates 
the real time database 
authentication which we just 
talked about Cloud storage and 
Cloud functions products and 
actually's dive in -- and let's 
dive in.  This gives you an easy
 way to take a directory of job 
descript functions or many 
directories and deploy them into
 the tool Firebase deploy each 
of these functions that you 
create is automatically mapped 
to a URL so you can directly 
invoke them but you can also map
 them to Firebase events such as
 analytics conversion events 
which your users have done 
something that is particularly 
important to your business or 
certain types of real time 
database updates or anytime a 
user signs in all of these can 
trigger one or more functions 
that you've deployed.  You can 
use these integrations to do 
things like send out user 
authentications when a user 
signed up or thank them for an 
in-app purchase or transcoding 
or photos that have been 
uploaded.  You can train tracks 
form data before you send it to 
your database and integrate with
 internal service providers 
using web words.  One of our 
startich partners, um, Woo 
integrated with Cloud functions 
and had this
 about this.  50% of the cost of
 their normal processes using 
functions.  And we think that 
this is really a power line 
model for your development 
moving  Relating to functions 
one of the announcements we have
 today is the integration with 
hosting.  is an easy way to sort
 of static content like HTML, 
CSS and images.  You can 
configure your own custom domain
 and automatically provision an 
SSL certificate for you and also
 serve it behind a global CDN so
 you're users get a secure and 
fast download.  Now, with the 
functions integration, what we 
do is we can now take requests 
coming in to hosting and proxy 
it over to functions to -- for 
additional service side 
proxying.  So what that means in
 addition to serving static 
content you can now use hosting 
with functions to build a fully 
dynamic web app.  And so the 
other cool thing -- really cool 
thing about it because functions
 is integrated with other parts 
of Firebase and also with the 
Google Cloud platform, you can 
continue to integrate your web 
app with things like Firebase 
auth we talked about earlier or 
really any other back-end 
components.  Put more simply you
 can create a power line 
progressive web app completely 
serverless right
 an additional functions in 
hosting integrations tomorrow 
afternoon at 5:30 with David 
East on our 
 All right.  is how you can 
store static files that you need
 during your app's run time.  
And we have another product 
called Firebase storage which is
 which is about storing estates 
that are diunanimous click 
generated at run time.  This is 
backed by the Google Cloud 
platform storage product.  
What's new for us are two 
things:first we unlocked the 
ability to map existing Google 
Cloud storage buckets that you 
signed up already into your 
Firebase project where 
previously you couldn't do that 
before.  The other piece is you 
can now choose the region in 
which you want to two reasons 
why this is important.  One for 
regulatory reasons you often 
want to control the country in 
which your data resides.  And 
secondly, it can often lead to 
performance improvements if 
you're able to specify where in 
the world you want your data 
located.  So these are the 
improvements we made to Cloud 
storage.then, of course, there's
 real time database.  Firebase's
 original product.  The real 
time database is the Cloud host 
at JSON database that will allow
 you store and sync database to 
kinetic clients in real time.  
any apps like a chat app or a 
shared whiteboard or any kind of
 real time collaboration apps, 
database makes it really easy 
because whenever you write data,
 it will automatically push the 
updates to keep all your 
connected clients synced in real
 time.  we've -- we have 
concurrent limits up to 10,000 
users today and now we're 
expanding up to 100,000 
simultaneous connections with 
this update.  So think about 
this.  100,000 simultaneous 
users can plug in and connect to
 database and we would 
automatically keep them in sync 
in
 Additionally, we're also -- 
we've recently introduced a 
profile or two to allow you to 
introspeck the bandwidth and 
latency to help you understand 
the data.  So we just talked 
about several of the back-end 
services of Firebase.  dedicated
 session right after this here 
on the same page with one of the
 cofounder and Michael Bly to 
talk about how we can use 
Firebase along with Google Cloud
 platform to build modern apps. 
 All right.  section we want to 
run you through is app quality. 
 critical.  No one wants their 
user sessions interrupted with a
 crash or poor performance.  In 
fact, over 50% of the poor 
operatings we see in the play 
store come from quality-related 
issues.  So we have 3 products 
focused in this area crash 
reporting, test lab and 
performance.  We talked about 
crash earlier.  We're going to 
start with performance 
monitoring.  So performance 
monitoring -- when you declare 
dependency on performance 
monitoring in your Firebase 
project, you automatically get 
monitoring of your app startup 
time and also of network 
requests.  We show you 4 aspects
 of your network request, we 
show you the response time, the 
payload size, your success rate 
and time spent waiting versus 
downloading for network traffic,
 um, so this is a powerful, um, 
intospeculation with what's 
hatching with your app and you 
could add your own time-based 
measurements we call them 
traces.  With these you invoke a
 function at the beginning of 
your code and at the end what 
you want to measure and then you
 can also supplement them with 
something with what we call 
counters.  The scenario you can 
think of here you can measure 
how long a certain requests 
takes and you can track how 
often you can successfully catch
 or miss on that request.  The 
good thing about performance 
monitoring we collect all these 
metrics for you and then you can
 -- through the console drill in
 through a variety of different 
filters to see exactly what's 
happening across the world.   
really --  One of our partners 
WWPS authors implemented and 
they found they were able to 
increase performance by 
significant amount as measured 
by click-through rates.  They 
said they got 3 to 5X 
improvements on their 
click-throughs after they used 
Firebase performance to see how 
long their prior application was
 loading.  This is something 
they had nothing to know about. 
 don't do a good job in general 
instrumenting all of this data 
and we think all of this will be
 pretty surprised once you see 
this data so easily with what's 
happening all over the world 
with our  Now, we're so excited 
about the new release of 
performance reporting tool so be
 sure to check that out.   we 
mentioned crash littics earlier 
and we talked about performance 
reporting these are tools to 
help you monitor errors after 
you shipped your app out in 
users hands.  Andrea developers 
we also have Firebase test lab. 
 With the diversity of the 
Android ecosystem you may not 
always have access to the most 
power line testers.  Test lab 
gives you access to physical and
 virtual devices hosted in 
Google data centers.  It's super
 easy to use.  All you have to 
do is upload your app APK and we
 have a robocaller that would 
automatically traverse through 
your app to find errors and 
crashes.  And when it does find 
it, it will send you the error 
logs as well as a video catcher 
to help you diagnosis and fix 
the issue.  Now, what's cool 
about a test lab is that you can
 also run many tests in parallel
 as though you have a full team 
of queue
 engineers so you can configure 
this in a matrix of different 
tests, for example, testing 
different devices, device 
models, different device 
orientation and portrait or 
landscape mode in different OS 
versions as well as different 
locales.  Now, one of the new 
things that we're adding is 
first class support for games.  
if you're a game developer you 
can now use test lab as well to 
automatically run through the 
test loop.  Adding to that we're
 also reporting performance 
metrics so that you can see your
 CPU memory and network 
utilization.  So I just talked 
about being able to test in 
different configurations.  We're
 also expanding test lab for you
 to simulate different network 
connections -- or network 
conditions, whether it's 4G, 3G 
or slower to see how your app 
behaves in the real world when 
the network connection varies.  
Also, we have expanded our 
device selection.  You can now 
test on Samsung S7s as well as 
the Google pixel.  And, of 
course, with test lab you get 
access to the latest version of 
Android 0 so it's a great way 
for you to get started to make 
sure your app runs well with 
Android 0.  Now, I talked about 
the simple path of using the 
robocaller where you just -- you
 just upload your app and we'll 
test it automatically.  For the 
most sophisticated developers 
you can also upload your own 
custom test scripts using 
frameworks like espresso and 
test lab will run those manual 
test labs as well.  Test lab can
 also be integrated with popular
 continuous integration systems 
like Jenkins so you can 
integrate it right into your 
development flow.  For example, 
every time you have a bill, it 
can automatically kick out, um, 
a test through test lab.  So we 
just talked about some of the 
tools on how you can use 
Firebase to improve your app 
quality.  We have a dedicated 
session later on today here as 
well at 4:00 PM with Nolan and 
Justin, the product and eng lead
 on how you can use Firebase to 
improve your app quality.  Okay.
  That brings us to the next 
section, what's new in our 
grow-related tools?  So this is 
a broad category that includes a
 lot of stuff.  We only have 
time to cover analytics Cloud 
messaging and remote 
configuration.  We'll dive in 
now.   starting with analytics. 
 Analytics is this free and 
unlimited tool that lets you 
instrument your lab and the 
reason why we made it free and 
unlimited is open up the 
opportunity to instrument your 
app.  Add events everywhere you 
can so that you can have a he 
will are a, really, really and 
granular view of what's 
happening in your application.  
 was built by the same Google 
analytics team that has been 
doing this for over a decade ebb
 and so we've been able to take 
all the learnings of running the
 largest web analytics platform 
into this product we integrated 
with the rest of Firebase which 
practically means that you can 
target audiences of your users. 
 of groups of your users with 
all of our products that are 
identified by analytics so you 
can use this to, for example, 
send messaging to just certain 
types of users, to use remote 
configuration to test your 
application on just the right 
set of users, um, and it works 
really well.  It's also 
integrated with big query this 
is important because big query 
gives you this, um, ability to 
dive in and explore your data in
 a variety of different ways 
using a sequel-like dialect 
that's power line so you can 
explore your data in-depth and 
find out So what's new in 
analytics?  Well, recently we 
had announced a feature called 
stream view.  Stream view 
provides a real time streaming 
view of events that are coming 
into your app rendered in this 
new Uing I.  As you can see on 
your screen you can drill in by 
location user properties and 
events to see how users are 
using your app right now.  For 
example, how many users are at 
Level 5 of my game right now in 
Brazil.  So it's a great way to 
see what's happening.  Now, 
relating to stream view you can 
also drill in deeper specific 
down to the individual user 
level in a view called user 
snapshot.  So you can zoom into 
the specific user and see the 
events that are coming in.  So 
this is a great way for you to 
-- it's like doing a user study 
and watching how users are 
inter-I got a with your app to 
see if they're using it in the 
way that you're expecting.  It's
 kind of like doing log head 
remotely on the device and see 
how users are using it.   to 
stream view is another feature 
called debug view, that is near 
and dear to my heart as a 
developer.  Now, instrumenting 
your app and getting in all the 
details right before you ship it
 is oftentimes pretty hard.  
It's kind of like writing a 
thousand lines of code and 
expecting it to him come pile 
syntax free and bug shot now, 
some of you can do it all the 
time but certainly I'm not that 
good.  This is where debug view.
  It provides this dynamic 
timeline view of events that are
 coming in with -- from your 
connected development device.  
you can again zoom in to see the
 events that are coming in, 
examine the values and user 
properties to ensure that you 
have instrumented your app 
correctly.  And if you do have a
 syntax error or say you have an
 invalid character, the string 
is too long, it would also 
automatically flag that for you 
so it gives you a quick way to 
iterate and make sure that you 
have instrumented correctly 
before you package up your app 
and ship it out to your users.  
Another enhancements that we've 
made to analytics is the 
integration with Google big 
query.  As Brian mentioned big 
query is a Cloud database work 
house and you can use database 
analysis on the queries with the
 analytics integration what we 
enable is raw data export from 
analytics into big query.  And 
what's cool about that it means 
you can also join additional 
data that you might have.  For 
example, one of our partners 
NPR1 had created a universal 
user ID across their mobile app 
clients.  So taking that data to
 analytics are coming in from 
their mobile clients they're 
also able to map that ID from 
their service I logs and see 
end-to-end how users are inter-I
 got a with their app and it's a
 great way to join all the data 
to all view.  One of the 
platforms enabled in this we've 
been enabled real time streaming
 from conversion from analytics 
to big query.   aspect is, um, 
we have enabled the connection 
of a tool called data studio 
which is part of the Google 
analytics suites that allows you
 to build custom data 
advisezations and reports on to 
here big query.  think about 
this.  You have analytics that 
connects raw events into big 
query and now you can use data 
studio to build your own custom 
report right on on top of that. 
 So what that means is 
essentially you can create your 
own analytics UI suiting to your
 needs.  And as I mentioned 
earlier because the conversion 
of events can be streamed in 
real time these reports can be 
fresh to show you the most 
important And another thing that
 we're providing relating to the
 data studio are premade 
templates so that you have 
examples to work off from to get
 started quickly and building 
your own custom reports.   talk 
be about Cloud Messaging.  
Firebase Cloud Messaging gives 
you an easy way to send 
notifications to your users 
either programmatically in 
response to events, for example,
 or manually with the console 
you can use in the Firebase 
website, the Firebase console to
 go in and send a message to a 
particular set of users.  FCM 
works across I/E S -- iOS 
Android and the web in our 
recently SDK makes it even 
easier to set up your website to
 register to receive 
notifications.  We've also made 
a series of other enhancement to
 FCM.  First we expanded its 
ability to target users with 
notifications by letting it send
 notifications based on user 
properties.  So user properties 
are really granular attributes 
of users that include things 
like the version of the OS that 
they happen to be using and the 
version of the app they're using
 and it could be properties that
 you come up with that you zoin 
to users and so now you can send
 notifications just to the set 
of users that map particular 
custom attributes that you're 
interested in.  For I/E S 
developers we've also made a 
series of enhancements.  First, 
we've added support for token 
based authenned cased for APNS 
which is really important for 
the iOS community and we added 
support for at them HTTP version
 2OI which you can use larger 
payload in your notifications 
and a feature for APS Tokens so 
it's easier for you to migrate 
from APNS tokens to OS tokens as
 you interact with FCM and we 
simplified the logic involved 
with edge aring with FCM on iOS 
and we made FCM easier to use 
and expanded its capabilities 
overall. tool to help you with 
user engagement and tuning 
retention is remote config as 
the name suggest remote config 
allows you to configure your app
 remotely and on the apply to.  
Very similar to FCM you can also
 do this targeted based on 
different user segments by 
different user properties, 
device type, OS versions and 
also custom audiences that you 
create through analytics.  The 
config itself is just a simple 
key value map so it's simple and
 yet flexible to do many things,
 for example, you can change the
 value to control a feature 
rollout or say you can change 
the value of -- to manage 
different price for something 
that you're selling in your app 
or maybe even changing the value
 to modify a button label two 
different audiences to see which
 one performance better -- 
performs better       As an 
example we have one of our 
partners cookbook recipes to 
customize their own user 
onboarding flow based on the 
users' location so users who are
 from India would get one 
personalized experience and 
users from Italy would get 
something else.  By using remote
 config, um, not only were they 
able to get this started quickly
 because they don't to have 
worry about creating their own 
infrastructure or manage the 
scaling, um, it'll allow them to
 modify and fine-tune the user 
experience in onboarding flow 
and what they saw through the 
tweaking of these onboarding 
flows is the increase of over 
200% of new user sigh-ups.  So 
we've just touched on some of 
the tools that help you use 
Firebase to grow and engage more
 users.  We have another session
 here tomorrow at 9:30 AM with 
two of our product managers in 
this area to talk more about how
 you can
 Okay.  Now, we're going to talk
 about the last section which 
are the new developer resources 
that we've created to help you 
make the most out of Firebase.  
To start out with we want to 
talk about fast lane.  So fast 
lane came into Firebase through 
the fabric team.  And it 
simplifies releasing your iOS 
and Android apps by automating 
many of the tedious tasks 
associated with that process so 
just about building your app and
 generalizing and localizing the
 apps you need and deploying to 
the app store all of these 
things can be AT&amp;amp;T mated it's 
open source and customizable 
it's got 180 built-in actions 
and 160 actions created by the 
open source community and it's 
passionately loved by its 
community of users so we 
encourage you to check it  We've
 also created resources to help 
developers learn more about 
Firebase.  For those of you who 
are interactive learning, we 
have an online video course 
through youth Dasity to teach 
you more about it over a 
weekend.  To date we have 15,000
 developers that have completed 
this 3-day courses so if you're 
into interactive learning as 
opposed to reading documentation
 alone for Firebase whether 
you're looking to get started, 
check it out at
 youth Dasity.com/Google.  
Hearing from our customers and 
data is on key part of our 
development process.  And we 
would not be here today without 
the developer community and 
feedback from developers like 
you.  So thank you for that.   
to expand our ability to collect
 feedback with the launch of a 
new Firebase alpha program.  The
 Firebase alpha program provides
 early access to some of our 
in-development features so that 
you can have the opportunity to 
provide early feedback and also 
help us shape Firebase.  So 
we're really looking forward to 
hearing from you.  Please sign 
up at Firebase.Google.com/alpha.
 Finally, we also shared we're 
open sourcing many of our SDKs. 
 This is a really big effort for
 us and it's
 a long-running effort.  And 
we've made enormous progress at 
getting to this point.  We've 
opened sourced these SDKs at our
 GitHub.com/Firebase and you can
 see the source for many of our 
iOS, Javascript and admin SDKs 
right now with more to come in 
the coming months.  This is a 
really important initiative to 
us and we love your feedback on 
these projects we'd love for you
 to get involved and we'd love 
for you to tell us what you want
 in our open source efforts.  
Finally we have a bunch of 
additional sessions today, 
tomorrow and Friday on Firebase.
 have a short URL that ics at 
that you to the Google iOS site.
  You can filter it yourself, 
um, you mean we'd love for you 
to come to the sessions to learn
 more.  We have also dedicated 
office hours times when you can 
come and talk to the Firebase 
team.  Generally, the Firebase 
team are all the folks in the 
yellow shirts.  a few sneaking 
around in the blue shirts too 
but they're all back there, um, 
and we'd love for you to stop us
 anytime. us questions.  This is
 really your opportunity to 
engage with us.  Let us know 
what you think and how we can 
better serve you.  And then 
after the talk we also have a 
sand box area where we'll be 
where you can also ask us 
follow-up  So you've just heard 
us talk about some of the 
updates we've made to Firebase. 
 might be wondering so what's  
We thought we'd share a couple 
of thoughts where we're headed. 
 Overall, we're on a mission to 
simplify development in app 
success and we're interested in 
making the biggest impact in our
 area and you'll see us to 
update Firebase throughout the 
year to do more things.  More, 
specifically, serverless is a 
big theme for us we're more 
focused to empower to focus on 
the client which is where your 
users are inter-I got a with you
 and let us do the heavy lifting
 on behind the scenes.  I think 
it's -- the idea of a full stack
 development and taking that 
stack of things you need to know
 and reducing it down so you can
 be really productive knowing 
less and worrying about less. 
big theme for us in the year 
ahead is to continue to deepen 
the integrations within Firebase
 products so that you can 
continue to gain more value out 
of Firebase as you continue to 
use more and have these 
components working better 
together.  Speaking of working 
better together we had mentioned
 about having the fabric team 
join us at Google.  And we're 
going to be continuing than to 
work hard to bring these 
platforms together to ensure 
they all
 another key key theme is also 
with analytics being the core of
 Firebase.  We want to continue 
to provide more insights to you 
so that you can better 
understand how users are using 
your app and also provide 
insights to help you use 
Firebase more effectively.  What
 we want to do not only provide 
the tools but to make it also 
easier and empower you to 
continue to build a more  So 
we're going to continue to help 
you develop and continue to help
 you grow your app success.  
Thank you very much for spending
 this time with us.  We just 
barely got through the overview,
 um.   to engage with us here 
also through our Google group.  
And everywhere else that we are 
also on Twitter and help us 
understand what we can do to 
better serve you.  Thank you 
 Thank you for joining this 
session.  Brand ambassadors will
 assist with directing you 
through the designated exits.   
making room for those who've 
registered for the next session.
  If you've registered for the 
next session in this room, we 
ask that you please clear the 
room and return via the 
registration line 
 Please fill in the seats in the
 front of the room. 
 Welcome.  Thank you for 
joining.  Our session will begin
 soon. 
 Good afternoon.  building apps 
with Firebase and GLOUDZ.  I 
hope you enjoyed the last 
Firebase where they talked about
 new things and I'll be speaking
 of how
 Firebase and Google Cloud 
platform can be build great 
apps.  I'm Andrew Lee.  I'm one 
of the cofounders of Firebase.  
I want to say how very excited 
I'm excited to be here.  
Firebase has come a long way in 
the last 6 years.  And this year
 has really been our best yet if
 you saw I/E last year we really
 expanded the platform and since
 that time, over a
 million developers have used 
Firebase to build an app.   
you're one of other developers, 
thank you.  I really appreciate 
the trust you've placed in us to
 help us build your app and to
 But first let's take a minute 
to try to travel back to 2011, 
our team started working out of 
a coworking space in San 
Francisco.  And one of the first
 things that we did when we 
began working on Firebase is 
write down the vision of what 
we're trying to build and the 
first sentence read, buildest 
simplest use and easiest to 
understand platform that we 
could in the world.  We felt 
Cloud computing was breaking its
 promise to developers.  Well, 
it had reduced the capital 
required to build and scale 
software.  It had done very 
little to make the writing of 
that software easier. computing 
was supposed to save developers 
time it was supposed to reduce 
the cognitive load and have them
 provide value to their 
customers and it really hadn't 
done that yet and we wanted to 
fix that.  The amazing part 
about this statement is that 
this is still our mission today.
  This is still what we're 
working on.  gotten a whole lot 
easier since we joined Google 
because we get to work directly 
with Google Cloud platform. 
 Well, Firebase is a full suite 
of products for building and 
growing mobile apps and web 
apps.  We think some apps need 
more than what we can offer out 
of the box.  They might need 
specialized analytics or 
specialized type of stories and 
they might need to do extensive 
computations or machine learning
 and in many of these cases, the
 Firebase core offerings can't 
help you. 
 But Google Cloud platform can. 
 If you don't know much about 
Cloud platform, it gives 
developers the ability to use 
Google's computing 
infrastructure to build deploy 
and run software at massive 
scale.  And this is a huge 
investment area for Google.   
more than $30 billion in the 
last 3 years on this 
infrastructure. 
 And Cloud platform offers a 
full range of products of 
storage, compute, networking, 
big
 Okay, so what does this have to
 do with Firebase?  Well, 
Firebase and Cloud platform are 
really a complimentary pair and 
combined they provide a fuel 
sweet of products for use in the
 most demand use cases and we 
designed this platform to make 
them easier to use together.  If
 you're a mobile developer you 
can start using Firebase for its
 high level mobile features and 
its rapid time to market and 
then when your needs get more 
complex, you can move over and 
start using products from Cloud 
platform so augment your app.  
On the flip side if you're a 
back-end developer and you want 
to start with Cloud platform, 
later, you can start using 
Firebase when you build out your
 apps. 
 This is all made possible 
because under the hood, Firebase
 and Cloud share a number of 
common components.  First they 
have a common foundation.  They 
share the same project and 
billing and accounts systems.  
when you create a Firebase 
project, it is literally a Cloud
 project. 
 Second, we're actually 
beginning to share our products 
as well. 
 We recently announced that 
Cloud storage would be available
 through  storage is Google's 
petabite storage offering and we
 also announced that Cloud 
functions would be available 
through Firebase.  And you can 
expect to see more of these 
integrations going forward with 
Cloud products being available 
directly through Firebase. 
 As we continue to integrate 
Firebase and Cloud platform, 
we're seeing more and more 
customers doing great things 
together with these 
technologies.  For example, 
national public radio is using 
Firebase analytics in its mobile
 app but NPR wants to do some 
more advanced analysis than they
 can do out of the box with 
Firebase analytics and so 
they're using big query from 
Google Cloud platform so that 
they can marp their front end 
behavioral data with their 
back-end usage data and improve 
their overall understanding of 
their users,
 engagement and retention.  We 
will be that this combination of
 Firebase's mobile feature set 
and the full power of Google 
Cloud is really powerful and can
 support the needs of even the
 So I'd like to show you in 
practical terms what that 
actually means for you.  What 
can you do together with 
Firebase and Google Cloud?  And 
to do that I'll be building an 
app right here called favorite 
places that's going to let you 
post pictures of
 places that you love.   today's
 demo, I'll be building a web 
application but everything that 
we do is fully cross-platform so
 you can do this on iOS, Android
 and using our unity or C++ if 
that's the came I say.  So here 
are the requirements from our 
application.  First, I want to 
actually users -- let users to 
actually log into the app and 
upload photos of their favorite 
places.  I want users to be able
 to view a feed of the photos 
that they've uploaded in the 
past.  And I want those images 
optimized for mobile so I'm not 
wasting bandwidth or battery and
 so they fit nicely on the 
screen.  PF      To help me 
build this I'm going to use 
several products from Firebase. 
 We'll be using Firebase hosting
 to actually host the static web
 assets, Firebase authentication
 with the new phone number 
authentication you heard about 
earlier today for log-in.  Cloud
 storage for Firebase for 
storing the photos and the 
Firebase real time database to 
store my feed metadata.  This is
 going to get us most of the way
 there but we're still missing 
the last requirement which was 
the ability for you to scale 
images to fit on your phone.  
Now, this is actually a 
relatively easy problem to solve
 Firebase if we want to but that
 doesn't really help us because 
mobile networks are slow, 
bandwidth is expensive, 
batteries expensive and so we 
really want to do that 
resignings on the server size so
 we can optimized the delivery 
of those images. Ordinarily, 
this would be a huge hassle.  
We'd have to stand up a whole 
new service.  to set up a 24/7 
oncall rotation and provision a 
bunch of servers and we'd have 
to deal with all the normal 
maintenance and scaling 
operations of running that 
back-end service and I don't 
want to do that but fortunately,
 we have much easier solution 
which is Cloud functions for 
Firebase is a product that we 
launched in March, and it gives 
you the ability to run small 
pieces of code in response to 
events in your app.  Without 
needing you to manage your 
servers or scale them out.  This
 makes it really easy for 
developers to do things like 
send a push notification when a 
user signs up, or thank a user 
for an in-app purchase, or 
transform data before inserting 
into their database, or in the 
case of this app, do some image 
processing when a new image is 
uploaded. 
  launched Cloud functions for 
Firebase in March, and the 
tremendous response we've seen 
has been really exciting.  There
 are thousands of apps today 
built using Cloud functions and 
we've seen over a billion events
 running functions since then. 
 Today we support a number of 
event providers.  You can see 
some of the products on the 
screen that admit events into 
Cloud functions and you should 
be able to integrate more in the
 future.   our requirements 
list.  Let's actually dive in 
and let's build this app.  Can I
 get us to switch over to the 
laptop screen? 
 Okay.  So to save time on the 
demo, I've actually kind of 
fleshed out the early stages of 
the app so you can see what it 
looks like here.  I've already 
populated a title bar and we 
have a box for entering your 
phone number and a confirmation 
code because we're going to be 
using phone number 
authentication. 
 So let's add our first feature 
which is Firebase log-in.  And 
log-in is really critical to 
this application because we want
 to segment the data by user.  
You wouldn't want another user 
to be able to modify your photos
 or vice versa.  And fortunately
 with Firebase Auth this is 
really easy for set up we have 
an out of the box experience to 
actually you log in -- let you 
log in with social auth and 
integrate with your own 
provides.  Today as you heard we
 announced phone number 
authentication which lets your 
users log into their app with 
aphone number and SMS passcode 
there's no passes words or 
emails for integration and it 
lets you control access to 
different resources.  So this is
 what's actually enabling to us 
segment the photos by user and 
the database data by user.  So 
the first thing we'll need to do
 is jump over to the Firebase 
console, and we'll jump into our
 authentication tab and we'll 
configure phone number 
authentication.  If you click in
 authentication sign-in mention 
you'll see a new option in the 
console today.  And it turns out
 the configuration for phone 
number is really easy.  You just
 have to enable
 All right.  So for today's app 
I'm going to be writing all my 
code in type script, um, if you 
like type script, great, if you 
don't worry you can do this all 
in Javascript and remember this 
is all fully cross-platform of 
Android or C++ apps so you 
canning do all the same things. 
 So the first piece of code that
 I need to add is a recapture
 on my page.  And this is 
because Firebase phone number 
authentication uses recapture to
 prevent spam and abuse.  The 
next thing we want to do is hook
 up that GUI that you just saw 
so when I click on the buttons 
for log-in or for code it runs 
the appropriate handlers to do 
the log-in so I'll insert some 
code here.  And this is doing a 
couple of things.   when I run 
-- click the log-in button, it's
 running sign-in be with phone 
number, which is actually 
kicking off the SMS 
verification.   To my phone.  
And then later after I've 
entered that code and clicked 
confirm, it's going to call 
confirm on the verification that
 has been sent to my -- to my 
phone.  
 And then the next thing I need 
to do is handle that log-in 
event.  So we want to make sure 
after the logger has logged in 
and we hide the screen and show 
them log-in content instead so 
we have a single event here 
that's fired every time our 
authentication state changes and
 I've hidden a little bit of GUI
 code here but there's a helper 
here that's actually holding the
 old UI and displaying a new UI 
and I've set up a helper 
function here that we'll use for
 the rest of our example called 
onlog-in so I'll insert that 
here. 
 And this is going to get called
 out after the user has logged 
in.  All right, that's.  We've 
added authentication to our app.
   Let's add our next feature.  
So the next thing I want to add 
is the ability to upload photos 
to my app.  And just like phone 
number authentication the first 
place we'll start is on the 
console I'll jump over to the 
Firebase console El.  This time 
I'll head over to the storage 
tab. 
 And storage in Firebase is 
Cloud storage so you actually 
get access to the full range of 
Google Cloud storage of products
 including buckets of regions 
all over the world and in 
storage classes.  When I click 
on the right I choose to add a 
bucket and I can select regions 
in the U.S. or all over the 
world. 
 As well as different storage 
classes but it Your Honor it out
 for this example the default 
bucket is a U.S.-central 
multiregion bucket which is 
actually perfect for what we're 
trying to do so I'm going to 
stick with the adult for this 
example.  -- stick with the 
default for this example.  Let's
 actually upload the code to 
upload my images into the map.  
onlog-in handler here I'm going 
to add a little snippet and then
 we have a UI helper function 
that is setting up the actual --
 the actual input form for me to
 input my photo.  And then it's 
calling into this function when 
the user adds their photo and we
 just have a couple of lines of 
code here to this has that.  The
 first is creating a reference 
to the file
 to upload.  And the second is 
actually writing that photo into
 Cloud storage.  This two lines 
of code here is actually all you
 need to upload a file directly 
from your app to Cloud storage. 
 All right.  We're all done with
 that.  So now if I deployed the
 app you can see you been that I
 clicked the button and it would
 upload the photo but the next 
step we actually want to resize 
that photo.  We want to go over 
to functions as I mentioned 
earlier, and we'll jump over to 
that code and we'll set up a 
Cloud function that takes that 
new object, resizes it and puts 
it back into
 So the first thing I'm going to
 do here is create my Cloud 
function.  We have an STK for 
Cloud United States ifs that 
makes it really easy.  All you 
need to do is add something to 
your exports like we did here 
and we now have a resize image 
Cloud function.  And we bind 
that to the events coming from 
Cloud storage with this line 
right here so this means that 
this function is going to run 
anytime a new object is up on 
the Cloud storage.   next thing 
we need to do is do a little bit
 of parsing so I add some code 
here to actually look at the 
request and pull out some
 variables that we need.  And we
 want to make sure that we're 
only doing image residing for 
newly uploaded images.  We don't
 want to have this event run 
when we resize the images 
because that would put us in an 
infifacility loop so we're going
 to jump out of this function if
 this is not a new upload.   
let's do the actual imagery and 
signings so I have a bit of code
 here that is first downloading 
the image from Cloud storage to 
my local Cloud functions and 
putting it in a local temp 
directory and then I'm spawning 
a new process with image magic 
to do the resignings and finally
 I'm uploading that file back 
into Cloud storage.  should do 
it.  That adds our imagery 
resize so let's move on to our 
next feature.  So we want to 
have a feat of images so you can
 see what was in our app, what 
we've uploaded previously to the
 app and so we're going to store
 that in the Firebase real time 
database and we want to add to 
that feed after the image resize
 occurred before if we did that 
we want to do the resize image 
so we'll actually do that in our
 Cloud function as well.   add a
 little snippet here which after
 we've resize the code is going 
to push a new item into our real
 time database with some 
metadata about the new object
 to display.  And Evan finally 
we want to jump back over to our
 client side code and we 
actually want to display the 
feed in the app and so to do 
that, we're going to listen on 
the real time database to all 
new children of our feed and for
 each of those items I have some
 code here to actually add the 
UI and I have a helper function 
to make
 Cool!  So that should do it so 
I'll just save this file and I'm
 going to jump over to the 
command line and I'm going to 
deploy this to Firebase.  And 
we're going to let that run.  
while all this is running I want
 to show you a couple of 
features that I maybe didn't 
mention earlier that I think are
 really exciting that you might 
want to know about.  So let's 
jump back over to our simulator 
-- our iOS simulator here and 
let's look at the top of this 
screen this is favorite 
places.pictures this is a domain
 that I bought last year.  This 
is a custom domain not that 
Firebase owns but I own.  a 
little lock icon here and that's
 because we're serving this icon
 over HTTPS.  One of the cool 
features of the Firebase we 
provision an SSL domain and we 
do it for me if you want your 
assets online on your domain 
with SSL use Firebase hosting.  
The other cool feature I want to
 point out is that if you look 
in our code, at the to here our 
client side code, you'll notice 
that there's no API keys up 
here.  There's no default 
settings or configuration.  It 
just declares this Firebase 
variable and that's because 
Firebase hosting is wigging the 
Firebase SDK automatically. 
 I don't have to put any 
configuration and it's 
especially useful if I'm 
managing multiple environments 
in a staging environment or 
production environment without 
managing those keys.  Okay.  
Let's jump over to deploy.  
Looks like I finished fantastic.
  Okay, let's give it a shot so 
I'm going to go back to my 
mobile app and -- I mean, I got 
to refresh, right?  And I'm 
going to type in my phone number
 here. 
 And I'm going to send an SMS 
confirmation, ah, but Google 
doesn't know if I'm a human or 
not so the recap is actually 
checking to make sure that I'm a
 person and not a bot to prevent
 abuse and it wants me to select
 pictures of store fronts.  I 
hope I don't fail this in front 
of all of you. 
 I think -- how does that look? 
 Is that right?  Okay.  Whoops, 
that wasn't it.  All right.  I'm
 a human. 
 Yes.  Great.  And then I'm 
going to wait for my SMS. 
go.  And I have it so I'll
 type that in. 
 All right.  logged in.  It 
worked.  
  I'm going to upload the info 
into my app and I'll click my 
app and let's upload a picture 
of the Golden Gate bridge and 
I'll click that button and right
 now what's going on behind the 
scenes is I'm uploading that 
picture directly from my mobile 
phone into Cloud storage that is
 triggering an event in Cloud 
functions which is then 
downloading that image into 
Cloud functions resignings it, 
putting it back into Cloud 
functions and then adding some 
feed data into the real time 
database which is pushing that 
data out to the -- to my mobile 
app and it is responding to an 
event on the device to update my
 feed and all that happens with 
the code that I just showed you.
 Now I want to show you 
something that's easy to 
understand if you see it that is
 when you're using Firebase 
you're using Cloud platform.  
remember, we updated -- we 
uploaded that image using the 
Firebase SDK for Cloud storage 
and we configured this using the
 Firebase console for Cloud 
storage so, of course, if I go 
over and I look in the console 
for Firebase and I reload this 
page, you would expect to see 
some images in here -- I can 
look in here and see
 there's actually content in 
here but what you might expect 
if I go over to the Cloud 
storage console tab in Google 
Cloud platform and I look in my 
bucket there, I see the exact 
same contents.  It's the same 
platform and same product and 
the same data. 
 Okay, I think we're done.  
about you guys but I think it 
was great.  I really want to 
share this with my friends and I
 think my mom would be super 
excited about this so I'm a
ctually going to pull up my 
phone here and I'm just going to
 take a picture of this app here
 -- hang on, I have to turn my 
flash on and -- what are you 
doing?  Oh, hey, this is sort of
 awkward, Michael.  I'm actually
 doing an I/E talk right now -- 
that but now you seem to be 
taking a picture with your 
laptop with your phone.  What's 
that all about.  I'm really good
 with Twitter and I have a lot 
of followers so I just thought 
it would be cool if I took a 
picture with the app that I just
 built and I Tweeted that and 
why don't you hold it and I'll 
pose in front of the laptop 
Wait, wait wouldn't your 
followers would rather have a 
link on the content that you 
have on your screen there than 
just a blurry photo from your 
phone.  That might be cool 
because that's not going to work
 -- there's no way for me to 
share a URL in that content.   
single page app. there's no way 
to share your URL yet.  Tell you
 what, let me jump in here for 
just a second I think I can whip
 something together in just a 
few minutes and I think you'll 
like it.  Can I take over here? 
 Sure, that sounds awesome.  
Yeah, give it a
 try.  
 Hey, everybody, I'm Michael Bly
 I'm the engineer lead on the 
Firebase hosting and the 
Firebase fly.  Can we go back 
over to the host please, great. 
 it's great is that we have this
 ZBAUP where we can upload 
photos and then take a look at a
 feed of our photos but if this 
is supposed to be a sharing app 
I think we're falling short it's
 a little lonely.  There's 
nobody else to share this with 
anybody else so let's add one 
more feature to our app which is
 a great social sharing 
experience and for this feature,
 we're going to need four new 
requirements.  First, we're 
going to need a share of URLs so
 that I can send to en a of my 
friends and they can instantly 
get to the piece of content that
 I want to send.  Second, we'll 
need that content for high 
performance and scalable.  What 
happens if my Tweet goes viral 
and I need to be able to handle 
that load.  Third, we'll want 
the image thumbnail of the image
 I'm showing to show up embedded
 in the Tweet so that people are
 drawn in and they have a bigger
 target to click.  And finally, 
we're going to want to 
automatically recommend some 
Tweet text so that people have a
 frictionless sharing 
experience. click a couple of 
buttons and bam, Now, how many 
am I going to tackle all of 
these new requirements?  You 
might have heard today that we 
launched a brand-new integration
 between Firebase hosting and 
Cloud functions and that's 
really going to help us out 
here.  Now you can create 
rewrite rules for Firebase 
hosting that will send matching 
requests to a Cloud function 
that you specify.  This gives 
you the ability to mix and match
 Firebase hosting's production 
grade static production with the
 dynamic production power with 
Cloud functions.  This is a 
great new tool to help you build
 capable performance mobile 
apps.  So Cloud functions and 
Firebase hosting can get us most
 of the way there.  That checks 
off 3 of the boxes.  I can 
dynamically generate HTML for a 
share U are, L Firebase hosting 
gives me the performance and 
stability characteristics that I
 need and because I'm rendering 
the content server side 
Twitter's crawls can pick up the
 metadata and embed it in the 
Tweet but what I don't have is 
to automatically recommend Tweet
 text.  You'll notice there was 
no title added to the photo when
 Andrew uploaded it.  Engine 
sent the image so how are we 
going to tackle of well, 
luckily, as Andrew told you a 
Firebase project is a Google 
Cloud project and one of the 
Google Cloud platforms strongest
 characteristics are its machine
 learning APIs one of those is 
the Cloud vision API that can 
analyze images and actually tell
 you about the content.  One of 
the features of the Cloud vision
 API is landmark detection and 
when we're uploading our 
favorite places that's a natural
 fit for this feature.  So we're
 going to use that to help us 
out and build this feature. 
 So let's jump over
 and start coding.  I'm in the 
browser code and the first thing
 I need -- oh, sorry, could we 
jump over the laptop?  There we 
go.  So we're in the browser 
code and the first thing that 
I'm going to do is I'm just 
going to add a share button to 
every item in my feed.  So add a
 little piece of code here so 
I'm just defining a share 
URL/places and slash ID for my 
image and I'm going to add to 
this helper that I've already 
set up.  So there we are.  So 
with that change now every image
 on my feed is going to have a 
share button that links 
to/places/ID but, of course, 
there's nothing there yet so we 
need to build that 
functionality.  So now I'm going
 to jump over to the Cloud 
functions scope.  Now, one of 
the things that I like most 
about Cloud function is that
 works great with the node 
exposystem and networks out of 
the box with Cloud functions so 
here I'm defining a simple 
express app so I just define -- 
I define my express app and I'm 
defining a single route kind of 
recognize from the last screen 
and then I'm just parsing a few 
things out of the URL and I'm 
setting up some content so I 
don't know what I'm going to use
 for the landmark name yet but I
 have a URL and a description 
and a Tweet and now I need to 
send some data back.  Now, I 
could use any server side 
rendering framework, any 
template engine that I want but 
for our case in a simple demo 
I'm just going to inline some 
HTML so we are we go -- whoops! 
 Okay.  So there's my HTML it's 
a really simple page but the one
 thing that I want to call out 
are these Twitter metatags that 
I have in the header.  That's 
the metadata that allows Twitter
 to parse the URL and then 
display information embedded in 
the Tweet and Twitter doesn't 
execute Javascript on your site 
so this isn't something that I 
could have done just by loading 
the Firebase web STG and use it 
with STWRAVa script after the 
fact it has to be Other than 
that this is just a really 
simple page that will render my 
page and have a Tweet button 
when I click it will have some 
prepopulated text now I built my
 express app but I need to 
export that as a Cloud function.
  Luckily, as Andrew showed you 
that's incredibly easy.  And now
 I've created an HTPS Cloyd 
function and you'll notice I 
just passed my express app 
directly into that Cloud 
function handler.  I didn't have
 to do any special rapping there
 was no special handling 
required because Cloud function 
works really well with no JS 
ecosystem so now I built my 
Cloud function but I want to 
serve this on my own domain 
using Firebase hosting so how do
 I go about that?  Well, I'm 
going to jump over to the 
Firebase JSON and here you can 
see that we already have 1 host
ing rewrite set up that 
redirects any URL to in 
connection.HTML and this is a 
great solution that's all 
browser side because you have 
Javascript that runs in the 
client and I guess if out all 
the logic for your page.  But 
now I'm adding some server side 
logic.  Luckily, again, this is 
really simple.  I just had one 
line of configuration that's 
going to rewrite my share URL to
 the function called serve share
 page that I just defined.  So 
now I've not only built my Cloud
 function I've connected it to 
Firebase hosting so it's going 
to serve on my domain name.  
that's most of our requirements 
but again the last one was that 
we would autopopulate the Tweet 
text with something relevant to 
the actual content.  And another
 one of my favorite features of 
Cloud functions is that when 
you're executing in the Cloud 
functions environment, you are 
automatically authorized to use 
all of the Google Cloud APIs for
 that project so if I want to 
use the Google Cloud vision STD 
for no JS, there's no config 
strings or config I have to pass
 in it I have to initialize it 
with a single line and an empty 
call.  below I'm going to 
replace this to do with an 
actual code.  a single line of 
code that passes my Google Cloud
 storage file over to the -- 
over to the Cloud vision API and
 that's going to detect the 
landmarks and return that as a 
response which I'm then saving 
as a variable and using in my 
HTML so I think that's 
everything that I need to do in 
a couple of minutes I built a 
social sharing experience with 
server side rendered content 
that uses the Cloud vision API 
to populate a description.  So 
let's go ahead and deploy that. 
 Now, what type's deploying I 
want to call out one other thing
 that I did here.  You'll see on
 this line that I set a cash 
control header in my response.  
Now, one of the best features of
 Firebase hosting is that we put
 everything behind a global CDM 
that catches things at the edge 
so people who are in the same 
area get a lightning fast 
response to images -- to think 
that have already been cached 
now, by default we're not 
caching Cloud functions 
responses because we don't know 
how frequently they change, what
 kind of characteristics they 
have so this is something that 
you opt into but that's really 
easy.  All you have to do is set
 a cache control header on your 
response.  In this case I'm 
saying public which means this 
is okay to be cached by a CDM.  
 a max age of 5 minutes or 500 
seconds which is how long the 
browser will cache it and it 
will tell the CDM how long it 
will cache it which in this case
 is 2 hours I'm now telling 
Firebase hosting that you be 
cache any response from this end
 point for 2 hours when you 
receive it and that's really 
going to help me with those 
performance and scaling 
requirements that I talked 
about.   I got to go over to the
 deploy and that looks like it's
 going to be finishing up but I 
think that I've built everything
 that I wanted to build here.  
So let's see if my quick coding 
was enough to impress my boss.  
Hey, Andrew, can you take a look
 at this. 
 Did you get it all  I think so.
  I just deployed it.  I'm going
 to refresh the page to get the 
latest code and as you can see 
there's a new button and let's 
take a look how about -- that 
was a great picture.  So you can
 see you can see it's processing
 the image just like before.  
And that is just running the 
same resize code that Andrea 
already showed you but now I'm 
going to tap on the share 
button.  And that is going to 
call out to my Cloud function 
running on Firebase hosting.  
And you can see that I have the 
image and the Cloud vision API 
has recognized this as a palace 
of fine arts.  I also have this 
Tweet button that makes it real 
easy to share so I'm going to do
 that and you can see it's 
prepopulated the Tweet text with
 check out my awesome picture of
 the palace of fine arts and a 
link to that content so I'm 
going to go ahead
 and Tweet that.  Great!  And 
I'm going to pull up my Twitter 
feed just to see how that looks.
 Try that one more And there you
 go.  The photo is embedded in 
my Tweet.  What do you think?  
Very cool.  And that was super 
fast, Michael.  since this is at
 favorite places.pictures you 
can all pull it up on your own 
phones and give it a call if 
you'd like that.  While you do 
that I'm going to play with it. 
 That was super cool, Michael.  
So I'll jump right here over to 
my app and I'll choose
 one more picture.  This time 
I'll do the arch.  I'll let that
 upload. 
go.  And I'll
 Tweet one more time. 
 There we go. 
 Has anyone managed to log into 
their phone. I got some thumb's 
up, awesome.  Cool!  As we jump 
back to the slides? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; All right. Ed to quickly 
recap we just built that app 
using 6 different products from 
Google, Firebase hosting, 
Firebase authentication, the 
Firebase real time database, 
Cloud storage for Firebase, 
Cloud functions for Firebase and
 the Cloud vision API. 
 And all that together make that
 app work.   more I would like 
to show you that's scratching 
the surface that we have and I 
only have 40 minutes to talk but
 instead I'd really encourage 
you to try on your own and get 
started in a few minutes at 
Firebase.Google.com.  Our goal 
is really to handle the common 
infrastructure for you so you 
can can focus on the things that
 actually derive value for you 
users rather than making the 
basics work.  I think you'll 
find between the two platforms, 
we really have a pretty 
comprehensive offering and we 
reach across the entire spectrum
 of mobile app development so, 
hopefully, we can fulfill the 
requirements that even your most
 demanding applications.  Before
 I go, I want to touch briefly 
on another topic I'm really 
excited about and that is open 
source.  Google has a long 
history of prolific open source 
contributions.  Last year alone 
we had hundreds of thousands of 
commits to open source on GitHub
 on over 15,000 projects and 
we've heard a lot of feedback 
from the Firebase community that
 you'd love to see Firebase do 
more of this as well and I'm 
excited to say today we're doing
 that and today is the first 
wave of those releases and it's 
going to include the SDKs for 
the back-end service products on
 iOS, the web and our service 
side admin SDKs and we'll have 
more coming soon.   making our 
SDKs open we're really trying to
 show a commitment to our 
community of transparency, and 
we're trying to build a stronger
 relationship with you.  We 
haven't -- we haven't just 
thrown the code over the wall 
either.  This is going to become
 a core part of our tool chain 
so if you want to report a bug 
or you want to send a poll 
question on GitHub send us a 
poll request, we can't wait to 
see what you do.  You can check 
out on these repos on GitHub.  
The links are right  If you want
 to learn more about Firebase or
 Cloud platform, we have more 
than two dozen sessions I 
believe at iOS.
 highlighted some of the most 
rev length ones but I encourage 
to click on the link that has 
all the Firebase sessions.   
there's a Sandbox right out the 
door right here that has a

present if you have a number of 
questions and I'll be waiting 
outside right here in the 
parking lot too if you would 
like to speak with me after the 
talk.

 parts of your applications.  
Sco       So natural intalked 
         in            Nalin 
talked about the new Firebase 
Test Lab test products which 
gives you insights about how 
your application behaves in the 
wild.  We on the test lab team 
believe it's equal important to 
understand how yoor application 
performs before it even gets 
into your users' hands, so with 
every test that you run in Test 
Lab that runs on a physical 
device, we measure various 
performance metrics, such as CPU
 and memory and network, and we 
provide you those as part of 
your regular tool test results 
synched with the video.  You'll 
see this in a demo later on.  
All right.  Who wants more 
devices?  Come on, I'll ask 
again, who wanted more devices?
   (applause).
   Yes, that's better, all 
right.  Yes.  Well, we now have 
more devices.  We've added more 
of the newer devices, as you 
heard Francis talk, yes, we have
 pixels, we have S7 Edges, also 
have some of the older devices, 
more of the older devices.  We 
also have a preview version of 
Android O running on the pixels,
 so now you can test out and 
integrate with some of those new
 features talked about at the 
keynote this morning.
  So we've known for a while 
that the quality of the network 
connection can really affect the
 usability and the reliability 
of your applications.  So with G
 Cloud and the release that 
follows IO, one week after I  
IO, G Cloud, you can now test 
your applications under a 
variety of different network 
conditions, everything from LTE 
to Edge to G  GPRS and so on.  
You can even test it under 
degraded versions of those same 
network profiles.  But what I am
 most excited to talk about 
today is our new support for 
testing games.  So we've talked 
with many developers who are 
creating games for Android, and 
from those discussions, the key 
take-away for me was that 
testing games on Android is 
incredibly painful, and because 
I had gum surgery a few weeks 
ago and that was incredibly 
painful, I immediately thought 
of this.  And if there are any 
dental folks      folks -- if 
there are any dentophobes in the
 audience, you can look away now
.  This unfortunately, this is 
the pain of testing games on 
Android, it's not quite the same
 pain as we see here, but given 
your feedback, given the 
discussions we had, it is almost
 as intense.  So this person 
recognizes that there are 
thousands of different device 
types out there, and it's 
impossible to test on all those 
different devices.  This person 
had to build five different 
versions of their game for 
Android and then test each one 
of those separately.  This 
person had a game which bricked 
a device that they did not even 
have in-house, a very important 
device that the only thing they 
could do with was black list, 
and lastly, the thing that we 
heard most often was that it is 
hard just treading water, 
keeping up with all the 
different operating systems, 
versions and releases
.  So what are we doing about 
this and the dentophobes can now
 look back on the screen again. 
 So we're going to do a number 
of things, but I'm here really 
today to talk about just one of 
those things.  Today, we are 
introducing a new framework for 
testing games on Android.  So 
with this new framework, we 
allow developers to create game 
loops and trigger those game 
loops.  So what is a game loop? 
 Well, I'm sure most of you have
 been to an arcade, and while 
the games are not being played, 
they are running through a loop 
demonstrate ing their behavior. 
 And that is essentially a game 
loop.  So a gym loop is a way  
                 -- so a game 
loop is a way of simulate ing a 
user interacting with your game.
  It can also be used as a way 
of stress test a gym, such
 as in a multiplayer situation 
or focusing on a specific game 
component.  Now, you can trigger
 game loops with this framework 
locally using an application 
that runs on the device that 
we've written that application 
is freely available to you, 
you'll find it by going to our 
website, documentation code for 
test lab and you search for game
 loop and you'll find a 
reference to it, that is freely 
available to you, you can 
download that, run it on a local
 device and trigger the game 
loop     loop.  But what is more
 important is that we've added 
support for game loops in test 
lab, so now you can, with test 
labs, simultaneously test your 
games, triggering game loops, 
across any of the devices that 
we have in our device fleet and 
expose problems, problems such 
as crashes or memory leaks, or 
probably more importantly, 
graphics performance issues
.  So to help us understand how 
this works, I am extremely -- 
mean this -- extremely excited 
to welcome one of our partners 
up on stage with us, they'll be 
up in a second, Deep Silver 
FISHLABS.  Deep Silver FISHLABS,
 who, as you probably know, is a
 world-leading developer of high
 fidelity 3D games for 
Smartphones and tablets.  Their 
latest game Galaxy on 53 Manzago
r released this morning but it 
is   is, frankly, a benchmark of
 sci fi shooting games.  They 
have been testing a prerelease 
version of their game on test 
lab for some time now, and as I 
say it released this morning, 
but I've been testing this game 
for a while.  And I can honestly
 say that the last game that I 
was this addicted to was about 
25 years ago.  And I can see 
some raised eyebrows in the 
audience, yeah, they did have 
computer games 25 years ago.  So
 let me welcome up Andreas and J
ohannes on stage.  Andreas is 
the director of business 
development and sales.
   (applause).
     For FISHLABS.  Welcome.  
And Johannes is the head of 
technologies, lead developer at 
Deep Silver FISHLABS.  Welcome, 
guys.  All right.  So we're 
going to start with you, Andreas
, I think.  What do you see as 
the main advantage of the new 
support for testing games in 
test lab?
   Â» ANDREAS STECHER:  Thanks, 
Justin.  As you mentioned before
, the challenge that we 
basically face is that we want 
to have our game running on as 
many devices as possible, so 
what we face, you're very, very 
successful with Android, so you 
have multiple O  OEMs deploying 
it on the devices, those 
multiple OEMs have multiple 
devices, so I think today if you
 look into Google Play, you have
 like over 13,000 different 
devices with OS, so it's a big 
challenge.  We look into that 
and say, well, what's the market
 share and so on, so today or up
 until the last few months 
basically before using Firebase 
test labs, we went out and tried
 to purchase as many devices out
 there as possible, and if you 
buy one of the latest phones out
 there, it probably costs you 
like $800, so imagine if we want
 to cover like 100 devices how 
pricey that basically is.  So 
that's one thing where the 
Firebase Test Lab helps us 
because as you just mentioned, 
you provide us with test devices
 that we can run our game on.  
That's one thing.  And by the 
way, we have this very, very 
little Vault in our office where
 we stack 100 devices, but 100 
devices are basically not enough
.  The goal that we have for our
 game is that we want to cover 
like about 500 different 
devices.  Well, why?  To have a 
meaningful user base.  So that's
 one challenge.  The other one 
is that one device of one OEM 
might not have the same hardware
 inside in the U.S. as in Europe
 or as in a somewhat            
Asia, so what we sometimes faced
 in the past is that we got user
 replies saying, hey, it doesn't
 run on an XYZ device and we 
tested it in Europe and said 
well, it runs with us, but then 
we find out that they use 
different GPU or CPU and how 
should we get as a developer 
devices from Asia.  So again, 
massively helped there.  So 
that's something that basically 
helps us to overcome that 
challenge, and the research, I 
mean, the time that we put into 
research before, finding all 
that out, the hardware stuff, 
was immense.  I think for Galaxy
 and Fire 3, we had a Product 
Manager for about two months 
just searching databases of 
what's the device of market 
share in different countries to 
try to get those devices.  So 
Firebase Test Lab really helps 
us there because we don't have 
to do that work anymore, we're 
saving money, work quicker.
   Â» JUSTIN BROUGHTON:  That's 
great.  How does this affect 
your overall launch process?
   Â» ANDREAS STECHER:  As you 
imagine, we're quicker, so 
basically three things.  We're 
quicker in getting the game out 
there, it's more effective in 
terms of QA and testing in that 
sense, expawls we're more 
confident.  -- and also we're 
more confident.  I mean, as I 
mentioned, and you also, it 
could be that we have to black 
list the device earlier on that 
was a product that is -- like 
has a market share of like 5% in
 Asia.  Now we're confident that
 we say you know what, we don't 
want to blacklist it because 
we've test it had with Firebase 
Test Lab and we're confident.  
So we are quicker for QA, so 
development time is quicker, and
 I guess you all know that less 
development time means less 
budget, so you can save budget 
on that one.  Secondly, have 
more confidence we can cover 
more devices, more devices means
 we make more game ers happy out
 there with the product, they 
are there, they are playing it, 
they're writing great reviews on
 it, because they don't get bugs
, they don't get crashes, and 
we're more happy with that, and 
then because we're quicker and 
we're more confident we're 
covering more devices, by the 
end of the day and I'm busy 
driving sales, we're making more
 money, which is what we want to
 do.
   Â» JUSTIN BROUGHTON:  Which is
 the point.
   Â» ANDREAS STECHER:  Yes.
   Â» JUSTIN BROUGHTON:  Thank 
you.  I really appreciate it.  
Joha     Johannes you've been 
waiting patiently to give us a 
demo.  Please       Please.
   Â» JOHANNES KUHLMANN:  Finally
.  I'm going on show you how we 
added support to the game and 
we've been using the test lab 
for some time now and I'm very 
happy that it has helped improve
 our game and also with the 
launch.  So the very first thing
 you need to do is you need to 
declare your support for the 
game loop and you do this in 
your manifest and for that I 
will just jump right into 
Android studio.  The first thing
 we do here is add to our 
activity and the action's name 
here r and that's pretty much 
already all you have to do.  You
 can also at some more metadata 
here like how many different 
scenarios you support but we 
currently only support one and 
in that case that's not really 
required.  The next step then is
 you need to check for this 
intent when your app starts and 
we do this in our activity on 
create function here, we get the
 intent, we get the action, and 
compare the action's name to the
 string we also saw earlier in 
the manifest.  Then the only 
thing we do here is call this 
native function, force 
performance test, which at this 
point basically only sets a flag
 in native code which we then 
later check once our native code
 spins up in order to determine 
if the game should run in this 
game loop mode or not.  So all 
the actually game loop 
implementation happens in native
 code where we load different 
locations and missions after 
each other in order to see if 
they work at all and also in 
order to determine the 
performance.  So once that is 
done in native code, we hand 
back control to the activity by 
calling this native notify 
performance test and function 
and calling to the game, all we 
need to do in order to finish or
 to show that we are done is 
call the finish function on the 
activity.  That's pretty much 
all you need to do for the 
implementation.  The next what 
you want to do is you actually 
want to run the game loop and as
 Justin said earlier, there is a
 lab that you can install on the
 device, so I will do that on 
the device now.  Can we switch 
to the device?
  So this app is called test 
loop apps which I have installed
 here.  So we just tap that and 
it opens and gives up a list of 
all the apps on this phone that 
support the intent we saw 
earlier.  So currently this is 
only our game at the time, so I 
will tap that, then it gives a 
list of scenarios, we currently 
have one, so that's not much to 
choose from, but quite important
 up here you can set the time at
 which it defawtle, to 3 minutes
, which might be a bit short for
 the game loop, I guess.  Then 
when that is done, you can tap 
on the run button, and this will
 launch our game in game loop 
mode and start loading the first
 location and once the loading 
is done     done, we will see 
some action.  So this works, and
 then the next step or the next 
way to run the game loop suck 
also do this in the Firebase 
Test Lab so we switch back to 
the MacBook for this.  So we 
head over to the browser and 
Firebase and select the Test  
Lab on the left.  Here you can 
see I did some tests before 
which passed and some which 
failed, but we want to run a new
 test, so we click on the run a 
test button here, and the Robo 
test and instrumentation test, 
those two are old, but what we 
want is the game loop here.  So 
we click that and the first 
thing we need to do here is 
select an APK.  So I will just 
choose a very small one here 
because now it does the upload, 
and then you can also choose the
 scenario you want to run here, 
but we will just go to the next 
page where you can select the 
devices and API levels we want 
to test on.  So once you've 
selected that, you can click the
 start button down here in order
 to launch the game in game loop
 mode on the selected devices in
 the Firebase Test Lab.
   Of course, the roughening of 
the game             
               the running of 
the game will take some time, 
for for the results I will just 
use one we did before.  So this 
one, it gives you a list of all 
the devices that the test ran on
, in this case, there are not 
that many devices, but we can 
look at the pixel, for example. 
 On the first tab, it gives you 
some additional performance data
 that we are self-generated 
during the run, but here you can
 also look at the logs, which is
 mainly advantages, mainly 
beneficial if there were any 
problems or crashes during the 
run, so you can figure out what 
went wrong.  You can also look 
at the video of the run, but I 
will just skip over to the 
performance tab because we also 
have the video here and some 
additional performance data like
 the CPU usage over time     
time, the graphics performance 
measured in fps here, the memory
 consumption, which doesn't 
really go up, so I don't think 
we have a memory leak in here, 
and the network usage as well.  
The cool thing here is that you 
can actually click on the graph,
 so if we wanted to figure out 
why we have these frame drops 
here, we can click on it, and we
 see that the video jumps to 
that point in time and we can 
play the video from there and we
 see it's the loading screen.  
So it's not that bad that we 
have frame drops here.  Once the
 loading screen ends, we see 
that the performance goes back 
up, so the fps we are aiming for
.  So this is running the game 
loop via the Firebase console, 
but you can also run the game 
loop via the G cloud command 
line tool, and for that I go 
over to the terminal.  This has 
the advantage that you can also 
use APK extension files which 
for games you might often have, 
and you can also easily 
integrate this into your 
tenderness integration set up.  
So there are different commands 
like for example you can get a 
list of the devices in the test 
lab, this is basically the same 
list we also saw in the console 
earlier, but being also start 
the test, for example, with this
 command, you specify the test, 
that's the game loop, you can 
also specify the timeout here 
and provide the name of the APK,
 the name of the OBB files, note
 the naming here that the OBB's 
already have to have the correct
 name, so they have to include 
the version code that is part of
 the APK, and you specify the 
devices and API logo     logos 
and the orientation you want to 
run on.  Once we run this 
command, it will start uploading
 the APK and the OBB files to 
the test lab, and once the up
load is done, it will start 
running the game loop on the 
selected devices.  It will also 
give you a link for the results 
in the Firebase console so you 
can look at the results just 
like we earlier did.  And that's
 pret tich all there is to it.  
-- pretty much all there is to 
it.  You have to add for the 
manifest, check for the intent 
on start-up, check for logic in 
your native code and run one of 
the three messages I just showed
 you.  With that, back to the 
slides.
   Â» NALIN MITTAL:  Thafntion, J
ohannes, that was awesome.
   (applause).
   Thanks.  That's how you use 
the game loop feature of test 
lab.  So if you're interested in
 testing your games, please go 
to Firebase.
   Â» JUSTIN BROUGHTON:  More 
excitement.  She just ran a game
 loop.  Come on!  Yes!  Yes!
   Â» NALIN MITTAL:  Clearly 
Justin very excited.  Yes, use 
game loops, run them locally, 
run them on test lab to make 
sure they work on your users' 
devices.  We're really excited 
to show this to you in person.  
To recap quickly, I wanted to 
just recap what app quality 
tools we have in Firebase and 
how they work.  So before you 
put your app in the hands of 
your users, make sure you use 
them, make sure you test your 
app on test lab to make sure it 
works in all the right devices. 
 After you launch, you'll never 
catch all of the issues before 
you launch, so after you launch 
make sure you monitor your 
applications and its stability 
and performance with crash 
reporting, and then finally, use
 performance monitoring to see 
where your app is slow and why, 
and definitely tune in tomorrow 
for right here on this stage at 
4:30 to get a deep dive into 
performance monitoring, it's a 
really exciting product and 
can't wait to show it to you.  
Finally, come see us at the 
sandbox, Johannes and Andreas 
will be there, you can talk to 
them about how they implemented 
the game loop, we also have 
another game, Mecca hamster tha
t's an internal game, we're 
happy to show you hands on how 
we integrated game loops into 
the experience.  Come find us, 
also will have the engineering 
team there that's excited 
talking to you.  Thanks for 
coming, everyone, have a great 
IO.
