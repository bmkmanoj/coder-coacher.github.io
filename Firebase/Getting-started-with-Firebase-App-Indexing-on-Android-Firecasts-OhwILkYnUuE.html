team and I'm Lawrence also from the
firebase team today we're going to talk
about app indexing a technology that
allows your users to re-engage with
their installed apps through seamless
integration with Google search
No why would use this one to re-engage
with their apps surely they have them
already on their phone I'm glad you
asked did you know that the average user
has 36 apps on their device and doesn't
use most of them three-quarters of the
time and of those most are only ever
used once what if that's your app what
would be bad I worked so hard on that
out
exactly so with app indexing when your
users search for content in Google your
apps content can appear in the results
and not only that with autocomplete and
using in apps in the Google app you can
drive users through your content - right
right so how does it work well if your
app and site have the same content you
can associate them with each other and
then your app can receive incoming links
from search upload an asset links JSON
file on your site which associates your
Android app with the website because
only you can upload this file to your
website no one else can associate your
website with their app the target
property contains information about your
Android app such as the package name and
details of the app certificate making
sure that the right app is linked in
your Android app within your Android
manifest or XML file you can specify
intent filters these tell Android how
your app should be accessed by the
system so in the case of someone
discovering your content in search and
that content triggers a launch of your
app you can then tell it which
activities to use so in this example
when the URL matches recipe opcom /
recipe you'll launch the recipe activity
within your app when the Android auto
verify attribute is present in the
intent filter installing your app causes
the system to attempt to verify all
hosts that are associated with the
webview are is in those intent filters
the system treats that app as the
default handler for the specified app
link pattern only if it successfully
verifies the links that are declared in
your manifest so now when a user goes to
Google and searches for something if the
result is in your app then they can
launch your app directly from the search
results and based on how you define the
intent filter in the app manifest
the correct activity within your app
will also be launched giving your users
a rich experience cool stuff so if I've
built an app that has content in it that
my users love then through app indexing
I can make it more likely that they'll
rediscover it and then it won't be it
won't be one of those apps that has only
opened once cool so how do I get started
just visit this URL try out the code
labs samples and read the documentation
and we'll see you in the index</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
