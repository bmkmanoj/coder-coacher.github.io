talk about two of my favorite things
cloud fire store and the admin SDK so I
love that firebase has such robust
client-side SDKs for iOS Android and web
but did you know that firebase also has
a server-side option the admin SDK the
admin SDK lets you access firebase
features server-side so you can for
example read and write to Claude fire
store outside of the client this is
especially useful for offloading CPU
intensive tasks and keeping secrets away
from the client now if you've seen
Todd's videos on getting started with
cloud fire store for iOS or Android
you'll already be familiar with the
sample app I'm going to use one that
stores an inspiring quote
if you haven't seen these videos I
highly recommend you check them out Todd
gives a great overview of the fire store
structure I'm going to use the iOS
version of the inspiring quotes app
which looks like this you can see the
quote and author as well as text fields
to write a new quote and a new author in
this video I'll show you how to use the
admin SDK to make changes cloud fire
store which can then be seen here in the
client so you may be wondering how can I
keep my quotes fresh with new
inspiration every day I could rely
solely on users to write quotes or just
try to remember something interesting
and type it in the console manually
after all there's no shortage of
misinterpreted quotes on the Internet
didn't George Washington say that anyway
one neat way I could handle this is
server-side I could use one of the many
quote generating REST API is out there
to get my quotes for me and then write
them to the database using the admin SDK
I can also use server-side code to send
a notification to users or something
like that if I wanted to so that's what
I want to show you today how to get
started using the admin SDK to read and
write data to cloud firestore today I'm
going to show you the firebase admin SDK
for go but Java Python and node.js are
also supported okay let's get started
first I need service account credentials
which I can download from the firebase
console
under the firebase admin SDK tab I'll
select generate new private key this
downloads a JSON file containing the
service account credentials I'll add
this to my projects directory now this
service account JSON file contains
sensitive information including your
service accounts private encryption key
remember to keep it confidential never
add it to version control never put it
in a client app and never store it in a
public repository now I'll install the
firebase admin SDK to my go app using
GoGet I'll navigate to where I want to
put my new go app and then create it
when initializing the admin SDK on my
own server I need to use the service
account key in my options which I do
using the with credentials file method
as shown here then I use the new app
function to create a new app from the
provided context config and client
options in my case the client options
contain the service account file so the
app will be authenticated using that
credential now if you're running your
code from within the Google cloud
platform you use the Google application
default credentials that way the admin
SDK itself fetches a service account on
your behalf like this since I'm simply
running my project locally for now I'm
going to use the service account
credentials now that I've initialized
the admin SDK I'm ready to get a random
quote and write it to the database but
before I get coding let's briefly
examine the structure of the quotes app
at the top level I start with a
collection called sample data this
collection contains just one document
called inspiration this document will
itself have two key value pairs or we
can call them fields one called quote
and another called author now as an
aside keep in mind I'm not storing one
quote per user everybody in the world
will be altering this one document if I
were looking to save a different quote
per user
I'd probably set up a user's collection
and create a different document for each
user and again if you'd like to see how
to build this app on iOS or Android
check out Todd's fire cast on getting
started with cloud fire store now I'm
going to call function I'm calling get
quote the result of which contain
adjacent object with a random quote
there is although the function looks
something like this
alright let's generate a quote and then
add it to cloud fire store okay I'm
going to call the get quote function
which returns a struct called quote
containing the quote and the author
I'll log the quote in terminal so we can
see it I'll write the quote to the
inspiration dock in the sample data
collection using the set function which
sets the documents data to whatever data
I pass to the function if the document
does not yet exist it will be created
now keep in mind this replaces all data
in the document with the data passed if
I wanted to update some fields or add to
the document I'd use update instead of
set a log the error if one is found then
I'll log the results so you can see when
the quote was successfully written to
the database alright let's see this code
in action in the terminal I'll build and
then run my inspiration app the console
logs tell me that the new quote was
written successfully and we can see that
quote here and we can also see it in the
firebase console but I think it's cooler
to watch the quote change in the app so
here's the iOS version of the quotes app
with the current randomly generated
quote when I run my go app again I can
see the quote changed in the iOS app as
well see pretty cool
my server-side code can now generate
quotes great that's sure to keep users
motivated but I may also want to be able
to read data from Cloud firestore
server-side say if I wanted to sanitize
backwards from quotes or send
notifications when new quotes are
written so let's look at getting data
from fire store I'll get data from the
inspiration dock in the sample data
collection using get I'll also include a
catch block to handle if an error occurs
I'll just log it for now then after I
get data I'm gonna check if the document
exists if not I'll log that no document
exists then I can use the document data
for whatever my app needs such as
sending a notification and there you
have it
now you know how to use cloud firestore
for go on your server I hope this
inspires you to incorporate cloud
firestore and the admin SDK into your
firebase projects be sure to subscribe
to be the first to know about new videos
from firebase including fire cast like
this one thanks for watching and I'll
see you on a future episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
