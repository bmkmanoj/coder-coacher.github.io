in getting started with cloud firestore
the auto syncing auto-scaling database
in the cloud well if I got a video for
you it's um it's this one so come on
let's save our data to the cloud in this
episode of fire cast so I'm working on a
little app here that lets me store an
inspirational quote I mean I can't just
be expected to start doing work right
like I need an inspiring quote
preferably from Einstein or maybe leave
Marilyn Monroe to motivate me and what
better way to do this then with an app
so my app here consists of an edit text
view where I can enter my inspirational
quote and then a second one here where I
can store the author's name I then have
a Save button where we're gonna save
whatever inspiring message our user has
entered into the cloud so later we'll
load whatever data our users saved to
the cloud and display it with a big text
view or something so if you want to
follow along go ahead and create your
own version of this app just make sure
you have some properties for the Edit
views and an onclick handler for the
button called like save quote
now I've already gone ahead and created
a firebase project in the firebase
console and configured the Google
services plug-in with my JSON file if
you don't know what I'm talking about
check out this getting started video
here and then come back it's okay oh
wait now before we go ahead and write
some data let's take a moment to
understand how cloud firestore generally
works frankly this could be the subject
of its own separate video and it
probably will be one day but here is the
executive summary cloud firestore is a
document database that means it kind of
stores your data in a big tree like
structure kind of like the original real
time database but everything is placed
into documents and collections you can
think of a document is something kind of
like a map it's got key value pairs
which the firestore folks like to refer
to as fields and the values of these
things can be like any number of things
from strings to numbers to binary values
to little smaller maps that are kind of
JSON II looking objects and collections
are basically well collections of
documents so there are a few rules
around the use of these things the first
is that collections can only contain
documents nothing else no collections of
strings or binary blobs or anything else
there second is that documents can't
contain other documents but they can
point to sub collections so it's very
common to see a collection containing a
bunch
documents which then point to sub
collections that contain other documents
and so on in a workout app for instance
I might have a users collection and this
collection would contain a document for
each user and then each of those
documents might point to a workout sub
collection that in turn contains a
document for each different type of
workout that this user is performed and
then maybe each one of these has a
history sub collection that keeps track
of every time the user performed one of
these workouts may be along with like
some average heart rate data or some
other stuff like that
now if you're coming from real time
database land this kind of deep nesting
might be giving you heart palpitations
but don't worry this kind of data
structure is completely normal in the
cloud firestore world where queries are
shallow meaning that when you grab data
from a document you'll grab just that
document not any of the documents
contained in any of the sub collections
below which is nice the third rule is
that the root of your database can only
consist of collections now in a normal
production app this is going to feel
pretty natural you're gonna have like
your collection of items and your
collection of users and your collection
of games or what have you the one time
it's gonna seem kind of weird it's when
you're creating a little test app like
ours and you just want to save like two
strings so looking at our app at the top
level I'm gonna start with a collection
that I'm calling sample data this will
then contain one single document called
inspiration this document will itself
have two key value pairs or fields one
called quote and another called author
incidentally note that this is basically
a global variable that I'm altering
meaning that I'm not storing one quote
per user I'm letting everybody in the
world alter this one document if I were
looking to save a different quote per
user which I might do in an actual app
I'd probably be setting up a users
collection and creating a different
document for each user make sense
all right let's start building so first
things first I need to make sure I have
fire store installed and so I'll go into
my apps Gradle file and add this line
here to add fire store to my project
obviously this version number will be
different than what's current heck I'm
not even sure this version will work by
the time you see this video so do make
sure you grab the most recent version
from our documentation and then I'll
tell Android studio to go ahead and sync
and we're good so next in my main
activity here I'm gonna head on down to
my save quote call so in there I will
first grab the text for my to edit text
views so we'll get the views and then we
will grab the strings from them okay
and then maybe I'll do a check to make
sure they're not empty next I'll create
the data I want to save in my document
now this will be a map of type string
object that I will implement as a hash
map so I'll use the key quote and then
the string of my quote text view as my
value and then I'm gonna do the same
thing for the author and let's do the
right thing in command options see these
things that we can make these key names
constants okay that's better
all right now I just need to save this
to the cloud and to do that I need to
specify in which document I want to put
this data so we do that through an
object known as a document reference it
turns out I'll be using the same
reference multiple times throughout this
project so I'm gonna make it a field up
here in my class and let's initialize it
up here too now there are a few ways of
setting my document reference first I
could call firebase fire store get
instance collection sample data dot
document inspiration now I kind of like
doing this because it serves as a nice
reminder that you're always going to
alternate between collections and
documents but does start to look a
little nutty when you get several layers
deep like this is this is kind of silly
so an alternative that I prefer is
calling document where I pass along a
slash separated string as our path so in
our case the path would be sample data
slash inspiration and just remember that
in your path you're always going to be
alternating between collections
documents collection document and so on
so now that I've specified my document
let's go back to my save quote method
where I'm going to call set on the
document reference and that'll take in
the data I created above as the contents
of my document now this call will
replace my current document if it exists
and created if it doesn't it also
conveniently creates the sample data
collection too so I don't need to worry
about that not existing now I'm going to
chain on an on success listener like so
where we can print a debug message okay
and outlooks command options see this
puppy - and then we can add on a non
failure listener where we can print out
any error messages and that's it
alright for those of you who are all
about fewer listeners in your call you
could also handle this with a single on
complete listener like so and then just
check in here to see if your task is
successful either way works and honestly
it's just really up to you which method
you prefer
all right let's give this a try so I'm
gonna start up my app and I'm gonna
enter this very inspirational quote here
in the text field and I'm pretty sure
that was said by Plato I'll hit save and
oh whoops looks like we're getting an
authorization error and this is because
just like the real-time database
my cloud firestore implementation
contains a set of security rules that
determine whether or not a certain
action will be permitted and by default
they're set up so that nobody can read
or write to the database so the correct
solution here would probably be to add
in some sign-in using firebase auth and
then create some proper well-thought-out
security rules based on what information
I'm willing to share to each particular
user that said all that would make this
a much longer video than it already is
so I'm just going to do a bit of a hack
here and make my sample data documents
open to the public so let's head on over
to the firebase console I'll select my
project go here to the database section
and then make sure I select cloud fire
store for my list of database options
then I will click the rules tab and then
I'm going to add these lines here to
allow reading and writing to anything
that's part of my sample data collection
now this is a pretty terrible idea from
a security perspective but at least I've
contained the damage to just what's in
my sample data collection so I'll
publish that and we are done okay let's
give it another try I'm gonna wait a few
seconds and then go back into my app hit
save and looks like it worked and I can
verify this by going back to the
firebase console we'll select the data
tab and then I can look at our sample
data collection find our inspiration
document and sure enough looks like
we've saved our inspiring quote to the
world whoo okay next up we need to show
our users this inspirational quote by
grabbing that data from the cloud and
populating some kind of text view with
it now like the real-time database cloud
fire store lets me listen to changes in
the database and update my app in real
time but I know that for some of you out
there the idea of creating a real-time
listener for all your data is weird and
strange and sometimes you just want a
basic fetch call to get your data right
so I'm gonna show you how to do that
first and then we can talk about getting
fancy with some real-time listeners
so let's create a fetch button I'm gonna
add some constraints and some text for
the button it's just a button nothing
too fancy here and then I'm gonna stick
a textview in the middle of my screen so
that I have a user visible location
where I can display the quote we'll fix
that up we'll add in some default text
give it a name all right next up I'll
add a placeholder method called fetch
quote and I'll make that my buttons on
click handler all right let's edit this
method so I already have my document
reference as you recall I created it as
a field earlier so I can simply call get
on that reference to fetch the document
now for this call I can also add a
non-success listener and you'll notice
that this time the listener takes in a
document snapshot a document snapshot is
basically an object that represents your
document you can find out its ID read
some metadata about it
make sure the underlying document it
represents really exists and most
importantly grab the data that it
contains we'll see if our document
exists and if it does I'm gonna get our
quote by grabbing document snapshot get
string and I'll use that quote key
constant I created earlier I'll do the
same thing for my author name and
incidentally there are other ways of
getting at this data if I wanted to
fetch it all at once I could call get
data and then that would give me my
entire document in a string object map
and for more sophisticated projects
document snapshots and cloud firestore
have this nifty two object helper
function that will look probably
familiar if you've ever used the
real-time database before basically this
will take the data that you get back
from the database and attempt to create
an object of the type that you specify
it'll take whatever values it gets back
from fire store and try to set those as
fields so for this to work you have to
make sure that the target object has a
constructor that accepts no arguments
and it's probably a good idea to have
getters for these fields too so if I
want to make inspiring quote its own
class it might look a little something
like this and yes apparently it's fine
for those field names to be private like
that and while this custom object stuff
is pretty neat for now I think I'm just
going to stick with my original to get
string calls next we'll want to display
this text on-screen so let's make sure
we have a field that references our
quote text view we can set it in
oncreate and then we'll set the text
value and we're done
and yeah I should probably add a non
failure listener here too but for
brevity's sake let's skip that so let's
run this well click fetch and there we
go I can save my inspirational quote to
the cloud and now I can load it with the
click of a button so this is great we've
got our data successfully saved and
loaded from cloud fire store but what if
you are interested in getting your data
in real time what if this explicit
fetching seems quaint and old-fashioned
to you well let's show you how to get
your data in real time to basically the
process is going to work nearly the same
let's override my on start method and in
there I'm gonna bring up my doc ref but
now instead of calling get I'm gonna
call add snapshot listener and I'll
create a new event listener for the
document snapshot now this will fetch my
document the first time I set it up but
then it will also grab updated data
anytime thereafter when that document
changes so my on event function gets
passed in a document snapshot just like
my on success handler below so in fact
I'm just gonna copy the exact same code
for my fetch call into here to update
the text view and maybe I'll print out a
warning if I do get an exception like
this now well this will work we also
want to do the right thing and turn off
this listener when it isn't needed for
instance when my activity is off screen
this will help to keep your network
usage low which means better battery
life for your user and potentially lower
database costs for you both of which are
good things now I could track this
listener manually and then you know
remove it at an appropriate point like
in my on stop method but there's an
easier way you see there's an alternate
call for add snapshot listener where you
can pass in an activity as the first
argument and this activity is telling
our event listener hey when this
activity stops you can go ahead and
detach this listener and so by
specifying this as my first argument my
listener will automatically do the right
thing and detach when my main activity
stops so let me run the app again you
can see that thanks to my snapshot
listener my label automatically gets
updated with the inspirational Plato
quote that was used previously and then
if I change my inspirational quote to
this one
I think Einstein said this you can see
that my text view gets updated
automatically without my having to even
touch that fetch button wow geno is fast
maybe too fast right it looked like my
text view got updated before I even got
the console message that
my data was saved to the cloud how did
that happen well what's going on is that
cloud firestore is making my app run as
speedy as possible by notifying me of
changes that happen locally as if they
had happened on the server but in the
meantime it's still going ahead and
updating that data remotely in the
background now it turns out my client
does still receive an update from fire
store that this data has been changed on
the server but by default the fire store
library will ignore this event because
basically with the exception of a little
bit of metadata that says yes this is
really from the server it's identical to
the first now if you wanted you could
get notified by the SDK about the second
event the one that actually happens when
the write happens on the server you do
this by creating some options for your
document listener that say yes notify me
even when just the metadata changes you
would pass those options in add in a
little debugging to print out what we
get and let's add in one more quote
notice that when I save this thing now
my callback is getting called twice once
for the change in my local cache and
then once on the server now there may be
times when this behavior is what you
want but honestly most of the time the
default behavior works just fine so I'm
going to go back to what we had before
and you probably should so there you go
congratulations you are now saving your
data and one of the most powerful and
sophisticated online databases in the
world and using it to store two lines of
text which maybe is a little overkill
but in a real app you'll appreciate this
power trust me now there's a lot more to
learn about cloud fire store including
more details on how that data is
structured how sub collections work and
how to run some more sophisticated
queries all of which are great topics
for future videos in the meantime go
back to those security rules and change
them to be a little more secure and when
you're done with that be sure to check
out the documentation and try using
cloud fire store in your own app as the
saying goes the journey of a thousand
miles begins with reading the
documentation
