wanted to store images into firebase
they would like base64 encode these
images into like massive strings and
then try and save them that way it it
wasn't very efficient but these days
we've got firebase storage which lets
you store and retrieve large pieces of
user-generated content like photos music
and movies all without needing your own
servers sound intriguing want to start
adding firebase storage into your iOS
app well then you're at the right place
let's get started on this episode of
fire casts so this here is my simple iOS
app with a button and a progress view
the idea is that when the user clicks
the upload button they'll be able to
select an image or a movie from their
photo library once they do we'll use the
firebase storage library to upload this
piece of media to firebase storage and
then we can report back the upload
progress to our progress view which will
nicely fill up so I've already hooked up
the code to allow my user to select any
image or video from their photo library
this should look pretty familiar to
anybody who's used a
uiimagepickercontroller before but let's
go over it anyway so when the user
clicks the upload button I'm going to
create an image picker controller now
our source type will be our photo
library and I'm letting the user select
both images and movies as possible media
types that's an important distinction
which you'll see later I'll set my
delegate to self show the view
controller and I'm good to go
so now down here my delegate most of the
hard work is being done in my did finish
picking media with info method so the
first thing I'm going to do is get the
media type to see what my user selected
if it's an image then I'll try to get
the original image as a UI image object
and then I'll try and get the image data
as a JPEG assuming that all works
I can now call my yet to be filled out
method upload image to firebase storage
passing along that image data as a
parameter now if I get a movie instead
my image picker controller doesn't give
me the entire movie object that would be
an awful lot of data to keep into memory
instead I get a URL pointing to where
the movie exists locally on the device
this is a URL that begins with file
colon slash slash probably something
like this so I'm going to call a
different yet to be written method
called upload movie to firebase storage
and I'll pass along the URL of the media
to that method I'll do a little cleanup
down here I dismiss the
you controller and then I also need to
make sure I dismiss my image picker if
the user clicks cancel and that's what
I'm doing up here so that's where I'm
starting off none of this has been
firebase specific so far it's just the
basics for using a
uiimagepickercontroller now the next
thing i've already done with my project
is gotten firebase up and running i've
created a project in the firebase
console attached my iOS application of
the project downloaded some constants
install the firebase library through
cocoa pods and called for app configure
in my app delegate if you don't know
what i'm talking about you should watch
this setup video first and then come
back so in general there are three steps
for uploading data to firebase storage
first up is creating a storage reference
you can basically think of this as a URL
where you're pointing to the data's
final location in firebase storage
second will start uploading the file
through a storage task object that we
create and then finally we'll update the
progress meter which will do by
observing when the storage task object
receives a progress event so let's start
by creating our storage reference and
firebase storage references they're
basically like URLs except that instead
of say beginning with HTTP and pointing
to a web page they start with GS and
point to a specific location in the
firebase storage cloud a typical
reference looks a little something like
this
this first part here you can think of it
as the host is generally something the
firebase library looks up for you as for
the rest of the reference you can think
of this as the path to the files
location you're going to set that as the
developer okay let's get coding so first
off let me make sure I add firebase
slash storage to my pod file
I'll call pod install and I am good to
go next I'll jump into my view
controller and import firebase at the
top here now to create the storage
reference I can do that by first calling
first storage storage dot reference this
will get me that storage host I was
talking about earlier after that I can
then call say child my picks child demo
pick JPEG to create the rest of my path
and while that works it is a little
wordy so I can shorten this to reference
with path my pick slash demo pick JPEG
which does the same thing it just looks
a little cleaner next up I'm going to
create a little metadata so I can
specify the content type as a
a peg this step is optional but it can
be useful as you'll see later now I can
start uploading the file I can do that
with the put data metadata completion
handler method I'll add in my data and
my metadata objects here that I have
earlier and within my completion handler
I get back a new metadata object that
tells me a little more about the image
that just got uploaded along with an
error object in case there was any
trouble so this is good but I also want
to be able to monitor our progress as
this image gets uploaded luckily this
put data call returns a first storage
upload task object so I'm going to
create a variable to capture that now
you can call certain methods on this
storage task like pause resume and
cancel in case you want to affect your
upload while it's in progress but you
can also add observers for when it's
state changes and that's what I'm going
to do here this will let me update our
progress bar as our image gets updated
so I'll call upload task observe status
with the status of progress this will
get triggered every time the upload task
uploads a chunk of data to firebase
storage inside the handler here I will
get back a task snapshot object now this
object in turn contains an optional
progress object which has this very
useful fraction completed property so I
can check and see if this progress
object exists and if it does I'll set
the value of my progress view to this
fraction completed property and just
like that I'm reporting progress to my
progress view Rea and since this is
happening within a handler let's do that
little weak self dance shall we okay
there that's better and in case you're
wondering I don't actually need to worry
about removing this observer when I'm
done with it
upload tasks objects automatically
remove all observers on themselves when
they're done which is one less thing for
me to worry about all right I think
we're about ready to give this a try I'm
going to select my image firebase
storage will upload it and oh oh that's
bad
looks like I ran into a permission
denied error and that's because the
default security rules on the storage
bucket only allow me to upload data when
I am signed in here I'll show you let's
go to the firebase console I'm going to
select firebase storage and then click
on the rules tab now these here are the
security rules for firebase storage and
they help manage what people can and
can't do with it for example you can
limit people the only
upload files that are under a certain
size or give certain people read-only
access now you see this line this says
that only authenticated users can read
or write data you can see it here allow
read or write only if the authentication
data is not equal to null now in my case
that doesn't work because I am NOT a
signed in user ah so the proper solution
here would probably be to add firebase
off to my app but frankly that's a whole
other video and you're here to get
started with firebase storage so I'm
going to do something kind of dumb and
dangerous and allow full access and this
basically means that anybody can read or
write anything they want to my storage
bucket so again for crying out loud
don't do this in a production app in
fact I'm going to revert this change
just as soon as my screencast is over so
we'll publish this and go back to our
app we can give it one more try and this
time we can see that it is successfully
uploaded my image awesome
the progress bar did get updated too it
just happens really fast here anyway I
can confirm this by going to the
firebase console there's my folder for
my pics and inside here here's my demo
pic now note that because I specified my
content type as a JPEG image in the
metadata firebase knows that it's an
image and I can see a preview of my
image right here in the browser which is
pretty nice so this is great but how
would my user download this image later
or share it with their friends we can't
send them to the firebase console well
there are a few ways to do it
I could once again create a storage
reference and call data with max size
completion handler on it
this basically lets me download the data
as a big old and as data blob which I
can then interpret as I see fit notice
this max size parameter here that's to
make sure I don't run out of memory by
loading something that's too large but
an easier way might be to take a look at
this metadata object that I got back in
my completion handler see it has this
nice little helper method called
download URL which returns as you might
have guessed a URL that I can use to
download this data later let's put it
out and see what happens
so I'm going to add this debug line to
our callback and run it again
and now I've got a URL that looks like
this we're accessing our image via
firebase storage Google API is calm and
right there's our storage host and
there's the path to our image and this
stuff at the end is a token that our end
user will need to download this image as
a developer I can revoke these tokens
later should I ever need to so I can go
ahead and copy and paste this into my
browser's address bar and voila there is
my lovely image so in my app I could
load this image using a plain old data
with contents of URL call although for
images in particular there's some really
nice third-party libraries like pin
remote image or Alamo fire image that
are worth looking at too so that's
everything you need to know to upload
and download images but hang on we are
not quite done yet what happens if the
user selects the movie well if you
remember in my image picker delegate I
get back a URL when the user selects a
movie instead of the movie itself most
likely because we don't want to load
this entire thing into memory well as
luck would have it firebase storage also
has a put file method built just for
this purpose that takes in a URL to a
file instead of some image data so my
upload movie to firebase storage method
looks nearly the same as my image method
with that one little change so I will
create my storage ref to point to say my
movies slash test movie mov we can add
in some metadata to specify this as a
QuickTime movie I'll create a storage
upload task and set it to the result of
storage ref put file where I will pass
in the file URL and the metadata we can
print out some useful data in the
completion handler and once again I can
observe any status changes in my upload
task oh and while I'm at it let me also
print out some debug info I'll show you
why in a second so I'll run this select
my movie to upload and there you go I'm
uploading movie too and you'll notice
that when I move my app in the
background my upload task continues to
run which is pretty nice so there you go
everything you need to get started with
firebase storage now if you want to know
more feel free to check out our
documentation but before you do I have
three tasks for you one revert back
those storage rules like now while
you're thinking about it
to think about what parts of your app
might work best for firebase storage
have any cool screenshots or images that
your users might want to share with
their friends well this is the perfect
solution for that kind of feature and
three subscribe to our YouTube channel
we got lots of great tutorials like this
one and a whole lot more on the way so
go on subscribe you know you want to and
