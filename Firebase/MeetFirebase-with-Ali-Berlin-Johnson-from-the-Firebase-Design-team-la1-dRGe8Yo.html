where you can meet the Googlers that
make fire banes happen my name is Doug
Stephenson and on the show with me today
is Ali Larijani hey everyone so thanks
for joining me on the show yeah thank
you all right so tell me how I what do
you do with the firebase team so I'm on
the firebase UX team and I kind of do a
whole kind of range of things related to
use your experience so I do some visual
design so like illustrations you know
making sure things are pixel perfect
using the right colors as well as
interaction design which is like how the
user is actually interacting with the
interface so our team kind of deals us
anything the user might be interacting
with their touchings everything from the
marketing website to our private console
I have a lot to ask you about that later
but first I'm really curious where are
you from I'm from Minnesota I also lived
in Wisconsin for a little while so I
grew up childhood in Minnesota moved to
Wisconsin in high school and went to
college there as well tell me what's
something interesting about where you
grew up so Wisconsin's known as the
dairy State we have lots of cows those
you know people argue that California is
where happy cows are you know how you'll
get some screens different people if you
tell that to someone Wisconsin but I
actually can't eat dairy at all so I got
the joy of going to restaurants a lot
and asking if something had dairy in it
and getting the responses like you're in
Wisconsin is the dairy state of course a
very in it so that must've been
frustrating to not be able to have the
best of what your state has to offer
yeah that's too bad so I understand
you've been drawing since a very young
age could you tell me about that yeah so
my whole family is rather creative my
mom minored in art my brother went to
art school so we always grew up drawing
painting coloring having art supplies
around so it's kind of part of how I
grew up so I understand you took that
into middle school and you had some
interesting projects there as well could
you tell me about that yeah so I
actually I'm a self-taught developer and
that kind of started in middle school so
I was a member of a Harry Potter RPG
website online and we could decorate our
common rooms I was raising claw if you
like look like a common room so that's
when I started first wing CSS
I also kind of played with flash
animation so first just kind of drawing
because I kind of liked how it made like
the line smoother compared to like you
know ms paint or something like that but
I also started then figuring out how to
make games their little interactive
things even if it's like a play button
on a little animation but in college you
major in biomedical engineering but then
you change to design only about that so
a lot of people think like engineering
the way over here and designs you know
way on the other side but they they all
kind of have the base of the same thing
which is problem solving and so I just
kind of realized after graduating and
working in biomedical engineering for a
little while that the thing I liked the
most was more of these aspects of design
and like creating a product or you know
fixing a problem so and I've always
liked doing art so like I said like I've
been drawing since I was little so just
kind of seemed obvious to kind of go
into design for visual and interaction
type type stuff so I understand that
you've done some apps of your own and I
have one here on the phone called happy
cloud and so if I play happy cloud if I
shake the phone he gets really upset and
then if I tap the phone it gets happy
and it says happy cloud is happy which
is nice but if I say shake it again I
make them a pleasure did they can said
I'm sorry so tell me a little bit what
was it like to make that I made that
during a fire based experiment week so
basically every once in a while we have
a hackathon or experiment weeks either
you know try out our own features that
we're making for developers you know
become the developer yourself or to like
learn something new so I usually take it
as a time to take a part of development
that I've never done before so in this
case I had never made an Android app
before and see what it's like it's
really important if I'm helping make a
product for developers that I understand
kind of what is what what it's like to
be in their shoes so you actually learn
some Android development with this and
you learned about firebase because I
guess it's hooked up so that other
people who are playing this could also
see each other sort of happy sad cloud
that they say yeah uses the real-time
database so if you were both playing it
they update on both of our devices at
the same time so it's pretty cool one
thing that you like that we talked about
is you play this game called quick-draw
and it's a it's a google game I guess
you could you call it a game it's is
more
a web app where you can go and it'll
tell you to draw something on screen and
then Google will try to guess what it is
so it's using machine learning so we
have some video of you playing so what
is it like for you to play that game
it's like pictionary but you're playing
against computer and the whole time
you're drawing it's been like it's a
fire truck it's a lightning bolt or
something because guessing the whole
time so it's interesting to see how it's
guessing you're like in progress drawing
as you go on it's also interesting is
it's learning off of everyone's drawing
so depending on how you draw you you may
think it really looks like what if
you're drawing so now with the firebase
team you work on UI and UX to the
firebase console so what does that
involve day-to-day so a lot of what I
worked on is design pattern so I work
with the team of designers we have on
the UX team you know we have designers
working on all the different features
and you need to make sure that these
features all feel like one products like
one of the biggest thing about firebase
is like it's not just one thing it's all
these things put together we want to
make sure that like remote config feel
similar to database and it feels really
cohesive so working a lot with everyone
to make sure we're using the same kind
of patterns and UI elements I also do
feature work so mainly focusing on like
the develop pillars for the back end of
the service features I also get to do
some more visual design related things
so sometimes illustration and stuff like
that yeah so it sounds like you've had a
pretty big impact on you know everyone
who's using firebase so they've probably
seen something you've done even if it's
as simple as you know just logging into
the console or something deeper in one
of the features so it turns out you also
designed the firebase logo I understand
which is ended up everywhere now right
it's on it's on my shirt it's on this
mug it's on the picture behind you it's
on this button so we had those printed
up for when we were in in asia and i
also had it put on this shopping bag so
do you know what i call this this is the
fire sack so you can keep the button
that's that's for you so tell me what we
would like to go through the process of
developing this icon so it's a very
collaborative process as you can imagine
like a lot of people with in firebase
they're going to have feelings about
what what should be the visual
representation of our product it also is
a little more complicated when you're
taking something that used to be an
existing
and you know merging it into something
that has to fit within a broader brand
so before firebase was on its own we had
you know it was like a little firebase
that was made out of fire not only did
that not really represent firebase any
well but now we have to turn it into
something that fits within the Google
family so it's working with product
people working with material design team
working with the other designers on my
team to kind of come up with something
that still felt like firebase still had
fire but like I what I one thing I kept
always saying is like we need happy fire
we don't want scary burn your house down
fire needs to be a happy little flame it
sounds like there's some balance there
it has to be material like it has to
have its own identity within the fire
based platform and I imagine it was kind
of hard to choose from among all of
these different varieties right tell me
about some of these varieties there's a
there's a three prong frame is a two
prong flame there's all these different
varieties tell me about tell me about
how that worked out sy just kind of when
I started I just tried to come up with
as many different ideas as possible and
then you know always thinking what would
make us successful logo for firebase so
one thing we knew we wanted to keep like
the warmer kind of fiery colors and fire
is in our names we can't ignore it
completely but also make sure like I
said it wasn't scary fire it was you
know happy little flame something
guiding like a light to guide you to
make your app so yeah we tried a bunch
of different variations I also even did
some like folding paper studies in the
beginning to kind of get in the groove
of material because it's really based on
like physical materials of yeah it is
kind of look like an origami kind of a
thing but I think we picked the right
one I kind of mentioned it any other way
speaking of drawing stuff I have a game
for us to play it's a drawing game so
our producer will give us some things to
draw and then we'll have 15 seconds to
draw it that's in the 15 seconds we'll
compare and then you can see which which
picture you prefer now I suspect I'm not
going to do very well at this game since
you're the professional drawer I think
Nate may also have something to
contribute to this let's go ahead and
play so let's get our tablet though okay
right for you let soup okay ready set go
well that's time okay what you get I
even included a person who's excited to
eat the shoot I see that I I made a cup
of soup and it has alphabet soup that's
why there's an A and a B in there oh I
don't know what a developer looks like
minds awful boy what did your happy
developer look like that's right I think
mine actually it might be a little bit
better than the recycle know they're
both pretty awful though clearly
everyone types like this actually I knew
a developer who did he was a true finger
hunting Becker and he was fast camera
crew this is not flattering at a camera
crew have to say why is a very rough
sketch of what's right in front of me I
just put a couple dudes head behind
careful because that's all I see is just
dudes head behind canvas google i/o
let's go for it did you draw here the
stage you drew I with the io logo on my
embarrassing since I was very in tune
with the Iowa event last year we had
tents out so i drew a tent with a
firebase thing and people inside there
now don't know what that box a nice tie
races like this is hard to do with your
finger what did you get Nate have you
been to google i/o oh nice
alright i'ma show you fun I'm ashamed of
mine well alright what you kid very nice
are roughly equivalent i would say
because i'm coming a little fishing line
they raised here alright well good job
mate did you draw yourself in this one
beautiful self portrait good job thanks
for playing Ali yeah that was fun
alright and for everyone at home be sure
to chime in the comments to say who you
thought did better I'm sure it wasn't me
well that's all we have time for be sure
to check out Ali's work on the firebase
console and also our on twitter now be
sure to subscribe to the firebase
youtube channel to get updates on all
our video content thanks for watching
see you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
