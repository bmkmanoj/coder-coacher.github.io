Fontaine here from the firebase team
welcome to another episode of fire casts
on today's episode I'm going to show you
how to track your AdWords app campaigns
with firebase we know tracking campaigns
can sometimes be a headache
so we made it so that you can now track
it with just a few clicks you'll be up
and running with conversion tracking in
just a few minutes so let's get started
in order to enable conversion tracking
with AdWords using firebase analytics
the first step is to verify the SDK has
been implemented correctly now I know
that for this app Transworld endless
skater on iOS it is implemented
correctly because I'm seeing a lot of
rich data in the dashboard already now
when it comes to conversion tracking or
any attribution in general a lot of that
is driven from the attribution tab
itself by default
firebase marks first open an in-app
purchase as conversions for you
automatically
first open you can think of this like an
install and since I'm going to be
running an install campaign to drive
downloads that metric is what I'll be
paying attention to at this point I
decide I want to run and track an
AdWords app campaign because AdWords is
a Google product firebase has a specific
integration with it to make tracking
smooth as possible
the first step to enable that
integration is to link my firebase
project to my AdWords account I can do
that by coming into project settings
first click on the Settings icon then
select project settings available here
in the top bar is account linking when I
click on account linking I can see
several different products across Google
that I can link to since I'm managing my
AdWords linking I'm going to select that
now you can see that I already have one
AdWords account linked but I'll be
adding another one that drives different
campaigns I click on link account and I
see a list of the accounts I have
admin access - I'll click on a specific
account I'm looking to link there's also
a checkbox that allows me to make the
audiences I've created in firebase
automatically available in AdWords for
remarketing I'm going to go ahead and
leave that one on since I do want my
audiences available in AdWords I click
link to AdWords one thing to note is
that in order to link accounts you need
to have admin access on the desired
AdWords account and you need to be an
owner of the project in firebase now the
first half of this setup is complete the
second half is actually importing your
conversions into Adwords you can see
here that I'm in Adwords and I'm in that
account that I just link to firebase in
order to import my conversions into
Adwords
I come to tools and I select conversions
here I can see a list of the conversions
I already have in the account but if I
come to the navigation on the left and
click firebase I can see a list of the
different conversions available to me
that have been created in draft by
firebase at this point I can decide
which ones I actually want to import so
you can see here first open for my iOS
app with this app store ID that's the
one I'm going to be focusing on for now
this is what I will use to drive
installs for a particular app you can
also see a handful of other types of
conversions that I could be importing I
select first open and I click import I
can see this confirmation message
telling me exactly what just happened at
this point you can see my iOS first open
conversion that has been imported from
firebase now it says no recent
conversions that's correct
what this is showing me is that it was
appropriately imported and
it's time for me to go run campaigns so
it can start tracking them now it's
several days later and I've run my
campaign I can see conversions
registered in AdWords that have been
captured by firebase
finally when I come back into firebase I
can click on the first open report and
see the performance of different
channels not just the Google campaigns
scrolling down to see the table at the
bottom I can see side-by-side different
channels I've been acquiring users from
and of course I can see the actual
Google campaign here how many first
opens it brought me how many purchased
conversions as well as the revenue and
lifetime value there you go
you've set up conversion tracking in
Adwords all in a couple of minutes now
you're ready to go run some campaigns
