Moroney from the firebase team and I'm
here to welcome you to another episode
of fire casts on today's episode I'm
going to show you how to send
notification messages to your users
using firebase notifications on Android
then you'll be up and running with this
feature and it'll just take a few
minutes so where do we get started the
first thing you'll need to do is to make
sure you have your development
environment properly set up getting
started with firebase notifications
really couldn't be any easier you don't
need to write any code none all you need
to do is include the firebase messaging
API s in your app and for her base will
do the rest just add this line to your
build up Gradle dependencies then when
you run your app you'll receive the
notifications in the background you
don't need a server or anything like
that either
you just use the firebase console great
now that you have a working development
environment you can send notifications
right away and these will be received in
the system tray but when your app is in
the foreground and you want to handle
notifications that's a little bit of
code that you'll need to write let's
take a look at this next make sure that
your app is linked to your firebase
project if it is you'll see it in the
overview screen here once you've done
that simply go to the notification
section if you've never sent a message
before you'll see this so click on this
button to send your first message this
will take you to the message composer
where you can specify your message and
your desired audience I'm just going to
say my first message and for my desired
audience and picking the user segment of
the people who are using this app I can
then send and confirm the message
let's go to the device and see how its
received now among the device and the
app is running in the background because
the screen is locked and there's the
notification when I touch on it the app
is activated it could also be in the
background if I had press the home
button that's how easy it is to get a
notification to launch your app in
firebase notifications we can also do
this when your app is in the foreground
and I'll make that the topic of a future
screencast so you saw how I could use
the firebase console to send the
notification and then my app received
and rendered it that's pretty cool right
and that's it for this forecast so
please leave your questions in the
comments below or reach out to us on
Twitter and G+ using the ask firebase
hashtag don't forget to hit that
subscribe button I'm Laurence Moroney
