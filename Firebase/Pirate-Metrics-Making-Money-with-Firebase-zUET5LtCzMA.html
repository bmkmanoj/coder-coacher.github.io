metrics with firebase I'm Lawrence
and he and follow back again pirate
metrics is a framework for growing your
business that's based on acquisition
activation retention referral and
revenue that's right in this episode
we'll be looking at revenue and hey if
you don't make revenue from all your
work you're gonna end up hanging out in
Davy Jones locker then it's good that
five these offers ways to earn from our
work isn't it absolutely and other than
earning gold from selling our app we can
also do so with AdMob and firebase AdMob
is all about monetizing through rich and
engaging ads emphasis on the engaging it
uses analytics to ensure that the right
ads reach your users at the right time
and it's important to remember that
adding AdMob to your app is just that an
addition so any existing set up
investment ad units registered apps
audiences all that kind of thing are
still valid and you can still use them
coupled with firebase analytics it
produces its own monetization reports so
you can plan smartly how to use it and
importantly given the huge inventory of
ads and the smarts of Google behind it
the ads presented in your app will be
relevant to their audience and the style
of app that you're in so in my apps all
about cannonballs and Crowsnest I'm not
going to get ads from scurvy landlubbers
who can tell the difference it's been
designed to be easy to get started you
can do it with just a single tag in your
layout and just a little code there's
even a new type of native ad called
native Express that's designed
specifically to streamline the coding
experience so give it a try by clicking
on the link in the description so the
key to earning from your app is not just
having a great app but having an app
that will keep your users engaged so if
they're going to see ads you want to
make sure that they are contextual and
delivered at the appropriate time AdMob
and firebase gives you the tools to do
exactly that but the rest is up to you
and that's about it for pirate metrics
check out the rest of the series where
