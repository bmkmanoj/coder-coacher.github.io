Laurence Moroney here from the firebase
team and welcome to another episode of
fire casts on today's episode I'm going
to show you how to sign in with Google
using firebase off on Android and from
that you'll be able to see how you can
sign in with other providers to you'll
be up and running with this feature in
just a few minutes so let's get started
the first thing you'll need to do is to
make sure that you have a development
environment properly set up to get
started with firebase and Android use
Android studio to create a new project
just accept the default form factors and
create one with an empty activity
whenever you change any of the Gradle
files you'll see this message telling
you that a sync may be necessary it's
good just to sync it in your module
level builder Gradle you'll need to add
the class path to the Google services
package as shown then in your app level
build up Gradle you'll apply the Google
services plug-in if you sync you'll see
an error that there's a missing Google
services JSON file don't worry that's
easy to fix you do this from the
firebase console if you don't have a
project already create one and follow
its steps once you're done you'll see
the project on this screen simply select
the project and you'll see the apps
associated with it click the add app
button and select Android you'll now
need the package name and the sha-1 the
package name is what you use when you
are specifying your app and the sha-1
can be gotten from your debug keystore
like this
paste them in and in add the app you'll
see that the Google services JSON file
gets downloaded to your machine select
the project view and then open your app
drag the file into the app folder as
shown
now when you gradle sink you'll see that
everything works and you're ready to
build in firebase okay great now that
you have a working development
environment set up the next steps will
be to build a simple app that lets you
sign in with Google and Android you'll
import the required files create a
simple single activity app and then
finally code this app with a sign-in
button that signs into Google and then
tells your app the ID of the signed in
person let's get going before you start
coding your Android app make sure you
have everything properly set up in the
firebase console if you've done that
you'll see it in the overview screen
like this next ensure that Earth is
enabled for your project which you can
do in the off section select the sign-in
method that you want and in this case
it's Google an Android studio check your
build.gradle make sure that the Play
services off libraries are included and
then in your layout file specify that
you're using a sign-in button and you'll
get it at runtime then in your code
there's a few steps that you need to
follow first is to create a Google
sign-in options object that specifies
your sign in scope and use this to
create a Google API client when the user
clicks the sign-in button you create a
sign-in intent and the activity for that
you can see it here you get the intent
from the API and start an activity for
it then on the result you'll be able to
get the users data you get a Google
sign-in result object from the data that
comes back from the intent and from this
you can get a Google sign-in account
from which you can get the display name
as you'll see in the demo we get the
users email address and effectively turn
it into a friendly name and display it
signing out is even easier you simply
call the sign out API catch its result
and you can update your UI from that
let's look at this in action here's the
app we've been building we have the
branded sign-in button and a sign out
button when we click the sign-in button
were given a picker you pick the account
that you want and then once you've been
signed in you're good to go you can sign
back out again and this clears the UI
when you sign in you're also given the
options
had an account and then you're taken
into the flow to add a new user I won't
go through that now I'll just go back
and pick an account with the picker
that's how easy it is to add sign-in
with Google to an Android app with
firebase
there you go you've just built your
first app that signs in with Google and
Android and it only took a few minutes
you're now ready to personalize your app
or maybe add other service providers
such as Facebook github and more that's
it for this forecast please leave your
