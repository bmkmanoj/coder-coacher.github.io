forecasts I'm Laurence Moroney and in
this video we'll take a look at the new
targeting options for sending
notification messages using firebase and
how you can finally tune who you send
notifications to using the firebase
console to send notifications you can
implement a notification system with
minimal coding and without a server
back-end it's built on firebase Cloud
messaging an infrastructure that handles
over a trillion messages a week with
messages being delivered to most
connected devices in less than 500
milliseconds to learn more about
firebase notifications click here in the
initial release of firebase we allow you
to pick the users for notification based
on analytics audience membership
language or a specific app version but
now we've added a set of enhancements to
how you tightly build your set of users
to send notifications to including
building them based on analytics
segments user properties and more this
is important notifications can be really
annoying if there are too many or if
they're irrelevant so accurately
targeted ones give a far greater chance
of user engagement first of all you can
now pick user audiences when you target
a user segment in the notifications
composer so for example if I create an
audience in analytics and name it here
you can see I've made an audience of
people in Canada or who speak French
Canadian as a group that I call
Canadians a then in the notifications
composer I can pick the app if there's
more than one in this project and
specify my Canadians as the user
audience that I want to send
notifications to and if you notice that
little and over on the right that will
allow you to stack conditions so for
example there's a property for people
who make in-app purchases so if I only
want to send a notification to Canadians
who have not made an in-app purchase I
can do that like this using these
combinations as well as the ability to
create
multiple audiences and filter on them
you'll get fine-grained control over
which users will receive your
notification in addition to this you can
also filter unuse or properties a user
property is one that you define that's
specific to your app so for example if
you're building a fitness app you might
want to set a user property that is set
to true once the user has walked a
hundred miles using the app then when
composing a notification you can add
this user property it can also be
implemented alongside the others that we
spoke about so for example if I build on
my previous example I can send a
notification to Canadians who've walked
more than 100 miles or in their case
more than 160 kilometers a so there's
lots of options for how you would match
contents maybe you want a string that
contains a substring or the opposite
only sent to people that don't match a
particular substring you can also use
regular expressions from maximum
granular control and of course if your
property is numeric you have all the
standard comparators with these tools
you're equipped to more accurately
target your notifications and hopefully
improve response rates and avoid
notification spam to learn more check
