about pirate metrics pirate metrics is a
framework for growing your business
that's based on acquisition activation
retention referral and revenue that's
right in this episode we'll be looking
at the third of these retention there's
an ugly truth about the app ecosystem
people tend to use only a very small
portion of the apps that they have
installed on a regular basis a typical
user tends to open a third of the apps
they installed only once and
three-quarters of the installed apps are
rarely used the goal for any application
developer is to make their product a
habit for their user and building habits
isn't easy you need a precise plan for
appropriate triggers that remind your
user about the app over a period of time
habit then develops in the user the
first step to solving the problem of
retention is identifying at what point
in a user's journey do they tend to drop
off for that you can use cohorts inside
firebase analytics cohorts help you
visualize your retention by showing you
what percentage of users you do retain
over a period of time it's broken down
by days or weeks ad1 retention means the
percentage of users who use your
application one day after using D five
means five days later D 10 means 10 days
later etc etc most users tend to drop
off in the first few days itself which
is largely an activation issue this
decline then flattens out you want to
start with a medium term goal such as
increasing week 1 retention keep an eye
on this metric over time as the
experiment with different ways to boost
it
speaking of ways to boost retention we
mentioned triggers earlier and for years
Google has provided one of the best such
triggers it's called cloud messaging
cloud messaging is now a part of
firebase and has some new tricks up its
sleeves you can still do all the things
from battle one great way for you to
utilize cloud messaging to improve
retention is send a push notification to
users after say three or four days from
when they installed you could
potentially share deals
tips or tricks or even extend trial
periods things that will get your users
to come back again we've also released
notifications which is built on top of
cloud messaging this allows you to send
push notifications to your users
straight from the firebase console with
no server-side programming required you
won't be able to send deals in an
automated manner as we just discussed
but it works perfectly for those moments
when your marketing team wants to send
seasonal deals straight to your users
plus you can target specific audiences
or users who have subscribed to certain
topics to keep the notifications
contextual ultimately you don't want to
bombard your users with notifications
that would just annoy them it would
cause a mutiny and maybe even carries
them to uninstall your app besides
notifications one of the cool things
that you can do is track uninstalls
right inside firebase analytics look for
the automatic event app remove go ahead
and take it a step forward by creating
an audience that you can then reach with
AdWords as we discussed in a previous
video and finally if you use app indexes
in your app Google search results on
mobile would highlight content from your
service this encourages users to use
your app since it's already installed
instead of going to a competing service
so if your ship is draining users
quickly it might be about to sync and
all that effort and money that you've
spent on acquiring users goes down with
it
plug this gap as soon as you can please
