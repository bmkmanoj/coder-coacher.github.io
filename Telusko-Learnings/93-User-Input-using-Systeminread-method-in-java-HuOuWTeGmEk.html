video we'll talk about how to take input
from user using system dot out or system
dot in dot read method now if we talk
about user input in java we can use a
class called a scanner or we can use
something called as bufferedreader okay
so these are the two ways you can using
which you can take input from user so
you can create either scan object or you
can use Beaufighter object but hold on
now if you want to plain something in
java we simply say system this is we
will really use this statement right we
use system dot out dot println to print
something which simply means this
println is a method which belongs to a
object called as out so out here is the
object of print stream class and the
object is created in system class so
this is the standard way of printing
something right and if you have the if
you have the same thing in c programming
it will be printf so in c programming we
use printf and then in c plus plus we
use c out and then in c-sharp we use
console dot write line so if you can
observe in every programming we have
some or the other way to print this to
print anything right now
what about user input so for user input
what we need is this two plus right but
in c programming for user input we have
scanf so we can directly use scanf to
take a user input in c++ they make the
thing is c in and in c-sharp we use
something called as console dot readline
so what's more important here is we have
direct method to take to print something
and to take to take input but in java we
need to use scanner and bufferedreader
don't we have any other way of doing it
and of course we have like we have or in
all this programming we have some of the
other way to take input
so in Java also we have the standard way
to take input which a system so sensibly
to print we use outright and to take
input via something called as in because
we are taking input and then we need a
method to read the value so to print we
have print Ln or we can simply say print
and to read we have something called as
read so there's a method well as read
and if you if you use read it will give
you the input ok so to print something
we have print and to read something we
have read now let's try to use let's try
to see how this read method works so let
me remove all this and let's start with
a concept now for sure of anybody to say
read it with my toe and other so what
we'll do is we'll say those exception
here so that we can we can focus on the
code and let me use system its system
dot in dot read and if you see the
signature of read so let me just go to
this read method and if you see the
signature it says it's a abstract method
which throws an i/o exception and it
reads next byte of the data from the
input stream okay and then it will
return or the value from 0 to 255 okay
that means if anybody use the lead it
can only take a range of 0 to 255 okay
that means I have to store somewhere we
have to store into a byte value but
still we'll use our interval you let's
see how it works
so we'll say int I equal to system dot
in dot read and let's try to print the
value of I let's see what happens so if
I enter a value of let's say a 5 so
let's run this shift f6 ok it's waiting
for my input I will simply say 5 so what
I'm doing here is I'm taking the value
and showing it in I and then printing
the value of I so the output should also
be 5 right but when I say enter the
author is different
53 where this these coming from let's
take a new value so let me run this
again this time I'll give 0 okay it says
48 and now if you see if you observe
this don't you think it's look like
ASCII value of 0 because a you did value
the ASCII value of 0 is 48 and the ASCII
value of 5 is 53 that means it's taking
the is taking the value as a character
which it converts into a int value which
is ASCII value and then is printing it
so let me prove my point if I say if I
done this and if I give a as input the
output will 65 so what what is doing is
it taking the input as the ASCII value
and then converting 2 into the what you
say the ASCII value it from gaita to
ASCII value but let's say I want to
bring the character itself so what we
can do is we can again convert that
integer into character using calc
casting here so you can use typecast or
friend devalue an I fit on this it's
waiting for the input let's say a it
will print a because we are converting
that into a karyotype but what you find
you take the whole string as input
because they when you say read it will
take only one character what I want I
want to take the whole string and that's
the biggest drawback of this read which
can only take one character or your time
ok so unlike C programming C programming
can take the whole line in in fact in
C++ also we can take the whole line but
a default method of n which is really
takes only one character so in this
Nadia what we can do is we can if you
want to infinity whole string we can
simply say it's spring STR the default
value will be blank and then we can
apply a loop here and what loop will
check is let's say system dot in dot
read now this value should not be equal
to what you say enter ok so we can check
enter also here in fact I don't know the
ASCII value for enter so what we'll do
is we'll just run this code there
get the ASCII value of enter shift f6
enter its enter it's not printing so
what we can do is we can check the we
can run a loop which will check for the
input as let's say as soon as I enter 0
or okay we'll do it this thing will say
I will say while system dot in dot read
it's not equal to not equal to 48 by the
time it will take the input and then it
will store that value in STR so what
we'll do is we'll say int I equal to
this value
okay
so we'll say int I equal to value and I
plus STR STR plus I okay so if I run
this but it will come it will
concatenate all the numbers I want to
concatenate the string so we can simply
cast it with the character and now I
feel on this okay and then we'll print
the value of STR itself so we'll say
bracket and STR let's save this and now
if we're on it's waiting for the input I
will say it's now being ready enter oh
it's printing was the issue now let me
run this again so it's being ready zero
so I can see it's printing my name in
this format you guys to run this again
zero enter also you use you can see it's
printing in this way now what's the
better way of doing this is instead of
using this system dot lead system dot in
dot read which only gives the integer
value what you can do is you can just
see you can just use the advanced
classes one of the advanced classes is
scanner and the advanced classes is
bufferedreader so what this do is this
these two things they actually use
system dot in dot read as a method to
take the input and they're just enhance
the user experience using this classes
so we have multiple ways to take input
so one of the basic way is system dot in
dot read and we can use also use scanner
and bufferedreader so that's the that's
the video does the concept about lead
method in in object</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
