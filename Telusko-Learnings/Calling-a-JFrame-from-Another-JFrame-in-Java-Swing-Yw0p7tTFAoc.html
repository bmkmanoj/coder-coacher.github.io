created a code in which we have added
two numbers using swing so at me on this
application should to show you the the
code we have done earlier so this is
your J frame in which we can add two
numbers we'll save five and two and the
answer is seven right now so I'm running
that the GUI by learning this file now
what I would do now is I want to create
a file from which I will call this class
or this frame what I mean by that is
let's say if if let me create one more
last year and we'll say this has color
now the main the main use of this color
class will be this class we'll have or
this file with our jframe or let me
define a main function okay and this
class will this file will have a class
called as XYZ already there
let's say X and this X is a frame so
we'll say a jframe let's import the
package now in this frame let me define
a constructor with a public X in this
constructor I need some swing code which
should have done earlier so this is the
template we are using from last few
videos now I want to do a noise in this
frame I need just one button so what I
can do I can say it is J button say
button B equal to nu J button and we'll
name this ass let's say add form now
what I mean by this is if I click on
this button B it should call that add
form so it should call this add GUI that
means when I click on this button it
should call a new frame for that we need
to add reasoner to it so we'll say add
this direction is now this add action
listener and this I need to pass object
of action listeners will say desires
action listener and here let me
method so let me remove this extra code
yeah and this editor also I let me write
a code for myself here so let me define
so what I I want to do in ours once I
click on this button it should call that
form it is a DUI so what we can simply
do is we can say neo add GUI simple
that's it when I click on this button it
will call this a GUI so let's take let's
do a try here let me say it is first way
to call that constructors will say X obj
equal to nu X we can even use anonymous
object there and if I run this code now
from this class and no button it's
because I forgot to add a button there
so I have to say add X also I'd be
simple that run this again so yep so we
got a button here and if I click on add
form Oh not working why is not working
it's not rgy the glass name is edition
edition let me just try it again there
are some okay so if I run this code now
so I have this frame which is actually
if I click on this add frame you can see
we are we are getting this added class
or add form now I need to close this
also when I clock when I call add form
it should call this form and this form
should go automatically get close for
that what we can do is we can go here
once you call this add new form will say
this does this this dot dispose will say
this politely so it's a dispose so isn't
this post method you can you can close
the form and if I say add form you can
see now our art form is gone right so
this is how you need to call a frame
from another theme so we can you can
call the question you can create the
object to call that frame and you can
use disposed to close that form we can
also use system dot exit but system dot
exit will close all the frames this post
will close the current frame so this is
how you need to call frame from frame in
the next tutorial we'll see we'll use a
progress bar which means once I click on
a button it should take some time it
should so which it should show some
process or some time so after 5 seconds
your form will get opens for that will
we use something but as J progress bar
so how to use that let me see in the
next tutorial so thank you so much for
watching until subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
