and okay so here we go so I guess tool
people are watching this and so this is
a public video where I will be doing our
first code okay so if you are watching
this on YouTube let me know by clicking
on the like button and you can also send
the messages in the chat window okay so
I hope everything is proper the audio of
the video and okay so if everything is
good just click on the like button so
that I will know everything is going
good and you can also do it all you also
do with a chat window okay so basically
what is the discussion I don't know how
many of you are following this on me on
you on YouTube but then I have announced
that I will be doing a live code and you
have the are so finally we are starting
with the live coding and so last time we
have discussed about what is the
requirement how it will be going and
today we will actually talk about the
real discussions and how to start the
project so we've been learning about
spring MVC how to use MySQL so the
making of actual product basically here
and will be also deploying that thing on
the App Store or the App Store that's
what happens there will be deploying
that on the Google App Engine so we'll
be making a real application which will
be deployed on Google App Engine okay so
I hope you're excited for this okay so
we are we are having 46 people watching
this okay so okay that's great
now so basically so basically we have
two types of people here one they are
members of the members of the project
and others you can actually watch
everything on YouTube so members can
contribute for the project so if you
want to be if you want to be a
contributor for this project you have to
be a member of the member of the group
so we have a Facebook group called as
the disco life project and you have to
be memory of member of
to be our contributor so if you are a
number of that group you can contribute
your code you can contribute your design
the Java code and all those things if
you know you can watch the video on
YouTube all these live sessions we were
done using YouTube and so that's how it
will make way I would suggest you to one
do one more thing I mean I would request
you to do one more thing you can share
this link on your Facebook profile so
that will so others will also know about
these things
so do share this video with your friends
so just copy the link about and go to
your Facebook profile and paste it there
so that everyone will know something is
happening something like that and then
use or also use a hashtag or asterisk oh
no so that I will I can actually track
you so I'm going to Facebook now and
searching for how many people have
actually using that hassle to put tag
okay no one has done yet so what I can
do is just share this video on your
Facebook profile and use a hash type ls'
hash telescope by the time let me just
have a drink
what okay so we got a parcel here and
also cause it oh okay so here we go let
me start the thing and I hope you are
sharing this on your profile I can't
still see any hashtag that you score
come on guys you have to support me
right that's how that's how it goes so
since you all learn you'll be learning
lots of thing do also share this video
with your friends it will be helpful for
us right okay so let's start with that
song I like to share my screen with you
okay so syllabus let me just talk about
the plan which we are going to do here
okay
so first of all I will open my sublime
base web browser okay I'm opening up a
story
here I'll let me share the screen with
you okay if I don't share only the
application which is okay so as you can
see we have started with the thing so
I'm sharing my screen now and I'm also
struggling recording here so click on
start and I'm doing the screen recording
of my system as well so that I will
upload I will be operating this on
youtube later okay
ok so what are things we need here so
basically we will be doing this project
using a concept as a child now I don't
know how many of you know I died so
basically what happens is normally in
software industry we use sdlc right we
use s VLC so when you make a software
you have to follow as VLC which is
software development lifecycle
ok so normally we can you we can we
normally use a concept of waterfall
model or we also use something called as
iterative model so that different types
of model which we use to make
applications right so what you can also
do is we can use again here the problem
with the problem with waterfall model is
if let's say if you complete your first
phase and if you go to the second stage
what will happen is if there is some
problem with the second phase or the
maybe if you are going through the
fourth phase and if something goes wrong
at the third phase you cannot go back
and the client requirement is never
fixed client might change the
requirement so what you have to do is
you have to make sure that whenever a
client changes the requirement you have
to add up those requirement so whenever
you use agile model it will be easier
for you to to adapt that changes and
help it that's how it will go
ok so we'll be using agile here so what
we do is every week we'll try to
complete at least one module so this
week will be focusing only on the
feedback module so what I get is from
the entire project so basically we are
building my website so we are
redesigning the telesco website so we
have two advantages with this the first
advantage would be will be having a very
designed website else quad core and the
second advantage would be you will learn
how to make a simple project ok I'm not
saying this is a very complex project
this will be a simple project but there
are lots of people they don't even know
how to build a project and while doing
this will learn different technique
Knology how to use github how to how to
deploy your application on Google App
Engine and all those things ok so
they're using agile here our next
repeater base technology we are going to
use here is mask you'll and
the language the programming language
will be using power because I'm going to
beat Java as I will be using Java here
and there's one more thing which we need
here we need a framework for Java and
the framework we'll be using here is
spring MVC again is it composite to use
spring MVC not exactly we can you can
use normal Java as well but then but
then we can but it is better to use
frameworks okay that's that's great so
let's let's try to implement this will
directly go with the coding coding step
so normally what happens is we have to
go in certain steps example first of all
you have to create a database then you
have to create a design and then you can
make the backend part of back in part
right but what we will be doing is we'll
be first creating the database and not
the entire database the only table which
we need now and then later will be going
forward so so after that we'll be going
for the coding part will be building a
application using spring MVC and then we
deploy that on on on the on the on the
Google App Engine okay so we'll be
deploying that on Google App Engine so
today we'll it will be one our session
so 15 minutes are they done so we still
have 45 minutes let's see how how much
we can do today so that the remaining
thing will do it tomorrow okay so now
let's me let me just go to the mask you
log match
so the first software you need to
achieve this is called as a MySQL
workbench okay again you can use any
software but I would suggest you to go
for Maskell workbench it just roll down
do some setup here guys
okay so we got some questions there do
we need JavaScript here yes the
knowledge of JavaScript will be
important because my focus here would be
to make the backend part live with you
the designing would be so I will need
designing help from your side so you
people will be submitting the design in
fact I got some mail from people I got
our design firm
Karthik from Karan then Shilpa Naveen
Chandra and Wells so we got designs from
these people I guess most of them what
they did is they just use the existing
page I mean that was a I mean I got a
very good design here but then I wanted
to read what you say I wanted to
redesign the stuff so I want some new
design so if you can help you with the
new design new format I will show you
the columns we need today also show you
the database part and how to do this our
part but I would need your help
and the in the implementation of the
design implementation or new design okay
so everything seems good here
okay so we got some maximum people are
watching this you say that's great
that's great okay so okay so if you have
just joined this session we are talking
about the live session here where we are
doing the live coding so if you are new
to this do click on the like button so
that I will know that you have also
joined it so yeah so the database will
be using masks you'll hear we can also
use for screens but then the place we
are actually deploying this website is
Google App Engine where it provides you
master database so it will be easier to
understand mask you'll now and you can
also implement that in posted that's
fine okay
so it means go to so the software we'll
be needing here is called as first of
all let's design database so what do I
do here is I will open my I will share
my into a spin with you okay am i
showing the entire screen or just okay
I'm showing my entire screen and let me
just open this
okay so let me open the workbench i'ma
bring a masker workbench here and it is
okay so now to create a database i will
be using mysql workbench and in this
system I don't have mask yo so I have a
mask you later guys on another server so
I have already one more laptop with me
the address so that me just trying to
tie database so the address the IP
address for that machine is one eighty
two dot one sixty eight dot one dot to
this this nation just next to my machine
and the username is loot and the
password is also dude recon okay so okay
so this is my ask your database here so
we can create any Mac we can use any
DBMS but I am using mask you'll hear
what do I do is I will create a new
table here first of all look at a new
database I will say okay how do we get a
new database Co so I can use query
string I will say create an app it is
visible so I would say create database
disco
that's my database I will click on run
so I will at the database I will say use
the disco I just hope you know SQL
before hand I will say one so I got the
disco and now I would say create
integrated people so to do what task
would be to create a feedback form
when I say feedback form and talk
actually talking about this feedback
form so let me just open it is go here
if I click on this feedback this is the
page we actually going to create so
we'll be creating the design your page
where we will ask for the name we'll ask
for the email address we'll ask for the
Institute name or will not will not go
for Institute name we don't need that
now
since we are doing some changes with our
database okay and we need okay what else
we need here we need a message so we
need a message and then we don't need
all this thing we are
so we will only go for one star the
overall rating will not go for a
specific one will not go for knowledge
into innovations will only go for the
overall one and since I'm not good with
design I will not be building this star
pattern so I'll be using simple numbers
there okay and then we can click on so
once you click on submit which should
work it should show the a tiny database
that's what we'll be doing now okay so
so how do you say is I'm not getting a
clear picture so what exactly I mean
you're not getting a clear picture means
it is not visible to you that's what
you're saying
I don't know okay so what do I do now is
let me just okay so well it will be the
same system but then first of all we
have to make a date database right so
what do I do here is that we get a table
here I will say create table feedback
and this feedback people need certain
columns so in say the first column is
name and name would be of type path cat
I would say maximum length would be
happy provided you not swapping in here
and we'll say will say email that to be
Val card and we'll say no one has I'm
already more than how do you write and
then what else we need here so we'll say
email then we need one more thing we
need message it's a message is also
value card will have a message of
message would be lengthy so it's a
thousand characters and then would be
having a visit and how the guy cuz
because some people they do type
feedback right then we'll go for
regarding what so normally what I want
here is when I go for so see I want
feedback for different things I want
feedback for my youtube channel I want
feedback for for my online training so I
do online matches as well right so I
want feedback for that as well and even
I need feedback for the corporate
training so since I am going for
corporate training
okay so since I go for corporate
training so I do ask them to send me a
feedback so I won't of I want figure I
want feedback for different things so I
need feedback for YouTube channel I need
feedback for online training I need
feedback for four batches carpet benches
so let's say regarding we'll say Val
care and we'll set and because we so
will okay let's not use bad CAD let's
use change
now why Inc is because we'll give
different values so one would be called
weight training also one would be
YouTube ii ii ii would be online pinning
and three would be corporate okay so we
got regarding and then we need code so
we need we also need a code now what is
code here so let's say so let's say last
week I went to a company and if I want a
feedback for those from those people how
would I know if those people have to
what did you feedback so what I'm going
to do in the batch is I mean if I go for
the training if I go for the corporate
wing I ask them okay this is your code
and you have to send a feedback with
that padilha code so that will be a put
again it will have a clear picture of
code once we started the coding part
will go forward and and and then last
you'll be rating rating would be from
one to five how could have beat waiting
so this would be aimed this is my beta
ratio okay and let's let's try to
execute this query okay so you can see I
got my table now how do I verify I've
got this table so let me say it describe
a feedback and if I love this query so
you can see I got a table so I got me me
I got name I got a mean I got message
regarding I got cold I got waiting right
so I got all this columns here
okay so we got a question from mr. Khan
Mubi will be following some daily stand
up and say how's that I was thinking
about that can we do scrum meeting but I
don't know how to do is committing
virtually so I mean how can we stand the
void surely let's let's see how it
became to that if you have any solutions
let me know let's see how to do stand-up
meeting life okay so we got our table
here and now let's insert some data okay
just to have the default values so I
will say insert into feedback of values
and let's say I would say this is okay
the first day term would be the name I
would say feedback is given by the wins
I will I will people feedback to myself
I will send a beam and I will use an
email ID which is envy and rdy okay I
don't have because not my melody okay
this is I'm using a fake ID here and
then we'll be using oh okay we'll use a
font size effect okay so we got yeah so
the next thing we have to mention the
message I will say message is good I
mean you can have a little message there
regarding so I will take a number here
so regarding one because YouTube videos
and then the code now as we don't have a
code for YouTube videos right because
the code is only for the corporate what
I will do is I will set it free for the
corporate and I will use a code so let's
say the company is let say Microsoft so
they will use of quadfather's micro 1:01
so let's say if the batch number is one
to one they will use micro Mozilla one I
will give this feedback I will give this
feedback - I will give this code to the
patch earlier before give the feedback
and then the rating so let's say rating
is four so this is be Rita I want to him
so time if I fire this worry you can see
it says inserted let me just verify
which is insert it or not will say
select star from feedback and if on this
query you can see we got our data so we
got our first row here okay so we
we are building a database here okay so
we are building our database and then we
have also inserted a tahir okay so in a
chat window I can see okay everything
same skirt so people who have joined now
just click on the right button so that I
will know you are enjoying this session
I'm doing this for the first time so I
don't know how it will be going so
you're asking me to increase the font
size how about now okay let's check my
display preference here is it right
display preferences right okay okay so
do click on the like button if you are
enjoying the session guys I will know
that how good it is going okay great
thank you so much for the feedback that
yes so we got the feedback table and
what next now okay so what do we do now
is let's create a project now see we got
the database right now let's say if you
want to provide a feedback of course you
need a page to give the feedback right
and if you want to create a page and
when you send a feedback that feedback
was going will be going in database but
then we cannot connect HTML to database
right so we need a language and that
would be a Java language we'll be using
Java to connect your database and your
the UI so data so let's say if you send
a feedback that feedback will be coming
in the UI and that data will go to the
java part and then java will insert that
into database right and to do this what
were you doing what we'll be doing is
we'll be using some software now when we
use Java we have different software's to
work with I mean different idea is to
work with we can use it we can use
IntelliJ we can use NetBeans we can use
Eclipse and since for Java I will be
using a spring framework here there are
different frameworks available for Java
we have stores we have spring we have
you have different flavors but then when
the best framework now is is a spring so
it'll be using spring MVC here okay so
either so for spring MVC again we can
use eclipse here but then to go with
spring MVC
I will be using a special software or as
STL's now as still stands for spring -
and sweet if I open that you can see
this is it stands for spring - sweet and
this is basic basically used for spring
projects so it is getting open let's
wait for some time okay this is the one
this is our software now I don't know if
you have experience in eclipse before
but anyways if any way you create
eclipse project oh you might be
wondering we are using STS then I'm
talking about Eclipse they are same
actually so when you use Eclipse you are
actually using I mean when you're using
s cheese you're actually using Eclipse
okay so so we kind of come in from other
path spring is a lightweight best for
web development exactly okay so let me
let me just change this to so I will use
my own workspace so let's create a
workspace clothesline so again what is
the workspace so you can create all your
project in one box space right so I will
click on this and you can see my STS is
getting open
okay so you can say we got STS here okay
my team is sharing some data with me you
know see what are they done so I guess
my team is sharing the check
so where's that okay so I've got a
design here so I got my STS here so what
do I be doing it is too far let's try to
understand how to create a project so
our main focus today is not to write the
actual code let's try to understand how
to get a project first right that's it
that is important so first of all let's
create a project here and then we'll see
how to go ahead so let's try to
implement a project now if you don't
know about spraying guys you can just go
to youtube and search for search for the
videos of search for spurning videos so
just go to just go to youtube and search
for a disco spring and you can see
videos there okay so okay okay so why
using spring because it is so anyway you
build a project using some free well so
it will be easier for you to maintain it
and if you with you I mean it is easy to
is it easier to make the project is
easier to maintain and it creates some
layers if you make some changes in one
of the layer it will not affect other
deals it's not compensated to you spring
here but then using spring will give you
better advantage okay because I was
saying new and so will create a maven
project now people who don't know about
my and you also have to learn Raven
first okay so what do we do this so so
see after this session what you can do
is just watch the video once again and
be with the flow because from the next
session you have to build your own
project I mean let's say in two sessions
if you complete feedback form in fact in
this week will complete feedback form so
from the next week you have to submit
the code to me right so you have to
submit your code so you will understand
that once you see this session ok so I
will click on the new but new here and
then I will go for an event project now
when you create am having project it
will be easier for you to build a
project right because maven gives you
all the required dependencies normally
when you create a project we also need
some dependencies so for this you should
have a knowledge about maven as well so
it means write it somewhere what are
things you have to learn first so first
of all you have to be very good with
Kodava ok and when you have to learn
about servlet and BSP a bit
I mean basics of this of it and JSP then
you should know about spring MVC because
we will be building the project using
spring MVC and C my main focus here is
not to teach you all this technology my
main focuses if you know all this
technology how to build a project and
then you should know about mavin how to
build a project using maven and the
awesome thing is I do have videos on
this on YouTube so do learn this because
it will be helpful
that the type of sessions which you are
doing now will be doing this type of
sessions a lot so don't worry if you're
not good at these things today make sure
you study all these things in one week I
mean you can do this see when you have
when you have something I mean if you
have something in your mind if you want
to achieve something it is easier to get
it even in one week it is possible okay
so when you create a maven project I
want to create a web project here so I
will say maven archetype web app so when
you want to create a web project so
you're going to create a web project
just click on this maven archetype web
app if you want to create a cool project
you can create a maven archetype
QuickStart but since we are building on
a web app so we'll go for the web app
here which is am having out the web app
the advantage is it will give you it
will give you the project it will give
you a web project so we go for that now
it will ask you for the blue party now
basically one is a blue party so many
when you create a project every project
belongs to some companies right so let's
say as a disco so I am working for a
disco now so in the disco we have
multiple projects so all this project
will belongs to one group and that is
combat telescope so the group ID should
be unique and the best way to make your
group ID unit is by reversing your
domain name if your domain name is the
discard prom just reverse it to make it
convert I just go and you are good to go
then you have to mention the artifact
idea what is artifact ID basically is
your project name I will say the project
name is task in fact I always believe I
mean I'm doing this project on a long
time so I always show for this project
as test project and then we mentioned
this version so I will say version is
one point zero and then the pact is
nearly the package name would be the
group ID plus your artifact ID okay and
then click on finish and you can see we
got our project so we got our project
here is the project it's coming so you
can see just get downloading everything
from the internet ok by the time you can
if you are new to this session if you're
just drawing do click on the like button
so that I will know you
sessions okay so we got our project can
you see that we got test project but
then how to connect this to a server
because even when we create a web
project you have to make sure that you
connect with your webserver with our
with I mean we open it your web app with
our webserver now we don't have that so
one here can you see that we don't have
any web server so we have a server tab
you know and it says no servers are
available so first of all you have to
add a server so what I do is I will
click on this no server available and
then I will click on Apache I will
create a server I will use tomcat 8.0 we
don't need any bulk is over here and
then click on next it will ask for the
Tomcat installation so I don't so first
of all you have to make sure that you do
have talk and installation your system
so download Tomcat you can go to you can
say Tomcat trade which pre-owned
theaters so this and you have to
download Tomcat 8
okay so depend upon which machine you're
working with if you are using Windows
machine you can pick up one of this
debate 64-bit if you're using a Linux
based machine you can select a dog said
now I'm using Mac here so I will be
using 2.0 you have to click on this and
you have to unzip or you can keep it
anywhere you want okay so a penny it is
saying that we should be using JBoss we
should be using JBoss if you are using
some enterprise thing a tomcat will do
for my server
I mean type of project we are making
Tomcat is enough for that in case if you
want to build a server when you want to
provide some EJB applications enterprise
there will services then we need JBoss
other than that we don't need your boss
here but then we can also use divorce ok
so
yeah you're right upside-down cake is
not a full Java EE so basically Tomcat
is a web server and it doesn't support
EJB but we are not using a jib in your
project right so that's why we'll be
going for Tomcat okay so yes we can use
Tomcat here so that sounds good okay
I'm got some suggestions in the chat
window that's great okay so what do they
do is I what do we have a target in my
system which is downloaded and unzipped
so I will go for browse and you can see
I already have Tomcat in downloads
folder so in my downloads
I have Apache Tomcat because already
unzipped so with we come back click on
open and click on finish so you can see
we got our Apache Tomcat EW I will
right-click this and we say start ok and
you can see target says Tomcat started
now you have to link your project with
this target now how do we do that
so right click on the project and say
raise the properties
so we'll say properties and we'll select
on target runtime will sent on this
which is apache tomcat 8.0 click on OK
and you can see we got our project
connected with the Tomcat server right
so recall our project here it is
connected to Tomcat server there is no
edit now so either is gone ok ready
so now what what we want next so if you
open this map and dependencies now the
advantage of having dependence is if you
need any jar files
mavin will give you all the jar files so
like mavin is like a Santa Claus you
just rich wish for it and Evan he will
give you those jar files right so just
close your eyes and say hey I want
spring libraries I haven't will say how
do you say it so in Indy visitor faster
right
ok so it's like blessed
okay I mean yes I'm getting some
sessions here for my team okay so okay
so if I open this font I smell file you
can you can whatever Java files you need
you can just mention that and it will
give you the joy of files otherwise if
you're not using maven you have to
download all the Java files by yourself
and that rush mate is very it's a pain
you know where so okay so if I go to
this for maximal file and you can you
just have to add a dependent caesium and
I'm sure your this is this point is not
visible to you so you can just change
the point size and just good to hear and
search for text current points I want to
change the basic settings for this text
font edit and let me just make it from
11 to footing will be good I guess
so the points is visible now okay so
I've got a point from Big Boss because
what's your name I mean I can see
because you I don't know your name in
the in the mail okay we shall says for
dependencies you can refer my cheat
sheet exactly
okay so okay so when you spawn XML file
form XML file is basically a file we
just which stands for our project object
model
so P om stands for the project object
model so anyone you need any dependency
you just have to add the dependency in
this file okay this is basically a mavin
configuration okay
okay okay so now what I do is so we got
a poll question from David ours we are
using Tomcat but we are developing it
deploying it on yes it does support
Google I mean Tomcat support right so
Google App Engine does support a tomcat
support so we can do that okay so what
next everything seems good now we have
to add a spring dependencies right so to
download the spring dependency first of
all let me just go to the official
website of spring to show you what is
spring exactly is so if I go here you
can see this is a spring official
website which is spring dot IO and is
managed by pi water
and if I click on project here okay so
you can see this is Spring Framework and
if I click on this basically we are
using Spring Framework here and okay so
we got okay this is the latest version
of spring which we can use all other
versions asked snapshot version will be
going for the current version which is
four point three point seven and this is
the dependency we want this is the
official result of spring but we want it
spring MVC dependency right so normally
you can you get a dependency from the
official website of Pavan which is
memory repository and if you can search
for spring here so it's a spring MVC by
the time it gets that will it see the
comments is it App Engine require
subscription yes you have so App Engine
is not free for it is it is free for one
yup
and after that you have to pay for the
services and even it is free for one
year but you have to give your credit
card details okay so even if you are
even if you are wanted free you have to
insert your credit card it is that's the
only drawback of Google App Engine I
mean most of them we don't have credit
card details right okay
so I will click on spring web MVC
okay and we'll go for four point three
point seven and click on this copy this
and we'll finish it here the moment i
pasted it good to see that look at the
dependency many dependencies here you
got all the dependencies here regard we
got all this thing here so we can see we
got spring MVC because AOP we got bean
so all these databases are required for
your Spring Framework okay I got some
questions here from David asked why'd we
don't use AWS it is free for twelve
months it was with Google App Engine is
for free for twelve months I was facing
some issues with a tab less but I'm
still figuring figuring out how to use
AWS for our project
okay so we got one more question make a
video with regarding to object-oriented
programming so mine free cable I already
have videos on objectivity programming
so you can check it out okay so now meow
say is spring up this is a framework
what about spring would shows please
good makes your project elephant bit
easier so maybe we'll also convert our
project in spring boot later once we
figure it out how to make it work on
Google App Engine but I mean we are
focusing on spring MVC okay for
OpenShift server we can also use
openshift some of the problem is
openshift server has closed there's free
subscription you have to pay for that
and then you want to pay why anyone will
do use open ship for when you want to
paste pay for it AWS is much better than
open ship right so that's why we are
using I mean Google App Engine is also
good okay everything is paid version can
we Oh 1.9 is releasing on the paid
version I don't think so Java will go
for paid version no idea about it let's
see okay so we got them a dependencies
here right so we got all
dependencies and okay what next the next
thing would be required here is to
configure our spring MVC so to convict
of this first of all we have to mention
that we are using spring MVC now how do
we mention that okay so I already have
some cheat sheet with me I would use a
tree trickier okay okay I've got my
cheat sheet so in this WebEx in this
WebEx web dot XML file you have to
mention that you are using spring MVC
and all the requests should navigate to
spring and to do that we have to add a
sublet tiles I will just copy that thing
I already have that thing with me here
and just paste it here so people who
have this drawing this session do click
on the like button so that I will know
your session because people are coming
and going I can see that okay okay why
is not copying from the local repository
because I guess I mean is it just copied
from the local deposit because that was
it was so fast otherwise it would have
taken some time to download this thing
right okay you want me to share my cheat
sheet I will do that okay so you can see
how I have specified that for all the
requests you have to send request to
disperse of it and that's how spring MVC
works right
okay my again my intention here is not
to teach you spring MVC okay my
intention here is to teach you how to
make a project so I am assuming that you
already know spring MVC and if you don't
know that I just go to the channel and
do learn spring MVC okay
so what next so once we once we are
specified that all the requests will go
to dispatch servlet what it will do is
it will okay so whenever you want this
spring MVC we have two arrays my job
folder we don't have a Java is Java
folder here let me get a job folder you
can see we have directly resources what
do I do here is I will say new I will
create a package with the package okay
oh I got a package but a photo I wonder
I want a folder here inside SRC main so
it's a new a folder okay I want to
folder inside main and the for your name
need to be Java because all your down
file should be inside this folder
okay so if it's not that do mention that
okay so question what about github when
you will introduce that later so we'll
talk about github later time when you
are focusing only on a spring MVC we
will see everything staged take a step
by step see I might not go in a sequence
the sequence which we should follow but
then since we are doing it for the first
time we'll do it as we don't we don't
update
okay so okay so what I will do here is I
will say new and I will create a class
and I will say this class as now see
since this is our first codes I will say
index controller there is not composite
to use of control at the end one is
always better to use control at the end
of the controllers okay
don't worry all this issue is getting
recorded okay so we've got our
controller here and if you want to use a
controller we have to use and annotation
to make it a controller and that spring
annotation is add controller annotation
okay and okay why just not getting
imported so I will say control space
okay
should not be a test it should be Conrad
the Disco dot dusk that's what I want
the package name to be so we'll just
replace this I would say click on this
and move to calm dr. Scott tusk I don't
want this earlier package right click
and did it okay so what text here
whether try to okay so let me get a
method here so for to accept all the
requests will go for public voice okay
we'll say public string home that's our
home page right so when you want to use
a request for the home page will show
the home page unfortunately have not
created any GSP yet but if we do that
let me create some jay-z pages here or
that you call index dot JSP
so that man that is my home page so
whenever the user calls for a home page
I will call hello world not will avoid
we say so that will be my home page will
say welcome Hoopa disco Lovings okay and
will also provide our extra positive
feedback page so we say a h left for use
i want to provide a feedback i will do
that later okay let's do that bigger so
we got out we got our index page and
whenever i use a calls for the home page
will return index dot JSP but for which
request you have to pause us so we have
to use our request mapping so we'll say
average request mapping and in here you
have to mention slash so whenever the
user fall for the home page when I say
homepage it means slash so slash
represents home okay well it's a control
space okay so whenever they use
cause for me home bathing you have to
call index dot JSP next very fine is
working and okay let's look here we'll
say run as run on server which is
already or Tomcat server for us let's
click on finish we shut this our okay so
we got the output as welcome to that is
called odd things it's just that we got
the output in the internal browser let's
do that on Firefox okay in fact I will
just copy this I will go to my okay it
should I should I should use the I
should be using Firefox here okay so you
can see I bought welcome you to this
color thing so anyway you say anybody
request for the home page it will call
for it will call for the index dot JSP
so the flow is working now now what I
want is I want one more controller who
will work with suppose this thing ok I
want one more controller who can work
with the feedback page so another quiz
for the feedback page example if I say
feedback dot HTM it should call it
should call feedback dot JSP where a
user will enter details and I don't have
a feedback page now so what I will do
this I will just okay I already
feedback design here so let me okay so
what we do now is okay just hold on guys
okay so I already have my HTML page here
let me just paste that in my web app I
will say paste and you can see we got
feedback 100 HTML I already created
design this is a very simple design here
and if I run this code
okay and I gotta enter here which says
is for watch file not found
okay oh that makes sense Oh
the problem here is now as whenever you
work with spring MVC you have to also
mention one more file which is called as
so in our in our web dot XML file we are
using this thing here right which is we
are mentioning that a separate name is
the disco it will also look for a spring
MBC also look for the disco - sound
letter XML file again we don't have to
create everything from scratch now the
advantage of using STS is you can create
a spring bean configuration file here
and okay you can mention the file name
as the disco - South let dot XML click
on next now the things we need here so
we need beans
we need context and we need MBC nothing
else so we need these three things click
on next and click on finish
just taking some time here by the time
let me take a design which for feedback
tourists um okay if I see the design for
this the designs not visible okay ribbon
and in this you have to mention your
dowel file belongs to which package so
anybody well Chris putting embassy up to
also mention all these things and as the
drawback with spring a busy right you
have to do lots of configuration and
when you use spring boot you don't have
to do lots of quantification here when
you use spring boat and I don't know how
many of you actually joined the session
now if you have just joined this session
do click on the like button so that I
will know that you'll enjoy the session
okay so we'll use okay so I will also
copy this from it from my cheat sheet
instead of typing it so we need to
mention this being tagged okay we can to
type it it's you're popping it you take
lots of time so is a context a
prominence can and you have to mention
the base package the base package is
calm touch telescope bar trust so
information where your controllers are
and you have mentioned the controller
belongs to founder to this code or task
I guess we are good to go now let you
study server once again that you just
write like ganas the non server by these
starting the application of course
okay so if I search for okay just
working now but what about feedback dot
HTML so first of all we have to put
everything inside oh there's a page so I
will close this and I will create a new
Daisy page which is feedback dot JSP
whether I take here and I want a JSP
page blimp is as feedback or Deus be and
let's replace everything with ESP okay
not literally everything but then the
HTML tags so we got our JSP here okay
doctype is repeated here okay sounds
good so if you want to call this
feedback page what you have to do is in
this index controller you have mentioned
so whenever I use a request for feedback
Colosseum so public string feedback so
whenever the user requests for feedback
you've returned feedback dot JSP but
when it we should call it whenever the
request is for the quest wrapping so
whenever the user call for feedback or
STM we have to call feedback or DSP
which one this now let's save resort
which is running or not right lake one
has or non server finish oh you wanted
to increase the font size more if I
agree
it will come out of these screens okay
so for the quiz for feedback dot HTM and
that's our feedback page you see that
we've got a feedback page okay so we got
our name here
okay so let's enter name it is Naveen
and the email address or I will not use
my name I will use someone else name
here I will use Manish when each email
ID would be m @r h finished code comm
website so you're giving feedback for
online sessions any code you can use
online one zero one and then you can
enter a message we'll say good and then
you can click any of the star so this is
the imagine this is one two five okay
this is a faces problem here so we have
not configured CSS yet and this is
that's that's why I won't design from
your side so okay when you click on
submit the data should go for okay the
code should be only number so if I click
on submit Oh
so why this is not perfect
okay so okay so the movie that thing and
so when you click on this up when it
should send a request to the to this
hour right and we have not put it for
that and this is what the coding will be
done
Kony will be done in the next live
session okay this is what you have to do
okay the design which which I was using
is buried by me so you can blame me for
that I am not using your designs yet I'm
not with a design yet so you can you can
create a good design for this something
new with the same fields which we want
here and then you send it to us so
tomorrow we'll be having again live
session I will try to complete the
feedback module yes this is just a
trailer okay yeah I will be doing this
don't worry we cannot do everything in
one day right so we have we are spending
more than one are now this is one a
session I guess so the assignment for
today is you have to okay so you have to
okay so the assignment for today is you
have to complete I mean do the same
thing which I have done and try to okay
so try so do whatever we have done till
now and give me a good design
designed by tomorrow afternoon so that
we can embed that here my planning is
not to use Ajax now but then let's see
how to include that since I am NOT good
with javis that I'm not good with Ajax
you have to help me with this so timing

you enjoyed this session and share this
video with your friends yes pooja class
will be used to save data in your
database we have not get it Oh Joe yet
we have just configured the application
to make it work we have not started with
the actual coding yet okay so this is a
big project okay it will take lots of
time don't be in a hurry so it won't be
