police for learnings and in this video
we'll talk about Tomcat so we'll see how
to download Tomcat how to configure it
how to start a Tomcat so that you can
deploy your web application specifically
Java web applications on your server so
for that first understand which Tomcat
so basically Tomcat is a web container
or you can say a socket container where
you can run your servlets because when
we talk about java application so when
you base when you say our website so it
can be of two types right you can you
can make a static website or again make
a dynamic website so in case if you are
making a static website you have all
HTML files right and to work with HTML
you just require a browser but to work
with dynamic pages where you will
generate the data as to the user request
so in that scenario we require some
server-side programming so for Java we
use something or sublets
so we have a server technology we have
JSP technology and both this thing works
on Tomcat
so if I go to Tomcat so tom care is a
web container of developed by apache
so specifically it is a soffit container
so there it is the latest version of
Tomcat is 9 the stable version is 8 and
we'll we are going to work with 8 now so
first the first step will be have to
download the Tomcat right to do that I
just click on tomcat 8.0 ok then it will
give you some choice so we have a
different setup for different versions
since I am using a Macintosh version I
will be preferring to work with the tag
file okay so we have zip we have targets
go for zip here so if I click on zip it
will download the zip file it will take
some time to download so what I will do
I will just pause the video I will wait
for it to download and once it is
downloaded then I will unzip it and then
we'll show you how to continue with this
first steps so it means pause the video
here so the download is done and we got
the unzip version of my Apache Tomcat so
in this you can see we have lots of
folders I we have been we have a bond
which is configuration then we have live
for libraries so if you open this live
folder we have all the libraries which
are used for use for use by a tomcat
right example if you want to work with
servlet files so we have servlet API
here and then if you want to work with
internationalization we have I 18 and so
we have all the available libraries here
and so we have there are two most two
important folders to quark to to work
with the first one is these this web app
so let's say if you are build a website
of course when you say you are building
a website what we do we build web pages
right and we combine all those web pages
we put those web pages in one folder and
we call it as website right so what we
do we put all this whole all this files
in one folder so that folder will be
here so that you can access this folder
to internet connection right so this is
a folder this is a this is a place this
is this value you will put your folder
your project now we have the next
important folder is pin now bin is the
binary binary folder as you know so we
will be having all the important files
here so you can start your tomcat using
bin you can stop your tomcat using bin
so this is the file we will be using so
we have startup dot PAC which is instead
of dot s H so let's say if you are a
Windows user so you will be using
startup dot back because batch file
works on Windows and if you are a Linux
user so if you are a Linux user a UNIX
user on Macintosh user will be using
startup dot SH and of course for
shutdown for Windows we use should are
not backed and for Linux we use shutdown
dot SH now let's say if you even if you
start it how did it will work so let's
go to your Chrome once again so it may
go back to Chrome it's Co or let me just
use my usual window so I will go back to
this folder so this is my this is the
place that we have downloaded right so I
will type it as
how to access your Tomcat so just type
localhost colon 8080
so if you write 8080 so you can see this
this site cannot be reached because it
is not available since your Tom Kane is
not started so in order to start the
Tomcat we have to go to this folder and
inside this folder bin we have to say
startup dot SH if you are working on
Linux or Macintosh if you are walking on
Windows we just have to say startup how
to do that just open a terminal go back
to download so it says CD downloads
loads okay so I am inside downloads now
and what I will do I just think is the
font size is it possible to increase the
font size not working okay I think we
can submissions okay so we have a font
size here let me make it what 14 I think
that should be visible so it's visible
right so we have increased the font size
and now we have to go inside Tomcat so
we say Apache Tomcat I have two versions
this is try to write on it too and
inside this we have to go into bin
folder now once we are inside the bin
folder let me just clear the screen and
I have to start this Tomcat ROI to start
a tomcat addition to say SH space
startup dot SH if you are a Windows user
just type startup it will work but since
in Macintosh you have to use SH and say
Enter Oh
so we acquire a permission you know
cannot find Catalina which is this so
let's give the permission to this file
okay so sometimes we get the option for
permissions I don't know how to solve
this problem I have never got this
problem earlier so how do that let me
just pause the video let me just give
the permission to it and we'll come back
to that the problem I have the what is
permission now how to provide the
permission so I just have to just have
to say chmod 777 caddy no doubt as such
that was that the permission was missing
this I have mentioned the permission
this will this problem will not arise if
you are using Windows and if you are
using Linux then you have to provide the
permission using chmod so let's go back
to okay so again we have to say SH dot I
such space shut up dot SH and if I
Center
it says Tomcat started right and let's
go back to your web page and say enter
okay so this is this is how you start
apache tomcat right so we are using
version 8.0 point 3 2 so that's that's
how you start the opposite or get now to
shut it down so just simply say a such
space shuttle dot sh
so it has shut down your your top or
tomcat if i defense this page again you
can see we it's not reachable if i get
startup and if i say enter we got this
file here i so that's how you install
you download the tomcat and you start it
right now once the installation is done
you can create a project inside your
folder which is which is what a web app
and you can put a folder here and you
can access the folder with the help of
this page sounds good
things to remember something we can also
look at one more folder here which is
your pond so inside this conf you have
some files one of the file is server.xml
so if you want to change the
configuration of your server that so you
want to change the port number so the
port number I'm working with is H 0 H 0
right
so let's say if H 0 H it is busy with
some other server so let's say you
already have a ramp server which is a
server for PHP so let's say you already
have a ramp server inside your system so
by default even vamps I will use H 0 H 0
port number in that scenario we have to
change the port number for Tomcat so we
have to open with the open where any
software will say this is text by
angular oh I think I don't have the
Apple account sink so let me open this
with watch Xcode I have export here so
to take some time to load scored
and it's a bulky software okay so in
this you can change the port number for
Tomcat so we can go to this and say I
don't want to use a generator I just
want to use h02 because h0h 0h0 is
already booked with vamp server so again
shut down this server restart the server
and this time if I try to access the web
page with 8000 you can see we got the
error because we have changed the port
number and if you mentioned AG right to
enter baccata tomcat right so that's how
you change the port number using a file
which is server dot XML so that's how
you download you install or you start
and you configure your server so that is
from this video and if you have any
doubts in comments so just form ideas
comment section and yeah thanks for some
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
