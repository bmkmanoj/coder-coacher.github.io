about arrays now what is added so just
to explain that what is an array let's
take an example so let's say you have 4
variables and all this variable of same
type which is 8 so let's say we have ABC
and D so we have this four variables and
this four variables will have four
values right so let's say we have four
values which is 1 2 3 4
yeah we go for normal numbers so we have
4 variables in each variable will be
having 1 value right so in a we have 1
in B we have 2 in C we have 3 in DVR for
so since we have these 4 variables in
order to use this variables we can use
the variable name right so let's say you
want to access the value of C so you can
directly say system dot out dot println
and you can mention C right but let's
say you want thousand variables so let's
say you want to maintain lots of data so
I should have taken those thousand
variables what if you can just create a
big variable in which you can have all
these values is it possible now let's
take in this way imagine you have your
you are getting some audio you have some
guest in your house and you want to
serve tea now now when you want to serve
tea let's say you have focused okay and
you want to serve tea so in kitchen you
will make those tea and then in each cup
you will be having tea right now how
will you carry those teacups from your
kitchen to hall so you have multiple
ways you can carry one cup at a time so
you can you will go to your kitchen you
will carry those can you one cup and you
will serve to your guest second cup
carry and sub third cup and then fourth
curve right you have second choice you
can carry two cups in a way since we
have two hands you can can two cups and
the weird ways you can dip your four
fingers into Windows four cups and then
you can carry first and that's not good
right so what we can do is we can simply
whether we can take a tray okay so we
can buy a tray in which you can have
four cups so buy a tray and take out
take out your cups and put those four
cups in that one tray so it should of
carrying four cups you can carry a big
tray so in the example each cup will
have each cup is one variable so let's
say cup one is a
b-2s b and then so on so we have four
cups four variables
ensure that you can take a one big tray
which will be a bigger variable and you
can have these four values perfect so
now that one tray is an added so what is
adding it's about collection of cups
that's what tray right so what is tray
creation of cups or these add a
collection of elements okay so instead
of having four different values create a
one big variable which will have four
values that's one adding now how to
access those values because to access
available see you can simply say C but
how to access the third value of an
array then we have to use some unique
numbers so every value or every element
in your array will be having a unique
number and that number is called as
index numbers and index number starts
with zero okay so for the first element
you have zero for the second element we
have one then third two and goes on okay
so if your size of array is let's say 50
so the last element index will be 49
because since we're starting with zero
so you have to end at 49 good so that is
one dimensional array now let's say you
have one more thing let's say can you
expand this size of an array well so
let's say you buy a tray from four cups
and you can have only four cups right
can you have five cups in a in a tray or
four cups maybe you will overload your
an E and you will get an error which is
dre index out of bound
because you don't have a particular
space so in in programming we can say it
is an ik index out of bounds so when you
are going well you are going ahead of
the damage okay so you have to buy a
different trip for final image you have
to buy a different tray for ten cups you
have to buy different tray for 50 cups
so once you buy a tray that will be the
size of the tray will be fixed how you
can have a 4 cup tray in which you can
have 2 cups but you cannot have a 4 cup
trade to have 8 cups because it will
overload on your you know it will what
you say it will all flow to be specific
so now in your house you will be having
multiple trays so you'll be having a
tray for two cups will be having a tray
for four cups will be having her tray
for eight cups now you have around 20
guests in your house and you don't have
any trade to carry 20 cups right so what
you will do you will take this biggest
train which is dead-set 10 cups then you
have a secondary pitches of eight cups
third row you have a four cups so I can
take your eight tray cup or ten credit
curve and you can put ten cups about
that tray you can have one more tray you
can have four cups about that you have
one more play for two cups and then goes
on so when you have multiple trays so
let's say when you have multiple cups in
one plate is one added but if you have
multiple trays and you have multiple
cups in multiple tray and one play and
you have multiple trays so that will be
array of tray
okay so we'll be having lots of praise
so let us cut that is called as
two-dimensional array okay so let's say
you want to access now the third third
cup of fifth the tray how many trays we
have let's say four trays you want to
access the third cup of thought train
say optimation I want to access the
third tray that your row number and then
you have to access the third cup that is
second column or which is two index
number two right so you have to say -
comma - that's your third cup so I throw
a tree and hello your third - and third
cup right so that is your any of adding
so if you have trays of same size and
force so you have four trays and each
tray will have four cups so that is your
two-dimensional array but it's a you
don't have tray of same size you have
tray of different different size so that
tree will be called as Jagd
added rug and it will be called as Jagd
adding so how to implement all this
thing you have in theory so index -
sub-second toodles we talked about how
to implement one one-dimensional array
two dimensional array in three
dimensional array okay so it is adding
it's a train so thanks for watching and
