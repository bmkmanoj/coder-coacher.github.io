without using third variable now what's
the problem of using third variable so
let's say if we talk about end so in
takes two bytes in c plus c programming
so two bytes two bytes and even for this
temp variable we require two bytes right
so in total we are using six bytes what
if if you can just remove this temp
variable so we can we can save that two
bytes again you will say what's that you
know was a big big deal with two bytes
you know when you talk about embedded
software as when I talk about cloud
servers going to talk about mobile
applications one bit matters and two
bytes is equal to 16 bits and also if we
can store one byte also so we should do
it but how to do that how to save that
two bytes so what we can simply do a
session of using that temp operation we
can use this formula which is it which
is a equal to a plus B then V is equal
to a minus B and then a is equal to a
minus B okay so if you if you perform
this operation it will swap your numbers
without using third variable and you can
see we are swapping the values so how it
works again it works with the plus
operator it works with the
multiplication operator and division
operator so you can use anything you
want so the multiplication or division
so if I run this again we set up your
numbers so we can use both we can use
multiplication or division
multiplication division or addition and
subtraction okay but it's time in focus
on subtraction because to just to
understand it properly so when you say a
equal to a plus B so the new value of a
will be 5 plus 6 which is 11 here the
the value of a is 11 11 minus 6 is 5 so
the new value for B is 5 the value for a
is still 11 the new value for B is 5 so
11 minus 5 is 6 so new value for B will
be 5 and a will be 6 right so that's how
you can swap two numbers without using
third variable but
there's still up catch straight up all
of you
the problem is the advantage in this
example is we are saving two bytes right
but still we are wasting one bit now you
will say how the binary format of 11 or
the binary format of 5 let's say we are
talking about the binary format of 5 is
1 0 1 the binary format of 6 is 1 1 0 so
the binary format of 5 is 1 0 1 and 1
easy for my top 6 is 1 1 0
okay what about 11 the binary format for
11 is well it was the one format of 11
it's 1 0 1 1 does the body format for
11th right now if you talk about 5 it's
3 bits 6 is 3 bits and certainly for
this operation we are consuming 4 bits
that means we are wasting one bit okay
so how to say that one bit so that is
possible if you can use something called
as a caret symbol now this caret symbol
represents our XOR operation so this is
your this is X or operation so what is X
or so XR is same like or gate and and
gate differences in X or if both the
values are same it will give you 0 and
if both the values are different it will
give you 1 so if both the values are
same it will give you 0 if both the
values are different it will give you 1
so that's how XOR operation works so if
you implement this here so what is a a
is 5 so 5 is 1 0 1
we are xor xor with 1 1 1 0 that is 6
right so the resultant output will be 1
and 1 is 1 0 and 1 will be 1 and 1 and 0
will be 1
right oh we are miss something one and
zero is not one it is zero
sorry for the mistake this one and one
is zero right now what next the next
value will be next operation the value
of B is still one one zero this will be
X or with the value of B sorry this is
what's happening you sorry it's sorry
for the mistake again okay and this is
one one zero
now the resultant output will be so your
a value is 0 1 1 and B value is 1 1 0 so
let's apply the operation this is 1 and
0 it will give you 1 then we have 1 and
1 this will give you 0 and this is 1 and
0 this will give you 1 so the new value
for B is 1 0 1 what about a again so the
initial value for a is 0 1 1 XOR width B
new value so be any value is 1 0 1 and
let's perform the operation so it is 0
and 1 it will give you 1 it is 1 and 0
it will give you 1 and this is 1 and 1
which will give you 0 so if you can
convert this into binary format or
decimal format it will give you 5 and
these are decimal format for this is 6
so see the values value for B is 5 and
value for a is 6 simple and I feel on
this your number is swept without even
wasting a single bit simple so that's it
