pattern which is a box structure here
now let's focus on the next pattern so
in the next part and what we'll do is
let me move the whole part and the next
part in you want to make is this one so
we want to plane star star star star you
know the what you say in a triangle
format so to say star star and star star
star so we want to print this pattern
which is a right-angled triangle so in
order to do this what happens if I
remove this if condition here so if I
remove if else so this was the code we
have done for the earlier pattern and
now if I run this you can see we are
able to print the whole box right so
what we can simply do here so instead of
printing the whole box so since we want
to print four rows and only one column
per row so for the first row we want to
print only one column second row two
columns third row three columns and
fourth row four columns so that means
your column number is depend upon your
lower number so this I here is counting
the number of rows and J is counting
number of columns I so what if I remove
this 4 and make it I so if any way your
I value is one which is before the first
row your J will start with 1 it will end
at 1 when your I will increment it will
become 2 so your J will start with 1
your J will end at 2 so it will plane
two stars when your I becomes 3 your J
will start with 1 and it will end at 3
so it will plane three stars and so on
and now if we run this code you're
creating this triangle shape of pattern
cool so that's it from this video in the
next part we'll be making a new pattern
in which we will be printing something
in this way so we'll write a four
triangle so the mirror image of this
pattern okay so it should be it should
look something like this
cool so this is what we have done now
this will be doing in the next video so
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
