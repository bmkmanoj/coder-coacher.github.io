okay stream is perfect but knowing is
watching this is getting recorded this
will be offline people to watch
idea i've done
ok so here we are streaming live but no
one is watching yet two people are
watching I guess one of one of the
machine is my machine here and the
second we were so you can just come in I
if anyone is watching ok so i think we
can start audio swap all right ok
perfect ok so let me just pick up some
questions from youtube first so before
answering your questions i guess two
people are watching now yeah so it is we
note or ok so we are we have at least
one person watching this we note ok
that's great
okay so
why this Jaden is not that powerful
oh we also have jitendra here ok so
himanshu welcome back I just got your
message on whatsapp why have ye have not
started yet and we started the streaming
at exactly five thirty and you're late
ok so let's answer the first question
from we know what should I want to learn
to become an Android developer that's a
very good question what you have to
learn to be a nun developer ok I guess
we have already done a video on that
what it needs to be an under developer
you have to sacrifice your life to be an
Android developer yo that's a joke so
what you can do is you can start with
you need some technology to be well
versed the first thing you need is XML
and the second thing you need is Java
again there are different types of apps
are available in the market now so we
have the first type we have or let me
check my streming August remain going
good so the first type of thing is
native apps and then we have android
apps so basically we have two different
types of apps native and android so if
you are focusing on so if you are
focusing on Android native app you have
to learn java and xml both you need xml
because you need to design the app using
xml and you need java because you want
to develop right so when you want to
development you have to go for java okay
so all the logical processing and all
the stuff the programming stuff will be
done using java and xml is for designing
ok but if you are thinking about the
need of the hybrid apps example if you
want to make make an app which works on
which works on android which works on
iOS which works on Windows you can go
for hybrid app frameworks which is
phonegap or ionic framework so they use
this JavaScript to work with so so if
you're thinking about if you're thinking
about hybrid apps JavaScript if you're
thinking about native apps like we have
lots of apps on Android Play Store I
would I will suggest
go for a Java so first learn java
completely omit the complete coach our
concepts because when you do when you
when you make an appt you need lots of
logical processing right so of course
you require the Java not is there and
for designing p into XML and you will
find both this video's on on my channel
I have Java videos plus i have XML
videos even I do have some Android
videos okay not everything but I do have
some videos okay so that's that's your
answer be note i hope that that's that's
helpful okay next question is from
himanshu i have read that head first
java now okay you have done with that
what next your videos has some different
topics on java but i don't know where to
start okay so okay just hold on
okay so you have so you have already
done with head first java right and then
i have lots of videos on java so which
one to start with so i would suggest
that you start with the so if you watch
the complete playlist in fact i have 173
videos in the playlist okay of java so
it starts with the core java promises
then we will talk to be talked we talked
about oops concept and later on we
talked about exception threads java 8
topics and then once you have done
everything after that you can talk we
can start with the advanced part which
is servlet and JSP okay those are things
which are required okay and yeah so we
can you can search for the sublet videos
of mine on YouTube it's there okay but
again I don't have the complete list of
it so these are this is an amazing
channel called as Java brains you can go
there for the advanced part but still if
you love my videos you can do that and
there's one more thing i also have
uploaded or spring framework video so
spring framework is a new phone book in
in java technology so you can you can
learn that also this dot net it's not
that new but everyone is using spring
framework now okay so in fact i also got
some questions on facebook and the video
which i have uploaded you know in the
morning it was shooted using it was
rooted in my home and you can that's why
you can see the background all the stuff
that's ok ok so
let me just check the comment
okay till the time i'm getting the next
comment okay with that okay so there's a
question from the shop saying this
kosher is on this question is down the
video of collection and generics it says
so many say that data structure is must
data structure is must and so my
question is collection is enough to
solve all the intersection problem not
exactly why every company needs you to
learn data structure is because data
structure teaches you how the data is
getting stored in your computer you know
when you talk about we talk about your
when you talk about your computer we
store lots of data right and all this
data stored in a different you can
format it maybe you want to sit you want
to store data to fetch it past you want
to store data to process it fast so
dippin up all the different requirement
we have different type of data structure
so depend upon your data this data
structure changes right so if you know
the concept of data structure you can
actually work on some you know some good
what you can say you can actually make
some software which can work faster okay
that's one logic the second logic is
interview or they want to test your
skills and the way they test your skills
is by asking you data structure concepts
because if you know data structure
concept that means you know lots of
things right so that's that that's the
main logic so if you're personally since
you can learn collection AP I am in the
collection part in Java will it cover
all the data structures and the answer
is no it will not cover all data
structure but it will cover the concepts
like the air is it will point it will
cover the concept of stack linked list
then what we have here we have all the
stuff but if you want to learn data
structure thoroughly I will suggest to
refer the book or you can refer the
videos online on YouTube or data
structure using see ok not using Java
because if you use Java in data
structure it is very easy to learn to
work with to understand the complete
theory of data structure i will suggest
you to go with C programming
okay okay that's one okay meanwhile I
got lots of questions here let me answer
this questions now okay so there's a
question from Gendun hi sir can you make
tutorials about fragments and how to use
multiple okay you're talking about
multiple segments so this this is just
okay so i started with android tutorials
okay i started with all the videos but
unfortunately my schedule is very very
very busy now so from July again I'm
going for a corporate bank so I'm not I
don't have much time to make videos now
okay so you might not find any of the
new video in android okay because it
takes time you know if you're thinking
that it will you know it's just it just
take 10 minutes or 15 years to make our
videos not that ok takes around one are
to make one video maybe two hours depend
upon how much editing have to do the
concept that have to be ready with the
example this engine is not something
which i am i'm very flexible with okay
if we talk about java concepts i am very
much flexible but if we talk about
android i'm not that good with android
am but you can say i am the big nerd in
android so it takes time for me also to
work with android to make examples and
then upload then doing the editing part
and all those love it takes lots of time
so you might not find any new video but
then why my videos are helpful you know
before my videos there were lots of
videos are available on YouTube again
from famous famous youtubers but the
problem is some people like my videos
they want to learn basics from me so
what I have done I have uploaded all the
basic videos if you want to learn
advanced part you can switch other
channel and you can learn android there
ok so at least i have covered all the
basic concert which are required except
the fragment part
okay so we know I have 180 cannot
resolve art ok so you have to make sure
that you have what was that entering put
the package somewhere else to do but we
don't do it normally right you have to
do it so I got an update from my i also
got a comment there yeah so I got the
answer from my android developer she
says you have to you you have to input a
class colors are a governor why package
our package of class package ok I think
yeah just mail me the question i will
just reply you on the mail so or you can
just type it they just type in there to
the account so we'll be getting the
answer in the comment section so tapping
is all right
ok so the package you have to input is
comp dot java dot class that's weird ok
let me answer your question later ok for
mobile UI wants the best software oh
that's that's okay so we know let me
just confirm you am NOT on Android
developers ok I just do it as my hobby
okay I'm not that good with Android so I
don't know how to design it even if if
we talk about my android app it is the
disco so what I have done is I have
designers here who have designed it and
you know I normally work on the back end
the Java part of it so I don't know
which software you have to work with you
have to use for designing
okay next question is from mahesh is
complete learn of Java is useful yes if
you want to be an application developer
you it you need to know all the basics
of java impaired in fact the coach our
concepts okay yeah we should know about
you should know about collections is to
know about exception threads jdbc ok so
now all those concepts okay so
okay so next question is from rohit
meaning of static keyword i have a video
on that right go ahead so if you're
talking about static keyword in c
programming we use static keyword in C
for what before making the variable
constant example if you want to run the
same called multiple times you can you
can make the variable static or so
that'sthat's they're not constant but if
you want to you know if you run multiple
times and if you still want the same
output you can use static keyword in C
but in Java if you want to share the
variable with multiple objects okay
example when you create int I in Java it
instance instance variable right so
every object will have its own value so
let's say I have the object called as
what i have a class called a scar and if
i create the object of car and we have a
variable called as fuel and if you have
five objects or five cars every car will
have a different fuel level right but if
we make it static every class every
every object will share the same data so
if you want to share data between the
objects we have to use static keyword
okay there's a question from jatinder
again that was your first course okay
jitendra your question is I'm okay in
Java now but I'm not able to solve
problems on top coders now like
topwaters more than quote chef and other
community of programming sighs give me
suggestions okay when we talk about the
competitive sites you know you have to
so basically what you have to do is you
have to start with the basics again when
you talk about competitive exams and
copy to test they will have some
questions which is difficult okay so you
have to start with base so search for
the question search for the event where
you're starting with very easy okay so
agassa websites like hacker rank then we
have code chef we also have topcoder as
you mentioned so what happens is this
website of course will have difficult
questions so you have to start with the
basics you have to start with the basics
I mean there will be some easy questions
first solve that get the confidence and
then start with the difficult questions
okay
but eventually you can do it and also
finally start making an app or any
software for that matter you know you
can you can make any app you want
doesn't matter yeah so there's a
question from some deep so what donate
can do we can do the same purpose and
you get you some questions and leave it
says dotnet can do can we do the same
purpose yes you can do everything in
Java which you can do in dotnet okay
except i guess the agile platform which
is the cloud platform flow for.net i
don't think they support java but
normally everything supports and I mean
everything can be done using Java
everything in fact okay there's a
question from the page I'm looking for
the job not in pune oh sorry okay i'm
looking for a job not in pure coding but
where i use whatever I learned in MCO
curriculum as as well as to interact
with more people yeah so yeah so I would
suggest you to go for tech support if
you want to interact the people or you
can go in to be a which is business
analyst okay it's a good place to work
so business analyst you have to get the
requirement of the clines and all the
stuff example if you if you get a coke
companies like coca-cola and for that
company you have to analyze the
requirements you have to analyze what
which software will help them all the
stuff so you can go for the tech support
or ba you can also go for QA you can go
for testing ok so but if you want to
intellect the people i would suggest go
for a business analyst field ok be a
business analyst
okay go ahead i have watched your videos
instead of keyword but i need some
simple explanation i have tend to forgot
this many at times okay so staticy well
again so let's say if you are working
with it's going this way whenever you
want a variable and you don't want to
create an object of a variable you can
use static okay that's one second if you
want to share the same variable the same
data with multiple objects you can use
static keyword example let's say if you
have five iphones and then one of the
iphone got a break in this screen okay
the screen is broke what you can do is
only one phone is affected right not
everyone is affected because only one
screen is black but let's say if all the
five phones they're using the same thing
card okay let's say everyone is using
one up on and now if there is up any
problem in the water font server okay it
will affect on all the mobile phones so
what're phone the sim card becomes a
static variable now because it is
affecting all the objects okay so that's
the example I can give you life okay but
again you can watch that video to get
the more understanding of it okay so the
next question from Vinod I'm saying some
people are coding by copy-pasted source
code yeah that's that's what you do you
know in software development fifty
percent ask you do papi paste okay other
things you have to customize button
maxim thing you do population example if
you want to create login form there's
already built login code you can just
copy it and paste it in a software let's
say you want to create a maybe what you
want else what you want us maybe you if
you want some YouTube stats you can get
the source code from the google and
paste regionals in your project in fact
this is what we have to approach in our
project example we wanted api youtube
api we have copy paste the code in the
app it's working so if you think that
copy pasting works the problem is copy
copying and pasting is very easy but
what to copy and where to place that's
difficult
okay so yeah so everything is done copy
paste but you should know what to copy
and what not to copy right okay today
today we have a different set up here
the thing is in my office we don't have
an AC so you can see a AC duct there
it's not working ok so we are using a
cooler if you can see if you can show
that so we are using a simple cooler to
cook to cool the room and that's why I
guess you can listen you can hear that
sound of food that sound weird sound and
you know my interns are sitting around
me and they're saying not to show their
faces okay so okay so that's your sort
of maximum time you have maximum time to
copy paste the source code okay but
thick you want the explanation for can
you explain the use of public static
void main see it's very simple you just
have to you know when you talk about any
execution maybe c programming C++ or
Java so normally okay shoulder
okay I still lost it where's the
question
I lost your question the main function
right here so what happens is in the
main function so main act as a starting
point right when you're working with C
C++ or Java main act as a starting point
of the code ok so in Java if you want to
call main first thing you require is a
return type that you're leavin type is
void because we don't want to eat
anything next to call a method we need
object right and since to call a main
method we need object and main is a
studying point right so you cannot you
cannot call mean without object and you
cannot create object without paint so we
have a deadlock here so to solve that
deadlock we use we use static keyword
which means you don't need an object to
call me and we make it public because
you know we were we can we should be
able to call we should be able to call
mean so many any place so in fact I have
a video on that you can just search for
the second video in the playlist or
second order to I don't remember but I
have talked about publish it avoids main
in detail there ok so there's a please
answer from Iman should too vinod you
can on your hood but when you will start
making appt you are so stack overflow is
one of the best website where you will
get the source code ok ok so praveen is
it false the question from Praveen I so
is it possible for me to get a job in
facebook because I have recently done my
diploma can you please guide me oh you
want a job in facebook that's a very big
thing it's not impossible ok getting our
job and Facebook is not impossible but
it's bit difficult because Facebook
company like Facebook Google all this
big giant company what they do is they
they are very choosy for their employees
if we talk about company like Indian
companies infosys TCS the high-end bulk
ok doesn't matter how much programming
you know ok doesn't matter how much
programming you know
yeah so just that was my interns and he
we don't want to show his face show me
your show me your face here okay that's
that's my intern his disturbing me okay
where was I yeah so this big companies
they are very choosy for their employees
so come the Indian companies what they
do they hiring but because they want to
show how many employees in that they
have how many employees they have in
their company but you know a Facebook
Google they have limited employees they
have limited employees and every
employee is brilliant so it is it
becomes very choosy to you know when you
talk about employees so I would suggest
you have to improve your skills a lot
especially data structures okay see for
them which language you know does not
matter for them what matters is the
basic concepts the basic concepts like
data structures databases and what else
so data structure database and maybe
motive or tells the networking part okay
most important IP this data structure
knowledge okay and the OS concept how OS
works on all the stuff
okay so happy is the question is it for
my turn off of me I don't look that
shadowkhan okay bye anyway so maybe for
my intern you look like a shot of car
you know okay so let me go back to next
question so I come to work for facebook
make sure your basic concepts are damn
clear okay and Facebook don't use Java
so no use of learning java friend to go
for facebook okay Sri no hi Sri no we
met in the morning and then again in
this session hi ok ok so we know ok ok
so this again a point from jitender also
sir I was really thankful if you can
provide lots of programming exercise for
each video in fact I was thinking about
that i was i was thinking about that i
was thinking about creating the exercise
for each video that's what that's why i
have created the website but the problem
is i don't know why but you know I've
got am suddenly I got so much busy with
the work I'm not able to do anything for
my website he when I'm not helping my
interns to any in there if they are
getting stuck in the in any of the code
I'm not helping them ok you can talk to
them and they will say their problem I'm
not even helping them now because I
don't know why I am stuck without other
work so maybe in future I will do that
from October I'm again getting free so
maybe from in october or September i
will do that predict android studio is
best for android yes it is best for
android
himanshu suggestion you have other
interns for Android developers yeah I do
have in terms but they're not good with
teaching okay they are very good with
Android but they are not good with
teaching I feel they can teach but they
don't feel they can teach okay in fact I
you know have told them that you should
I told them that you should you should
learn teaching but they're you know they
don't want teaching they want to make
projects so unfortunately they will not
do anything for that ashish sharma hi
sir please explain when we should go for
instance block okay then we should go
for instance block and the answer is
never okay I mean why to use instance
block ever in fact in my career of five
years I have never used an instance
instance block we do have a concert to
write we normally use constructed to to
do that task okay next appt lithic can
you please explain your we have done
that right okay krrish you have
commented up question the morning okay a
very big question right place okay okay
there's a question from you okay so you
have done your B Tech and I guess you
have a gap for two years right like the
first of all or even if you go even if
you got a gap in your education between
your education and job that's okay okay
maybe you cannot join big companies but
you can join smoke up you know if you
can you can join a start-up they don't
they don't care about your gap they only
care about your knowledge okay if you're
good with Java joint startup or small
company where you can show your skills
of course you will get you not get paid
much but that's okay your point is you
want to show this fake certificate first
of all you have mentioned your name in
the video next time on saying your
question about fakes a fake experience
if let's imagine if you're joining a
company and there and there a chart I
know if unfortunately if he's watching
my videos he knows about your fake
experience
okay but i would suggest don't go for
fake experience the thing is
interviewers are very smart okay they
know if you are giving fake experience
they will know that you are picking
because the interview in the as a
fresher is bit different from the
interview as experienced as a fresher
they will ask your basic questions but
if your experience if you're saying your
experience then if they will ask you
about your projects okay what you have
done in two years okay and that question
will screw you I mean tell me what you
learned so if I'm interviewing if I ask
you what you have done in that two years
tell me tell me explain about anyone
project and again you can fake it right
you can say we have done this we have
done that but we know when you make a
project where you will get stuck and
then we will ask I will ask you that
question which you cannot answer if you
are faking it so make sure you don't
fake it so my suggestion is learn java
get satisfied okay give or 0 so JP which
is all echo certification and then
search for a company and for sure they
will hire you fear if you have good
skills so therefore there's a question
from Moorhead my question is if we make
package and make deep private class then
what is the use of those classes I mean
why do you why do you even create a
private class in fact we cannot do that
we cannot make a class private input in
java now you can make it in a class
private but you cannot make the outer
glass private that's not possible no
heat isn't an alternative for go-to
statement oh yes we do have label we do
have label in Java so if you can in one
of the video have talked about labels
with break so search for the video with
break and label so that's the option
that's the that's the what you say the
alternative of go-to statement
mahesh for graphics if you're talking
about the app I don't know if you're
talking about mobile app or desktop app
for dekstop we have to use Java FX FX ok
and for Android app I don't know what do
you have to use for graphics animations
we have animation package ok so we do
have animation in android I don't know
how to do it but we do have ok which
book ok so for java certification i will
suggested to go for ocjp a certification
book from Kathy Sarah ok just search for
Katty Kay a phy ocjp you will get the
book okay as in C++ yeah you can use
that break any questions you can ask
life ok so there's a question there's a
point from biswajit be so gto from
bengal right you are genius you deserve
more subscribe but that's what I'm
saying I deserve more subscribers you
know so for that you have to share my
videos with your friends talk about meet
with your friends and ask them to
subscribe that's how you do it because I
do think I deserve more subscribers even
I think I keys are more subscribers you
think these ideas are more subscribers
yeah that's a background background
sound so even I think I desire more
subscribers of share with your friends
ok kosher how to become good performance
although I want to solve problems like a
cockroach ok to do you know
to be a good problem solver you have to
learn how to solve problems okay so
start with basics you know that's why
you that's why people teach you about
you know when you join our College we
start with palindrome we start with the
prime number although stuff why we do
that it's because but why we do that
because we want to increase the problem
solving things right so make sure you
solve the basic thing prime number
Victorian all the stuff so does the
first time that's the baby steps ok the
next step would be some big equation
data structures or sorting algorithms
create your own algorithm and try to
solve it or maybe there will be some
algorithms on internet don't get the
source code get the algorithm and try to
code it ok and then later on try to use
hacker up because heckle also they start
them the basics ok or you can try hacker
drank which is hiker and rin k which is
easier than hacker earth I feel so you
can just go to hackers rank and go
step-by-step there ok so there's a
question from David tiwari still
developers are not using jaw it features
like lambda expression yes they are not
using it is because company is still
using companies are still using Java 7
they feel Java 7 is most stable java 8
is getting used in data processing thing
example big data hadoop in fact an
android we use java 8 now but not every
company is using java 8 but soon maybe
one or two years everyone will start
using to a lambda expression because it
is something very new to java that's why
ok so again this a question from
biswajit my question is what kind of
preparation i need to get a job for the
campus again the same thing you have to
be very thorough with data structure
concepts the OS concepts was concepts
like you have what you have
synchronization beijing pagination all
the stuff so be clear with your basic
concepts ok even if you don't know any
language that's ok c programming will do
there is no compulsion that you should
know java to get a job but you should
know all the basic concepts java gives
you an added advantage you know it's
like complimentary pack something
advanced a big make sure you your coach
of concepts are clear okay
I guess I lost all the questions okay
jitender I'm doing machine learning now
for a long time now I'm really good at
it I just love machine learning and a
either please guide me okay you mean I
don't know where you can implement
machine learning but you know today
itself I've watched a video on virtual
reality so maybe you can implement your
concepts there because in future in five
years virtual reality devices will be
everywhere I hope you know about the
Google card so we'll be having those
devices everywhere in next two years for
sure in fact lots of mobile devices now
we have Samsung s7 which gives you watch
agave TDI device then we have lenovo
which one is that we know k for which
which gives you the virtual device so
you can make some apps for that which
works on machine learning right maybe
you can implement your logic your
concepts there yeah my aliens don't want
to show their faces I don't know why in
fact they are very good looking people
here one of them is shut up Connie you
want to show your face okay what about
you Ashwini okay happy are what you what
do you have on your head I don't have
anything on my head is that I guess the
light righty deflection I have a light
there with just a reflection you know
nothing there nothing okay nothing is
there okay next amit verma please tell
me how to take the values of a radio
button okay now you're you're going wait
technical ok this is see this life is
not very techincal ok don't expect I
will give you some Java two questions
here ok now I'm not going to give you
job on socio okay this is just for your
career guidance and all the stuff
okay it stills to see still a value yes
yes it's still if you if you know see
you can make robotic softwares you know
if we talk about embedded software
examples maybe if we talk about the AC
and if you have to control your AC
automatically you can use C programming
is to make those apps okay so what you
think what about this emitted software's
AC car they are using Java and the
answer is no they are not using Java
they are using c programming and what
about compiler designs and all the stuff
they still use C programming ok compiler
designing was their studio c programming
can you make android apps using see no
we cannot make ended up seizing see you
look like shut up con you're talking
about me or my interns that pic clear ok
talking about me is this guy right ok
ok so is class variable an object of a
class similar thing no class variables
mean static variable so if you say
static int I that's class variable but
when you create an object of a class it
is object it's not a class it's not our
class variable it's an object but if you
make a static object it becomes a class
variable that's weird right the two
different concepts will tape which
language to start with I would always
suggest you to go with C programming c
is like a starting point you can also
start with Python there is no harm in
that you can start with Python OC but if
you want to buy jordan up i would
suggest you to go with C C++ and Java ok
so the same question was asked by my
intern
which language should i learn okay so
Praveen okay so your java is not using
facebook so what you can do is you can
learn PHP facebook has their own
language called as hat which is H ACK
you can learn that to work for facebook
Calypso Java is good to start or see you
can learn java directly but you know
there will be some problem so start to
see which will be very easier you can
take my the feedback from my intern he
has not learned see you done with see I
mean oh hi Penelope so you know basics
of C so i would suggest you can start
with c then c plus percent go for java
don't I get a jump on Java you can get
that's not the issue but you will find
the concept be difficult though one hi
naveen sir the great respect from Nepal
or that's awesome even people from Nepal
it they are watching me that's awesome
you are making me genius java developer
is it ok so I I you know I deserve for
15 subscribers from Nepal ah ok
question from Sonali what is your
opinion about our HC as a are those
certificate helpful in India so
basically RH is without certifications
ok so you can be a system architect if
i'm not wrong as a is and c is a
certified engineer not sure but if you
are if you are doing that had
certification yes it is very helpful so
if you want to be a server engineer you
want to manage the that service example
i hosted my website on open ship which
is a red hat product ok let's say in
future if my company expands ok then I
will surely hire a red hat engineer that
must be you ok so there is a lot of
demand for it at engineers in India ok
so we need more usher says he needs more
you need more videos on jdbc how many
videos you want more I have a separate
six or seven videos you want to do PhD
in the jdbc awards
more videos on collection framework okay
again in October maybe subtable october
i will add more videos now and maybe
this is my last q s session so the QA
session i don't know if i will try to
make more q sessions but I don't know
not sure I was getting lots of questions
on Facebook and YouTube varies your
YouTube various your life session that's
why I'm doing this now you want to good
depollier Sweeney okay next question is
can we use static modifier interface no
you cannot use we can use static
keyboard we can you begin you static
methods inside interface but we cannot
make interface static okay recently I
got placed so they gave me program as a
combination of JTB centralization clean
work no this is not the place to work
with Java code so no you're right i am
in Bingol doing electronics and
communication that's great vishwajeet
damn the aliens get up in there
glad I started swimming started
go go far apart swimming shut it sorry
cuz the problem was with with the my
device so i am using this phone okay
which is geo so i am using this internet
and unfortunately the charging is over
so i'm using a different Wi-Fi now you
are going to geo home hiding min device
we have 2g what u.s. is my office
okay so i hope i am swimming good there
15 people watching i lost all my
subscribers unfortunately so bad so bad
so bad
I just just two minutes guys so let me
just do all the D congregation of
everything ok yeah I went offline
unfortunately 20 people are watching or
that's that's good people are back I got
1 dislike that's awesome ok so what are
the last question was just going about
so there's a question from Sun sheet can
I go for Android after C and C++ or Java
I mean how can you make ended up using C
and C++ not possible right so you have
to go for if you have to go for iOS you
can go for c programming which is object
you see okay you can do that but not for
Android you have to learn java you don't
have a choice okay local and instance
variables what are the basic concepts
you should know if you don't know Java
the basic concepts of the syntax of Java
for loops while loop variables and oops
concept if you know this that means you
know basic java so thanks for the
lecture can you suggest me best ide for
java developer with best version the
best ide available now is IntelliJ it's
IntelliJ okay again you can go for that
or you can also use watch eclipse which
is which i am using so i use eclipse
okay the best version for eclipse would
be you can go for the clips mass okay
mass or math is stable you can also use
the latest version which is neon but
it's not stable go for mass Oh point two
five four point five point two eclipses
version next version from kusal and
record it most of them solve problems in
cm c++ eyebrows many profile they are
okay the problem is
hiker earth is not checking your
programming skills they are checking
your problem-solving skills and problem
solving skills can be achieved with the
help of C and C++ also right so if you
are going for java then they will get
less less people if you are going for c
and c++ everyone knows see right so
that's why they go with C and C++
because hacker earth is not focused on
programming skills they're focused on
problem problem analytical skills soco
there's a point from dining thank you
sir I I don't know maybe maybe have
pronounced your pronounce your name
wrongly but thank you sir i learned java
in a month which I could not in four
years of engineering that's awesome
that's what motivates me to make more
videos ok sir is engineering better
option than BSC ok ok so it depends upon
what type of job you want to do so if
you want to go for big companies go for
engineering go don't go for be a CIT or
BSC comp science because engineering
will get confirmed job compared to bsit
people obviously comp science but if you
want to explore more in programming i
would suggest have intern who have done
calm science these are look at this auto
 person ok so i would suggest you go
for engineering ok but yeah so but if
you want to be entrepreneurial want to
be good at programming calm science will
give you time to learn programming
engineering you will not get time so
that's why calm science people are good
at programming competitor engineers so
it's your choice ok amazing videos your
question why don't you use your names
why you use your channel names like we
have hush who's 10 name is tech therapy
then we have amazing videos I don't know
your name now again ebay so PHP or JSP
depend upon what you want to do you can
talk join a big company always go for
Java but if you want to create your own
website i will suggest PHP it is easy to
make PS we have such compared to java
web sites
archers be since we sincerely need more
videos I would I will try to do that but
currently I am damn busy with my work so
don't expect more videos like how much
noise is necessary for fisher developer
i would suggest for freshers threads may
be the last topic would be threads to
know so basic concepts oops file
handling then threads ok next from next
question is from Sri know what is the
best language to learn for kids python
python is basic to learn ok
what you can do in two weeks to set for
the base watch my videos watch my first
60 videos you will learn the basic
concept of Java ok please don't say last
q s session okay I'm not saying that but
practically it is okay what a watch a
movie I'm tired last 10 minutes now
people use a C C++ reckoners
the next q s session will be very soon
in frog in next five months don't worry
yeah I will try to make more apps for
more videos live session but I don't
maybe 15 minutes live session max you
know this lecture is almost now 1 R 1
hour right it's almost 1am 53 minutes
okay yes trimming is good 18 oz
how to expertise any programming
language the best way to expertise any
programming language is to each eat it
you know just digest all the basic
concepts and make apps the more make the
more apps you make the more experienced
we will get in the language you have a
question can I just mail you the
question right now we'll be able to
answer that okay so it just made me the
question let me check if there if I can
answer those questions I learn secrets
perfect but unable to attempt the heck
of wine then solves solve simple
questions son sheet
okay ostrich your videos did help me in
cracking java happy to test that's
awesome even I can crack java test now
then okay I can I should I should give
some introduce now right okay
after learning sitterly I found gold as
dead easy yeah so once you learn to see
it's basically on kochava can I learn
yeah you can learn C++ side us side by
side you're learning java but again you
know you will be getting very confused
then because some concepts in C++
different from Java so you will get
confused okay okay you have your exams
tomorrow and then you are still watching
my video that's awesome that's awesome
you dummy free calls they are good some
goes on some course are good not
everything which book you can search for
c programming for c program you can use
this just want kinetica book if you to
learn or you can use the c programming
boot book from dennis ritchie himself ok
does does up good books to learn c which
is your meal my malaria is navin
twenty20 its nav I n ready re W by 20 i
dinnae gmail com
for some DP off you're struggling in
bangla to get a job get certified ok get
java certified you will get a job that
easily ok yes it's always a good
decision to switch to development neeraj
he is working for last three years in
Red Hat Linux so don't be a developer
but you can be a Hadoop developer not
javed up about Hadoop developer you can
learn big data that's a booming booming
field now so I can go 4head you ok even
Sandeep I got that link of learn Hadoop
foundation for 500 rupees I feel it's
not it will not dad it will not be that
helpful but you can try why is not a big
amount right you can try at least you
