remains which is the best language so in
this video we'll talk about which is the
best language for you
so welcome back aliens this is I've
entered different values for learnings
and let's continue the topic which is
the best language and the answer is none
of them are perfect language so when you
say it is best for something or when you
choose a language is the best language
which we do that because of specific
requirements you know so if you are
going for mobile development let's say
if you want to be a mobile developer we
have to choice right because the world
is working on with this two languages
now two technologies iOS or Android if
you are going for Android again we have
two choice we can go for either native
applications or we can go for hybrid
applications if you are going for native
we have only one choice which is Java
because when you want to make a native
application for Android we have to learn
Java you don't have a choice so you have
to learn Java and you have to learn is
you have to learn XML if you are going
for a hybrid you have to use certain
frameworks like Cordova we have PhoneGap
then we have ionic framework using those
things you can make a application which
will work on Android Android OS but then
for that we have to learn JavaScript and
we don't actually use that above
application everywhere so if you have
some web services available on the
Internet and if you want to use those
web services then only you should create
the hybrid apps but other than that you
can go for native applications which
which which provide you better
performance compared to the hybrid
applications if you are going for the
iOS we have to choice again either we
can go for I or we can go for object UC
or we can go for swept and nowadays
everyone is moving towards Swift because
Swift is new and it has lots of features
compared to object you see right so
that's probable development so if you
want to get into any of this you don't
have a choice you don't have to think
about which language to learn
it's depend upon your what you want to
be you have to choose one now before
that I have one more point it doesn't
matter which language you choose let's
say if you are going for iOS and if you
have to choice either we can go for
Swift
or you can go for object you see what
matters is when you build a software the
architecture of the software the
database strategy the testing strategy
that defines your the power of your
software not the language because
language is just a tool to achieve that
stuff right so any language will do but
those things also matters okay so it's
not just
which so we have talked about your
mobile boil let's move towards the web
world if you want to be a web developer
now again we have two things because you
can be a web designer or you can be a
web developer when you say you want to
be a web designer you have only one
choice I mean you have you have to go
with this this suit which is HTML CSS
JavaScript and jQuery and again if you
want to get into a data updated stuff
you have to learn angularjs so to design
a website you need all those things but
then if you want to be a web developer
in the backend you have to use either
PHP you can use Java you can use Python
you can use C shop ASP combined now
which one is best out of this so if you
want to be a developer and if you want
to be a developer in a quick way if you
don't know any programming language and
if you still want to go for a
development part start with PHP PHP is
much easier to learn you can learn PHP
in two weeks I guess and you can start
making web sites inside majority of the
web sites are actually built on PHP
first of all it is easy second it is
easy to configure and it is the hosting
charges for PHP is very less compared to
other other technologies and that's what
maximum web sites are we're using PHP
but then question is is it secure it is
stable it is scalable no none of them
suits with PHP right so if you want to
make a secure website if you want to
make a stable website then you have to
go for some other languages right so we
have Python we have the Ruby so you
might have heard about Ruby right so
Twitter was launched it was made with
the help of Ruby language but then due
to elections because we have lots of
tweets coming on elections right or
during elections so to handle all the
twits they went for so the backend part
of Twitter now modified from Ruby to
Scala so if you want to make a awesome
website where you want to work with huge
amount of data you can either go for
Java or you can go first column right
now you can also go for c-sharp but then
C shop is a propriety language for
Microsoft and it is always better so
anyway you work on Microsoft
technologies always go for C shop and
ASP but if you have a choice if you want
to go for an open source world Java is
one of the best way to go for but then
if you want to make a normal website
should we use Java no if you are making
a small website and if you if you if you
are using Java there there lots of
headache you have to handle first of all
you have to know you have to buy this
server space and that's will cost how
much again there are some free service
available you can go to AWS and you can
you can host your website there but
again you have to some somewhere you
have to pay or the other way up to pay
right so so which is the best one to go
for depend up on certain parameters if
you are if you want to make a small
website go for PHP middle-level website
go for Ruby if you want to make a
website which will process huge amount
of data go for Java or Scala right so
you can also combine Java and Scala to
make the awesome websites so that's for
mobile development web development now
let's go for the enterprise void if you
want to be a enterprise developer if you
want to get into a big company like you
know MNCs or company like Google
Facebook not exactly Facebook but Google
Amazon then you have to work on
enterprise level software and the moment
you say enterprise there were software's
you have to work with huge amount of
data and if they are using big data
there to process the information then we
have to work on some frameworks like
Hadoop we have SPARC and if you want to
work with any of this language let's say
if we talk about video framework if you
want to work with Hadoop you have to
learn either our language because our
language is used for data processing or
data science so if you have a huge
amount of data and if you want to find
some pad
south of that you can use our language
we can also use Python there again easy
to learn and easy to implement you can
learn Java because Hadoop framework
itself was implemented in Java or you
can go for Scala because if you can
learn Scala you can work on Hadoop and
spark both which works on the on the on
the head we get our world so let's
choose one now so if you want to be into
mobile world I would go I mean I would
ask you to go for Java because we are
making iOS Android applications if you
are sure you want to go for iOS go for
Swift if you are sure you want to go for
web development and depending if you
want to go for web development as a
startup if you want to build your own
small applications go for PHP if you are
making a big applications or big
websites go for Java if you are making a
big data if you want to get into big
data world like Hadoop or spark again
you have to choice Java Oscar right so
now none of the language is perfect is
depend upon the requirement which you
want to go for right so which is the
best language depends upon requirement
