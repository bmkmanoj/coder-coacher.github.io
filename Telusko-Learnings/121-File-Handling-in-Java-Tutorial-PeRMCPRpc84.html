I'll talk about something called as file
handling in Java now to handle file we
have to consume it on some classes so so
initially when I talk about file
handling we will be storing some data in
a file and we'll retrieve those data
from a file right so let me let let lets
suppose my file name is the demo dot txt
so to store data in a file we have to
write in a file right we have to write
so normally when you say you have to
write this is a method right so when you
when you say you have to do something so
you have to use methods
now when you say write in right we have
to pass some data so we will pass like
we can pass data like demo content so
you can we will pass this data but when
you talk about this yeah we need some
main function so we have main function
and this should include they should be
included in our file so so in our main
function so we'll do this now when we
talk about this method we have to use a
method s right now question as I bought
right we have multiple types of write
statement we have write text we have
write bytes then we have write UTF so
we'll be using write UTF right UTF means
it's a type of format you know it so it
defines the format and visit I will be
saved so when we talk about this notepad
it follows utf-8 you might be knowing it
so so we have this right UT of method
now this right UT of method belongs to n
class called as data output stream so we
have a class for the data output stream
and it belongs to our package for java
io so we have to create object of data
at position let suppose object name is d
o s and to create this object with a new
data output stream yeah
so we have nearly double stream now when
you create this object what it will ask
you for this it will ask you for the
object it will ask you for an object of
file input stream so to you know in
order to use data output stream object
in order to create this object we need
to create object of file output stream
so we say F is equal to a new file
output stream and this will ask you for
a file name so we will say a file name
is will say file name is demo2
txt so we can have multiple formats we
can have txt we can have dat and then
you have to pass this object here so we
can say F OS and this method is a non
static method belongs to a class called
a data output stream so what you do is
we have to use the object of data output
stream order to save data so using this
you can store what the problem is there
might be some problem in creating this
file there might be some problem in
writing in this file so we will be
getting errors so what will you do is we
have to handle this errors either we can
use a try-catch or you can diagnose a
throws exception all right so using this
we can store the data in our file so let
me run this so if I say shift f6 so it's
running
yeah so you can say it is build
successful now personalized wait this
file is so for this way to go to our
documents folder in NetBeans project so
here we can see this is our project and
yes we have a file of demo dot txt and
content is some Chinese text again it is
encrypted format for the file if I say
this too we can use so if I open with
this word power also so we have this
demo content okay so so now what if you
find read this file from our code itself
so what we can do is to read to read
this content we have to say there is a
method called as you read utf-8 to read
we have read UDF it will return
something so we will store those data in
STR right and in order to read this we
have to create object of c2 store we
have created object of data output
stream so to retrieve we have to create
object of its data input stream so will
say data input stream and we'll say D is
equal to new data Oh snow data input
supreme now to create the object of data
output stream we need an object of file
output stream in the same way to create
object of data input stream you have to
create object of file input stream so
let's say F is it's is equal the new
files input stream and in brackets we
have to pass the filename so file name
is demo dot txt and here we can pass is
f is and semicolon now this the duty of
belongs to a class called as data input
stream so you have to specify the object
name so D is dot radiative and now what
we can do is we can say s out and we'll
say STR so now if I done this the output
is demo content so what is happening
here is you have created a file demo dot
txt then you say when you say write UTF
in that file as demo take content now
from the same file from the same file we
are trying to retrieve the data and we
are storing this data int and a far in
our string STR angular we are printing
it now that's it but but the problem is
we have create we have done some hard
coding here we are mentioned the file
name in the brackets only so what we can
do is in order to change this file name
from the moment a moment we have to
change in both the methods right so what
we can do is we can create an object of
file as f equal to new file and in this
file we can mention demo dot txt so what
you can do is again you have to import
the package as you can see the package
name the package where this all this
classes belongs is IO
so it's Java dot IO and then instead of
passing the file a we can specify F here
also we can specify F so in future if
you now change your file name as demo 1
also you have to change it one class
only what you can do is begin
can run this and with the same content
so that's about file handling again we
have multiple methods to work with so if
you have any doubts please come in thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
