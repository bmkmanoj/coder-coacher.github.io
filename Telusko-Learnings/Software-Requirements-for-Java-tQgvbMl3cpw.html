this is part two of your video in Java
session so we have series of tutorials
and this is part two so in this we'll
start with the basic Java programming
now when you talk about Java programming
you need something right
first what you need is let me just drink
this this fawn 14 okay so first thing
what we need is we need to type a Java
code so it will be I think a Java code
then after code typing this Java code we
have to compile this right so we require
a compiler so we need to compile them
now to type a Java code we need we need
notepad okay then then to compile this
code we need a compiler called a Java C
so Java C stands for Java compiler now
to run this application to run this
application we need JVM okay so in order
to work with any Java code you need you
need this this three thing so you need a
notepad to type a code you need a Java C
to compile your code and you need JVM
JVM to run your code right now this is
your notepad right so you can type your
java code here then where to find this
Java C okay now when you talk about this
java c you have to install a software
called as dedicate so the software
requirement is the software you need is
jdk now jdk stands for Java development
kit okay and the version I will be using
is 1.8 so one point it is the latest
release for JDK so it's also a Java 8 so
you can use Java 1.6 1.7 or 1.8 which is
which is available for you so
so this is I'll be using jdk 1.8 here so
now with the yeah but this let's let
wished let's see way to find this Java C
so in this and this C Drive I have
already installed my JDK so in Program
Files I will you will find Java here and
we have jdk 1.8 and this i have been
inside bin you will find something
called a java c right so this is your
Java C so now you have a notepad and you
know where to find Java C now where to
find this JVM now JVM in JDK you will
find by when you uninstall Windows like
Windows 7 Windows 8 by default you will
get a JVM but the version of JVM will be
older that's why when you install your
JDK you will update by default it will
update your JVM to the let Rosalie's and
you will whenever you want to work with
JVM you have to use something a Java
command so you will find a Java command
here so this is your Java command right
so this is this is actually our a part
of Jenny JVM so what we need is means
Java C to compile and we need Java to
run right okay so this is what you need
now to run this out how to type our code
and how to work with new application we
will see in next subsequent subsequent
video thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
