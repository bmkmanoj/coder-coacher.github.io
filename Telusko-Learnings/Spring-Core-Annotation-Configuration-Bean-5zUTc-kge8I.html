ready from school earnings and in this
video we'll talk about Spring Framework
we also use mavin in this and will try
to configure a spring application with
the help of annotations so after after
watching this video you will understand
what is Spring Framework will understand
how to use mavin to create a spring
application and you can configure a
spring application with the help of
annotations now in fact I have already
created some videos for Spring Framework
using XML configuration so in this video
we'll talk about annotations move more
focused on annotations okay so we
normally achieve dependency which is
spring tip the dependency injection with
the elf of Spring Framework right so
what I will suggest is if you want to
know about the basic concept of spring
you can you can go to the playlist of
Spring Framework just there are some
three to four videos you will understand
what is Spring Framework how to
implement Spring Framework this video is
specifically for annotations ok so you
will find the link in the description
area of this playing framework okay so
let me create a new project we'll be
creating a mapping project because we
what we do not want to download all the
device required libraries right we can
ask mavin to give you that for you
so we'll say mavin project now since we
are going for a simple spring
application we'll go for a QuickStart
which is a map in app type you can go
for spring web for their application you
can go for a quick start for Co job
application I will let me convert to
disco and the artifact I will give is
spring annotation so we'll say spring an
O okay that's the project name so you
can see record our project where it is
it is here and if I expand this we have
okay so we have this P om file now since
we want to work with spring framework we
need to add those spring dependencies
here right so what will do is will first
print dependencies just have to go to
google and search for mavin repository
because you will get all your base from
here okay and here you can search for
spring core that's what I will search
for spring context
so we have to get this spring context
here we can just take the latest version
which is four point or we'll take one
point four point one point 90 it is
always better to have a one lower
version because it will be stable for
sure let me copy this if I go back to
the MAV and paste it here you can see it
is downloading the jar files if I go to
mavin we got all the required jar files
so it will download everything from the
internet if you have already done this
earlier so it will be having a local
repository which is dot m2 folder in
your documents so you can just go to
your home path search for dot m2 folder
you will be having all this jar files
there okay that's the advantage of using
mavin here okay so once we got this
let's start with the actual work so what
we need here is we have a class and well
I will name this class as Samsung s7 so
I want or Y dimension s7 will just will
simply say Samsung so we have a phone
which is samsung gear and in this
Samsung class we have a method will name
that method as public void of config so
that's the method name which is
configure and in this conflict I will
simply print I will print oh this is
Eclipse so we have to say s out and in
this will print the configuration of
this phone we can say this is octa-core
comma this is 4 GB RAM so I'm talking
about Samsung s7 to be specific we have
12 megapixel camera okay so that's
camera right so we have this Samsung
class here and what I want to do now is
I want to create this I want to create
this I want to call this config method
so in order to call this config method
is for that we require a main function
right so we go for a main function here
ok so I have my main function inside
this app so app is a class inside this I
have to call that Samsung right so in
order to call Samsung we can simply say
as Samsung or we can say this is s7
equal to new
Samsung s7 so Samsung and at the end we
can say s7 dot configure right and if
you can run this application will be
getting the output as the configuration
right but the problem is we don't want
to go for this because this is not
dependency injection right what we want
to achieve so using spring you should be
able to inject this object so in order
to inject this object we can ask our
factory which is application context
should give you the object of Samsung
for that way to create object of
application context we can say this is
Factory equal to so in order to create
object of application context we have to
create we have to use a class which is
annotation conflict in fact if you
remember in XML we use a class but XML
and this we have to use annotation
config application context in which you
have to pass okay for first wait the
object of Factory and then here we can
specify factory dot get been you need to
specify two things the first thing you
can just specify the class name of which
you want the object we can say I want
the object of Samsung dot
and we need to also the test run so way
to specify that we want the object of
Samsung class right and if you run this
application now so what we are doing we
are asking factory to give you the
object and if I don this code okay it
something is happening we got oh we got
an error here it says illegal State
exception is because okay we have not
mentioned the configuration file here so
when you go for XML you mention the XML
name right which is spring dot XML in
which you have to specify something like
this you have to specify that or not
this one you have to specify instead of
not dragging you to specify Sampson and
instead of CPU we have to say we want a
phone so when you say we want to phone
you will get a Samsung right so this is
what we do in when you work with XML
type of configuration now we are not
going for xml type of quantification we
are going for annotation which
configuration so in order to use
annotation based configuration what we
need is we have to create
a class who will who is responsible for
this so I will create a class who will
provide me the configuration since we
are working with annotation so we create
a class animal in this class as app
config we can give it any name doesn't
matter and since this class is a
configuration class or this class is
responsible for the configuration we
have to use an annotation which is at
configuration so as soon as to specify
add configuration now this file this
class is responsible to create to give
you those objects so in XML what we do
we specify this stuff right so in inside
your XML or inside your annotation what
we can do is we can create a method and
we'll this method will return you the
object of Samsung which is Samsung and
we'll name this as get for so method
name is get phone okay
and we can simply say return new Samsung
sounds good right so now as soon as you
run this code now it will try to fetch
the object from here let's try let's see
what is happening oh we need to specify
this stuff here also right we have to
specify this is app config dot class so
we to specify from which con which
configuration class you are working with
so this Factory need to know about the
class you are working with okay let's go
back to the app config and everything
seems good and if I run this code again
if I go here we got another error now
which is no such bin definition found so
we got the class so there is no I don't
know of class but it is not able to find
the bin type of Samsung the problem is
inside your methods you have to specify
that this method is a bin retooled it
will return you our bin so does the
annotation we have to use in order to
create or that dependency thing work
and if run this code now can you see
that we got the output so you can see we
are not using any XML file here
everything is annotation based awesome
right so this app config needs the
object of or within this app
you have to specify at configuration we
should specify that this is a
configuration file and for every object
so let's say in XML we need one more
object so let's say I want an object of
mobile not mobile so every every phone
is depend upon the CPU right so let's
say I have a bin here ID will say this
is CPU and we have up the last who
creates this CPU let's say I'm talking
about Snapdragon right so we can say
this is Snapdragon so we have a CPU of
model Snapdragon so now if I if I want
the same thing if you are going to
achieve the same thing here we have to
create another method we will say get
CPU or get Snapdragon or anything it
will written you have the object of
Snapdragon and they can you can go on so
let's try to implement that let's see
how to implement that stuff here so what
will what we we need here is so you got
the idea about the concept of dependency
injection with the help of annotation
right so what we'll do next is we'll try
to create another class or not the class
but we will we want an interface here so
what I will do I will go to interface
will say this is interface and this is
mobile processor ok because every mobile
every phone needs a processor right we
click on finish so what this phone
processor or this mobile processor will
have is it will have a method with name
will say this is method name is void
process that stuff it will do so we have
a void passes method and to implement
this void to implement this mobile
processor we have one more class and
we'll name that class as what we'll name
this class as we have a class which is
so the first class is Snapdragon ok and
something more so this Snapdragon will
implement our interface which is with
the name of mobile processor right so
this is the interface and when you when
you click on finish you can see we got a
method which is process but by default
is empty right so what I will do I will
say this out I will say world burst CPU
right so we have a mobile processor
which is Snapdragon
inside your Samsung class so every phone
needs a process alright so in this
advocate the object of mobile processor
is a mobile processor and okay mobile so
I will say this is CPU right and for
this we require gate and center so I
will just right click here I will say so
get a setter because that's a variable
right so we get a setup for this we
click on OK
and let me remove this all extra tags
which we don't require here ok removed
okay so we got get CPU SEC CPU and when
I print the configuration I also want to
print the processor I will say CPU dot
process
sounds good absolutely let me repeat
what we are doing here when I run this
application now it will call the config
method of Samsung and this Samsung
method of this the config method will
call the process method which is a part
of mobile processor
now the question arise if I done this it
will it work and the answer is no of
course right because we have not created
the object object for CPU it is just the
declaration right and we're going to
director coin trying to access the
object of course it will give you an
error so if I go to this app and if I
run this so we were expecting the
outright regional point exception then
how to provide that object how to
provide this object for mobile CPU again
I will not use new object new keyword
there so what I will do is I will create
the bean inside configuration for every
object need to create a bean annotation
that's compulsory and we can specify a
method name here we can say this is
public it will return the object of
mobile processor because that's what we
want and we'll name this we can name it
anything we can say this is get again so
this is get processor anyway that name
doesn't matter and this will return now
we need to provide the concrete
implementation so we can say this is nap
dragon so specifically we are saying it
should return the object also not dragon
ok so now we have created that
mobile was an object also right but
inside this Samsung how it will connect
will it connect directly just Wi-Fi on
this code we are still getting the error
is because we are not able to connect it
so in order to connect these two things
in your Samsung class we need to say
this is at O at Auto wire so what it
will do it with such I need the object
of CPU
I will check in the app configuration we
already have a method which returns
mobile position so it will check the
type of the return type it will check
the return type
so this Auto wired inside the annotation
part comes as by default is by type ok
it will not check the name it will check
the type and if I run this code or not
this one if I run this app boom can you
see that we got the output as world best
CPU it's because just you can see in
Samsung we have still not created the
object it is it is done automatically
and that's the power of this override
annotation quite simple right so let me
just repeat all the stuff here which we
have done so we have created a class
with yes we have cater that we have
created this app class in which you have
a method which is main in which you have
application context object which is
Factory and using factory we are getting
the object of Samsung which is get being
in package you can specify Samsung class
and then we are saying as seven dot
configure right quite simple but the
problem is when you say get B and you
have to provide those being inside your
app conflict so you have to specify this
class here so this is your confirmation
class we can have another confliction
class also let's say you have one more
confirmation class as my app config so
you can have two three four you can have
multiple confection files but when you
whenever you are working with one
confirmation file you have to mention
that file here inside your app
configuration you are specifying to
beans one is the gate phone and the
second one is cat processor and then we
have Samsung class we have mobile cursor
and then we have Snapdragon right so
it's that simple but what if I say you
don't have to write these two things
also that means if I delete this
we come in this part where you drill it
so if I come in this part it should
still work and if I run this code it's
not working again say we got the others
then question arises how to achieve that
is it possible to commend those part or
not even writing those parts rate should
work we'll see that so what we'll do is
we'll see that stuff in the next video
how to do that although stuff so that's
it from this video thank you so much for
watching and do subscribe for for the
videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
