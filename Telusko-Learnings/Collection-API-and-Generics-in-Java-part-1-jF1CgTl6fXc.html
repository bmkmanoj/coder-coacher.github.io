about collections so before starting
with collections let's talk about adding
so to define an array we have to specify
datatype and then we have to mention the
ID name which is a and then we have to
say a new array and we happy to find
this size here but the drawback of added
is you can you can have only ten
elements now we cannot increase and we
cannot decrease also so if you say ten
at the time of declaration it will be 10
the prop na or to overcome this problem
we have a new framework of collection in
Java now to use a collection we have to
use an interface called as collection so
in Java we have a collection interface
now by importing package it's
collections its collection now now we'll
say the curve the reference as see now
in order to create object or instance of
a collection unfortunately this
collection is an interface you can see
it's an interface right so to create an
object of instance of this collection we
have to use a class which has
implemented a collection and the class
name is released so earliest is a class
in in collection framework which has
implemented which has implemented this
collection interface okay so let's see
if you go to this class at least if you
can see this class at least has extended
so this addict ArrayList extends
abstract list and it implements least
that means we have one more interface
called as list and if you go to this
list now this lace extends collection so
indirectly this ArrayList class
implements collection so we can create
an object of add a list and a reference
of collection now to add elements it see
the by default this a delicious will
have 10 elements ok so it will take all
the 10 elements or it has a size of 10
elements we can add more than 10
elements we can reduce the number of
elements so to add an element we have to
say seedot
and and we can add elements like we are
let's say we add one we can add let's
say two we can add any number of
elements and in the amazing part is we
can add any type of element so we can
say one two naveen then C dot add let's
say when I could add five point five
that means it supports all type of
elements is because by default
collection is a collection of objects
and all these types of objects one is
integer but it's object string loving is
a string but is the subclass of object
right because all the classes like
integer or string or double they are
subclasses of objects it does the
advantage of using a collection right
now how to print a collection it's very
easy you can use a enhanced for-loop
announced for the will pick up since we
are using our object type we'll say
object o in c so it will fetch one one
value of a collection interface one
value of from this collection and then
we can print it so we can say s out and
oh i can say it will print all the
values amazing right it can print all
the values so the advantage of
collection is it c is the collection of
objects right and we can directly add
elements we can remove elements so we
can say say dot we have option of remove
if i don't want to i can just specify
two and if i run this now so it will
print 111 and 5.5 it's because it has
removed two so we can add elements we
can remove elements which are not
possible in adding right now now since
it is an advantage that you can have any
type it's also our drawback it's because
whenever you put in an application and
when you use a added least order
collection you are using that collection
for specific types this example we can
say we have a collection of names we
have a collection of numbers we have a
collection of images that means this
collection should be of a particular
type if i say there's a collection C
this C should be of type integer
or it should be a string or it should be
a like any object right but it should
not be default which means by default
this collection is a collection of
objects what I want I want it to be a
collection of maybe integers so what I
can do is to specify this collection
should not support string it should not
support double it should only support
integers we can use something called as
generics nowadays genrich's we can just
specify in angular brackets that this
only this should only supports integer
and in this side also we can specify
this is integer now this type of styling
is college genrich's so we can specify
which type of a dimension we should have
using this generic symbol now question
arises why angular brackets is because
on your keyboard
the only symbols which are remaining is
this angular brackets that is why the
generics uses this angular brackets now
genrich's was introduced in version 1.5
and in 1.7 we have a new update we don't
have to mention the type on the right
side of the collection which means when
you create a reference you have to
define the type of the collection but by
when you create an instance you don't
need to create its because it will fetch
that type from the left side alright and
you can see now we are getting LRU and
that's why it will not support so we'll
just remove this part and from this will
remove 0.5 so now it will support so it
supports all the integers
now then amazing thing is now this C is
not a collection of objects this is a
collection of integers so what we can do
we can simply say it is integers right
and now if I print this I will get all
the integers okay I have removed too
that's why it's not printing too so this
is the basic of collection will go in
detail in the subsequent tutorials so do
