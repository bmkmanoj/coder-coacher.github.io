two numbers so for that you have to
create a new project and in your project
you have to create new activity so in
the last video we have seen how to get a
project right so now let's see how to
get an activity so to create an activity
right click on your app send new and
select activity here you have to go for
empty activity and we'll mention a name
we'll say this is addition of two
numbers so we'll say this is addition
activity here and every activity which
jar file will give you a layout file
also that you could design it now in my
application I might have multiple
activities right and when I was on this
application where it should load or
which activity should should it load it
depends upon the launcher I want this
activity to be the launch activity so I
will I will just check this and I will
click on OK so as I click on finish I
got a Java file and I also got a layout
file here and this is your preview so
whatever changes you make here will
reflect on the preview so let's say if I
create a textview it will reflect on
this view if I make it any text it will
reflect on the view now to add the
components maybe the edit text or the
textview we have two ways the first way
we can drag drag and drop so on this on
the left side you can see we have we
have widgets so you can just drag the
switches on the screen that's one way
the second way is we can directly create
the text views or your components using
by typing here so we can say if you want
it it takes so you can take type added
text so it will give you a detection on
the right side okay so if I mention as
let's say if I mentioned 20 DP and here
if I mentioned let's say again 20 DP so
you can see we got will be getting a
text to be who is not visible but this
is attic text here so that's one way we
can have in that way so every component
on your screen will have to think
compulsory which is widget also with
width and height but let's not do it in
that way because I'm not a good designer
so I will directly use drag and drop
okay so let me use our text view we need
to text to you here okay so let me drag
and drop both and it's not visible right
so let's change the font
so how to change the text size so just
drag it here or search for text size
property and we can say this is 20 20 DP
so when I say 20 DP DP stands for so we
have three things here we have P X which
is this we have P X we have a DP and we
have SP okay so it's better to go with
SP because it depends upon the font size
of your screen
okay DP is it is device-independent
pixels so it's like even if you have a
smaller screen or bigger screen it will
not change or match and better to go
with SP because if user change the font
this will also increase okay let's take
it here okay let's change size for this
also will say this is even 20 SP okay
and now it's now it's able to we can
select that and we can crop it here okay
now we got to text knowledge change it
text text the text of the first field
will say this is first this is first
number and I forgot to mention the ID
now why we have read to mention ID here
is because if this will be used in in
Java coding so we say this is T V 1
which is team textview 1 ok
and this one also this is o so for the
second text we have to say this is
second number and this will be T V 2
right so we got tv1 and tv2
so we have assigned the ID and the text
what we can see here is you can see we
don't have a good enough gap between
these two components right I want a gap
there so how to mention that gap so we
need a margin between second number the
first number and we can include the
margin so you can see we have a textview
properties which is set here and then
this is the second textview property
which is set again we can discuss about
this property so this is the width so
which is web content so if you if you
mentioned that match parent it will take
the whole area like example if I mention
is match parent it will take the whole
area right so will not do that will make
a pit web content ok the property I want
to set here is for the second one it
should have some margin from the first
number so to set the margin we can set
it anywhere which is better to go with
the n-word so we say this is margin and
we'll select margin top because we want
space from the top and let's take 20 DP
so you can see we got some margin here
between first number and second number
now we also need a text field there to
enter two values right and we'll select
plain text so let's drop it here okay
it's go on here let's okay so now the
first thing when to change is this width
of this let me change the width to 150
DP I think that will be better
okay so we got 120 DP we can just move
it here and we want one more which will
be again let's say 150 DP again just we
can just drag it here okay it's one big
another we can even provide margin for
this we can set the margin on the left
side of the component so we can set the
margin in this way we can say margin or
left side it will be around let's say 30
DP yeah perfect right so we got the
margin there now once we got this - Oh
switch below okay so now we have two
labels and to text a text field which is
edit text here now we also hit a button
right - when you click on the button it
should have something which should
happen there so let's take a button so
button is here and just drop that button
here now we can change the name of this
button so we can double click the text
we should show here is add and we to
also change the ID we'll say this is BTN
add okay now as soon as I click on this
button something should happen but we'll
do that we'll do that later
we got to text field and when a one
button right so now let's say if I click
on this button something will happen and
I want to show the output so we require
some place where you can show the output
right so now let's take the textview
here so we can just search for the
textview it's here and let's take a
large text so that we can see the output
a bit away and we just said the name
we'll say this is ID which is TV answer
and yeah we'll keep it large text oh
we'll say this is watch what's the
answer is typical thing so with this
answer is and we'll get the answer right
now let's perform the action so we saw
this I click on this button add it
should take these two values and show
assign the value to the answer okay and
how do I set it do that we'll see in the
next video we'll talk about the
programming part of this so this is just
a layout video in the next video we'll
talk about the programming thing so I
hope yeah so make sure subscribe the
channel and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
