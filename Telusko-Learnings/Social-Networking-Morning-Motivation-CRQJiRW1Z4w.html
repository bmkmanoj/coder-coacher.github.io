from telesco learnings and today's topic
is networking so one of the biggest tool
for success is networking you should
know how to network these people right I
mean why network is so important is when
you are walking in I mean in your life
you know you cannot do anything alone
you need people to help you right I mean
a Bill Gates cannot build a Microsoft
without I mean with with I mean alone no
one can build an empire alone why they
need people to do that so networking is
very important I don't know if I mean
networking with everyone is important
you are if you are the college student
you have to network with your professors
you have to network with your with your
friends you have to network with your
lab assistant right i mean engineering
engineering students you know this what
I'm talking about right when you say
networking with lab assistant you know
what I'm talking about so you have to
network with everyone even you with your
watchman of your building let's say when
if you are even if you are working for a
company have jockbox you have to network
with your colleagues you have to also
get work three people who are into a
different project I mean they are not
into your project but they're in two
different project okay now why it is
helpful as when network with people from
the other project maybe let's say you
have net we are networking with a pic
with a person who is not from your
project is from different project he's
not your friend okay you went to a
cafeteria to have your lunch and then
you have seen one of the one of the
person from the other project you I mean
you know that guy by his face but not
with his name so i would suggest to go
go i'm going to go sit with him have
your lunch with him are the advantages
when when you when you talk during lunch
i mean when you share something about
you and your project and when he shares
of something about tim and use project
not the not the private things about the
project but something which is which is
you know which you can share the
advantage is maybe in future if you like
his project and in that project they
need someone with the skill set which
you have you might you might work with
that project right so it's always better
to network you don't know how powerful
it is in fact if you watch videos on
youtube or networking they will give you
lots of examples all successful people
they are successful because of the
strong networking they have
I mean talk about any successful person
I mean no one can know when no one can
do anything alone why so you need you
need you need networking so from today
try to connect with everyone doesn't
matter who is your it may be offline it
may be someone who will who is not you
know you think is not potentially
helpful for you but you never know right
i mean talk to people help then okay
don't don't help people just because
they might help you in future but help
people you know if you want help in
future you have to help others and learn
that stuff you know help others it will
improve it will improve yourself also I
mean example if let's say if you know
something if you teach that thing to
other pole other people you are helping
them right but you will learn a
different way I mean you will learn a
different stuff about that that thing
when you are teaching to it I mean make
sure you help others build a strong it
working send messages to people you know
if you have if you are using okay first
of all I don't just connect everyone
virtually you have to connect with
people physically because that is more
important than connecting with what you
think watch it is a good thing right you
can use whatsapp you can use messages
you can use Facebook but talking to
people physically I mean you know face
to face is more important than talking
to people on whatsapp and Facebook
because texting is the most weird way of
talking to people you know it creates
lots of misunderstanding because you
want to say something else and they what
they take something else because see
when you talk to people face-to-face you
have two things one is your words and
your expression your body language but
even when you're talking to people on
whatsapp and facebook chat what is
happening is you are talking to them
using only text and people might in you
know misinterpret the way the things
you're talking okay so make sure you use
proper channel to communicate with
people face to face is more important
and you know texting is also good no
good morning text and all those stuff is
good but sending is like we have the
value here in India now everyone is
wishing the valley to everyone right
they use their using a water feature
where they can where they can share all
the gif so weak we got some new gif in
this diwali and some images so this
share it as a broadcast I mean trust me
I have not replied anyone on this Diwali
the reason is I mean they don't know
whom they are sending these messages
right they are just forwarding all the
mass
it doesn't make sense to me right if you
if you truly want to do you want to wish
me just send me a personal message don't
send me a forwarded message that doesn't
make sense to me okay your wish should
be from your heart because that's how
you create a network right I mean
sending a message just afford a message
I that will not get a network between
you and me you have to send a proper
genuine message that will connect that's
that's how you network with people okay
so network with everyone you don't know
who will help you in future okay when
your watch man you're feeling your
office boy a bank employee so even if
you are going to a bank for a
transaction talk to the Cassiar talk to
the watchman if they might help you in
future if you get if you get a problem
anyone okay don't just have your ego and
then don't talk I mean there are people
there are lots are they got lots of ego
and they don't talk to people I mean why
to talk with them and all those attitude
just build a strong network that will
help you in future trust me so that's it
that's about networking if you have some
