link on facebook oh how would that's
crucial let me just share the screen I
mean I'm just share the I'm life I am
live
but where am i I'm here life is going on
this on Facebook
I know why people take so much of time
to join how many of you actually joined
so two people are watching both are my
machines okay
I hope I'm audible
okay so three people are watching let me
just start with the topic
okay people are following me on Twitter
streaming is good it's awesome
okay so let's start where topic so today
we are going to discuss about the
required resources to learn language
right so let's say if you under learn
any programming language it maybe it
maybe you know c programming it may be
java it may be c++ from where to learn
right the sea you want to learn
something of course there are lots of
people they want to learn lots of things
right example i want to learn how to
dance the other people they want to
learn how to cook so we are always
searching for the resources right so
let's say if you want to join dance
classes you have to you want to learn
down so why do you have to join a dance
classes you have do you want to learn
yoga you have you will go to yoga
classes right all the stuff but since we
have since we have online it was
available now people are moving more
towards online thing instead of going
for the life classes right so yeah so
today we're going to talk about
resources to learn programming right so
there are lots of this is available so
you can go forward so let's say in you
know in earlier days when you talk about
1990s somewhere so if you learn
something you just have to go to college
they will teach you something and then
that's how you learn right there were no
other resources and the other issues was
books so if you have to learn something
you have to refer some books and all the
stuff but the thing is now time is
changing right is so instead of learning
from books there are lots of kisses I
believe I'm not saying book is a bad
thing now you can also refer books but
it's kind of boring right so that's why
we don't learn because we don't like
books so there are lots of resources
available one of these sources which is
I've been able is online videos right so
you can go to so there are lots of
options one of the option is you can go
to classes you can join a classes you
can learn different technology there
otherwise you can you can refer to
online resources right you can read
books online books you don't have to buy
the hard copy now you have ebooks
available right so you can refer from
there you can also you know you can also
refer online videos so in fact I I make
lots of videos right so you can
therefore my videos to learn something
so let's sacred
java of course you have to go just go to
statistical learning and you can watch
the whole playlist you can learn c
programming to do the same thing right
but is it the only source available
they're not there again there are
different websites you can learn from
right there so there are websites like
udemy.com you can go there and can learn
a programming you can go to Coursera or
the only thing is they are not free if
you go to you die me if you go to
Coursera so those those videos are not
exactly free so initially they started
with free version now they start they
started charging you in fact when I went
for I wanted to check the price for java
course and they're charging
approximately I guess three forty
dollars I just imagine if you are paying
so much of follows the source so that's
why I prefer making videos on youtube
because I don't have to charge them
right it's a free of cost but then again
they're different things so you can go
to you damn you can pay there and you
can learn a jar technology you can learn
anything you want right so these are
this option of you diameter is option of
Coursera you will get awesome videos
there so there are people who are
working very hard to make those
tutorials for you so that you can learn
those technologies sitting at home now
why I'm making this video today I mean
why this topic from bed resources to
learn because the thing is i have my
videos on youtube so i think it's enough
but there are some people they think
okay we want to learn something new they
want to learn more they keep their
dinner they keep asking me this question
from way to learn from where to learn so
yeah the answer is there are lots of
options okay so i will suggest okay you
can learn something any programming
language will be C C++ or Java I will
suggest start with a book okay don't
start with with you try to the book any
book you want okay you can go for
complete reference you can go for head
first java you can go find any book have
a look and the on the index page now
what index page will give you as the
comp is the idea what that language
covers example if you if you open
complete reference it will teach you to
it you know if you see the index page it
will teach you that you'll be having for
loop you'll be having if else you'll be
having
a day's exception handling spring all
the stuff like then they then it will go
for jdbc all the stuff so you have an
idea what are the topics you should know
to be a good programmer I tell you you
if you want to be a Java programmer so
you have to go to all those resources so
that's that's one choice the other one
is if you read a book you will you will
get lots of stuff there I mean start to
end starting from the basics till the
end they will cover each and everything
in sequence but there's one problem with
online with books it is quite boring
right again you have fill that right
it's quite it's very very very boring I
hate reading books but we don't have
choice I'd I kind of learn something you
have to have four books so why you
should start with book is it will teach
you what are topics you have second it
will it will make sure that it will bore
you so that you will search what other
options now what are the other options
you have you can actually go to youtube
we can go to my channel you can learn
everything but there are people they
don't like my tutorials there are people
they love my tutorials there are people
more like okay we are not finding
anything else so let's have your
tutorials right example if it if you
search for an open shift tutorial
tutorials i am not i'm not the best guy
for that but we don't have open shift
tutorials on youtube much right so some
people are watching my videos because it
don't have choice some people are
watching because they like it right so
so you can refer online videos also
right so what i will suggest watch my
video and start reading the book so
let's say i'm teaching about oops
concept after the after the concert
let's say if I have done with
encapsulation open the book and read
about it what exactly it means right so
maybe the words I am using my videos may
be different from the words which are
using books because no one can say this
is the actual what we have to use it
here because oops has different
implementations I oops is just a concept
Java has its own implementation C++ is
it own implementation so maybe the words
will defer somewhere here and there so
you can watch my video and you can just
read the book it will make sure that you
will understand the complete topic but
hold on the problem is if you even if
you learn that
you will not remember anything it's very
important right when you are learning
something you have to make sure that you
are learning everything right so so what
I would suggest after that once you are
done with my video when she once you're
done with the book start with the
implementation anything you want you
know any idea in your mind you can go
for packed you can go for prime number
you can go for factorial all the stuff
so watch those do those coding because
it will make sure that you will you have
you got the actual concept okay now once
you have done with that what next okay
so you have done with the videos you
have done with books you have done with
the coding right next is interview
questions or any competitive programming
you can go to hiker earth you can go for
hikers rank their participate to compete
now you will you will say okay are these
for competition right but what I will
learn from that the thing is when you
solve those questions you will get lots
of you will get lots of you know you
will give like stuck somewhere you will
get lots of bugs so when you solve those
puffs you will get some new ideas you
will know how exactly to solve problem
you know the Indians are very good with
the problem-solving concepts right so
all over the world we are very famous is
because we know how to solve problems we
have lots of patience i'm not saying
people one from work from outside india
they are not they are not they're not
good at problem solving is just we are
bit higher than the i'm not saying i
cannot say that right so um we have that
power we have patients we have we we
know how to handle things we know how to
solve problems so why don't you solve
problems right so to increase your
programming skills you just have to make
sure your that you you have to solve
this fellow so go to hacker rank and
solve those questions there okay so once
again watch my videos second read the
book I mean not the whole book but those
particular points next we have to go for
as those solving questions anything you
want prime number on the stuff and then
go to hacker rank and compete okay it
will also tee it will also give you some
rewards points you can show it
difference that I
on that okay so that's how those are the
resources available not time being I am
talking about that more by time and if
you have any questions because this is a
live session I can actually answer your
question so 10 people are watching I'm
not sure I guess two of those are my
machines so if you are watching this you
can actually comment their adulation let
me know that you are watching this okay
and if you have any questions at least
you can say hi and even your name will
be pop there 10 people are watching okay
this is rohit okay so a got a message
from the know it so if you have if you
have again 10 people right so connect at
least send me hi or if you have any
questions you can give me a I mean you
can just put it put up it here in fact
I'm going to answer some questions which
which were asked in my videos so i got
lots of comments last week about lots of
questions so i'm trying to solve those
this week i'm in the wash rotates pitch
thursday right so I guess the questions
were asked on sunday so I'm trying to
answer those questions okay so yeah
those are the resources available right
now i'll come back to the resource part
now what next all these companies like
if you talk about if we talk about
oracle if we talk about us if you talk
about google if you talk about microsoft
whenever they launch any technology they
have their own documentation in fact
oracle has its own documentation for
java don't you don't have to buy a book
you can actually refer that
documentation to learn something okay so
you can you can refer javadocs you can
refer let's say if you want to be a dot
interloper then you Microsoft has its
own technology I mean Microsoft has its
own documentation this isn't there
something unless a network of Microsoft
which is called as msdn which is
Microsoft ms microsoft developer network
you can actually go there and you can do
eat all those documents there so for
every language sorry sorry for that for
every language for every technology we
have a documentation for that particular
from that particular company you can do
that also right so those are the
resources
available there okay so if you have any
more questions where you will find the
resources in factor I will suggest
whatever you learn by one book so if you
are learning java by at least one book
of java for learnings python by one book
of python at least okay even if you are
not reading those books have it with you
because it will be helpful when you when
you're referring to online video so you
can actually verify that the concept
which is covered in the video and the
concept which is covered in the book is
almost same you should not be it cannot
be exactly same but you should not it
should be almost same okay there should
not be any contradiction there so by one
book again okay so that's that's all
about resources to learn programming so
that was the concept I wanted to cover
now let's talk about some questions so
last week I got lots of questions but
before that there's a cushion from Rohit
Rohit Sony good evening sir i'm watching
your programming they are awesome okay
thank you but I have some problem can
you give me an email address or any
contact info for asking doubts odo hit
okay the thing is Rohit the problem is
if I give you my email ID you will put
up lots of questions and I may not be
able to answer your all of your
questions because I got lots of extra
stuff to do sorry for that but what you
can do is whenever you watch my videos
there's a comment section below comment
your comment your question even if i am
not able to answer your question there
are people on youtube there are my
friends not exactly friends but they
watch my videos they admire my videos
and they try to answer your questions
okay even if i am not available so you
will get your answers there okay
otherwise you can I'm there on facebook
okay in fact you can take my email ID my
mother is now been ready to 0 let me
just type it here okay let me just type
it here it's naveen ready 20 @ gmail.com
so that's my marathi but but the problem
is i may not be available to your to
answer your questions if it is if it's
something that i can answer in very
short time i will do that for sure but
it is something very big rig might know
