one last thing is the meaning in which I
need to print will print to the user
that's a print
ellen but i will plant a in h1 tag I
will say close I just want to say here
your name is cute that's it okay and
which knee that's your name is cute now
so first ed now let's go to your Firefox
here you can see if i refresh again it
will take some time okay so in this go
to application so you can see by default
I don't have any application here which
is not deployed anything here so let's
go to your project and simply say deploy
so once you click on deploy it will
deploy all the required files there it
will take some
depend upon your order system speed for
me it will be much fast my system is so
it'll take some time to learn what we
have done we will revise what we have
done till now is we have created a
project a JB project enterprise project
in which we have created a bin and
index.js file and I solve it which is
this servlet so I get a diploma tis done
let's open a Firefox click on
application you can see we are record
our project which is demo MD be it is
here
now let's launch it I guess launching
from here should work anyway so what
we'll do is we'll go to your project and
go to index file and simply say it 1 if
you run this code it's giving an error
because it is already deployed ok we'll
just go to a browser would say localhost
it is localhost colon 48 48 for it 4head
/ my project is name is demo demo m DB m
DB / it's index dot HTML enter this was
not found was the issue
okay let me just remove this from here
we'll say and deploy we'll deploy it
again I guess there is some other way
the deployment you know when you work
with this verification you have to
handle lots of deployment issues so
we'll say deploy egb will not deploy the
whole project will deploy EJB first it
is deployed
that's verify go to application click on
application hf is deployed and it is
enabled in your project now let's done
this TM l will set on I think it should
work now yeah so you can see it will ya
it was demo /y I forgot that Wow okay
now let's enter your name here okay I'm
getting all this numbers let's say I
find time I named I win and if I say
send your name is cute that means this
data has been sent to my GMS let's see
I am I able to fetch that if I go to
output in GlassFish server you can see
this is mr. Naveen okay so that means my
name was sent to JMS and since it is it
was sent into JMS using this message
listener I was able to fetch it with the
help of on-message method so let's go to
this gym is just to verify everything is
deployed you can see both are deployed
and they are able to use it okay so we
have created this two destination one is
this one second is this in this
destination we have this settings so I
hope you are done with you have clear
with all this concept of message g1
beans in fact you can you can use you
can write a code for your you own you
can create a producer you can create a
consumer so on the consumer side you
have to write this on message simple so
this is how we need to use message
driven</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
