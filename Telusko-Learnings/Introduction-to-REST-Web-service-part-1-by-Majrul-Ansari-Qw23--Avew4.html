different is politics and today we have
module and Sally with us so module has
experience of more than twelve years in
the corporate industry as a trainer and
he is training on different technologies
like Java web services a needed
technology in Java and he has done his
training there so and for different
companies so last year we were together
for one of the training and so that's
how we met and now he's here so we so
he'll be talking about Web Services
restful web services now just to give
you a glimpse what is web service is so
we are living in a void of websites
right so we go to different web sites
and what we access is pages right so as
a client or as a person we consume pages
but what happens you know we sometimes
we have a server and we have a client
which is you so when you request for a
page you get an HTML page but then
sometimes what you have is you have a
machine and a machine this machine is a
client machine and this is our machine
when when when a machine needs a data
from this server a machine will not
expect a HTML page a machine will expect
a data right now data can be represent
in an XML format or we can represent
that in a JSON format and the server
will not be a normal server now it will
be a web services again what exactly it
is and how it was that will be discussed
that will be discussed by module so so
here we are
hello everyone my name is module and
sorry I'll try and giving you a small
introduction on this Web Services today
let's see in the time that I have with
me what are the areas of West web
services that I can talk about so let me
get on to the topic very quickly because
I'm very very very very bad in giving
introduction so people around here right
no you know so they will know why I'm
saying like this ok so coming to coming
on the topic understanding what this
concept is all about starting the Dacron
named representational state transfer
the idea is all about developing web
services so this concept is nothing new
when we try fitting the concept of web
services we can say it is yet another
solution for developing distributed
applications what did we use to do in
the past
in the past we used to use technology
like let's say korva if we go back in
time maybe Microsoft has its own ways of
dealing with things
calm D calm and there were there were
many other options which came over a
period of time in Java be adding JVs are
they my lot of options so the concept
goes back in time there is nothing new
we are talking about it's it's the usual
thing that we are going to repeat again
just that the technologies we will use
would be different the protocol we will
use would be different the concepts a
bit here and there will change but most
of the things remain the same so anyone
who has any background of any other
areas which are similar to this if you
worked on then this topic will become
very easy when I talk about web services
before rest we can say we had another
style of web service development so that
was called as so so there are two ways
of developing web services we can say
today soap styl web services and this
rest snail web services restful web
services that's what people generally
refer to this as a simple object access
protocol act on him for the same and
yeah we just talked about this but we
need to go into the details about
understanding why this kind of a name
was given what is the thesis behind this
naming convention that the guy who
actually introduced this I'll talk about
him also very soon so there were two
there are two ways of developing web
services so panelists this is now very
much outdated we don't talk much about
using so for new applications that we
are developing today any project that we
actually do today when we can think
about it's all waste based and I we are
going to use web services it's going to
be rest rest rest everywhere by default
no one is using soap it's only for
existing applications for which
developers still need to know about soap
as a technology and all the concepts
associated with it but for any new
application as I said we just need to
focus on this one thing now the guy who
has come up with this concept you know
who introduced to this concept of
representational style web services or
state web services the guy we had this
Roy Roy fielding he is the same guy who
has been what we should say he has been
the principle author or you can say the
co-author of HTTP protocol so he's a
very senior kind
industry and he is the one who was a
member of the team that was responsible
for designing this protocol so when we
talk about the person who has designed
the protocol well you know when this guy
came up with this concept of developing
rest Web Services I'm sure you all agree
with me you know like this this guy
knows about this protocol better than
anyone else so what what he said was
that when we are going to develop Web
Services over here we are going to use
just HTTP protocol that's it we don't
want to use any other protocol so the
idea of refreshed based web services is
how we can use HTTP protocol for
developing the same so altogether came
up with a different concept there was a
different protocol that was created it
itself is called as a protocol simple
object access protocol which would work
on top of HTTP protocol so it also needs
support of HTTP protocol so you are your
connection between the client and the
server would be established using HTTP
and on top of HTTP there would be this
layer of soap that would be established
between the client and the server so
there were a lot of challenges when we
had to develop and consume so this web
services so this guy just removed this
concept of soap completely and he said
that HTTP protocol is sufficient for you
to develop your web services now
initially people disagreed why because
when this protocol was created let's say
more than 20 years back it wasn't
thought about people will be using it
for developing web services so he had to
prove that you know why HTTP is
sufficient you don't need any other
protocol so he he basically just came up
with a PhD thesis of his and he shared
his ideas with the community everyone
started liking it and then today every
technology whether it is Java or.net and
no matter which other language we work
with everyone is providing us some API
that we learn as developers which
confirm to the principles laid down by
Roy fielding so he has outlined that if
you are going to develop web services
using HTTP protocol these are the things
you should take care of we'll talk about
that very soon now so that's a bit about
the initial thing about the web services
the concept
she goes back in time I have not yet
talked about how this name was coined so
we'll also try discussing about this
full form in detail what exactly this
bits mean over here representational
state transfer we'll talk about that we
just talked about the guy behind this
and what his idea is to promote HTTP
protocol nothing more than that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
