from physical earnings and in this video
we'll talk about expansion functions in
Cortland now to demonstrate that let me
just go back to my alien class now
remember in our tutorials we have
created this alien class and in fact uh
in the in that video I have talked about
a name variable but then I have changed
it to skills because everyone when I say
you people are alien now in fact I got
lots of comments in the comments section
in the earlier videos that why I call
people as aliens is because I feel you
know in programming world we are not
humans because we are living in virtual
world so in we are human in real world
the moment you write codes you interact
with the virtual void you become an
alien and every if every alien needs a
skillset right and that's why we have
skills here so we have a alien and then
we need skillset right now as everyone
know that in fact I have Java skill set
I have Quadling skills that you might be
having PHP you might be having Ruby
maybe a c-sharp skillset right so
everyone has some sort of skill set with
them right and even if you don't have a
skill skill set you are coming to this
channel to increase your skills so
that's why we have skills here now again
I'm emphasizing emphasizing the skills
because the entire example is based on
this so let's say every alien has some
sort of skill set and let me get a
function just to print that skill set so
I will say function show oh what's that
so function show will print whatever
skill you have so I will say I want to
print this variable skills that's it so
we got a function and in which you have
your printing skill set now that's it in
this agent class we just have this thing
okay we have a DIN class in which you
have skills and then we are printing
your whatever skills you have let me
just go back to my first code in bin in
which you have a main function so what I
want here is let's say a little first
grade object of alien so I will name
this alien as a one we can have any
alien name so and then we'll say equal
to which it would be alien right so we
got this object here we got
alien object now once we got this object
let's say I want to print these skills
so what we can do is we can simply say J
a one I want to print your skill
so I will say show the moment I call
show and if I don this code let me just
do that so I click and run first code
and you can see it will give you the
output here yes and we got the output as
null because we have not specified this
skills yet now how do you specify skills
it is very easy or you can say a 1 dot
you can specify these skills and you can
say ok this a one guy he knows Java okay
so this guy knows Java let's run this
code now and of course you will get the
output as Java now you can see that in
the console window record Java now
that's your first object what I would do
is I want to create one more object here
let's say we got one more area which is
a 2 and a 2 is again an alien and a 2
dot skills again it will have its own
skills and let's say he knows about SQL
and a 2 dot show so what happened this
one person will have Java skills one
person will have SQL skills and if you
run this code and you can see that you
got Java and SQL now what what happens
you know let's say if you don't know
something and if you want to improve
your skills the best way is to be with
those people who know those skills
example if you don't know Java you know
communicate with people who know Java or
be with people who know Java you will
know Java ultimately because they will
talk about Java thing the you will sort
something on internet like so if you
don't know ask uses SQL skills just be
with the person who knows SQL skills
work with them you will know SQL as well
so let's say if you are creating a new
object and let's say this is you so I
will name this as a tree and you want
these both the skills so what you can do
is just imagine this world what if I can
simply say a 1 dot plus and then a 2
what you should do is it so you are a 3
here so you are create you are getting
created because I mean you are becoming
alien because of the first alien and the
second 8 alien is it possible can I
simply call plus on or met on this
object a 1 now unfortunately when you
are calling this plus map function in
alien glance we don't have any function
called as plus right that's the weird
part we don't have that function so if
you want to make it work so what I
expecting here
a 1 we'll have a function called as plus
and then it will accept another alien
object and in return what you will get
is a alien object but unfortunately we
don't have any method here inside alien
which can do plus so what we will be
doing here is we will be saying ok
no not an issue let me create a alien
let me create a plus function here but
just imagine if you don't have a source
code with you right if you don't have a
source code or maybe you don't want to
touch this class what you can do is you
can add the functions inside a class
using extension functions I mean you
will be defining those functions
somewhere outside example I will be
defining a function inside first code
but that function will be a part of
alien I know you are not believing this
right let me just try so you can do that
ok let me show you the example here so
what you can do is you can say hey I've
got a function and this function name is
plus so this function name is plus and
this function takes a parameter as
aliens I will say a colon area now a is
the reference here for the off of the
class alien and this will return an
alien we've got a function but then I
don't want this function to be something
like this I want this function to be a
part of a length class now the way you
can do that is very simple you can
simply say alien dot plus and your job
is done
the moment you say this plus belongs to
alien now it becomes an extension
function so this function now belongs to
a alien class not internally but
externally and that's what is called as
extension functions so what we will be
doing is here is we'll be creating a new
alien object I will say this is new
alien equal to so this agent should be
created using an alien object or agent
class and then once we got an alien what
we'll do is we'll say new alien we want
to we want to add this kill set right so
it's a new alien dot skills is equal to
now see you are calling this plus
function from a1 right now in fact a1 is
also an alien here and a 2 is also agent
so in total we have two objects in this
parameter you are expecting only one
Jake what about the second object so the
second object is actually calling this
calling this function so we can refer
that as using at this keyword again the
same way you do it in Java right so in
Java this refer the current object here
also this refers the current object so
who is calling plus a1 is calling plus
so a1 will be referred as this what you
are passing in the in this you are
passing a which is a 2 so a 2 becomes a
so we say this dot skills and then you
will give a space in between and you
will say a dot skills so you are adding
both the skills in one a lien awesome
right and then at the end will return
new alien right so you can see it is
working now so this function works even
if in alien we don't have a plus
function we can call this function with
the help of a 1 that's the power of
extension functions right and I know in
examine in your mind you are thanking
Cottle in his awesome right yes cotton
is very awesome so let's run this code
once again forward to blenders so at the
end I will say a 3 8 3 . i will say show
so that it will show in his skills and
if you run this code
the first a1 will print a java second
will print SQL third will print java and
SQL both and you see that yes that is
your extension functions and Kotlin so I
hope you enjoyed this concept where you
have you can have an exchange in' again
i know this was not that in java it is
there in quatrain and that's why i'm
saying Kotlin makes java more strong so
that's it guys that's addressed from
extension functions in the next video
we'll talk about insects and operator
overloading so that's a thank you so
much for watching and do subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
