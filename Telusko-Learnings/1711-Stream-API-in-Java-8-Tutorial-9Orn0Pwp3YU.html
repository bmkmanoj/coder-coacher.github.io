ready from peaceful earthlings and in
this video we'll talk about stream API
now as you know in the earlier videos we
have talked about the new features in
Java 8 right in this video we'll talk
about one of the most amazing concept in
Java 8 which is stream API again I'm not
saying that the earlier features which
is a lambda expression and what we had
we had those static methods they are not
amazing but this is very different what
we are doing in Java okay so in Java 8
we can also use functional programming
and this is the way you can use it again
that's trim API so just to demonstrate
how exactly stray PPI works let's start
with an example okay so let's say you
have a list of values how much value
we'll take let's say we take hundred
values okay so how do you create a list
so you say list and then you must
mention their integer and then new
ArrayList right and the way you can put
values there are multiple ways of
putting the values but let's say we are
using add method and we want to add 100
values so technically we couldn't go
both for loop right so this is the way
you can just you know in this in this
way you can actually add 100 values so
let's say you've got hundred values now
now what next now we want to you know
print all those values so how do you
print it so we can use normal for loop
or they can use enhanced for loop right
so let's say if I am using enhanced for
loop so we got a list in which we have
100 values so we have added all those
values with a for loop and now we are
printing it with enhanced for loop right
quite simple right now this is what we
know from collection API but if you have
seen my earlier videos or lambda
expression or for each method we also
know that we can print those values with
the help of internal iteration now if
you have not seen those videos make sure
you watch those videos first and then
come back to this video okay so first
you have to make sure that you know how
it is lambda expression you know about
the concept of internal iteration then
only see this video otherwise just you
can just skip this go back to the
previous videos or search for the videos
in which you have talked about this and
then you can continue okay so once once
we have added the values and then once
we have printed the values let's see
what are different ways of doing this so
this one of the way is using for each
method right so you can simply use
values
forage in bracket you can mention the
lambda expression which is I add odd we
can use the method reference again we
have seen this in the earlier videos so
using method reference you can print all
the values right so that's quite simple
right so instead of instead of using
enhanced for loop to print the values we
can actually use for each method hold on
we have not came we have not started
with stream yet
okay now let's convert this into stream
now how do you convert it actually so it
is very simple if you have seen the in
the earlier image we have talked about
values dot for Detroit but in this we
just have to change with one method so
earlier we would having values dot for
each this time we'll go for values dot
stream dot forage simple so that stream
method will convert your normal list
into a stream which is which will have
list of values right so we have values
list which which will have some values
even in stream you you will have values
but then question arise what is the
advantage anyway we can use for each
with list and we can use forage which
stream was the advantage right so that
that will see in this image if you see
this example now we can actually use
something called as parallel stream okay
so let's say you have you have
approximately ten thousand values and
you want to print all those values with
printing you are doing some extra stuff
also so what happens is in your machine
you'll be having octa-core CPU you might
be having quad code machine so to
achieve to handle to work with all the
cores so if you have focus again if you
don't know this multi-threading make
sure you watch the multi-threading video
ok because to understand this concept we
we we should know the idea of threads ok
so let's imagine in your machine you
have four cores and to eat to use each
code we need a thread and by default we
have just one thread right so as a user
as a programmer we have to create those
threads why should we create those
threads when you can get those threads
for free I mean exactly in fact threads
using threads also we can get for free
but this time you don't have to create
threads you just have to mention
parallel if you make it parallel
method
automatically it will create multiple
threads for you okay how much depend
upon the available cause if you have
focus available it will create four
threads if it is two-thirds I will -
cause I was able it will create two
threads for you quite simple right now
what we'll do is we'll sew so that so we
can use stream and we can use parallel
stream right that's one advantage do we
have another advantage here yes
stream has lots of methods okay when I
say lots of methods literally there are
lots of methods to work with now what
are these methods actually used for
so if you know in this world this is
information age right so in this
information age we have lots of data to
work with and that's why we have a
concept of big data head you of all the
stuff right and in this all this concept
we have to process huge amount of data
and in stream API we have lots of
methods to process this data example
let's say you have these top values and
from those list of values you want to
remove some values let's say you want
only five values or you you have list of
values in which you only want add
numbers you can use stream API
okay used to filter on those elements
because in stream we have certain
methods like filter so in this filter
you can mention I want odd numbers it
will only give you odd numbers you have
a method like map if you want to convert
a value into another value let's say you
have a list of values you have one to
ten you want to make it you have to
multiple you want to multiply each value
you can use map you want to convert all
double value into integer value you can
do that you there is a method class map
to int right
so in the stream API we have lots of
methods using which you can process data
but that's not the only advantage you
have you have one more advantage in
stream we have two types of methods one
is intermediate methods and then we have
terminate methods now what exactly it
means let's say you have stream of
values so whatever exactly this we have
this watch stream is because it's that a
stream of water you know once the value
has been used
you cannot reuse the values example if
you have list of values and you are
doing some stuff with list of values you
can use the same list of values multiple
times right so let us say you have a
list of values you have printed those
values once you can also print those
values second time
you can print those value third time but
what about stream once you use streams
stream values once you cannot reuse it
okay so let's let's say if you have this
method here which is let's say filter
okay so is it filter yeah so we have
let's say we have a method which is
filter and then in this filter we are
passing a lambda expression again for
that you have to understand why Z lambda
expression means and how filter exactly
works that we'll see in the next video
in fact the coming videos but if you
talk about filter it takes a predicate
okay and if you if you print something
there if you want to print hi and if you
run this code now any any guess what
will be the output since we have hundred
values so we should be printing hi
hundred times right
but hold on this this code will act will
not get executed even if you are
executing this it will not give you any
compile time error it will it will run
perfectly but you will not get any
output it's because this method is
intermediate method and this is also
called as lazy evaluation since we are
not doing any stuff we are just we are
just filtering the values right but we
are not printing it then why to even
execute that okay so stream is lazy okay
but if you want to find the value okay
let's say you want to find the first
value so there is a method versus point
first now find first is like a
termination method if you have a five if
you have a fine first method it will
actually find the first value and if you
run this code it will execute that high
ones make sense
but hold on fine first will give you
optional value or integer value so what
we need is we have to we have to print
this into system dot out dot println so
that you will get the values okay that's
how it works
so stream once use cannot be reused okay
now what exactly it means so before that
we have one more thing if you are using
fine first fine first will give you
optional right but let's I don't want
optional oh why why gives you optional
hold on so let's say you have list of
five values and you want to print all
odd numbers quite simple right you can
filter out the odd numbers I mean you
can filter out the even numbers you will
get only odd numbers but what if
in your code you don't have in your
values that don't have any odd number
what will be the output nothing right
that's why stream API provides you
something I was optional maybe your
niece doesn't have a value or it doesn't
have any odd number so it will give you
optional right but if you lives let's
say if you if you get an optional value
you want to plane something else we can
also use all else method as you can see
in the example but that's the key that's
the thing next we have let's say okay so
let's talk about stream down so let's
say you have stream of values okay and
you want to use this the same stream two
times can we do it if I use the same
stream two times so if I use it for the
first time here you it will work okay so
you can see you can say this stream of
values dot find a for each and if you
print all the values it will work but if
you use the same method next time for
the same stream it will give you
exception or it will give you a de which
is exception right it's because once
this stream is used we cannot you cannot
reuse it okay but what about what about
least you can reuse you can use the
least multiple times but not stream
okay so stream provides you some
advantages and even this is not a
drawback right because you don't want to
preserve stream that's not the whole
intention here the intention is just to
process data okay so this is like stream
of data you want to process that's it
okay that's how your stream if you API
works now how exactly to do all this
stuff and in the practical that we'll
see in the coming videos so in general
stream is a new concept in java 8 which
provides you to process huge amount of
data it has lots of methods it also has
a feature of parallel stream so we'll
see that in example also when you start
with the implementation we'll also talk
about the normal stream and parallel
stream how exactly parallel stream works
ok so that's it from this video that's
all about stream API so that's it thanks

the channel and do is it the website for
for questions and for tests thank you so
