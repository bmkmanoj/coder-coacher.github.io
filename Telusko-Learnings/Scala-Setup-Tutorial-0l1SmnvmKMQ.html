from the visible earthlings and in this
video we'll see how to set up scholar
now once we have once we know what is
Scala once we know why we need to learn
it and the Pyrrhic was it and the
prerequisite to learn Scala is Java of
course so you should know the basics of
java and you're good to go so let's in
this video we'll see how to set up
scholar so that you can work on it and
of course right when you work with any
programming language let's say say C I
mean C C++ Java the first step you have
you do is you download some software so
that we can work on it
so first color what we need now Scala
since as we know that Scala works on JVM
so that means since color box on JVM
Eclipse support the languages which
works on JVM so we can run Scala on
Eclipse right and that's one of the
amazing thing about Scala so you can you
don't have to learn a different ID for
that you can simply use Eclipse which is
our old golden eye tips which we work
with Java right so we can we can do we
can work with Scala on Eclipse also but
if you go to the official website of
Scala so you just have to search for
Scala and it will take you to the
official website which is Scala Lang
Obagi right and if you go here so city
heading it is object-oriented meets
functional and is Awesomeness you know
Scala is both
object-oriented and functional so it has
lots of power in it so if you want to be
a powerful programmer Scala is the way
and the latest version of Scala is 2.11
point H and these are the features of
Scala it says Java interoperability or
then type inference then it is which
provides concurrency and distribution it
supports higher order function we are
they excited for this part then it has
pattern matching
it has threads now if you know
interfaces in Java that is threads and
traits and in Scala I have to learn the
pronunciation of it first okay so we can
so we can go through this download tab
here and if you click on this download
you can see your you got three options
so you got this option which is the
download or the binary version of it so
that you can if you want to work in work
on terminal or if you want to work on
CMD this is the best way you can also
use the light bend activator this is
another tool which we can use so if you
use this tool it is a web-based tool so
that means the software will be
installed on your machine but to access
that we have to use web browser so you
will be typing your put in web browser
you will running about it in your web
browser ok this one is amazing tool in
fact if it download this it is very
heavy file around 700 MB from not long
and we can also use the Scala on IDE so
you can run Scala on eclipse you can run
Scala or IntelliJ or you can learn I
mean you can run Scala on NetBeans and
this is I mean so if you work with this
you have to do this step so if you click
on this need help in installation you
have to set all these parts that's one
way a second way if you download this
one again we will be using Scala IDE
Eclipse in for our tutorials but let me
show you how this works so if you
download this part and if you unzip it
this is how it looks so this is how it
will look like go to bin and this option
of activator disk again you don't have
to do this it is just for if you are
curious about it then you can do this
experiment otherwise leave it live this
will say this once we got some
experience on Scala so it will take some
time to open or don't worry I just I've
just changed the point of my terminal
that's why it is giving you showing you
so much bigger I mean big text there so
it will open in this way you can create
a new project so you can creat you can
click on Scala here so this is Scala
i this is slick slick is for the
database i mean if you want to work with
some database framework which scholar we
can use click we can also use play
framework here or plays amazing
framework to work with so if you click
on Scala
it will ask you to create an application
so I have done some experiments so I
already have an application here the
point to remember is this Scala
I mean this fella is supported by
typesafe company and if you click on
this project I mean if you click on the
existing app which I have created so
this is how it looks like I would sit on
an inspector object so that's code
where's my code so this is what I was
doing on that day I was doing some X
and I was spending all those stuff you
can just simply run this code by
clicking here and you can see the output
in the run tab and you can see we got
the output okay so we can we can use
this this window okay but I'm not a big
fan of this window I don't like web
console based things but if you like it
you can you can explore this this thing
there's no harm in that
but my interest is more on the Scala on
Eclipse okay now how to do that so there
are two ways one you can download this
Scala IDE itself which will be around to
200 to 300 MB I'm not sure about the
size the another way is if you already
have eclipse in your machine see if you
can out difficult click on this it will
download the whole Eclipse for you where
you'll be having scholar in build but if
you already have eclipse in your machine
where you you used to work with Java
what you can do is example I have I have
my eclipse here so you can see I have
Eclipse here but in this Eclipse I don't
have Scala you can see if I click on new
there is no skull opposite option here
and even if I change the perspective to
Scala there's no option of Scala here so
for that we have to go to downloads and
latest table you just have to select
this URL here copy it and go to help go
to install new software and you eclipse
and paste that URL here so once you
paste it here it will give you if we
show you all those options and which two
things you have to install you have to
install this Scala IDE for Eclipse and
you have to install scholar worksheet
again we'll talk about worksheet bit
later select those two click on next it
will download this stuff for you and
then you have to say next next and your
Scala will be installed on your Eclipse
now once you install Scala on Eclipse
your Eclipse will look like this ok and
if you open the perspective you can see
you will get Scala there you just have
to click on OK and you will get a
scholar perspective view and now if you
right click on your project will send
you and you got the
option of Scala project now this is
possible only when you have downloaded
the Scala plug-in so click on Scala
project you can give any name with say
first code and you can see it says one
time environment is Java SC
I mean that's awesome right Scala works
on JVM what else we need click on next
and click on finish you've got your
first scala project so you can see it
has two things it has certain it has
certain lab base for Starlite answer to
lobbies for Java that means you can
write Scala code inside this you can
also write a Java pod inside this so you
can write both the codes in one project
and that's why I'm really excited for
this ok so let's say if you are the web
developer and you're walking on Spring
Framework you are walking on hyper date
you can also use Scala in your in your
web application ok so that's not
something which is awesome about
scarlove so that's our first project in
the next video we'll talk about how to
write our first code so yeah that's it
from this video I hope you enjoyed the
video and if you enjoyed it please like

not subscribe and if you like my video
you can also come in with good words or
