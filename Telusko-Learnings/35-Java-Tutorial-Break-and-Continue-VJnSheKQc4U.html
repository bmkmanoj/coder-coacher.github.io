loops let's talk about this jumping
statement called as break and continuum
so what we'll do is let's say I want to
ever have a loop here which is for loop
and I'm starting with one and I mean
this I think this value till 10 and I'm
saying I plus plus so I'm iterating on
loop ten times right so from 1 to 10 I
want to print all the values of I so I
would say value is and then I will print
I so that's how you concatenate two
things so this is your string here and
that's your variable so when you want to
print string and a variable you have to
use a plus operator okay let me just run
this okay so that's the output we are
getting from one to ten but it's I don't
want to print I don't want to print
seven so if the value is seven I don't
want to print it so what I will do is I
will say if the value is 7 and then what
will happen
in this scenario what we'll do is we'll
simply say continue now what it will do
is when you say continue it will first
check ok the value of I is 1 I is not
equal to 7 it will print it then 2 eyes
not equal to save I mean 2 is not equal
to 7 it will print it but as nose here I
becomes 7 it says continue now convert
continual to us it will skip the
remaining statements in the block so it
will skip the remaining statement the
block from here to here it will not
execute any statement and then it will
jump to the next iteration which is 8 so
continue we'll skip that one iteration
there and you can see if I on this code
we are getting all the numbers from 1 to
10 except 7 you can see over to 6 we got
eight because false 7 I'm saying
continue right with us the importance of
continue so if you want to skip the for
loop if you want to skip the iteration
we can use continue statement that's
what is jumping it is for jumping
statement if you want to change the
condition let's say I would don't want
to print all the codes I just want to
play in the numbers which are less than
5 so I want to print from 1 to 5 not 6 7
8 9 10 so in that scenario I will say if
my I value is greater than 5 in that
scenario just break it so break means it
will directly break the for loop it will
directly go out so break we'll break the
blue it will go out if you can see 4 on
this quad record only 1 2 4
so difference between continued and
breakers in continue it will skip the
current iteration that's it it will
complete the remaining iteration the
break we'll break the loop so it will
not allow any further statement to be
executed okay so even if I say I equal
to equal to five here if you're thinking
that it is because of all the various a
greater than five let's say if I equal
to five if it works same as continued it
should print the other stuff right but
it's not printing the other stuff it is
breaking the loop from this block so
that's how you use break and continue in
Java so that's it from this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
