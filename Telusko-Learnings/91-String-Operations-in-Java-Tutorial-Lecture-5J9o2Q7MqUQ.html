video we'll talk about some string
operations so in this video we'll talk
about this question where you have
writer program to accept two string from
the user and perform the following
operations
so first we'll do is find out the length
of both the strings
well concatenate this two string and
then we'll convert the first string into
our pockets so let's start with the
tasks so let me go back to my IDE which
is NetBeans so the first task is to find
out the length of both the strings okay
so let's take this input from user so in
order to take the input from user first
we'll take two string will say s1 and s2
so we have this two string and to take
input from user we can use something
called a scanner class here services
scanner is equal to new scanner and this
will say this is a system dot in okay so
to take input from user we have to use a
class which is scanner and then we are
to specify from where you'll be getting
the input which is system dot n in order
to use the scanner class we need to
import the package and the package we
require here earth which is a Java dot
util so we'll import that package using
ctrl shift a shortcut in NetBeans and
now once you got the object of scanner
let's assign that value to s1 so before
that we'll ask user to enter value so we
say enter two strings okay so once you
see this message you say within touch to
string or to string values so one we
will store in s1 which is s C dot so in
order to take the input from user V into
an a string value right so this SC
object which is object of scanner class
has lots of methods so one of the method
is next line so next line will give you
the string so we got string one we got
let's talk about string - so this is
your string - which is again next line
now we got now we got to string
let's see what next now once you got
this to string let's concatenate them
now in order to concatenate two strings
let's use the third variable which is s3
and how to concatenate so string class
let's say we do you have some method yes
we have a method here so it says concat
you have to pass string two so courts s1
dot concat s2 it will return a string
and let's print that value so it says
out and we'll say concat t is a result
of concatenation is - and the value will
be s 3 so this s 3 will have a value of
s1 plus s2 so let's try to run this
let's see if you are getting the first
operation so we say shift F sex which
waiting for the toy input will say hello
everyone so that's my first string enter
it's waiting for the second string we'll
say welcome to telesco Lovings
and you can say the answer is its
concatenated so we are getting hello
everyone welcome to else for learnings
because that's how you have to
concatenate two string so this is the
only way to concatenate so we have one
more way so what we can do is we can
also use so we'll just come in this part
is a comment it's there so in order to
contact we can also use s1 + s2 ok so
this is this is also this is also the
way you can know and I can contact to
string and if you run this this time I
will likely go with some blah blah blah
statements and again some blah blah blah
statement so it is again going for
concatenation okay so we have we have
this two ways one is your plus operator
or either you can use the method of
string class which is concat so that is
our first operation now let's see the
second operation here oh we're done with
oh we have done with the second
operation so just start with the first
one which is find out the length of
those strings so I have done the reverse
part so this is your second apart so how
to find the length so we'll say length
will be saved in int variable we say l1
to store the length of the first string
now in order to fetch the length of the
first string will say s1 dot so there's
a method called as lengths
straightforward okay and we'll say l2
which in which will be having the second
statement we'll say s 2 dot length so in
l1 we have s1 dot land and in l2 we have
s 2 dot length that's when this length
will say s out I will say string 1 or
string 1 then s will say :
and we'll print plus l1 which will be in
the string that string 1 length and it's
copied a statement down using ctrl shift
down arrow with a string to length is i2
simple and if it on this let's enter 2
statement with one is lemon ready and
second is that is true okay if I say
enter now so the length of the first
string is 11 the second day is 7 cool so
that's our second task of first and
second task done now convert the first
string into upper case okay so we had to
convert the first ring into uppercase
for that what we'll do is we'll go down
here because this is the start step so
let me just write here this is step one
this is step two and let's go for step
please which is this step leap now in
step three we have to we have to convert
the first string into uppercase which is
o s only the first string here so in
order to convert into upper case is
straightforward with s1 equal to s1 dot
so there is a method called as odd to
uppercase so if you use the inbuilt
function of string class which has a
method for the to uppercase it will
convert your string into
upper case okay now let me print the
value
so we'll say a first string in upper
case okay and we'll print so we'll save
space :
and we'll print here s1 okay and now if
it on this so let's take the same thing
I mean ready and that is co and if I say
enter so again the length is 11 and 7 so
we got navigate am telesco and you can
see the first string get converted into
the uppercase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
