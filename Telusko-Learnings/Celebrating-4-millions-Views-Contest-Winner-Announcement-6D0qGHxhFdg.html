that and the last point is watch so I
will so last week I have announced that
so I'm selling the new course right with
coach abacos so these are the paid
courses kochava paid cause and then
advanced java paid cause i know i have

certain charges there are certain
charges for the Pecos right of course i
have to i am charging for that but since

financial reason so i'm giving this
cause for free for those people who're
cannot afford it so every batch will
have one odd one or more one or more
participants will be will be learning

thing and so we be announcing that in in
the in shop in some do at some point so
so here we go the first thing so thank

this a good number of reviews which is
four million views i was not i mean i
have never imagined that i will be
getting so many views on youtube i was
happy when i was getting 100 views 200
views per day and now i'm getting a huge
number of views i'm very happy for that
sometimes thanks for supporting I don't
know so that you you people are my
motivation you know because of you I i
get i make more videos on youtube and so
i'm improving myself so that i can make
more videos you know because i am NOT
nakhon right to know everything but
still I want to make more videos and
that's why I'm creating I'm making more
videos i'm learning new stuff you know
this only recently I've started building
Scala so that I can teach you people I
mean that I guess that's the only reason
why I'm letting scholars to teach you
people right so you people are my
motivation so keep motivating me so yeah
so thank you so much for your support
and they do share with your friends my
channel awesome subscribe and they can
with you they can also learn from me
right so that's that's my motivation ok
so that's about the celebration now
let's talk about IT belongs to signs or
promise that's the question right and
after that we'll announce the will
announce the winner for the pain where
course or case of the pay the winner
will get the free goes from there is for
learnings ok core java cause ok so i'm
getting lots of questions guys hold on
hold with your questions okay i'm
getting lots of questions here let me
finish the topic and then we'll go for a
quick question round so I t belongs to
science or commerce that's a question so
the answer is IT belongs to okay so
people who are from science background
don't feel disheartened right because
see even i when i when i completed my
10th standard i went for signs 11 12 i
dint my science which is HSE signs and
after that I have done be a CIT then
have done mscit you know I'm so proud of
myself that you know I'm from science
background so when I went people ask me
what you have done all your commerce
or science always say I'm from science
you know I have been master of science
in information technology that's a good
thing right so you we are from science
but unfortunately are not unfortunately
but I t is not science I te llamas okay
again it's a big debate but I T is
commerce now why these comas is because
okay let's let's analyze what I T is
doing so I T stands for information
technology right and so when you say
information technology it simply means
slow day and day out you are only
working with information think about
ebanking think about e-commerce websites
wait when it when you say I teeth
everything comes around you right we
have ERP system we have CRM system in
fact I got lots of lots of comment on
those videos people were like okay let
me just reduced without the comments
which I got for that video and we'll try
to decide what exactly it is I mean as
for me it is commerce but let's let me
just also give you the reason why i say
commerce but before that I want to see
what is there what is their comment in
this so I got some comments on that
video let me just check it out okay
where is that was that is that
okay here we go so I got approximately
14 comments on that video okay let me
just read out the first comment so it is
from deeper dance of science alone
cannot survive without ID so is saying
that science works with ID because there
is many educational branches like matcha
tronox I don't know what that means the
bar takes so all this are done with
programming so you according to you it
is signs sure she does says it is not
just programming developing it's also
includes business right so I tis not
just about programming it's not java
development it's also about business
customer relationship and client
satisfaction that is your that is so she
their plot points then we have web or
shinda he says I t is a branch of
science oh so it so I to includes logic
and logic means mats and that's why I t
is science because match is my match is
signs right so itís signs it is the
point of web oh then we have amith Hamid
says he he doesn't agree with Weber he
says 75 person it is okay so you say
only twenty-five percent okay that's a
confusing thing let's let's skip that
okay so some people from I mean one guy
from s aged he says that IT
certification okay so we have to we have
to field one is a calm signs and one is
IT so palm signs belongs to science and
IT belongs to commerce that's that's is
point I guess okay that's okay some
people say it is both let me go back
here
ok
I guess let me share this length on
YouTube
okay that is weird YouTube is asking me
for facebook so just shade the link on
facebook if so you can help me out I
have shared a link on on Facebook just
share that link with your friends so
that your friends would also know that
we are doing some stuff on YouTube okay
so so i think is so let's let me put in
my point so I T is commerce okay it's
because I T deals with business IT deals
with I mean I deduce with business right
because that is what you are doing so if
you talk about ebanking ecommerce then
we have a silent sister of CRM system
then we have ERP system everything deals
with that deals with IT right i mean
everything is everything is done by IT
so I t basically belongs to business and
business is commerce when it comes to
science part it is basically a comp
science you know working with data
processing data also doing some
scientific thing on data it is your palm
signs or you can say information signs
okay so even if you are from science
background i if you are learning IT that
means you are moving towards business
you are moving towards you're moving
towards commerce right so you are doing
i.t so by no mean I'm saying commerce is
not good it's just that I key doesn't
belongs to science it is it belongs to
commerce okay so so so we are from
commerce now so we are the technological
paper in camas field okay and you know
this is there's not much money in in
science right that money is there in
commerce so we are from we are running a
lot from IT we are learning a lot from
softwares so we are from commerce so
that's my point so again you will be
having some debate here so you can put
your points so you can put your points
in the comment section if you are
finding that you if you don't agree
that's okay right everyone everyone have
their own point of view you can that you
can just put that in the comment in the
comment section
okay so yeah that's that's about the
topic and now let's let me just announce
the winner okay and it's time for
winners let me just search for the
candidates so not much of the people
participated in this but hold on so
after after to this announcement so in
future also i will be starting with new

actually you don't know my event okay so
what I'm doing is okay lots of people

is C so I have some okay let me just
enjoys myself now people are questioning
my existence so my name is Devin wendy
and i am running a youtube channel so on
my channel I provide online free videos
but the thing is there are certain
things we cannot do free okay so you
have to pay for that example working on
assignments working on working on
project for that you have to pay okay so
so it is a paid course so there is
certain amount you have to pay for the
course but there are certain people they
cannot pay for the course right they are
maybe they are financially not strong
maybe they are student and even if you
are and I as a student sometime it is
difficult to pay extra piece for to
learn something right so the best way is
so I want to I want to educate more
people that's why I'm starting with this
free cause I mean it's a paid post but
for some people it will be free okay and
so if you want to participate in that
okay for today's event depart the winner
is sagar the contest is very simple what
you have to do is so i have lots of
videos on youtube right so you can do so
the main purpose here is I am doing lots
of I'm making lots of videos on YouTube
the thing is I am I do not know what are
the videos you
Ike and what are the videos who don't
like so I want your feedback on that so
what you can do is you can watch any of
my video that's the contest part you can
watch any of my video and there will be
some good parts and the bad parts of the
video right if I'm getting lots of views
on that video of course it should be
some good parts but there might be some
bad parts also write some drawbacks so
you what you do is you have to watch the
video go to Google I mean go to you go
to Facebook and share the link of the
video on your profile as a public as a
public video k not as a because don't
share with only your friends share it as
a public so the access should be public
and share the video and provide these
content I mean the good things about the
video and the bad things about the video
and just use a hashtag so that I can
search hash telescope ok te l us k oh
and every two week there will be one
winner ok and that's the that's the
contest ok so we have a question here
ok so from my team and getting a point
ok so that's about that's about the
competition let me just go with some
questions and let us try to answer as
much as much as question as possible ok
and
okay so others is starting a new channel
okay others are tip for you I can never
promote your channel on different
channels okay that's a bad bad manners
if you want to get famous create quality
content and it will be helpful for you
but don't don't promote don't promote
your the channel on other channels okay
okay so you are 14 years over those up
for that scare the others make make
something good and make a video on that
but don't promote like this you can what
you can do is that the best way to
promote your channel is make or
accounting to ask your friends to watch
it ask your friends friends to watch it
and use some good description use good
tags but don't promote it on other
channels in fact YouTube will ban you
for that okay if you try it if you try
to do that okay so Praveen Kumar says
please upload java ee videos soon
Praveen i will be uploading that ok i
have some videos on java ee on youtube
but i don't have all the videos I will
do that soon oh ok sort of was the best
free online test to prepare for oh I
don't know just go to google and search
for ocj OC a jpa so you have to it's OC
a I can say Oh CJ ap so you can you can
search for OC a a java certification so
there will be some free test available
i'm not sure about that
thank you everyone for wishing me for
for millions of fun it's not four
million subscribers just four million
views okay some people are getting
okay's it oh sorry my mistake d it is
not four million subscriber it is four
million views I made a mistake there
it's four million views okay it's a good
to drop a year for android development
so this from tech therapy before going
to college for a degree okay so I would
not suggest you to take a break from the
college because they in India if you are
taking a break that's a very bad thing
because if you join a company they will
be asking you this question okay don't
take a gap you can do development
anytime you want right you don't spend
your whole day in college so to go to
college complete degree and Pat early
working for two to three hours a day you
can complete your app don't take a break
that's not good that's not a good thing
okay next so this FX you cleared my an
exception handling oh I clear your
doubts on expanding gauge so I am
putting happy about that and that's how
I get motivated you know i'm able to i'm
able to help people that's important so
we shall sing like i have god testing
profile in my company is it is it there
any future scope in that of course you
have a future scope in testing the only
thing is once you start with testing for
at least six months do whatever your
company says but after that in a breed
your profile you know as solar
suggesting you can go for automation
testing that is a good thing that will
be with best thing for you this is
always go for testing okay it's not just
about development testing is also
important
okay so it is abhilasha Alma will
learning java will be helpful in third
year for it Electrical see learning java
is like upgrading your skills right and
once you learn Java you can jump to any
language at any point you know today you
are today you know today you know Java
in future you can work on Java you can
you can switch to other languages also
so it's always a better thing to good
thing to learn but the only thing is
once you learn it being a touch with it
okay if you if you don't do it for one
week or two weeks everything will vanish
from your brain so so keep practicing it
okay next question organist pace from
lambretta Congress 0 for 4 million views
thank you know Gotye it's all because of
your support okay
okay so question from mahesh what is
difference between Hadoop and scholar so
Hadoop is a ecosystem for big data it's
a framework and Scala is just a
programming language like Java so Scala
is the upgrade version of Java okay so
scholars ish language and head to be the
ecosystem nice oh so Gotham says I want
to get into Google oh that's weird so to
get into google it is very simple you
have to ok so first of all I would
suggest is go to Google careers website
and find out what type of skills they
need ok basically Google want people who
are good with thinking who are good with
analytical skills and I should be saw
you should be able to solve any given
problem using algorithms they are not
focused on coding they are focused mode
on algorithms how can you solve a given
problem right we're optimization all the
stuff so I've where your skills on that
portion walking on data structures and
all the stuff so even I I'm not sure but
you can we can start from that are you
can be you can take part in hacker earth
ok so go to hiker earth website and
participate in different competitions if
you win one of the competition Google
might hire you ok so soil javed say is
providing such a wonderful education
thank you sir could you provide a great
video series on java app the other paint
yeah when I am planning to do that I'm
trying to start with a projects in re ok
but it will take time since I am
focusing mode on Scala now but if you
take time I will do to assure ok kevin
says so I want to learn android
programming so that the Java EE is
required than Java SE oh no once you
know java SE which is this decode java
you can go for android directly the only
thing is you should also know about xml
and if you know swing java swing
which is the GUI of java if you know
that android becomes more easier okay
but it there is no need to learn java e
to be an Android developer ok so Akshay
kunda you came for the first time on my
channel so welcome Akshay I hope you
will be learning lots of stuff
ok
I guess I have skipped some questions
hey wherewhere are questions i guess i
have just skipped all the questions i
got the questions
okay i'm getting all the repeated
questions okay shake is the price for
the winner as they are getting the cause
for free so the Pecos which I am
providing by spy paying some some amount
your they are getting this pose for free
okay so how much so it is how much you
earn from YouTube quiet amount I mean
was very small amount on from YouTube
not much because I don't do youtube
videos for earning i do youtube videos
to educate people okay which but i do
paid courses for earning okay i have to
fill up my my stomach right so i have my
i have to earn my bread and butter but
youtube is for you to this is for
educating people not to learn from it
okay watching your videos i got job hey
I just peek I don't know your name just
pique but that's great you got the job
so by watching my videos you got the job
ok it's I guess it is because they are
you feel it's because of your hard work
ok I mean my job my videos are good but
all because of your your hard work you
got the job at Oracles of
congratulations and share my video is
there to a lack of people tell them I'm
promoting their language ok be
certification is important read hot Java
for future depend upon this Turkish
depend upon what you want to do so if
you want to get into seven level if you
want to get into linux environment of
course go for that hacked but if you
want to go into programming of course
you have to go for java depend upon what
you want to do is depend upon that you
will choose something so question from
vamsi and one see i have taken advanced
java is my core subject I was poor in
kochava so I'm feeling difficult to
understand so just me something to
overcome the problem so to to learn cojo
it's very simple go to my channel and
watch those 178 videos on youtube and
you know on Java so you will learn the
codes apart and then you can you can be
an advanced Park or to learn advanced
java you can be a member of my course
the paid pose and you will done that ok
so I don't what is your opinion I mean I
don't question from I don't what is the
opinion on ms in CSC it's a good thing I
mean if you are doing it properly then
it's an amazing thing lots of
opportunities but with that you can also
certified in some language so get the
house i defied there will be a good
scope after that ok question from gu bc
i don't know what is your full name
certifications are important but the
thing is let's say if you if you wanted
to get you to java and then if you are
claiming that you know java how company
will know that you know java so you have
to show certificate right otherwise you
can make some projects in java and you
can show those projects to your
interviewer that's there are two ways to
impress people so I mean it's always a
good way to get certified so if you can
invest time and money get your
certification
okay and last five minutes let me answer
some okay so question from large how is
the winner will be selected so winner
will be selected based on the based on
the criteria so first when you upload
when you share the videos you have to
make sure that you are sharing the video
you are making the making the post as
public and you are specifying something
from the video which will be helpful for
me okay for some of the good things and
some bad things okay so that i can
improve myself there and that that's the
criteria for winning the competition and
then my team will select one of them
okay so my team will do some research
the day which is uploaded and and how
many views that post god how many likes
that post god so everything will be
considered and one will be selected from
that
so Bible says you inspired and inspire
me to good good for those oh thank you
so much whether that means a lot I just
happy that my videos are helping people
nagaraja was his daughter in business
better I guess the future is open source
and the jar will be there for a long
time so i would suggest always of course
i was at this java to you okay and then
last two minutes a high me he'd okay so
yeah last week I went to last week I was
having at winning at L&amp;amp;T infotech and me
here is from there so thank you behave
so Weber says what are your future plans
what is that big thing that you're going
to come up with note to surprise your
subscribers any plan I'm planning to
make all our videos and okay so self oh
ok this there's a surprise but I why I
should tell you the surprise surprise
white rebel okay so okay that's it yeah
so one last thing my last thing so I'm
getting lots of questions about the
communication how can you improve your
communication okay I'm telling you from
I mean I'm telling this from a long time
communication is not about okay before
that before they doing that that is so
when you're watching this video there's
a like button there okay make sure you
click on the like button so that they
will know that you have liked this video
or the dislike button then click on the
dislike button so that it will know that
you have not liking this video or you
can comment in the comments section if
you are watching this video later I mean
later on not life about your experience
here okay so yeah so how to increase
your communication the best way in fact
I was very poor in communication so if
you if you look at me and I few if you
see me five to six years back or seven
years back I was I was very bad with
communication how I improve my
communication I don't know how good I am
now but how I improved it first by
talking okay you have to interact with
people
you have to interact with people while
smiling because the moment you smile the
other person smiles and the movement
other person smiles it gives you a
conference to talk okay so always smile
and so that's that's the best way so
communicate with people read articles
watch movies I know I always try to copy
actor so if i watch hollywood movie i
try to copy those actors how they talk
how they behave and all those stuff so
try to copy them try to copy the accent
and the I mean communication is also
about your boy language so don't talk to
people only with words talk to people
with your expressions talk to people
with your body language I feel that is
something which is
hey you
okay there's something
ok so that's that's the thing difference
between oh that's it that's it that's it
from this video if you have some more
questions just ferment it that's about
the live session I'm tired now and
thanks for your support that's it thank
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
