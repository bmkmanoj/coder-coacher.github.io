from those coordinates and in this video
we'll talk about jst L so the
prerequisite to learn jst L as solids
and JSP so if you have basic knowledge
of servlet and JSP this video will be
helpful so what is gstl so gstl so why
did he also jst L stands for JSP
standard tag library ok now why we use
this is because you know when you work
with servlet so we write HTML code
inside Java code and that's not that
helpful right and then in JSP in JSP we
write we write Java code so insert HTML
code via our code but still as a
designer we are not that comfortable to
work with Java codes right so if you can
convert your Java code into HTML like
code it will be much easier for
designers to write the code it will be
easier for them to maintain the code it
is easier for them to change the code
right so that's why we have this concept
of gstl and if you see the output of
jstor the code of jst L it's more like
HTML right so let's try to do that so to
explain that how J's TLO works let me go
with an example here and I will create a
one more I will quit okay for that I
will just simply okay I will create a
variable which is string I will say name
equal to I will put my name Lavigne and
then I will send this name to the JSP
file so let me first call JC file and
how do you call it will say request the
Oracle dispatcher so it is request
dispatcher will say Rd equal to nu nu
but request dot get liquid dispatcher
and we have to mention the name of the
JSP obviously which is display dot JSP
right so what we are doing here is we
are calling a JSP file from from a solid
file and we can say our DDOT forward and
we can pass those two objects so what we
are doing is we are creating a string
here and then we are calling this JC
page now in this JC page will try to
fetch that string that value which is
name
okay first of all when you are sending
it you have to make sure that you add
that value somewhere so I can use the
quest object or we can also use session
object we'll say this is label again we
can have any label here and we can say I
want to send name so I'm using a label s
label and then I am sending this name so
in this name I will be having a bean
right now if I run this code of course
it will call your JC file right but we
are not we're doing they are doing
nothing here now how do you face that
value so before fetching the value I
will simply print hello world okay and
let's let you run this code if I now
this code on a server I'm going to have
a server here and I'm just calling that
it will take some time okay yeah so you
can see we have we are calling a
subdivision demo servlet and this
servlet will cause your JSP now since
I'm running this for the first time it
will take some time for your JSP to get
converted into servlet and then showing
you the output so you got the output as
hello world here but I don't want hello
world I want to print I want to play
Naveen here now how do we do that so for
that we have to use some Java codes
right in fact we can write Java code
here and to write Java could we use this
triplet tags and inside this we can
write we can fetch that value we can
store that value in string we'll say
string name equal to request dot get
attribute can attribute and you can
mention what type of whatever value are
sending so I am sending a label which
you have to fetch again this will return
you an object so let me just convert
that into string so I was a to string
right now once you got the string we can
say out dot println and we can say name
so what we are doing here is we are
fetching value from I mean we are we
have this value Naveen which is going to
the JSP and then we are fetching the
value from the requester object and then
we are printing it I can since we are
using request object here to set the
attribute we will be using request
object to get the attribute right let's
run this let me just run this once again
and you can see we got the authorized
Naveen
now why we are getting a win is because
in JSP we are fetching the value which
sent and then they are printing it this
is one way but if we can see as a
designer you are comfortable with this
lines of code but the moment you see a
Java code you might not feel confident
about it then Java says ok chill we can
have one more way here we can use or we
can use something called as expression
language so expression language was
introduced in JSP later and how it is
used so we can use a dollar sign here
with a curly brackets and inside your
curly brackets you can simply mention
the label ok whatever label you are
sending there so if you are sending
label here we have to mention that here
ok so if you say dollar and curly
brackets label it will fetch that value
ok let me show you that let me just say
once again and you can see we got two
Naveen the first moment we caught
because of this Java code the second
Naveen you got because of this line here
ok now let me just remove this Java Cori
I don't want Java code so using this one
line of code we can get our output is
Naveen but this is expression language
ok but expression language was created
just to just to I mean just to get used
inside gstl so if you are using jst M
then you can use this and how it was how
it was introduced so what we can do is I
mean we can we can have one more way of
just real way here so in order to use
jst L we need to use some special tags
example in J still we have our out tag
instead of using out object we can use a
out tag but the problem is out tag is
not available inside HTML right it is a
custom tag and whenever you want to use
custom tag we have to use our tag
library right so we have to add a
library for gstl now which library we'll
be using here so we'll use percentage
utter it with a tag lip and we need to
use a gstl tag ok
now question arise which how to use J
style tag here that we'll see in the
next video the pointer member here we
are using a
we can use eel instead of using your
java tag to use to print something on
this server now again
it's not compulsory to have that in
request object itself we can also have
that and session object we can also have
that in page object because you know
right J and JSP we have different
objects so you can have this label in
any of the scope it may be in request
cup it may be in session scope it may be
in page scope or page context it can be
anywhere so that's how we use e el in
JSP in the next video we'll see how to
add the tag library in jst to use it
