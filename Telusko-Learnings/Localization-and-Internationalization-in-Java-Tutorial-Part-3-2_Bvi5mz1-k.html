so for let's let's go for a different
language and this time we'll go for you
know which language maybe we'll go for
Swedish I don't know you go for this now
I'd to put in this thing the wish is
this so far for this thing what we're to
do is we'll create one more I'd go for
the finish will go for Dutch stretch -
oh yeah this is a German language do we
have another German a German easier this
is German says something la blah blah so
videos videos German language to use
German languages right click on your
package again click on a property file
at this time you have to mention your
property file in our different a name
now you have to mention bundle and then
you have to give underscore it is the
format you have to follow and then you
have to mention the language name with
exact language name is GE and then then
the countries country name and the
country name is again a GE so G is
German and then you click on finish now
once you click on finish again we to
mention here again swish your key or
your key name I might to mention the
value and values this it's a copy
and with the paste simple so you have to
use this type of text and you can copy
you can create multiple very multiple
keys here so you can have let's say by
hello all this texture but this time
we'll go for only one data so we'll say
wish now I had to change something from
E and I should make it GE and from us
are gonna need to make it G E and that's
it if I understood now you can say we
are getting data from different bundle
now question arise I am just mentioning
here bundle I have not mentioned the
file name which is bundle underscore GE
underscore GE
and that's the advantage of using this
bundle since we are mentioning here
locale it will fetch the language and
the country it will assign or it will
append that thing after this bundle you
have so this is how you have to use
resource bundle with a different
language and so you can also work with
Hindi so what we can do is we can simply
say it says yeah so this is Jenny Medina
Mubarak so copy this thing and create
one more property file
I'd like property and within this has
again bundle under scope for Hindi the
languages are the code is H I and the
country is I and India with a finish and
here in this wish I would specify gender
is Mubarak and in my locale demo I just
specified the language name which is H I
and you can specify country name as high
end and if you on this code now the
output is generally Nevada right so the
important thing is you can you have to
specify the locale you can specify the
language and country and then you have
to fetch the key I can even take the
input off or language name and country
from the user if user enters Ge Ge the
output should be there near one which is
this one
if using does H I and I and the output
should be this one yeah so this is how
you have to use locale and users printed
in the next video will talk about we
talk about the swing application in
which will it will implement this thing
and very efficiently</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
