from police car learnings and in this
video we'll talk about one of the methyl
which is very famous when you work with
JDBC is for name so the class name is
class and the method name is Ford name
so we use this method to load the driver
toy so to load and raise our driver we
use class dot Ford name but what exactly
does so for that what we'll do is we'll
try to do a simple code without JDBC so
let's say we have a class here which is
PQ R ok so we have this class P Q R and
in this class we have a static block so
if you do not know the static block it
is a block which will be which will be
executed once the once you load the
class so we have a static block and then
we have something or this instance block
so this is an instance block so let's
say if I print here and I will say this
is in instance and we print here this
out in static okay and if I done this
code so you can see we - we are not
calling anything from the main method
and if I run this code so you can see we
got nothing but as soon as I create
object of PQ R so I will say P Q R obj
equal to nu P Q R and if I run this code
so you can see it executes the static
block and then it executes the instance
block now why is the case is because the
whenever you want to create the object
so this is let me just write here in the
comments so this is instance block and
this one is a static block so whenever
you create an object so before creating
the object it will first load the class
and while loading your class it will
call the static method or static block
while you are creating the object it
will call the instance okay so that
means whenever you create the object you
get two things the static block and the
instance block right but let's say I do
not want to create the object but still
I want to call the static block so what
we can do is we can load the class so in
order so if you load the class it will
execute a static block right now how to
load the class so to load the class we
have to use
glass dot for name and we can specify
which plus so I want to load the class
which is PQ R ok it will it may tone
exceptions so let's run this also let us
apply the exception if I run this code
you can see we got in static because we
are not creating the object we are just
loading the class and then we have a
method which is new instance ok again
throws an arrow against yeah and let's
run this yeah
so if I say dot new instance it will
create the object so when you will not
when you say dot instance dot new
instance it will create the object but
if you if you just say without this if
you just say dot for name it will be it
will execute on the static block so that
is the advantage of using class dot for
name but let hold on whether would you
work with JDBC so does the point that is
the funder of class name ok so we use
class dot for name to load a class so
that when you load the class it will
execute the static block right so
whenever you work with Jerry basic code
right so you write this statement which
is driver manager we create the object
right so we say connection of con equal
to Java manager and before that line so
before this line so this step is you
have to load and register driver right
so how do you load so whenever you want
to load the driver so we need to use
something called as Java manager dot dot
register register driver in this you
have to create object of the driver so
that's this is the statement we should
be using to register driver because we
have to raise to this driver servicio so
let us say if you are working with mask
you have to know the mask you'll drive
ur
if you are if you are working with
Oracle you have to load out a co-driver
and to do that we have to first use this
Java which is mask you'll connect ur so
the address is comm dot mascot JDBC
dot driver okay so it was one exception
okay let me just write in general
exception instead of writing all the
stuff is the exception so this is the
step we have to use so this is the step
which is responsible to load the driver
right so let us say or they show a
driver so let's say you are using Oracle
so it will be what I call driver here
but instead of doing this stuff what if
we can just specify comm dot mask you
are Gary BC dot
driver so this stuff here is same as
this thing but the question arise how
its same it is because whenever you go
to the driver class of your mask color
connector in this you have a static
block and this static block does the
same thing which you you are trying to
do some simple right so this thing here
so whenever you call cross dot for name
it will call it will load the class why
this class and whenever it loads it will
execute the static block and when we
execute static block it will call the
method which is the register driver so
that means you do not have to write this
statement because you're writing Clause
dot for name so that means whenever you
want to raise to a driver so class dot
Fortnum is not the method which low
which which raise to a driver it is
actually the static block of Java class
which loads to driver this all which
register driver so this class dot for
name it's just loads the driver so that
you can raise your driver here okay so
that is the basic understanding of class
dot for name so that is from this video
