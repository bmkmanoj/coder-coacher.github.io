into J unit for assertions assertions
form a very important part of J unit
library assertions are nothing but we're
in you basically testing for a
functionality you set your expectations
and compare the expectations against the
actual values that you are getting the
actual values that you are getting after
running your applications so you are
asserting that means a set some
expectations okay fine suppose I say I
have two plus two and I'm expecting it
to be four and when I run the
application of AD a man getting four or
not that is actually while running what
I am getting the values and I am
expecting if I am providing two plus two
I am asserting that this particular
operation after evaluation gives me four
only so that's my expectations
assertions program concessions are an
important part of J unit and the syntax
for the same is you use assert and you
have various assert xxx methods what are
they
you have assert equals you have assert
null you have assert not null you have a
third true you have assert false and so
on right so all these are search
basically takes values so when I say
assert equals are providing the expected
values and providing the actual values
and I'm asserting with those and I am
testing whether my test parcels or fail
now a small syntax on G Unit how do you
write the G unit testing now assume that
you have a class called s calculator
wherein it has a method public void add
which returns 2 which takes two
parameters and it is nothing as of now
but returns the addition of the result
okay now just a simple java class
nothing much doing inside it it has a
method
x2 parameters adds it returns the result
back you want to test this class how do
you do it using J unit
I'll have plus calculator test is this
test word mandate ring no convention yes
when you have you understand that this
is a test class by the prefix added to
the calculus and it is a test class for
the calculator class so it just makes
our developers life easier to understand
by the names of the classes what it
represents now I want to test the admin
that means for testing I have an
annotation called as add the weight test
this meta or this annotation is
available in the package or dot J unit
dot star okay you use the annotation and
annotations are always applied either at
method levels or class levels so I have
a method public public is mandatory void
yes mandatory you cannot have any other
return life except void now the method
name for the test case should be such
representing what that test case is
testing so I'll say and should return
then okay followed by open and close
long bracket and it takes no parameters
at all so this is the signature of a
test case that you write open curly
brace close curly brace now I'm testing
the calculator test class calculator
class where a I'm testing the add method
what I am testing is when I call add it
should return some value right public
it's mandatory void it's mandatory and
written without the written test
how will I test it of course I will
create object of the class that's again
plain core Java and then I say c1 dot
add passing in
values now when I pass to and for what I
am expecting it to return six so my
expected value is six my actual value
depends on when I call the method it
executes what values it returns and I
put this inside assert equals so I am
asserting that whatever I am expecting
is equal to the value that I am actually
so this is a simple disk case that you
can write in jail unit to execute the
test case it's pretty simple again you
can watch the Eclipse with you to see
the testings or how to run on Eclipse or
else just on this method say right click
or right click you will get run as
j-unit and when you do this your test
case will run and you will get the
success or failure if the test case
passes you will get a green bar
specifying the test case passes or else
you will get a red bar so I hope you
like this video this is all about the
basics of chilli unit and the unit
testing and the importance of the sea
