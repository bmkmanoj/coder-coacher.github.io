intuitive from that is for landings and
in this video we'll talk about a luma
which is Google will be using Swift for
Android hold on that's not the case so
let's talk about even if this even if
that's the case we will try to
understand why Google is doing that or
why this room is that it's because
Oracle is suing Google for using the
licensed version of JDK because as you
know Java was created by Sun
Microsystems and linked over at a bought
Sun in year 2011 I guess now Java
belongs to Oracle vibe so Java JDK then
we have JVM so everything belongs to
Oracle so even if you go to Android
studio so if you are a developer if you
open another studio if you go to about
Android studio you can see that it
written that you have an Android
programming and it also returns the JVM
version with it says it's a spy and what
I - compilation right that means you are
using Java which is which is given you
by Oracle
so Google is using the proprietary
software of Oracle so that is the case
so what either is suing Google because
of that and now Google don't have any
answer for that right so from in year
2008 Google is using Java so from a
Google is using Java for Android wise of
it's from last 8 years people are
working on Android using Java language
now Google has 2 choice here just to
come out from the suit it has one choice
using open JDK which is the open source
version of JDK and then we have Swift
language so it is swept
cert is a programming language made my
apple so if you are using iOS if you are
using Apple iPhone of course iPhone if
then you will be having so those apps
are written either in object you see on
inch swept so Apple has two languages
what is object you see and spend so
Swift was introduced two years back I
guess it in 2000
I'm not sure to 13 or 14 so it was in so
it is a new language now so it's been
what you three to three years for Swift
programming right so Google has two
choices they can go for open JDK on or
they can go
effect so if they are going for OpenJDK
that means if you are Android developer
you have to use open dedicate not JDK
this time for the new software
development right so that is the
solution right but let's say if the
indication is true if the rumors true
Google will be using swept for Android
now this this is this this is concerned
for to now people here who are already
working on Android so let's say if you
are doing a development for gosh two to
three years or maybe five years you are
walking on Java app Java programming
right so you have used Java programming
for idle applications but now if you are
using if your Google is coming with
Swift you have to learn a new language
right so does a big task second if you
if you want to learn Android now so
let's say you are a college student on
you you're just passing out you're just
completing your graduation or you are
working on some other platform that so
you are a PHP developer you are a Liuba
developer you are maybe some other
developer now you want to switch to
Android now we should like me to choose
now because if the addition is true you
have to learn Swift if that is not true
if so is not true you have to learn Java
right so which one to choose
so let's imagine let's imagine Google is
using Swift okay so the later version
will be using straight for that language
for that Android the problem is even if
Google switches to Swift we have to
change lots of things which is not
impossible for Google but it is that it
is damn difficult first Google need to
change Android runtime right so be in to
now we cannot use a JVM runtime which is
8 AR T we need to use Swift or runtime
for Android devices
second second problem else you will be
having there are lots of libraries
written for Android using C++ language
so we have a Java and C++ bridge we
don't have that thing it's Swift
programming so that means way to change
lots of libraries willing to change the
whole runtime environment the third
problem is the developers if we talk
about Android it uses Java now right and
there's a huge
huge market for Java developers what
about series programmers we don't have
my suit for grammar I've enabled right
so if now Google chooses to work with
Swift we don't have developers that
means there will not be any new app in
next one month in the next one year
that's the problem right so again it was
the developer will grow of course right
if you if you don't have choice if you
want to learn Swift you will learn Swift
but it will take some time right so it
will be addressed for Google to switch
to swept right so that is the third
problem so because of this three problem
it will take if it is true it will take
huge amount of time maybe two to three
years to implement Swift right on what
Google can do is they can use two
language side-by-side so they can use
Java and swim to side by side so if you
are a jaw-dropper you can work as a
developer and family in one year you can
learn Swift and it's not difficult to
learn Swift okay when I have learnt
swept in two or three days or not
completely but I know basic soft Swift I
just run it into two to three days
because I know Java right so if you know
Java syntax is almost same compared to
Java or if you talk about Swift and Java
so circa is almost similar to Java so if
you're know Java well you can learn
Swift in two to three days not complete
but let's say let's expand the duration
to two weeks right so at least in two
weeks you can learn the complete seeing
a switch programming right but let's say
fumed if you don't know what it is if
you know if you don't know what this job
IQ don't know what is a Swift the
problem is to learn so if you don't have
we don't have much books to learn Swift
we don't have much pushing some type of
flow so when you are a java upper you
know each type of flow right so all your
doubts will be cleared by step of the
website but what the point for if we
don't have much questions answered in
stack overflow so we have limited
questions there so the resources are
lacking for Swift I mean again I'm not
saying it will not change it future
maybe in future you'll be having lots of
programmers working on Swift programming
and they got lots of resources I am
talking about the other situation right
so it is very difficult for Google to
switch to Swift directly okay so they
might be using Java
side by side with
and then people can learn Swift you know
in in sometime okay okay so nothing to
worry so let's say now now if you want
to be a Android developer then what
so do you run java and unser is yes even
if Google is switching to Swift it will
take some time maybe two to three years
okay so by the time lunch hour
don't wait okay don't wait for that
answer from Google what they are doing
so start the Java now okay so from today
learn Java understand the concepts of
Java start making Android apps if into
one or two years Google announced that
they are going for Swift that's okay I
did it was great things but next one
year to implement so what you can do if
you're no Java if you know how to make
apps you can learn Swift in one week
because making Android apps is not
program specific right it is logic you
should know how to create apps so start
building apps lunch hour now start
building apps publishing on the on the
Play Store if they are switching to
swept you can learn Swift but now let's
say you want to learn Swift that's okay
you can learn both side by side okay
give some time for Java sometime to some
time for Swift the advantage will be you
can be a i OS developing future right so
if you're learning Swift now by a
macbook buy iphone you can buy any
iphone maybe for as well to buy a
second-hand laptop or second macbook
walk will search programming you can be
an iOS developer and if that education
is true out that rumor is true Google
will be buying a Google will be use
expect for Android now you can make two
apps two types of apps you can also make
iOS app and you can use Android app so
then those there's no harm so the final
thought is don't stop yourself before by
learning of all making Android apps
start building now learn Java so that is
all over maybe turn over on a leak on
some real news nothing is confirmed yet
so if it is confirmed I will let you
know and then we discuss about how to
transform yourself from from Java to
sweat so that's it from this video
