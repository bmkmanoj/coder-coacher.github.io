about this thing which is which is your
industry knowledge is different from the
college knowledge right so what you
learn in college is very different from
what is happening in the industry and
then I am saying that you have to
improve yourself you have to upgrade
your skills and then it was a monotone
right so I was saying that I knew you
were hearing it and then you're thinking
okay it is different right industry
knowledge is different but then how to
improve ourself you need a live example
that right so I'm a different zone now I
am a trainer I am into a defense zone
right in future you will not be a
trainer maybe you will be a trainer but
then most of the time you will be in the
development field you will be in some
other field maybe a testing field maybe
data warehouse field right so I'm trying
this from a long time to have someone
who has huge amount of experience to
help you with this right so someone who
is working in the in the industry from a
long time so I got one of my friend he
is there in London now and he's working
for one of the biggest travel company in
London and he is working on data
warehouse again I will not reveal his
name and everything now that's a
surprise for you and so we are going
live on Saturdays so that you will get
an experience what happens in the
company so again I will ask him some
questions that it will be a integer type
type of things so I will ask him some
questions and even he will answer those
questions he will share his experience
with you people and trust me those
experience worth millions right because
no one will share their experience with
you how to tackle all the problems in
the life and then how to get from the
college zone to industry zone and I am
excited for excited for this I don't
know how well it will be going this is
the first time I'm taking an interview
online it will not be a interview for
company it will be it will be a normal
discussion between two people and so you
can ask your questions as well I don't
know how it will be going how
comfortable he will be with those
questions but then he is very excited I
am excited let's see how it goes so on
Saturday we have a live session but if
