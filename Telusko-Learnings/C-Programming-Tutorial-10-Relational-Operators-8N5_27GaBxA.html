relational operators now what is
relational operators so let's say you
are applying this operation let's say we
have we have two values one is 5 and
second is 3 and we want to check a 5 is
greater than 0
sorry 5 is greater than 3 so whenever
you say this sign which is greater than
sign and this is less than sign so we
are checking 5 is greater than 3 so this
operator it will return a value either 1
or 0 if it is true so if 5 is greater
than 3 it will return 1 so just to
demonstrate will say I will say result
equal to so we have int result equal to
5 is greater than 3 8 5 is really 2 than
3 it will it will give the value as 1
otherwise it will give the value as 0 so
let's try to print this value so it's a
printf and we'll specify % D and we'll
write result ok and let's run this so if
you run this code you can see the output
is 1 again we want a new line so it's a
/n so you can see the output is 1 simple
and if I give a wrong input if I say 5
is less than 3 which is not true right
so it will return 0 and if I done this
at 0 so specifically if you say NC
programming true true means 1 and false
means 0 so anyway you see 1 it is true 0
is false
now unfortunately C directed doesn't
support true and false which is boolean
values it supports 1 &amp;amp; 0 so whenever you
want to achieve true we say 1 whenever
you are children we want to achieve
false we say 0 so 5 less than 3 is not
true which is false that's why it is 0
simple so this is one type of operator
we have one more operator let us say we
have we want to check we have two values
3 &amp;amp; 3 we want to check if they are equal
so to check if something is equal way to
use double equal to because see when you
talk about this equal to sign this is
called as assignment
so it will fetch the value from the left
side so right side on it will side to
the left side example if I say 10 to I
equal to 6 so I am assigning a value 6
to I so that's your assignment operator
here
so equal to is assignment operator but
in this case we are not assigning we are
checking so that's why we have to use
double equal to so when you want to
compare something we have to use double
equal to clear and now if I run this it
will print 1 because 3 is equal to 3
what if I say 7 so is 3 is equal to
equal to 7 and there's this false why it
is not equal it will return 0 so we have
less than operator we have greater than
operator we also have less than equal to
operator so it simply means if 3 is less
than or equal to 7
yes 3 is less than 7 right and if you
run this it says 1 now if I make this
also 3 so it's not less than but is
equal to so 3 is not less but it is
equal to 3 again it will give you true
which is 1 so we can use less than
operator gaiter than operator less than
equal to double equal to we can also use
not equal to so when you say not so we
have to use exclamation which is not so
3 is not equal to 3 and since 3 not
equal to 3 is false it will return 0 and
let's say if I change this to 4 so 3 is
not equal to 4 of course there is not
equal to 4 so it will return true which
is 1 1 right so those are all your
relational operators just to list it out
let me use multi-line comment
so for multi-line comment we have to use
star slash star or star slash okay so
you can use multi-line comment here so
we have less than operator we have
greater than operator we have less than
equal to we have greater than equal to
we can use double equal to we can use
not equal to this these are the
operators are available to Association
operators available in C programming so
that's it thanks for watching and
