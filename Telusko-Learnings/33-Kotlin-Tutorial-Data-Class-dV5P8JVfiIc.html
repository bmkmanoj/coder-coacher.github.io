from those color things and then this
video oh I will not tell you that now
let's have a big suspense now what I do
now is I will create a scenario where we
try to solve that problem using one of
the concepts again you must have seen
that in the title but then again it's a
virtual surprise for you or maybe
suspense so what we do here is we'll
create a class and it will name this
class as laptop now in Java what we do
is we create a class and we create
variables and we create methods right
what do I do here is I will create a I
will create those variables within the
constructor itself so let's say this is
Val again I'm going for Val's we can go
forward as well I'm going for a while
for this for this example I'm going for
bland so every laptop needs a I mean
sorry every every laptop needs has a
brand right so we say this blind type is
string and the second thing is a laptop
will have a price right and that's very
important the brand ends and applies
okay so weak once we got this to convey
once we got these two values in the
constructor what do I do here is let me
get a function called as show and this
function will print whatever message you
want to print in fact we don't need this
function anything here but then just to
have something in the class let me print
awesome laptop awesome was that awesome
machine maybe I love my machine ok so we
have this we have we are we're printing
also machine voice so we got a ricotta
brand and we got a prize here ok so what
I do is let me create objects for this
so let me get the first object I will
say where I will get my first object as
left of one equal to and the way you can
create object here we can say laptop and
you can pass two variables right I mean
two values obviously the first brand is
Dell okay I love Dell brand and the cost
of is is $2,000 again I don't know the
exact price for Dell machines but then
let's say we have Dell and we have
$2,000 I can talk and talking about
high-end machines here now what happens
when you print the el ap one as it is
okay so I'm not using
is that okay so I'm printing a lab one
now now I'm not saying I'm not printing
the values I'm printing the reference as
it is okay the moment you do this the
moment you run this code let's run this
let's say run and okay in the address
and in the console you can see we are
not getting the values of del machine we
are not getting the value of del and
2000 we are getting a hash code right so
let me remember this problem the problem
is when you try to print a reference it
only gives you our address and a class
name without now this address means the
hash code right now you might be
wondering that's how it that's how it
works right in Java as well we do the
same thing with it brings the reference
address it brings the hash code now how
to solve this problem this is one way
one way you can solve this problem is by
using a two string method right and we
have done that before I mean when I said
before and talking about Java so in Java
we know that we create two string
methods the first problem is every class
needs so let me just write it here so
the first point is every class needs a
two string method right because we want
to print the values again we will not do
it here let's say we need a we need a
two string method let's go with second
problem the second problem is if I
create one more object here we'll save
ad lab two equal to laptop and then we
say this is Apple comma 2500 let's say
we have this different machine which is
Apple and then just Apple and then the
record applies us two thousand five
hundred now of course when you print lap
one lap two now both will print the hash
code we don't want that my main concern
here is I want to check if both these
objects are same now the way you can do
that is by using println and in print
and then we can compare this two so we
can say lap 1 equals equal to lab 2 now
this is how you compare two objects why
so we are comparing lab 1 and lab 2 here
and if you want this code okay so what
it's printing falls into that in the
output window we got false and that
makes sense these two are these two
objects has two different values you can
see we have del 2000 regards apple 2500
now what if if I make this del
this Apple as 2005 set deploys us mm now
as you can see we got two objects now
and both this objects has the same I
mean this they have the same values now
when I compare two objects of course
right if two if two objects have the
same value they should be equal right
and if you don't this code now at least
we should get equal now Oh unfortunately
again we got false because this two are
still not equal now if you remember in
Java what we do is whenever you want to
compare two objects and when you say
those are equal you have to define two
methods one is you have to override
those two methods the first method is
you need to override a equals method and
you need to and you need to override a
hashcode method okay now y equals is
because our hash code seek capital now y
equals is because sometimes you are you
also you also compare two objects with
the help of equals method right this is
one way of comparing the comparing the
objects I mean if you if you want your
object to be exactly same that was equal
to will make sense but then if you have
two laptops and these two laptops has
everything same except the price maybe
you have some more parameters CPU Ram
but then because of different sailors we
have different price still those two
laptops are same right in that case you
should be using dot equals because that
will make more sense okay so yeah so we
got your lap one dot equals slap two and
still physically fit on this code again
you will get false because even if those
values are same we are getting false
because of what it checks is it checks
for the hash code and since both this
object has different highest quality it
is printing false so what I want is if
you want to make it work first of all
you want to print the object values by
using by just printing the object so you
need to signature you also need equals
and hashcode method you need these two
things right and the third one is maybe
you want to achieve a concept of cloning
now it is cloning in Java is if you got
this one object here which is laptop and
if you want one more object let's say
okay let's say let's change these values
let's say this is Apple again and this
is two thousand five hundred and if I
create a new object now
to this new object which is VAD lab 3 I
want this to have the same as a depth of
1 so it's a lab 1 dot copy oh can you
see that we don't have any method copy
so we want a method like copy or maybe
clone but unfortunately you can see we
are not hitting those methods here so I
want this thing as well I want my I want
to create a clone also but it is not
there so what we can do is we need a
copy method as well so if you want to
make it work the things which we need
here is first of all I want to print the
object so I want to string I want to
compare two objects so I want to
override equals and hashcode I want to I
will also want a copy method right so
it's a very big video now again you can
see that in fact it's a very lots of
things are remaining right so the thing
is we have to find all those things
right and if in Java you have to define
everything by yourself now cotton says
hey don't worry now everyone has the
same problem right everyone want to
create the same thing so if you want
something you need if you want a class
where you want to string methods where
you want equals and hashcode where you
want copy it's very easy just write
detai
in front of your class the moment you
write data can you see that we got a
copy methods there is no problem in that
and when you compare these two objects
now of course those are G though those
two objects are different
let's compare Dell and with the same
price so I'm comparing lap one lap two
I'm also creating lab to the object and
let me also print lab to the object just
to see if it is working so we should be
getting to string method as well right
so if I say lab 3 and the motor on this
code and can you see that we got true
and it is also printing the values of
the laptop just by writing one keyword
that is data I mean just imagine how
powerful it is again for the small
example I know it doesn't make sense but
then the moment you create big
applications maybe if you are creating
big entity class this will be this is an
awesome concept in fact I used to face
these issues a lot in when I used to
make projects because every time if I
create multiple entities you know let's
say if you if you are building a big
project in that maybe you'll be having
50 to 60 entities for different
different as
right and if you create those entities
you have to override to string method
you have to override equals and hashcode
then clone as well again if you are
using so many modern ide maybe eclipse
netbeans or IntelliJ this code is given
by your IDE itself but still you have to
manage those codes right because if you
change something how would you know
which code is given by your IDE and
which code you have written so it will
be difficult for you to manage and
that's why cotton says don't worry
everything is running behind the scene
you just have to use a data keyboard so
this type of classes are called the data
classes now the data class data class is
same as normal classes okay there's
nothing different as you can see I am
defining this function the only purpose
of defining that function there is to
show you that this is a normal class
okay
don't tank data or classes something
very different the difference of data
data classes class the only advantage
what you get is every data class by
default has a two string method it by
default has equals and hashcode
implementation it also has a copy method
so this is how we use copy here right so
copy what copy will do is it will create
a new object of lab 3 and it will have
the values of the first laptop which is
del and 2000 because you are copying
that object but let's say if you want to
copy the same object but one different
value I want to change this mm I want to
change this to a price of 2200 in that
case we can mention that you can say
price equal to I watch different price I
want to go for 2200 not what's that an
able CD no not now
so 2200 right and now if we run this
code lab 3 will print 2200 right so we
it got del because we are using copy but
the price is changed you can you can
change the price as well so this is that
powerful
so yeah that's it I hope you enjoyed
this data class thing so if you have any
more questions let me know in the
comment section and that's it thanks for
watching and I hope you are subscribed
subscribe the channel because the lots
