ready from tellus color things and in
this video we'll talk about menu in
Android so what what we want to do here
so let's say we have an activity here
okay we will we will not be building the
same activity it is just for the show
purpose so we have you can see a three
buttons there so if you are using a
Android phone if you open an app like
whatsapp so you have those three buttons
there right and if you click on this
button you get option of update status
then we can set T or we can go to
account settings right so this is this
is your menu so if you click on this it
will show you some options right and
when you click on this any of this
button it will do something for you if I
click on maybe other menu it will do
something for you so what we want to do
here is we want to implement this menu
okay will not be building any one big
application it will be like a small demo
where you have we will have to teach you
how to use menu okay when you click on
this but menu like in this example we
are showing the toast right maybe you
can call an activity you can you can
send the request to the server you can
do anything you want okay so that's
that's the different thing but I will
show you how to create this menu and how
to perform the actions here so to do
that we'll create a new activity and
we'll name this activity as main
obviously let's create an activity
service activity m'kay activity and
we'll name this as menu demo so that's
will be the menu demo activity right and
then we'll click on will click on finish
nothing obviously we want it to be
launcher with resinize I run this code
this this this is the file which I want
to execute right and then when I click
on finish we got the okay so we got the
project here so that's menu okay so we
got menu here now how to create a menu
so for that you have to go to so any or
the RAS we have to go to this menu
folder if it is not there you have to
create an own menu folder inside that
you should have a file which is menu
underscore main and if you open this
there will be some items so every item
you have here
so maybe if you don't have so you have
to created own item here so how to
create an item so we have to mention
item then in item you will be having IDs
for every optional in your menu will
have a different unique ID then we have
to mention the title so let's copy this
I will paste it here and beyond one more
so I will make this title as okay if you
have to first change this thing so we
will say okay before this let me set a
title here so this is settings so we'll
say this is settings okay and the name
is action studying doesn't matter we say
this is when implement this excellent
settings we'll say this is settings
that's one the second one will say about
and okay that should be small a and this
will say this is what oh so this is
about oh not this one
will say this is about okay and here
we'll say this is contact us so we say
this is contact okay and even this we
need to change it to contact us now we
can write anything we want right we can
mention or we can mention Google Maps
you can introduce all the stuff here but
we are going to keep it simple so we
have settings about and about us so what
it should does if I run this code it
should it should expand if I click on it
it should show this the option settings
about and contact us and if I click on
about it should show the a toast about
me if I click on contact us it will show
my location or address and if I if I
click on settings it will say now I can
say D thing so we just should just show
a test a text with help of toast so so
once we have created this menu now let's
use this menu inside your inside your
what menu or inside your activity so
here to introduce this into an activity
we have to add two methods now these two
methods are overwritten methods from the
app compact activity to do that
right-click on your
a squint just good to generate and way
to over two methods the two methods are
the first one is on create option menu
that you will see such type menu it will
filter out some things for us so it is
on create so let's search for on create
filter because the on create option menu
it should be somewhere on create
algorithm type entire thing so it is on
on create option menu so that's that's
the first whether you have to go you
have to select the second one is on
options items selected so it is on
options item selector so we have to we
have to override this two methods one is
for the menu seconds for menu item and
if you click on OK it will give you
those two methods now what we want is we
want to include this main menu activity
which is your menu we want to introduce
this inside your job inside your inside
your activity right for that we have to
use something else
inflate also as we have discussed in the
last video if you have seen that we
talked about infinity right which will
feel the area so in fact means fill so
we have to say it is main inflator which
is the method we have to use it is main
inflator so it we can say main fighter
object as inflator we can have any
object name and the method name is get
menu inflator which will give you the
handle for the those three buttons and
then we have to say inflator dot we need
to inflate it with the help of this menu
right so we we have to use this menu
here and how to use that we have to say
r dot menu dot so this is our activity
name which is menu main comma you have
to specify this menu object here so
which is your this is the handle for
your menu and then everything is done so
we will return true because everything
is working so we'll sit on true and if I
run this code it should open an activity
without whether I should get these three
options right if I don this code now
let's see if it's working or not so it
will take some time to load in my
window so it will let me just pause the
video for the time okay it's okay where
is the output okay I have changed the
manifest so we have to make some changes
in manifest we want the launcher
activity not this one so it will remove
launcher here okay so we want the we
want our file to be on main right so let
me run this again I think it should work
now it was like some time to load okay
so that's our activity here so we have
an activity with a menu if I click on
this button you can see we got three
options we got settings we got about and
we got contact us right so it's that
simple
so this is how you can introduce a menu
inside in your activity but let's say if
I click on this button
nothing will happen right if I click on
about about nothing is going on if I
click on contact us nothing was there so
every time you choose one item it way it
executes this method which is on options
items selected so this is the method
which executed every time you click on
an item now way to check which item was
click so every time you click on item it
will give you the the name of the Act
the name of the item so we can apply a
switch case here and inside this which
case we can ask the item give me the
name of the item which has selected so
it will so we can get that with the help
of get item ID and then we can pass this
into a case we'll say our dot if this
case case matches with what are the
options we have one is settings about
end contact so we'll say dot settings if
it matches settings will will give a
toast again we can call an activity
caller settings we can create an
activity call the settings and then we
can call that setting activity but time
we will focus only on the toast will say
make test on the same activity and it
should display now you can configure ok
and then we give a comma we specify the
length of the toast we say the lunch
should be short or we can also skip it
long right
and then at the end we have to say dot
show so if that is one case so we'll if
this is the case return true because we
do not want to execute execute further
otherwise we can use case r dot ID dot
second one is about so say : and we can
use the same thing or same toast with a
different text and we'll set this text
is my name is Navid ready so that's
about me
and the last case we can just copy this
case here and paste it here and we can
say this is instead of about we'll say
this is contact and if you want to
contact me just go to www.assist.org so
if I want this code now so it would take
some time to load so here we are we have
the activity if I expand this now it
shows the same things if I click on
about so you can see my name is the
vendredi if I click on contact us we got
wboc.com and if i click on settings' we
got now you can configure so that's how
we can use menu in our Android activity
