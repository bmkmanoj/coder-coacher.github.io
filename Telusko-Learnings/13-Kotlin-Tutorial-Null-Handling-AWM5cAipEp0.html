different particles are things and in
this video we'll talk about null
handling in card lane now if you
remember when we are talking about this
alien class we were having this question
mark here right and we have not talked
about question mark yet I was ignoring
that part for a long time let's talk
about this later and let's try to
understand what is this let's see if I
create a variable here which is called
as a name and the type of this variable
is string what if I do not assign the
value so that's fine but then what if I
assign a value null again null is evil
in Java right we try to avoid null as
well as possible because ultimately we
get this awesome exception which is null
pointer exception right and somewhere
you know we I mean I am sure an 80% of
time when you get an error we know that
it is a low point exception so Scotland
says you know we can cotton will handle
your null values properly example by
default you are not allowed to assign
the null value to an object example
let's say if I create a string variable
here if I say where STR and if I if I
say this is a type string and if I
assign a null value to this the moment I
do that you can see we are getting an
error
it says null cannot be a value of non
non null type string that means if you
define a string here it is by default
not null that means you cannot assign a
null value to it so if you cannot assign
on that value of course in future you
will not get a null pointer exception
right that's an awesome thing so caught
in by default doesn't support null value
or it will not allow you to put null
values there in case if you if you want
to allow it to do that you can put a
question mark there the moment you put a
question mark everything is solved as
you can see there is no error now you
can use null values the way you can do
that for string we can also do that for
so the same thing is happening here as
you can see we wanted to assign a null
value that's why we are using question
mark so question mark is allowing nulls
with that means this this string can be
null able now let's see if I create
object of alien here so if I say where I
will go for the same object name which
we are using before t2 and if I say
equal to an alien this is a alien object
here right
now question arise if you have a
kneading object and if you try to print
the value of this if I say print Ln and
if I give a tick to dot a name again the
name is null I mean it's it's null as of
now right if I run this code okay so you
can see it is printing null here so
we're not underscored up in the output
is null but then if I if I try to print
if I try to get some properties of this
example I want to know the okay what
properties we can use maybe I want to
fetch the length of it the moment I do
that you can see we are getting an error
it says only safe or null non null
asserted which means this is nullable
right you are allowing to use it in a
label so in case if you want to use that
then you have to put a question mark
here so when we use question mark then
only it will work otherwise you will not
work so if you are using an elite
nullable string you have to use question
mark everywhere so let's run this code
now okay
and can you see that it is it is
printing nothing because of course this
is a null value right so it is it is you
know calmly handling the null values
here now if you if you do this in the
job of course it will give you a null
pointer exception right so that's how
you can use with this name but what if I
if can we do this with our own objects
can we do this with in an object
vegetate tool so let's try so if I a
sign if I let elected if I say t2 or
equal to null if I assign a null value
to this and you can see the moment I do
that we are getting error so you can see
we are getting in error it says not null
cannot be a value of not null so again
we have to put a question mark here the
moment I do that if I put a question
mark oh but before that if you want to
put a question mark you have to also
specify a type of this t2 which is
optional initially okay because we are
running alien here but if you want to
use question mark you have to put alien
here as well okay so once you assign a
value of type alien now you can make it
null and the moment I try to fetch the
value of of t2 so if I say I want to
fetch the name of t2 which is blank as
of now
and you can see we are getting ed again
if you want to make it use it you have
to put question mark so using this you
are actually handling the null values
you are reducing the null pointer
exceptions right so that's how cotton is
more stable in compared to Java because
we are we are awarding exceptions here
so yeah that's it that's how you handle
null and that's how that's why the
question mark is there so if you want to
assign null values we'll put question
mark which is nullable values so that is
from this video if you have any problem
just commend your comment section if I
cannot answer we have a community who
will answer these questions and do
