use of string buffer and we want to
convert this string which has numbers
and alphabets and we won't just want the
numbers out as an output so for that we
want to do we have to use a way to use
something called a string buffer to do
it okay so let's see how to how to find
the output so let's first take a string
value okay so let's say we have string
STR as let's take the above input so
which is nine 8pv
or nine eight seven bv it is six eight a
six six seven so this is your input and
what we'll do is we'll say STR equal to
a I want to change the value from minus
TS to STR but this STR will go into
something called as convert convert okay
we'll use this method what is convert
now what this method will do is it will
convert the value which will it will
take this string with alphabet and would
just give it the numbers and we'll play
in this Istria so that's what you want
to do here but to make it work we have
to define this method which is convert
right so what we'll do is we'll create
one most static method which will return
me a string value and the method will be
convert so this will take string as
input and it will give you a string and
output okay but I don't want to send the
same output which is which is the input
right so we need to apply the conversion
thing here so for sure when you say
you're converting something so we have
to remove these two values we were to
remove B and V and we want to remove a
so when you say you want to remove
something so that means you want to
change your existing string and when you
say you want to change something so that
that class should support mutability so
to use it to make it mutable we have to
use a class called string buffer
we'll say s be equal to new string
buffer and then in this string buffer
we'll pass a string okay
now so what way to goes we need to start
with the first element so we start with
nine and we'll go till seven
if this nine is a number skip if it's
eight is a number skip seven is the
number skip as soon as you say get B we
say delete as soon as we get V we say
dill it as soon as we says sex skip
eight skip a dill it that this is what
we want to do it right so that means we
have to start with the first value to
the last value so if you have to use a
for loop for that we'll use in initial
value of I will be 0 because string
normally works with and string is the
same as an added right so I just start
with 0 so we have to start with 0 and
will end at the last value or the length
may be less than rent and then I plus
plus so this this will take you from the
first part with the last value now what
we are saying is if you are getting our
input as 9 so the first value will be 9
right so if your input you are
forgetting the input as a number skip so
have to check when to skip now how would
we know that the existing character is
it correct is it a normal character or a
number now to know that we can actually
use the range of ASCII values so
basically my talk about ASCII value so
for your digits also from 48 to 57 these
are digits so when you say 48 that 0:49
is 150 is 251 is 3 and 57 is 9 so what
we can simply check is we will ask this
guy the string before
give me the character at location first
which is I here if the value is less
than 48 which means is not a string
right or which is so it's not a number
and give me the character that I and if
it is more than 57 so it's not a number
so if it is it belongs to the it is
number is less than 48 or gate is in 57
so for sure it's not a number in that
scenario if that's not a number we can
simply say delete the character at what
location we are visited location I
simple
and if you're if just a number skip
anyway we are we are going for the loop
so it was skipped that value I took off
the net unique situation simple you want
to see the output let's run this
if we run does oh it's not working it's
because it's because it's because I know
what happened okay how about if I say -
- now if I done this will it work oh
it's not working so we are sending a
string which is an object and then we
are turning a string oh we should not
return a string we should return SB
because we want to return a string
before right we are changing the values
in string before and then we need to
just convert into two string and let's
run oh hey we got something we got an
output here but tonight it has just
removed B and a what about other values
so it is it has not removed this one V
the issues as well as you say delete so
it will delete the character and all
this value will be shifted this side so
the value for B let's say the index
number for B is 3 so when we deleted the
index number for V is 3 now and then
within when you look over the next
iteration it will start with 4 and
directly it will start with 6 so it will
not go for V again ok so what we can do
here is we can simply say every time we
delete a value we say I plus plus I
minus minus so that if you delete the
value be here if I did it be
it will again go back to the value so
that it will also check V so this
position here this is 3 right so if you
remove this so V becomes 3 so that's why
I'm going for - - n here because we are
going for plus plus and now if I done
this and here's the output so we have
removed all the characters in fact you
can you can have any type of characters
you can simply say
or maybe a space maybe a dot it will
remove all this it will just go for the
numbers and that's the part of this code
so I hope I understand this simple code
