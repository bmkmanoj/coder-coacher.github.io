about pattern matching so what we have
here is let's say we have two string
which one is let's say we'll names a
text and the text here I'm writing is
Naveen ready so let's say we have a text
file is now in 20 and then I have one
more string here called as pattern and
the pattern I am using here is let's say
VI n okay so I want to verify that this
pattern here is there in this string or
not that's it if you have this string
okay I will write something in the kief
condition by default let's say it is
true if it is there then I will print
these brackets so if it is there I will
print pattern found or I will print else
I will paint not found right that's it
that's what we want to do now so for
that what we'll do is since I am writing
every time true so obviously the output
will be true right now to do this thing
will be will be I think this code in two
parts so the first part of the video
will we'll use some inbuilt functions
and we'll try to find this the second
part of the video we'll talk about the
way without using inner method the
inbuilt methods normally when you go to
introduce and they will ask you a
question you know you have to write a
code to do to match this baton all you
have to find out path in that particular
text so if they don't mention that you
cannot use any inbuilt classes or
interfere or methods then you can go
with the first way but if they mentioned
you know did they purposefully mention
on the paper that you cannot use inbuilt
classes or methods so in that you know
you have to go for the you know lengthy
way the using the proper proper way now
to use in build method and classes what
we have is so if you can see this let's
say let's say we have a text here so
this text will have lots of methods
right a test text is the object of
string now and if you say text dot you
can see there are lots of methods and in
those methods there is something
contains so this contains in contents
you have to pass a string and if that
string matches with the exists or that
if that string is contains and the
existing string it will return you true
so if this pattern is there in the text
it will give you true let me just give a
semicolon so it will turn you true right
so what we can do is we can say boolean
result equal to text dot contains and
the pattern and if it returns true so we
have to say enough true we have to say
returns or result so if it turns true it
will print button found I will return
not found okay now if I run this query
and that's what we got the output X
pattern found let's change the value let
me just write it as V I and E and if I
run this query it say is not found okay
let's change it again let me say it is
just read it's there in ready so if we
run this it says pattern found okay so
this is the one way but the problem is
we have used in build method and in
built glass okay
so if you don't want to use in build
method in class we'll we'll write a
structured code here but that'll be
doing in the second part of a tutorial
so thank you for watching and do
