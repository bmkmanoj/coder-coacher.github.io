for-loop now let's see why we require
enhanced for-loop so let's say you have
a adding so let's see let's create an
array of integers so we'll say we have
an array of integer let's limit as
numbers or nums equal to a new and added
so we'll say the size of array is 10 now
I want to insert some values now the one
of the way to insert values in array is
you can use a of I and then not a of I a
of zero and then we'll say the value is
1 and then a of 1v the value is 2 and
this is how we can insert values right
now instead of this we can use some for
loop to insert values so we can say int
I will say equal to 0 because index
number starts with 0 less than 10 and I
plus plus okay
now we have this for loop which starts
with I oh I'm missing a main function
here Shola let me just put it in main
function so it is B SVM tab so
everything should be in main function or
some in some functions and let me say
format now so we have this for loop now
what we'll do is we'll assign some
random values now how to assign kind of
values we can create a random class
we'll say random are equal to new random
using which you can generate some random
numbers and then here we'll say a of 0 a
of 0 F IP service a or I then and this
we can say our dot we have a function
here called as next int okay and the
maximum value I want here is let's say
50 okay was the issue of the arrays nums
so we have this array and the maximum
value of a day will be 50 simple and now
I don't want any negative number I want
only port we will play
is not so how to print an array if you
say s out and if you say numbs now you
should print an ad it right let's let's
see what the output will be so if I run
this now it may close or different
windows here okay so if you go to this
output you can see this is the address
or the hash code of your nums object so
if when to print a value you have to
specify an X in the index number if I
say num of nums of 0 it will print the
first number and the first number is 28
again this is random generation of
numbers but let's say I want to print
all the values so I will use a for loop
we'll say int I equal to again 0 and
then I less than not less than or less
than 10 and I plus plus and we can say I
want to print this values so instead of
0 here we can mention it as I so it
should print all the numbers in that
array now this time if I done this I
will get different set of values so I
got all these values 341 and blah blah
blah so we got all these values right so
we can print in this way but let's say
if I don't know the values okay I don't
know two values of how many number of
how many numbers I have in that case I
can ask numbs that give me a length and
I will go till the length minus 1 so if
your length we'd understand so it will
go till nine okay so if I run this now
again I will be getting an output and
bingo we got the we got 10 number zero
but let's say I want to change this so
one of the way to print this or the same
number is with the help of something
called as enhanced for-loop now it is an
enhanced for-loop now in this scenario
what we're doing is we are fetching not
our numbers from Nam's
and one by one instead of that we'll
assign this task to a variable called as
let's say n and I will say and go to
nums
and pick each value and show printing
nums here we can print now
simple we can print n since our painting
the a day we are printing individual
values so this n will go to noms for the
first time it will fetch the first value
after first value it will press the
second value and third value and then it
will go on now from this and this is
your output right and you can see the
maximum value we are getting is 50 so
because of this bond okay so this is how
you have to use of announce for loop but
let's say you want to work with
collections now announce for loop or
works very effective and effectively in
an enhanced for-loop oh sorry
