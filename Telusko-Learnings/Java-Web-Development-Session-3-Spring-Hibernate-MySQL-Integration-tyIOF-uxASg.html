last session what we have done is if you
run this project witness on this
projects first I will say god okay so it
is running you can see the server is
started let me just go to the browser
and in this level I have to run local
8080 - and if I click on submit not this
if I click on enter
oh what the was the port number I guess
I have given the wrong code number or a
legend on this project once again right
click run as the non server and finish
okay you can see the music you can see
this is oh this is what we have done in
the last session when you call for I
mean when you request for task project
it was okay so it's opening in class
okay so you can see it is showing the
home page but if I say free type because
we are working on feedback now right and
if I say we know that HTM you got a page
now this page is it contributed for one
of the member so we'll insert will enter
name will say this the name is Mahesh
and we say mahi at rate gmail.com and
okay gmail.com and then we'll say you
are giving the feedback for the course
and will give a message which is good
and if I give a four star rating here
the moment I click on submit if we click
on OK you can see I'm getting another
page which page here because we have not
get that page yet but we are sending all
the information here now that
information you can see was it printed
on the console so whatever we have
entered in the main page when we will be
printed on the console now why we are
getting that is because in our code we
are we are mention that whenever I use a
call for pre-digestion
I'm sorry whenever a user click on the
submit button to submit button it will
call add feedback and add feedback will
be calling will be will be having on my
circle as ad feedback and okay so if you
are new to this do watch the enjoy
videos because I cannot talk about
everything here okay so what we want to
do is we are the data which I am getting
in the feedback and that is printing
that data I don't want to do that what I
here is to store this data indicator
base - my agenda here
our to store whatever data I am getting
here into data base
now how we can do that so there are
multiple steps you have to follow the
first step is whenever you want to work
with hibernate you have to add the
dependencies for hibernate
now when I say dependency I am talking
about the jar file I mean you have to it
is very important to follow these steps
okay so I hope you have seen the earlier
videos and based on the earlier videos
they are going for the next session and
configuring the application is very very
important downloading the jar files and
all having all the things so which jar
files I need you second you can see we
already have a spring jar files here
right now I want to add one more jar
file which is which is - a jar file so
what I'm going to do is I will go to my
permanent file
and in this dependency I have to add the
hibernate jars line okay I already have
all the jar files in my system I can
just copy them but then I wanted to show
you how to add jar file so that it will
be easier for you to work on the project
and again whatever I am doing now it is
actually contributed by Shilpa so I will
just write it here
wishes we should mention the names right
so I will say project this thing is
contributed by Shilpa same Raj this is
it okay so if there's any spelling
mistake sorry for that so this project
is this the modules which I'm talking
about now is will be is contributed by
she's path so thank you shall talk about
this okay so what are the jar files we
need here so the first jar file is the -
in jar files we want to use hibernate
here so what I will do is now I am going
to be getting dependencies now for this
you have to understand leaven now if we
don't know mavin do learn about maven so
we so to add the dependencies we need to
use maven now how do we use maven here
so what we will do is we will go to the
maven repository so this is the lemon
repository
to use a hybrid night project so I will
search for hibernate and if I saw one
hyper tonight you can see I'm searching
for hibernate here and so this is the
jar files this is the dependency we have
to add I will click on this now the jar
file I need here ok so which version
let's go for five point two point nine
this is the latest version I never go
for the recent version I can go for the
stable version you can see this library
is used a lot so let's go for that one
so we'll go for five point two point
nine let's copy this you have to copy
the dependency and you can just go back
to our project and let's paste it now we
got hybrid and dependency the moment I
say save you can see the dependency
section here we got all the library all
the high potato file so this piece of
the Java files
I got using hi pertinent ok now what are
those jars are needed now since we are
using hibernate and string together
I will also have to add one more jar
file here which is for spring o RN now
when you will remember this whenever you
combine spring and hibernate we have to
use that jar file we have to use spring
o RM jar file so we go for that as well
let's go to Miami depository and search
for spring o RM and this is what we want
so we want string ORM let let's go for
spring four point three point seven
that's our spring version here let's
copy this let's go back and let's paste
it here so we got the spring over the
dependency as well okay so this is this
these are the two dependencies we have
added ok so people who are asking
question to charge window just to let
you know we will only talk about the
project in this live session no other
question please so let's not get
distracted from this project ok so ok
what else we have
so we got this dependence
spring ORN now next dependency is the
MySQL dependency because the database
which we are working now is mask you'll
right so see this we have added a
dependency for spring MVC this is what
we have done the last session then we
have added dependency force for the
hibernate code and a spring ORM in this
session we want some more dependencies
here one of the V dependency which we
need is MySQL so whatever we do is I
will go back here and now which mask or
dependency we need so let's go back to
the map of where we deposit tree and
search for MySQL connector ok it's
searching ok so if I click on this will
go for the version which is five point
one point three nine this is the stable
version again I will use this and let's
go back to our dependencies and paste so
we have added the hybrid dependency the
spring one of dependency and we have
added to mask your connector dependency
now what are the dependency our need
okay so okay so why we need all the
dependency first of all we have added
spring MVC because we are building a
spring MVC project I wanted to implement
hibernate that's why we have added
spring Co so hyper edge code I want to
use hibernate and spring together that's
why we are using spring ORM C we can
either use only spring with database
which is using JDBC all we can use only
hibernate but then it is better to
combine spring and hibernate together to
work right and that's why we require
spring over them here and master because
the database which I am working with is
a master database now we need two more
dependencies view first one would be for
JDBC because we will be using derivative
did you see
pulling here so I want to use this
database connect database connection
pool and whenever you want to use pool
we use a we use a dependency which is
which is c3p0 that is the difference to
our dependency is available for this one
of them is three c3p0 this is Jerry BC
connection pooling okay so we go
questions from Muhammad's we're going to
be using hibernate annotation I mean
Forex to make to make an entity will be
using JDBC so we'll be using JP here but
then for for the implementation will be
using hibernate okay
so from this we'll be using the first
one because that is used a lot let's go
back and then go to pom equals file and
let's paste it here okay so we have
added also dependencies right I mean
that's a critical thing okay now if
you're wondering just to make a feedback
form via writing all these dependencies
no actually we are doing this for the
entire project you just have to do this
one okay so once you have added all the
dependencies you're the using this for
the entire project so this is a one step
okay this is what you say the initial
quantification for the project okay so
we have added this one let's add one
more now see will be so many way you
work with database we know the concept
of transactions right so we have the
concept of rollback we have a concept of
commit so whenever you use whenever you
do any transaction of the database you
have to make sure that either you click
on I mean if everything goes good go for
commit if something goes wrong you have
to go for goal bank now again I don't
want to do that I don't either developer
I don't want to focus on rollback and
comment so what we can do is we can ask
our Spring Framework to do that position
for us and to do that we have to add one
more dependency I trust fit is the last
dependency we are using now which is
Spring TX which is spring transaction if
I search for this spring TX this
visiting species be dependents if you
have to add and we'll be adding four
point zero point seven and let's go back
and done so by doing this we have added
all the dependencies which we need here
I know it is lots of dependencies but
then we do not have a choice so it is
required to use GDB or not so we got a
question from current if you are using
hi wanna extend we need JDBC knows if
you are using hibernate we only have to
focus on hyper tonight we don't native
is there okay so you can see they have
added all the dependencies here regard
spring MVC regard spring cause we got
spring one and we got a mask yo we got
Jessica nation pulling and then requires
spring tas so once we have added all the
dependency what next
see to connect with database I mean to
connect with hibernate I don't know how
many of you know hibernate here but I'm
assuming that you know hibernate
if you don't know hibernate that's fine
so this just pause this video and if you
are watching this live we do not have a
choice but then if you are watching this
video afterwards just pause this video
and you have to go to youtube and search
for telesco hibernate I do have videos
on hibernate on YouTube so watch those
videos it will clear your hybrid concept
and you can just continue with this
session then okay so we got a question
from mam for Mohammed spells
what about string security dependency so
we'll talk about string security later
timings we are not focusing on string
dependency or spring technology so will
we talk about that later
ok so now o when you work with when you
work with a dependence I mean when you
work with hibernate you need to add ok
so we got a question from aware you have
added dependencies c3p0 for that do we
need to add related properties yes when
you work with cp3 3p0 you have to add
these properties which is full pool size
you have to mention the minimum idle
time and like them sighs you have to
mention all the things we will be doing
that soon ok so you have to so we we
need to use a hibernate rewrite and many
will use hibernate we need to create the
object off session factory so what I
will do is I will say private session
factory and I will name this as session
factory
ok so I want to create object of such an
factory let's input the package for this
and you can see the package is important
on this package so session factory is
interface which is coming from
so our G's or hibernate package okay now
the question arise how do we use this
session Factory and how do we save the
data I mean you will not believe it is
so easy to store the data
normally in JDBC we have to follow seven
steps I mean I hope you know all you all
know JDBC and if you want to do the same
thing in JDBC if you want to store this
I get it in the table you have to like
the service steps now fortunately we got
hibernate in in hibernate you don't have
to do seven steps I mean you have to but
not in the code so what we will do is I
will simply create a little session I
will say session a session equal to and
I would say sessions factory which is
the object of such an factory which is
created about and will say get current
session so whenever you work with
hibernate we all know that we have to
work with the session session object now
once in court decision object let's
input the package for that it should be
Oh RJ dot hibernate dot session and here
once you got the session object what
we'll do is we'll simply say session dot
save and I will say save the feedback
and that's it your job is done
the moment you run this code we are
expecting that it will be storing data
in the database unfortunately if it on
this code you'll get an error because we
are still debating with some
quantification now what condition
talking about let's say if it on this
code
how would you hibernate thing see
hibernate is hibernate why hibernate is
not Reznick hard to do everything by
itself you have to configure your you
have to configure the hibernate but then
where i will configure the hibernate
which plays ok so what you can do is if
you want to configure hibernates
properties this will be fine you have to
use so this is the file where you have
to configure your hibernate ok so if you
want to configure this we have to add
extra extra or uses the namespace here
the first name space you have to mention
is ok so what do I do here is I already
have four type this code Samba is always
actually use this is of typing because
it will say it will wedge lots of time
so the first thing we need here is the
XS day which is for transaction ok so we
will need this one so we got this one so
we got D X so XML xmlns:ix
so it is xml namespace for transaction
is this one and then we have to also
mention the x SD file for that so the
excessive file is it is copy that one as
well so I am copying it and let's paste
it here okay
so we have to add these things if you
are typing by yourself you can type it
okay so that great alright so what we
have done till now is we have simply
created this we have simply added that
transaction thing now what else we need
here so we have to provide lots of
quantification right the first thing you
have to provide is the properties for
connection pooling now I will not type
all the properties here I will simply
copy those properties from the convict
thing which I have in my system I will
try to upload all the things on the key
table don't worry
so once the session is complete I will
be uploading this thing on github to
copy
I will explain you what are all this
what all the things being just give me a
second here okay so we got okay so
whenever you want to configure your
connection pooling which is really
pulling you have to mention the you have
to mention the database place so I have
my database inside this system I don't
have database in my system I have
another machine just next to me with IP
address 192 dot 168 dot one dot two and
in that we have a database which is
Cisco okay and we have to mention the
Java class name which is combat max will
give you statistics or driver and you
can mention the username password and I
can I am revealing my username password
here that is root and root this is the
minimum pool size and this is the
maximum pull size or video 5 finish in
my company connections and idle time
would be to reduce all those very second
okay so we have configured our connect
data connection pooling now once you
have done with this next thing you have
to configure is the session factory
because see when you talk about this
object know where we are creating object
for this slide I am actually using the
reference
we cannot use the reference directly
right we need to create the object it is
important and since we are using spring
I will not create the object by by
ourselves
of course right when you when spring is
there why you have to create object by
yourselves you can ask spring to give it
to you and why this thing is giving it
to you you can also assign the
properties because whenever you session
factory we have to throw a lot subtract
what is right
so which power I am talking about let me
just copy those properties as well so
it's here let me just copy that okay and
let's paste it here now these are the
properties for will show down okay where
was I okay so yeah so we have to we have
to set all these properties now what is
this property so this is the object all
session factory which I have created now
so this is a special factory object now
many we want to create a session factory
object again we can use a normal day TBC
way but again normal so normal hibernate
way but then using normal hibernate way
it becomes very compact you know if you
want to change it with anything you have
to change the source code in spring what
you can do is spring provides you the
hibernate of features so using spring
ORM you can use local session factory
pane which will give you the object of
session factory okay but you have to
configure you have to mention something
you have to first mention the data soul
the data source which we have created
here okay so whatever gate opposed the
whatever property is the information
here the same properties will be used
for data source next thing you have to
mention is where do we find all our
entities now currently we have only one
entity which is feedback you can see we
have feedback here this is the only
entity we have now okay this is what we
have there is a long session while you
have created or feedback for me or a
feedback failure so we have to mention
bit feed if you have to mention all our
entities within this file okay so you
want to increase the font size but which
is all which is better right if you can
see my video in full screen and if you
increase the quality of which of your
video to 720 I think it gives software
divisible okay so
yeah so I just verified this with my
other machine I guess I can see the font
properly all right so let's go back here
okay just before continuing if you are
watching if you are just joining this
session we are doing a live project if
you are liking this session do click on
the like button so that I will know that
you are enjoying this session because
that's what motivates me okay so this is
what we have mentioned here we have aqua
witness to some indentation here okay so
as you can see we have so we have
mentioned the place where you can find
all the packages the next thing which we
need here is the hibernates properties
now when everyone would hibernate you
have to mention some properties one of
them is okay so you have to mention
these two properties so anyway you work
with hyper that you have to mention
these two properties the first one is a
dialing now why we have to mention that
it is because different DBMS has
different way of writing SQL queries
right so one of the query is I mean if
you are using mask you have to use MySQL
dialect and then if you want to see the
query which is running you can say it
true otherwise which is not compulsory
where you can even if you don't mention
this property to divide equals false
okay so that's cool okay so we have done
with this property so we have mentioned
we have mentioned the okay so we have
mentioned the data source we have
mentioned the property for a session
factory we have to set one more property
here which is for transaction of course
right we are doing a transaction here so
how do we set the property here so to
set this a transaction transaction
property let me just copy that okay so
let me just paste the property for
transaction so for transaction will we
will be using hibernate transaction
manager so because I don't want to
manage the transaction I want - it - -
the transaction because I don't know how
many of you learn - it by yourself if
you watch my hibernate videos you can
see in that I was managing all the -
installations by myself ok the
transaction but now I will ask string to
do it for me
okay let me just do some indentation
here just to make it look good okay oh
now what I what else I needed the final
property we have to mention is first
transaction so we have to mention all
the transactions will be done with the
help of annotations I will not be using
context I will not be doing modulation
by myself
always in annotation and since we want
to use annotation here I will be using
this one so is a t-rex plantation
divination annotation free one and I'll
mention transition manager as my
transaction manager notice this marginal
manager I give the ID which you are
mentioned here so you can see everything
is interdependent here so by doing all
the things we have configured our
project so that we can work with
hibernate now okay I'm tired with this
only so we have configured our servlet
XML where we have mentioned the
hibernate property so all the properties
are mentioned here in case in future if
you are not using masks you'll you just
have to change this one you have to
change this one you have to change which
one you have to change the dialect
that's it so that's the advantage of
using spring you know okay now what's
nice now once we have done with this
let's go back to our feedback Tao and in
this we have this method which is
feedback Tao okay so in this what we
have to do is I want to create objects
of sessions factory now I will not get
object of such as bacteria myself I will
be using string here so I'll be using
iterate or two wired now if we use an
identity auto wire it will create the
object per object oxygen taxi by itself
however if we go to questions from party
multi-phase property name will always
decision factory you are talking about
this one yes this property is always
action factory because that is the
inbuilt object or hibernate transaction
manager it's already downloading the
source code but once it is downloaded
you can see this one which is the
session factory is in
which is a which you have to use and
this is in factory is our object which
we have created here in fact if it also
lipid also uses used to a great sorry
auto wire the XML property for that you
could have used that okay so you can see
we call the documentation for this and I
just hope I am glad I was talking about
now you can see the infinite object name
itself official factory so it's not
change that we don't have a choice okay
so oh that's good I got 61 likes and one
dislike okay so someone is panning the
chat window let me just block that
person so macho Kumar you are blocked
okay great so let's cook let's continue
with this now so okay so let me call
record all we have said all the
properties here now what next we can do
okay so now what I want is this should
work will this work
no because we have four transactions we
have to use annotation which is called
as a transactional now we want it to
manage the transaction by itself so I
will not use transaction by myself I
will I will ask you to do the
transaction and I will import the
package from this yeah so this is the
thing which you have to use so add
feedback we have to put either a
transactional on top width so that it
will manage the transaction by itself
okay so now it should work like but then
I got a point from someone here who was
mentioning about a great entities so TP
void but TP voice says if you have not
mentioned a de-rate entity will it work
no we have to mention that right but if
you don't mention what will happen it
will give you a low right so let's
mention that so let's mention this is
identity so whenever you use hibernate
and whenever you mention I mean whenever
you want to use I mean if anyone you
want to specify that this will work with
hibernate you have to use
identity that will make it edgy Dee's
this will make it at entity type
this will make it as entity and we have
to also measure the dramatically now I
know I was not thinking about primary
key idea but now this composite is our
primary key here so I will make this
email as a primary key so I will say at
H ID so the using metadata ID you can
make or you can make a variable as a
primary key of a table so if I use a
great idea on top of email it will make
a primary key okay now it I think
everything should work let's not let's
run this currency which is working or
not let's go back to our file for slice
Firefox it's here and let's just refer
this a - thanks for the code so we are
using your code here I hope it will work
silver okay so I will use my age I will
use all this detail and it is the
consummate like white thank you here
okay so because another but that'sthat's
it because we don't have a J's because
we don't have a welcome page let's go
back here in my HT s where is my excuse
okay you can see this is working because
a husband denied output which says
insert into feedback it has inserted D
feedback but on how you will how do you
verify this
so I'll forward to mention I have
already created tables while in the last
session we have fit our table so it will
be using the same database view so I
will go to my workbench and if I pass
the query yeah you can you see that we
got my age we got a man ID regards they
are not enter the message oh what's
wrong with message watch wrong with math
which I have I guess have I have not
typed the message there is it just go to
five four oh I have typed the message
but message is not coming here so there
is one problem with the message message
is not coming resolutions coming code is
not coming up if you have not entered
the cold
so something wrong with the message here
let me just verify what that problem is
so you find see my HTML ch okay if I see
my stable response you can see message
here is MSG and the message there is the
complete a message hmm let's see all
that so what we do is we'll change this
name here so I was the right leg we're
not here I was acting on the feedback I
would say all the tables I will make it
as I want to change this message to
message m hg and let's apply now again
this is on other the machine it will
take some time to reflect
okay so you got some time anyway let's
try once again let's try the different
output or different values let's go back
here what's wrong with this this and
let's reach see refresh the page and we
didn't set a new value zero or it is
nice change this name and I will name
this name as Kundun and I will mention
the email id as Koons nitrogen will calm
you want to rate it for me and you'll
insert the code as one to the one okay
zero one zero and we'll take search very
good okay and we'll keep the feedback as
five the click on so much thanks for the
feedback Quinton okay let's go back to
our database and register my database is
actually hanged here workbench is not
working properties like the so I click
this and say force quit let me open my
workbench once again
okay let's fly now let's see you let's
use the Disco database and let's fetch
these feedbacks now can you see that
require Kundun here regard London regard
to regard one zero one zero three oh we
have not got the message here it is
because oh we've got a message but what
is not working it is very fine with this
let's open a Cheers
let's see feedback Dao everything is
perfect here also oh we don't have a
message here that is real how can we
make this type of mistake and let's have
the constructor for that as well in fact
we are not using constructive right
let's remove this constructor from here
okay I need given to the phone message
as well so I will say right like so
and white clay there is a toes okay
we've got a question from says which is
better the annotation way or XML I
always prefer an efficient way because
it makes my work easier I was never a
fan of XML before so that's why I always
should I always be for XML the way also
the annotation way let me just read this
server that CV is working or not let's
go back to five four and let's do this
again by changing the images open
because we are made it dramatically
right
so I will say kundan is a kun kun enter
a gmail.com let's submit this it says
thank you for the feedback let's go back
to the database now and let's try this
query now run can you see that you also
cut the masses design so yes we can also
use create and update instead of using
phase we can also use create and update
here so the way we are using phase
methods we can also use update method
you can also use delete all the small of
things okay so that's it so we have so
fungal eyes we have done with the
database code and we have used hibernate
so I am very happy with this because I
was not thinking about hibernate before
I was thinking about JDBC I wanted the
code in JDBC but then shilpa has given
us the code in hibernate and then i've
implemented tag but is working so we'll
be continuing with the spring and
hibernate so that we'll be having that
complete power right so so what I want
from you so complete this project by
yourself now so we have done only for
the add feedback I want you to create a
method quadrants get feedback so I want
to see all the feedbacks here I want to
see so I want to see all the feedbacks
so we should be able to add feedback I
want to see all the feedback so I want
you people to complete - stuff for me
and send it to me upload the project on
github and give give give that
to be so okay so we've got a question
from current in hibernate roots behind
us okay so this is that is different why
we are using hybrid CMG where you can
use create an update in spring it is
better to create database by yourself
initially and then you can use that in
fact in spring hi one is also we can do
that exercise the point of research then
Google how to use that and that sits on
this from this life coding what I want
from you in the next session is I want
you people to redesign this page so we
have to be almost under the feedback
right so we have done the initial step
that the next step would be I want you
people to give me the homepage I want to
be able to redesign the homepage okay so
I want you people to redesign this page
okay so what I'm expecting is instead of
having three different okay so first of
all let's talk about the links I want
you can see you have a power you can
redesign this thing the way you want I
want this online course to be on the top
here not here here
I mean that is that is what I have done
and not good with designs right so I
want okay for this page slider you can
just animate this okay and then you can
so the you can see we have explore our
videos happy coding so you will get the
codes from here and you can also give it
tests instead of having two different
sections can we just have everything in
one section you can have a video we can
have code and we can have test and if I
click on the video icon it should expand
it to something like this if I click on
the code icon which should be here if I
click on that it should expand in encode
the code text okay and I also want one
more update here if you can show the
latest videos somewhere after this
slider if you can show the latest video
so whatever we do are loading on YouTube
if you can just put that if you can just
put that here
yes current images for slackers slider
images for Spyder years okay you want me
you want the images what you can do is
you can just give dummy images and we
will replace that so we have design team
here they will replace the images okay
