attached to my microphone yet I was
doing some setting on the phone so this
time I'm using a different I don't know
hope I'm not evil properly there just to
check the voice I will just verify wit
once before going ahead and let me just
do it setting as well so let me know my
the quality of the video the quality of
the audio other thing so let me know if
it is everything is good I said cut
again II was saying hi hi okay voice is
good great what about the what about the
video quality is it good okay everything
is good so I can see the God to 128
people watching great today is no match
right so last time in event live it was
only 65 people watching then today we
have 127 people watching and 16 likes
that's great okay so great so I can see
that lots of messages coming so so first
of all it's been it's been a long time I
went live so it's been two weeks now
like two weeks yeah so this is the third
third Sunday and then I'm going live I
was busy with some other stuff plus
there was - they were in Depok India
Australia match so everyone was busy
with that and I was working on some
project I'm working on
Java 9 content I'm doing ok so there are
lots of things which I which are going
on now and that's why I was bit busy and
that's why I was not live but today I'm
back so we try to answer as much as much
as questions as possible let me give you
a thing and it may not be possible to
answer all the questions so I will try
to answer those questions which R&amp;amp;D so
it is like first come first serve so if
the questions which starts from the
first one I will try to answer I was
trying to start with that the time limit
for today's session is half an hour so
we are going so we shut it at 6:40 will
end at 10:00 7:10 okay so we have half
an hour session so if you want to go
somewhere just go out to 30 minutes
great so we got 128 123 people watching
and 49 likes if you are if you want the
top of sessions more because like button
and that's what motivates me is the look
of it they want the like button there
okay so let's start with the first
question okay Abbi folks any question
can we talk about something else about
my plan so Java nine videos are on the
way I'm trying to make as much as videos
on Java 9 the only thing is I'm busy
with some other work that's why I'm not
able to concentrate on the content of
Java 9 but then I'm ready I mean reading
some documentation on that I'm reading
some I'm watching some videos from Java
people what they think about John online
features and then I will try to simplify
those stuff and give it to you ok great
so oh my god Victor says hi I've been
watching you from last year that's great
idea thanks for being with that is
called laughing from a log for a long
time okay so we got okay everyone says
voice is good
hi hello good ok are good perfect
everything is good sir ok so there's so
much positivity can you see that
ok everything is good where do you oh so
first question copy hacks where did you
work before ok so uh it's been a long
journey for me I cannot label the
company names I was working with I guess
I was working for one of the service
based company before fall for quite a
bit of time and then I joined a
particular company I was working there
for some time and then I became into
training and then so I used to go to
colleges for training then I went for
companies for training and I also work
as a freelancer project I also work as a
donor / as a freelancer I'm trying to
build my own platform now so there are
so many things going the same time so
yeah so that's my whole journey buddy
I've been to what multiple companies not
a very big company you cannot expect
goal or Facebook if you have waiting
what that answer no I was not working
for any big company or small companies
but then I was happy with whatever I was
doing ok so watching you from the acaba
Haresh audio is perfect oh that's great
we've got audience from everywhere in
the world everything is good everything
is good ok so question from the TIA are
you from Hyderabad the answer is No
remember and you can see number there's
lots of lightning happening there so
lightning thunder sturum then we have
rains
so we have a very different climate in
Mumbai so answer Mumbai a bond but up in
Mumbai kur the only thing is I am into
I'm the origin is from Hyderabad not
just not exactly hyper but but then from
from antibodies which is now Telangana
I mean I'm into that work the Telangana
part and then to be specific Karim Nagar
so okay so basically I belong to South
but then I live in Mumbai a bond bottom
by happy to Mumbaikars okay so
everything says good audio is good audio
is good okay I know that or just thought
five into five what is five to five
twenty five I don't know video quality
is very bad or is it okay I am trying a
different phone today this is not my
primary phone the problem with primary
phone is not working properly there is
some problem with that so I'm using the
second phone maybe for video quality is
bad and not sure I can see actually the
video card is not that good I will not
use this phone again I will try to find
some other solution next time for sure
okay so let's start with the actual
questions now so I use says is so this
is a good time to switch to Kaplan has
an toda raba
I would say yes in future most of the
people will be switching to Cortland for
multiple reasons one of the reason is it
is easy to learn the second problem is
when you work on Java project or the
problem is in Java you have to write
lots of boilerplate code and in Cortland
you can you know you can manage all
those things very easily especially the
way Parthian handles null it's awesome
so I would say yes if you if you have
worked on Java and if you thinking about
coddling go for it
I am NOT saying you you you skip Java
and just saying just also focus on
Courtland so when you work on a project
so try to work on both Kotlin and Java
anyway when you work on quarreling
you're actually working on Java right
you're not just walking on Kotlin you're
working on both Kaplan and Java so yes
so you can switch there is no problem in
switching to Cortland
anyway if you know Java that's quite
right so switch to code name so which
will be a wrong word right also work on
Cortland
and this also depend upon the it's also
depend upon the programmers if you if it
if you ask me and Dan coffee with Java
doesn't matter how much boil up it could
have to right I am comfortable with Java
but then there are people they are not
comfortable with Java they feel Java is
bad
Java is not back by then Java has lots
of boilerplate codes then you can work
on Cortland oh it's again depend up on
you so if you're happy with Java stick
to Java but then if you feel that you
are facing some issues with Java go for
go for Cortland ok ok so people are
saying video idea is good
oh ok so I guess depend upon the network
connection you are using so if you are
using a good connection yeah I guess you
are getting a good equality if you use
if you don't have a good call it a good
connection maybe that's the issue you're
facing ok so not on sale of use or other
now you to everyone of ok so sis may I
say is like a via or thank you so much
and the best likes actually motivate us
see for a youtuber to come live on you
come live on my on Sunday because
Sunday's are holiday right you have to
enjoy our day but then just because we
want to talk to you I mean especially if
talk about myself I want to talk to you
I want to know what is happening I want
you to know what is happening in in my
career in terms of YouTube all those
things and there one more thing I have a
recently crossed one I mean 100 thousand
subscribers I applied for the silver
button so said no button is on the way
I don't know when I will get it just two
or three days before my telescope
earning is verified now if you can see
there is a tick
so yes finally we are verified right so
in case in future if you are facing some
issues so we have someone to you know
take a color so yes we got the attic as
well ok it is mobile ok so question from
Abdul is mobile development good choice
as a major in life of course the future
is mobile right ok so future is there
are lots of things in future now you
know the things are changing damn
quickly if you talk about 2 year 2000
2000 to 2005 everything was so smooth
you know everything once you once you
learn dotnet you are your life is set
once you learn PHP your life is set once
you learn Java our life is set but then
this is not the right time this too
17 now and things are changing damn fast
I cannot I cannot tell you that once you
learn mobile your government your future
is fixed the only thing is you have to
start somewhere right so this is a good
time now so BRB my developer and try to
see what is coming in the future when
you cannot tell you the future right so
maybe after 3-4 years they like Google
mentioned they are not focusing on
mobile now they are focusing on AI right
so the past was mobile and in fact the
past was desktop the future the present
is mobile the future is AI so of course
if it so I would say go from a while and
then in future try to work on AI try to
work on a concept like blockchain so try
to learn all those things but yes
starting with mobile technologies or
some things so struggle it why are you
waiting for
okay so the daily produce a is waiting
for Python tutorials
keep waiting I can't make Python videos
I was thinking about making a Python
video I was thinking about you know
refreshing my skills on Python and think
then I make up then make a video but
trust me guys making videos it's a very
I cannot say difficult task but it take
lots of time you know making videos
takes lots of time lots of brainpower
and I don't want to spend my time on
Python because there are so many things
on the way
I'm not saying pythons bad it's just
that I'm not that comfortable with
Python so if I if you give me a choice I
have to make a video of course I would
choose something which I love to work on
example I would love to make videos on
Java 9 I would love to make videos on
ADA blue eyes I would love to make
videos on gate I can oh they have so
many plays which are still not completed
yet so I'm working on all the project
together right so let's see so Python
I'm not sure when I will go up loading
that ok so good voice quality oh thank
you so much ok cushion for money when
you upload data structure videos as I
mentioned there are so many things lined
up it's difficult for me to you know
make the videos so I will sure they try
to make as much as weak as possible on
data structures but then but not now
okay I got some messages let me just
reply them since
life okay next okay one more thing if
you're watching this live I would
recommend you to share this video with
your friends let everyone knows about
this channel because when you're
learning a new technology and if you get
a platform to learn why not so share
with your friends let them know about
this channel and let them learn okay
okay so people okay people are watching
Bahubali is it bogging is coming on TV
I'm not sure I know and I have not seen
that and this in a long time I've
watched TV
okay so prion Gupta says difference
between access modifier is specifier
okay simple answer in Java we don't have
anything else method specifiers in java
everything is modifier yeah if you are
coming from C++ that around I'll see
that around yes we have specify as it
specifies there right but then in Java
everything is modifier so if you talk
about so when you modify your axis
example when you make it public when you
make it drive it you're changing the
more you're changing the axis right and
that's what it's called as modifiers so
in Java we have final as a modifier we
have private public there's so many
things right so yeah in Java we only
have modifiers oh okay so question is
okay
real MDM can store data likes local
storage I don't have any idea about real
DT DDM MDM okay good thing I will just
Natick node on I will just note on all
these things and then I will be such
upon this what is real MDM not sure not
sure okay
next what's up nothing a question from
day Bernake so will you please make
tutorials and data structures no not as
of now maybe future maybe oh please make
a video or java.awt who is using AWT
nowadays I didn't know so it's been a
long time people have worked on IWT now
so after it availability we caught swing
Java swing and after swing we call Java
FX if we really want to learn something
run Java effects why you want to learn
aid ability maybe because of your
syllabus for
syllabus in fact I have seen this there
are some colleges they are still teacher
stood we're focusing on a WT I know when
they will change the syllabus okay next
is can you okay I lost all the questions
this is this is why I hate the chat
window the moment you scroll up it goes
way up and I lost all the questions let
me just go up everyone just two minutes
not not even two minutes just one ten
seconds
okay yeah I'm here I'm here
yeah can you please make a video on a
sink loader in Android oh okay I first
need to check what is this see the thing
is Android Java these are technologies
which is very easy to forward you know
because I was working on Android 2 years
before and then I worked on Android for
some time now I'm not focusing on
Android and the problem is once you
switch once you switch on some other
technologies and see all this data all
this technology which you learn is there
in your exam so in your brain you have
RAM and you have hard drive right and
then the moment you lose the what you
say then whether then you lose the touch
with the technology you will you may pop
out all these things or you may not be
comfortable with all the technologies so
the same thing happening with me for
Android if you ask me to work on Android
now it will take me at least one or two
days to refresh all these skills and
then that's why Android is not in my
playlist for I mean in my not in my
to-do list for the next series so I know
you are expecting lots of videos from my
side and I should be making lots of
videos because I have this channel right
you are supporting me from a long time
but then there are so many issues you
know I'm working on so many things I
know I'm not able to manage everything
properly but then I will try to my I
will try to make good use of my time all
right ok ok so so much so cos say is
what is your profession good question
okay so time being I'm moving from a
part-time youtuber to a full-time
youtuber because of good number of
subscribers since we have built a good
platform so we have a very big family
now and I have to make sure that you get
what you want so I'm moving
a python youtuber - a full-time youtuber
I'm also a corporate trainer so I've got
two different companies for training I
okay what else what does it do
so these are some things I'm doing now
okay so Guinness says best web developer
certification and whatever it is
necessary now first of all I don't know
why people want to do certification it's
been long time we are we are focusing on
certification I mean no one asked for
certification nowadays
what you need is skill set if you you
need a good amount of skill set with you
so what I would recommend is if you
really want to be good at something
start working start building projects I
would not recommend certification at
this point yeah when you talk about new
technologies like Big Data Hadoop all
those things yes you need certification
but then for web designer web
development
I think if you build enough projects so
what conferencing projects work on your
own projects make dummy projects and
upload those files on github and
whenever you go for the introduce share
your github link if in fact if I want to
recruit someone I were to cook some
people who knows something was warmed on
the project not well certifications even
I don't know what certification you can
go for for web designing not sure but
then I would not recommend you to go
forward with certification okay so next
is but the top card will java build a
place by cotton in future c java will
never be replaced now this is a very
wrong term which we use replacement is
not a right word but yes people will
move to Kotlin okay they will so let's
say if I'm working on a project now and
that does it is built on Java so of
course I will continue with Java project
but then if I get a chance that you can
build you are building a new project now
and then you have you have two choices
our Java or you can go for Cortland then
of course if I am not comfortable with
Java then you can go for the cut line
right so at that point people will use
it will start using Cortland and then
they they can make project but then
remember this quadlin itself gets
convert into java files so even if you
are working on coupling you're working
on Java now it also happened that your
project may be in Java maybe a Java
project and then you want to use partly
that's possible because cotton and Java
interoperable but yes any future people
will prefer partly in over Java it will
not be replaced completely but then yes
it will people will prefer to use
Scotland in Java
so that's that's the thing maybe Kotlin
and Scala so people will prefer these
two things so they will not refer Java
ok one day for those people who are new
but then people who have already worked
on job for a long time they will pay for
Java is best in fact if you ask me for
if I want to work on a project of course
I will choose Java and I'm comfortable
with Java right I am not that compare
with Cortland now but if I choose to I
can learn partly I can spend next two
months working on different projects on
Kotlin and that's how I become
professional but then you know that's
the problem with the experience people
they don't want to jump to different
technologies just because it is new but
for freshers they will choose they will
choose Scotland for sure okay so - says
I I just want to ask how to learn code
Java in 30 days oh ok so if you spend 4
hours a day see first of all this of
there's no particular formula for for
someone to learn I mean so there's no
particular formula that you can learn in
30 days but then learning is let me the
time of amount of time which will take
to learn a language is different from my
brief word for different of different
for everyone so example if I want to
learn something new maybe it will take
two months for me but there will be some
person who might learn the same
technology in one week right so I cannot
say how we can learn in 30 days but then
there are certain subject to follow when
you learn the language I cannot promise
you in the number of days but then I can
promise you that you can learn Java in
this amount of time such steps start
learning syntax for Java so anybody
learn a new language only focus on
syntax first at least for first one week
focus only on syntax ok this is how we
can do it this is how we can do it this
is how we can do it this is how we can
do it and later on you can think about
okay I'm getting some call I guess or
I'm getting a very bad connection just
hold on okay I guess I am live again
there was some issue with the network as
it is raining outside okay let me know
if you are if you if you can watch me
property there this next one is an epic
issue
and there's a like lots of lightning
happening there if I can show you a
lightning there or something you know
okay so but then I cannot promise a
number of days but then if you work hard
it will it is possible in 20 days or
ninety five days okay but if you take a
formal training you know when you go to
classes when you join any batch you may
learn it in one week or two weeks
because when I go for company training I
teach I teach Java to people in five
days six days of course they will not
understand everything but then you can
learn Java in one week but then
implementing it it takes some time so
okay next how to start a I in fact I
would recommend you to go to youtube and
search for Angie Ong so a and D are aw
Angie and search for that person is very
famous in terms of AI and machine
learning and watch his video he will
because you're getting good ideas how to
start with a I am NOT a person to you
know to let you know about AI I don't
want to miss Li misguide you so search
for Andrey Ong or you can also search
for I always forward his name see Raj s
I are AJ said I watched some of his
videos and his awesome yes I are AJ is a
large okay so next question from Rohit
Varma okay so good question best
features in Java 9 I love lots of each
of Java 9 you know I am I don't know I
became a big fan of Java and nahin okay
so one of my ok so you're talking about
the favorite feature or the future I
love so let me start with knife what I
loved as a trainer you know I always
find difficult to teach people and
that's why because we've nu want to
teach Java to people you have to start
with so many things you know you have to
teach about classes and methods now we
caught in Java and we got Jay shell and
in Jay shell I can teach Java very
smoothly or I can simply talk about how
this is how you can play this is how you
can get a variable so yes for me at
least
Jay shell I loved it but if you really
talk about
the major development in Java 9 it is
that the concept of logic jigsaw which
is modularity which means you can you
can draw you can create small small
modules and stop building a big project
you can create small small modules and
there's so many things inside that once
I make a video on that you will
understand but then yes the biggest
biggest feature is project itself which
is modularity there are so many concepts
they have so many updates which are
coming but I loved Jason and the best
one is producer ok
hi why don't you keep what what do you
want want me to KITT keep silent I don't
know okay
have a question ok so no no ok good
morning are you from Hyderabad no I
mentioned that questions alright I guess
the questions are getting repeat it I
don't know why please make a video
through our data structures of the same
question okay so next question from
mother what courses what courses should
I do rather than BCA degree okay first
of all if you are the if you if you're
talking about a graduation degree then I
would say you have option of be a CIT
you can go for BCA is another good
option if you want it to get too
technical technology so learn BCA and
with that also work on new technologies
maybe you can learn about machine
learning you can learn about Android you
can learn about blockchain so the
emerging technologies in future is
blockchain AI what else there's so many
things which are coming on the way so
with your VC I would suggest to learn
all these things I'm not asking you to
join a classes for that but then if you
can do it online better alright so
there's some way this is available
online nowadays okay I can see 151
people are watching this that's great if
you really like this all sessions click
on the like button I guess that so many
people have just joined the session just
you can click on the like button there
just to motivate me okay so our next
question from Kailash real life example
of polymorphism
I always give this example you know we
as humans we behave differently in
different situation example when we are
at home we first of all polymorphism
means many forms I had many behaviors so
body is many more okay again lightning
yeah samake ism is behavior many
behavior are many forms
so as few months we behave different
different different different locations
when you are at home you behave
differently when you are in office you
behave differently when you talk to your
boss you behave differently so we are
polymorphic so dependable situation we
change right there are so many examples
which I can give you but not now you can
watch my videos for that okay next okay
next place make a video okay same thing
same questions same questions okay okay
so our scene says wanted to learn spring
MVC but that's great what you can do our
same I do have videos on spring MVC but
not not the complete thing so if you
want to learn spring MVC you can you can
watch my videos or what you can do is i
am i do take online patches you know you
can go for the paid courses i do on and
i just like training so i provide live
training on kochava advanced java spring
and hibernate if you really want
interested go to a web site that is calm
slash online dot HTM and you can get the
course from there okay good coach should
I learn okay should I learn ad
development with Java or Cortland is
depend upon you if you are big now first
learn Java been learn Kotlin and work
you start working on Courtland ok by no
means don't skip Java ok Java is not
going anyway for next 5 to 6 years but
yeah it may be after that it is possible
but then you cannot learn one language
and you can say ok light is set because
everything will change in three to four
years even if you if you learn maybe a I
now the way I will work in future will
be very different you cannot say once
you learn something you will be stable
with that so start it something okay
next next next next
okay I'm a question a point from Reno
your videos are so useful because of
your videos I got placed in one of the
MVC MNC oh thank you so much right now I
know I love people who steal P credits
but then it's all it's all your it's all
your hard work because it does so many
resources available on the internet
right it's all depend upon you how much
you work on right so I was just a part
of your journey but then it's your
efforts so I would I would you know so
all the best for your future right so
work hard and keep learning on those
Runnings okay so neuron says now in AI
with Java please okay first for that I
have to I have to learn the Hat have not
into AI much okay so
Akshay says I placed in a company but I
don't have aggregated 60% economics is
there any chances that they will
unplaced me I don't know when you signed
that agreement in that agreement they
mentioned so when they when you when you
went for the introduced at that point if
they mentioned that you need 60% then
yes you need 60% if we don't have 60%
because for first one month especially
in MNC is they do lots of verifications
you might lose your job in that case
first so what I would do is what I would
recommend you is talk to a chart first
let I mean ask them what is it what are
your situation so it's always better to
first ask white instead of working for
one month and then they say okay you are
not eligible so this this happened with
me a one of one of my friend in one of
the MNCs or services company in India
not 1-3-1 because of the Marx's show one
because of some other company issues so
it does happen with first one month a
child will do lots of verifications or
do check to verify that so this says I
love your teaching methodology sir or
thank you so much thank you so much in a
recently I was thinking about changing
my teaching style because they were say
for as there are so many people who like
my videos there are some people who hate
my videos
I thought you know people are hating my
videos they don't love that they don't
want to watch the way I teach so I
thought of just modifying it some people
they don't like my accent some people
don't like my examples I thought let me
just change it but now then I realize
what if I change it and then the people
who like my videos they start hitting it
I don't want to take a risk
that's why I'm being the way I am now so
but thank you so much for the informing
that you love my videos so I will be
continuing with that
dad says after a long time years after a
long time it's been two weeks now I I do
try to come live as much as possible but
then I don't know what happens okay
sniffs a is okay make a video on AWS oh
okay sure sure it up yourself is on the
way especially AWS quotes tab is on the
way mmm Naveen is my first participation
this is my first participation oh okay
you are the best oh thank you so much is
the first live session rate I hope
you're enjoying it I wanted to learn and
we see okay I mentioned that are the use
son certified no I am NOT so coach all
says is kailash says are you son
certified no I'm not certified but I
teach people who get oh go for
certifications that's the irony of life
okay hello so spring boot social and
badge is really important for the
industry yes spinning boot and badge is
important that don't I'm not sure about
social but then yes bring a boot and
spring badge is important it's also
depend upon which company you join is
also depend upon what project they are
working they might not use a spring
batch then what you will do once you
join a project then you will agree you
will understand what they want exactly
so what I would recommend is learn
spring spring code and spring MVC and
spring boot spring that spring security
is all depend upon your project so if
you really get into that type of project
then learn at that point okay where do
we learn where did you learn programming
suba suba ask where did you learn
programming so unknown program
from internet from Google from YouTube
videos so when I was in my first year
was it first year yeah first year BSC IT
when I was doing that or second year BSC
IIT it was here 2008 so I I went to
Google I searched about different
concepts I went to YouTube or not it was
2010 2010 when I come to I be a CIT not
doing I was doing it so when I come into
my BSC iti went to YouTube and I was
learning lots of things so I remember
one of my favorite channel at that point
was Java 9s so you can search for Java
9s on YouTube he so I learned lots of
things from him I don't know if he knows
that he so but then he is very good with
training so I learned lots of Java
concepts from him now once I got the
confidence that you can do Java like
this because see when you want to learn
something new or getting a good type of
trainer is very important and luckily I
got that person I forgot his name I'm
very bad with that I'm very bad with
names but the channel name is Java 9s I
guess his name is something start with
s3 or sure I'm not not sure but then
he's an awesome guy so since because of
fame I got that conference this I can
learn Java and then I went to Google I
went up a different topic then I started
working on a project that's how I
learned programming and I also used to
participate in competitions and that's
what helped me in improving my
programming skills I don't I don't do it
now I don't complete with different
people
I should I used to do initially when you
compete you learn lots of things ok
money deep says we love you so you are
providing free knowledge oh you are
helping a lot of students so thank you
so much yeah that's what I was aiming
for I want to I want to teach as many
people as possible and that's why I say
you know share this videos let everyone
knows about the channel so everyone can
learn break can you suggest me some
final year project ideas I advanced Java
Oh a higher shot a long time so the
thing is I cannot recommend you with the
topics because nowadays things are
changing damn fast very very fast
so whatever the recommend is
think about the world around you or
maybe you can mimic some websites so
what if you really want to work only for
your college project what if what I can
say is there is a flip card application
or Amazon application Amazon website
just create a dummy of it so create the
exact dummy of Amazon advantage you know
the requirement and second you you can
prove yourself yes you can build this
same application which is already build
right it will give you lots of
confidence but if you really wanted to
try something new then try something new
right think about what are the problems
you face in real world and try to solve
our issues example when I was learning
Java for the first time the issue was I
was learning Java but I was not sure if
I didn't understand what I want what I
need to understand so for that we used
to participate in lots of competitions
and that's what we do so what you can do
is you can build up that form where
people can compete so that's how we do
it so build a platform which we so if
you face any issue just build a platform
for that ok next question
accesses do you understand
multi-language yes I do understand body
language born but a Mumbai so I don't
have a choice so some most of my friends
are my Russians so they they talk to
they talk in Marathi and when I when we
go out of course you have to talk to
people in Marathi so yes I do understand
Marathi I can speak a bit not come not
fluent in Marathi but then I can try ok
so why not sufficient videos on spring
ok you're asking me why no sufficient
videos on spring ok good point why not
all the videos I don't know how to
answer that question it's because not
everyone is watching my videos so what I
do is what is my strategy here is I
believe in I believe in something well
if I want to make videos let's say I
want to make videos on gate so whatever
it is I will start with the tutorials I
will make 5 to 6 videos and then I will
wait for the input so I will wait for
your input and on those videos and
depend upon your input I will continue
with the series right that's what I did
with Java so when I started with Java
videos I created maybe 1520 videos and
then I I was
was a whole for one or two months or
three months then I got good good
response from you people and that's why
I made the entire series same goes with
this one of the sublet I created two or
three videos then I wait for
I waited for some more video some inputs
and then I complete the entire series so
that's what I'm doing now so I'm waiting
for your input so if I only want those
videos to continue we just idly make it
right ok which one gave you a better
experience sir whether product based
also is this of course product base
proposed companies are worth working for
want to learn okay how to get it okay so
when can I says I would like to thank
you because of you our tutorials are
caught sight of Java in a company that's
great
ok so today I'm getting lots of
compliments a good day indeed ok
oh we are out of time is it here I want
to contribute my knowledge mustard
questions questions questions how much
experience I have seven years I started
in 2010 XT in seven years now it's very
easy to count count right I started in
2010 so I can just simply subtract that
year okay now next five minutes okay
it's we are running out of time now let
you pick those questions which I love
loud well I don't have any idea I I mean
it's a PHP framework but then why why
exactly we use it or not I'm not sure
please tell how to learn to work for big
companies like so work on data structure
skills work on design patterns work on
Java work on aptitude skills and most
important work on your communication
that's how you learn
okay sounds good is it good to join an
Institute for Java as they will help us
to work on live projects I learned Co
Java from your channel but getting less
opportunities yes here you can join any
class Institute and if they promise you
to work on Java project if they promise
to work on life project then great you
can do that otherwise you can practice
by yourself
okay enjoy what is a para fication oh I
did MSC in my nightie I've done my
Master's 19 which software is better
Java is good taking too much time
oh you are taking so much time for one
question what do you want you you want
me to answer ha ha I'm not doing a
viable College why why here okay so why
not videos on jigsaw and Java and coming
jigsaw videos around eBay so jigsaw
videos are on the way okay anything else
so next last two minutes I know I was
not able to answer all the questions but
then you have to understand guys it's
very difficult to answer all the
questions okay questions questions
questions
okay let me just go very down and let's
see what else I can get there no dodgy
is okay that's it I'm tired it's been a
long time it's been how many how much
how much time we were like we were live
for 14 minutes that's great so that's it
guys I hope you enjoyed this session
again I will try to go live so when you
if you have a question just let me know
in the comment section if I make a next
video I will surely implement that there
I'll try to answer your questions there
and okay that's it then guys I hope you
enjoyed this session bye-bye everyone
we'll meet soon for sure okay and it's
one question Hindi okay so uh yeah okay
just I just want to answer this one last
one why I am not making videos on in
Hindi the problem is so the audience
which I have is not specific to India
and specially in India also not everyone
speaks Hindi okay we have to come we
have to be with the language which
everyone understands okay we all are
humans we all are IT professionals we
order aliens so I want to make sure that
every everyone can watch it and then we
have choose our English language right
so everyone is learning English then why
not learn why not learn English when you
are learning programming and programming
itself is in English I mean why don't
you create your why don't you create a
programming languages Hindi so if you
can have a programming language in Hindi
I can make a video on in these alright
so I mean I'm trying to make in these
videos but then learn English right up
all right if you are anyone to be a good
programmer learn English because you
cannot write the program in Indi so
okay then that's it bye-bye I just
wanted to answer that with that question
bye-bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
