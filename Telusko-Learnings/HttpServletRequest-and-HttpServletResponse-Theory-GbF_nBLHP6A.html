have talked about what is South
lighthouse of it works right so we have
also seen the lifestyle of sublet so the
first method is a sublet life cycle is
in it then we talk about service and
then we talk about destroy now if you
observed in the practical implementation
when we have implemented that service
method right
we are provided two objects one is
request object and response object so
those tomatoes two objects are here so
in this video we talk about those two
objects one is HTTP request object and
HTTP response object now why we need do
this two objects so let's say we have a
client machine here and then we have a
sublet now when I say solve that it
means Saba when I say Saba it means of
that because we are running a server
technology so we have a solid here and
then you have a client so let's say this
client want to add two numbers so if you
want to add two numbers that means you
have to first send a request and you
have to also pass those two values I
mean let's say let's add two and three
so if you want to add these two values
you have to pass those two values right
of course now how do you pass those two
values maybe not just this values I want
to also talk about what is the client ID
twist I want to also send about what I
mean which browser client use so if you
want to send all this information you
have to pass it in some format right and
since we are working in Java technology
we will work with objects so what we can
do is we can put this values in an
object right so we can put those values
in an object now this object which is
going from the client page to the server
will be called as your request object so
request object is an object which will
hold your values now once this server
got the request you have to set a
response right so what we have to do is
when you are sending a response okay
when you send a response what you what
you send so basically some time we want
to send a data we want to send HTML tags
we want to send a video we want to send
an image so you can send all those
information in one particular object and
that's your response object so while
sending the data when
sending a response object now this
response object will have all the data
which a clients need right so the quest
object will have all the data which are
solid needs and the sponsor object will
have all the debits our client needs
right again it's depend upon subject
what it what what it wants to send right
so let's say in this scenario a solid
want to send a value five right so this
is response object will have a value
five now it can be of type this data can
be of type text this data can be of type
HTML this data can be of type let's say
video so you can have all this format in
your response object again you can
specifically I mean you can you can
specify what format you want to go for
right I can how to do that that was in
the petiole implementation but that's
that's possible you can specify what
about data you are sending you know in
terms of when you talk about the web
services world where you return JSON
value you don't return a page or a text
value what you return a JSON value in
that scenario you can specify what data
you want to send from the server machine
to the client machine with the help of
response object okay so we have request
object here and then record a response
object now where do we use it
so if you remember in service method we
use two objects one is a request object
and the next one is response object
again when you say request objects a
part of HTTP service requests and
response object is the object of HTTP
server response but then question arise
can I do we do any to create object of
it and the answer is no we don't have to
create object of httpservletrequest your
Tom Kyte says hey you want an object I
will give you the object so Tomcat will
give you those two object request object
and response object you have to specify
what you want and Tomcat says I will
give you that okay so in the service
method you have to specify the
references so that Tomcat will give you
those objects to you make sense so yeah
so this two are actually interfaces okay
httpservletrequest is an interface HTTP
server response is also an interface not
a class but the implementation is done
by the Tomcat and object will be given
by the Tomcat and that's why when you
want to run a web application you need a
tomcat server right so yeah so that's
how
your request and response object works
this is the theory part of it we'll say
the implementation of it as well in the
next video we'll talk about how do you
call a sorry Thomas sublet is it
possible let's see how how to do that
thanks so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
