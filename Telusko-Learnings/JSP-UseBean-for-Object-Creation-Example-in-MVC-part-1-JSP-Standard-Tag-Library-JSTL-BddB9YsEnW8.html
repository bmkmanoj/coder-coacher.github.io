video we'll talk about the importance of
use bin in GSP so before starting with
use bin let me create a file here so let
me create a beam because when you talk
about use bin it's more towards bin
concept so let me create a beam for a
student and we'll give a package name
strong third nubbin and we click on
finish so in order to create a bin what
I need here earth let me remove the
comments here so I have a package name
and a class and here I will write let's
say a method I need to I need two
variables we'll say the first variable
is private int roll number will go for
simply solution or simplest podía and
we need one more which is string s name
so I have two variables here one is roll
number and second is s name now to
access this variables what we need is
getters and setters so in that means
what you can simply do is you can right
click and say insert code what code I
need I need getters and setters for both
the variables and just click on generate
so if you can see we got all the getters
and setters here now once you got
getters and setters this is your being
done right now what I want I will ask
user to enter this details or number and
s name so we'll create a JC page again
and we'll name this JSP as let's say
index dot JSP because this this should
be the home page of my project and this
let me remove this comment as H will and
I don't require this head section okay
so what I need here is a form tag in
which user will enter some detail so a
form tag once you click on this form tag
it should call let's say a lower dot JSP
because this just we will responsible to
load the data and we'll use two text
field
we'll say
the third your door number : and here
we'll say type equal to text and the
name of this will be let's say T one
okay so we have we need to text philia
one for don't numbers again for name
it's what I can simply do is I can just
copy this code the same thing and then
we'll say entered your name type will be
'text and the name here will be two and
we save it we need one more submit
button here so submitting a type equal
to submit and the name doesn't matter
we'll go for the same thing now once you
click on the submit button it will call
this load door jst now so the next task
we have is to create that load dot JSP
so I will right click here and let's
click on JSP and this time we'll name it
as Lord dot JSP now here I don't require
this head and I don't require this
comment so what we'll do here is now so
in this what I need is a scriptlet so
we'll use this triplet here okay I am
this triplet what I need I need to
create the object of the student so that
I will fetch this data this data and
we'll set to student so again we have
multiple ways first we can face the
value so we'll do what we'll do that
we'll first first eval you
so we'll say integer roll number and
this roll number you will get from the
request parameter but before that we
need to pass int because anything you
get from get parameter will be string
format so we'll say request or get
parameter and in this we have to mention
the name of the field which is t1 the
second field what we have is the string
so we'll say this is string s name and
we'll say this is request dot
getparameter and in this you can pass t2
so now you have this two fields one is
t1 which is your roll number and t2
which is your s name
now once you got this detail I want to
set this detail to the student object so
we have to say student st equal to new
student this is how we to create object
right so this is specially I've been
here which is st also a POJO so we'll
say st dot will set the roll number the
problem with this we need to import the
package so we can directly say comm door
now in dart and i mean dot student or
what we can do is we can just import the
package so in order to import the
package in GSP what we need is the
import tag so we'll use so we'll use
here with a page and we'll mention
import equal to it is calm start Navin
okay and we say dart student so we need
to import this and wait to finish this
this tag will say finish okay now once
you've got the object will say a street
art set roll number and we'll set it on
number which we caught from the user
with a street art site name and we'll
set the name here simple so this is how
we to set the roll number and name and
if you if you want to check that it is
getting assigned what we can do is I
will create one more JSP so that we can
sent it data right oh yeah we'll do that
also will do one thing with the object
of liquid dispatcher all we can the
object of request dispatcher just to
demonstrate that the they have anyway
assigning is printing or what we'll do
let's make it more simple will simply
print these values here itself
we'll do that trick with dispatcher in
the next part so in say st dot will say
get roll number will print the value and
will say out dot print a state our to
get s name if you can see i have not not
used use bin yet so i'm going for the
traditional way of using
operating the bean object in GSP okay so
let me just run this to check if it is
working or not so that we can move ahead
and do some
so if I done this now let's run this
code of course it will take some time
because it's my first one okay taking
it's compiling compile it on hope so
there will not be any error seem so so
it will open my browser which is default
is I here and it's asking for two things
all numbered and Annie will say the
number is five and the name is nothin
it's nothin if I submit the query here
so the answer is five and I mean
unfortunately I have not specified the
space there so what we can do is let's
put in the space use BR tag here so
again for that we need again I'm not
using the proper power of JSP here which
should be written outside but for the
timing it will do and I fir on this code
let me change my browser also let me set
it as Firefox and if I run this now
let's run this it's opening in the
Firefox watch the other exception of
course in dot JSP number format no J's I
should have done this one okay so it's
asking for values let's say five and
again no mean and if I submit it says
five and I mean right
so this is what this is a way to use
bean in JSP but this is not the proper
way of using it it's because JSP gives
you extra power of use bin so instead of
creating object in the java format you
can use something called a jst L which
is Java JSP standard tag libraries in
which if you are using those libraries
it will be very easy for your designers
to look at your code right so
so it the placement for this here we
should be using use bin now how exactly
we can replace this code with use being
that we'll see in the next part of the
tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
