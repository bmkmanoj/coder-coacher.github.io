directly from today's kaletnik's and
this is our first QA session so I'm
getting this request from a long time
about Q s session so that you can ask me
questions and I will answer it so
basically we it's it's been two years
for this channel I know from in this two
years I got 1.8 million views and
approximately 14,000 subscribers and if
you are one of this Tibor thank you so
much for the subscription so from last
two years I'm getting lots of questions
about depend upon technicals there are
some technical questions there are some
career choices and all those tech all
those stuff fly so I'm getting these
questions on a YouTube comments YouTube
messages Facebook messages and whatsapp
messages so what but I have to not
collected all those questions and we'll
be dealing with this questions in the in
this QA series so this is the first
video at while video for the QA so if
you if you like this video just make
sure you like on the like button so that
I will get motivated for this type of
sessions more if you have some you know
if you have some what you say some
suggestions you can Porsche in the
comment section so that I will further
solution we will make I will try to make
this much better so so what I have done
I have taken some some set of questions
from last two months from the YouTube
comments I have not touched the YouTube
messages and Facebook messages yet so
we'll start with a YouTube comments and
then we'll move towards Facebook Thanks
all those things so this is just last
two months questions which so basically
questions maybe have two times one it
one it can be very technical questions
the example how to solve file not found
exception and how to how to set up the
environment that that those are by
taking questions in this series we'll
talk about they generalize concepts like
the credit career choices how to learn
something and all the stuff so the first
question what we have today is from
Rajesh and the question is to get a job
in Java should I have a record
certification all I need to do
certification so thing is you know there
was a time you know long back maybe five
to six years back if you say you want to
be a Java programmer so having
certificate in your hand gives you an
edge it is because at that time they
were no there were no way to prove that
the person knows something or not
example let's say you're you don't know
Java much and then you are preparing for
the interview tool is back you have gone
through lots of websites you have
learned lots of basic concepts you're
going for the interview and then Antonio
asked you some questions and then
luckily unfortunately you are able to
answer all our interview
you know Java but technically you don't
know job right because you have worked
only two days so how to prove that the
person knows so if you have if you have
if you are a writer certified then you
know it makes sense but in current
generation if we talk about the current
programmers or if you want to be a job
or grandma instead of doing
certification you can do that that's one
of the still you know you will get an
edge if you are certified but I will
suggest with certification if you don't
if you're not going for certification
what you should does start working on
projects are not the maybe actual
project but you know you can work on
demo projects so in every every person
they have different ideas right so we
have thousands of ideas in our mind so
let's say you want to make you want to
make your own railway app you want to
make your own mobile app so you can what
you can do is take the concept which
individually having you obtain write on
the paper and start implementing it and
trust me those projects will matter
modern certification but how do you punk
your interviewer knows that you have
done that project so upload your
projects on github so if you upload your
project on github you can share the link
with the interview and then they will
check the orthotics and you will get
hired okay so so summary of that if you
want to be said if you wanted to
certification go for it okay but the
only thing is you have to pay around ten
thousand rupees per exam so if you if it
is not that comfortable with you make
projects and upload it on github okay
and yeah so having a lot or lack
certifications with you will matter or
not the initiative certificate no one no
one recognized the initiative
certificate okay next question is from
Gotham
he says I'm very confused and I want to
do complex programs like building his
own software building his office like
Photoshop but the thing is when you go
to internet if you search for some
resources he says you will only get
programs like palindrome they were
straying all the stuff right and no one
uses this concept in the project so what
happens is when you want to build a
project let it say you want to learn
something so every technology doesn't
matter is it cooking cooking in your
kitchen or making software's or maybe
playing football and anything so if we
have he goes into three levels the first
one is beginners level the second one is
intermediate and the third one is
advanced right when you start with
something it always goes with bigness
right you are big enough for the
technology then after that you you get
your hands on the technology ties
intermediate level and then further you
will become expert in the edge right
when you say you're expert that means
the other advanced programmer now so
whenever you learn something new we have
to start with beginning right you have
to start with very basics the paniyaram
all those because this all concept will
teach what is programming but your
question is you want to become you want
to do some complex programming like
building a Photoshop right if you have
to build your own Photoshop don't search
resources on internet you know the
basics right start the start with the
concept create you know take a chart
write down what you want to build right
so you want to be your own Photoshop or
you want to build your own Facebook
write it down what you want break the
big task into small small tasks okay and
try to code those small tasks those
small things and you know fortunately
when you are when you are putting that
those small stuff you will be using
palindrome you will be using all those
learn all the stuff you have learned in
core Java alright so what I will suggest
start the implementation from today
itself and build your own codes don't
search for the associates on internet
yeah but let's say while building those
things and if you if you got stuck
somewhere what you can simply do is go
to Google and search for that specific
type of error
okay and then it will solve your problem
next uh so okay so the of the problem is
before this also have R equal to the
same video for 20 minutes and then
suddenly I saw the thing so it was the
recording was not done so let me just
verify is it working the recording is
working there okay great so so now the
next question is from such in such as
says videos are awesome thank you but
the question will be so the question is
when I when when he sees or when he
watches my video he understand
everything but the problem is when you
try to code you get stuck it happens you
know when initially when you learn new
language like C C++ or Java when you
watch those videos when you watch my
videos of course you will understand why
but the problem is when you try to do it
by yourself you will get stuck it
happens with every programmer it was
happening it happened with me also so
there's a very simple solution for this
and the solution is practice okay let me
tell you my story when I was in my
college in my BSC IIT so at that time I
used to participate in lots of
competitions I should participate in
intercourse competitions online
competitions so at that time there was a
website was Gilda calm gee ILD calm so
that video that so that competition so
that so I know about participating in
those competitions I you should get lots
of questions and I used to answer those
questions and that's how I learned so in
intercourse completion when I when I go
to different colleges for the
competition luckily I got lots of prizes
approximately I have 45 prizes or in my
college level so I used to participate
in lots of competitions and not every
competition is to win but when I used to
win a lot so I have to I used to work
very hard learning all the technologies
not just learning but practicing because
in the competition you will be having
nothing you will be having just a
question you have to solve it right so
you have to practice a lot choice - I
should stay awake till 2:00 a.m. for
that kissing so practicing is very
important so when you learn something
because when you will learn something it
will go to your
in your gran okay so your days are ran
now so we designed the Maxis memory
which is temporary temporary memory so
as soon as you learn something new you
have to make sure that you store the
data from your landing to your hard
drive how to save data from your dime
into hard drive by practicing it and not
just practice practicing once or twice
you have to practice every day okay so
there is something which will vanish
from your brain if you don't practice so
yeah so how to remember things practice
I can practice it a lot too I different
examples make your own take your own
idea and try to implement it okay next
is from safe what are the different
reference book you will suggest a
reference book for Java so you can refer
to one of my favorite book which is
headfirst Java if you don't learn Java
in funny way I know normally I follow
this concept of teaching in you know
make making teaching fun or making
learning fun is very important right so
you can refer that book on his head
first Java you will know lots of
concepts in the expose Java you'll
understand what is object for these
classes and all those stuff but the
problem is head first job or the latest
version of it first Java has Java 1.5
version so in that you will not you will
not learn 1.7 1.8 concepts of Java so
for that if you have to learn about new
features of Java just go for Java
complete reference
I guess ninth edition will do so those
are the books I would recommend
otherwise you can go to Java Docs online
you can go to a title website and you
can refer the Java talks okay
the advantage is they update it you know
every time they have a new version so
that's the advantage you have on the
Oracle documentation because when you
buy a book you know it will not upgrade
itself so when you when you learn from
websites so they will take an update
right we have a soft copy those are the
reference book for Android also for Java
and for Android you can refer the
professional Android development book
one of the amazing book you have
otherwise the best resources to learn
Android as the official Android
developer website so just go to editable
search for Android development
with Android so you will get the link
there so that's one of the best
resources full on Android again
otherwise you have my channel that goes
okay next next question is from Raj and
large says okay I'm new to programming
learning see how much it is important to
develop logic about patterns using loops
okay is it important for big projects of
course not right when you build a big
project you will not do patterns I hope
you know this pattern side you have to
so when you build patterns what happens
is you have to build a star pattern
right so you'll be having star
triangular start angular the equilateral
stock patterns so those are not
important the project no one will come
to you or no company will say we'll ask
you to make a project for patterns but
thing is when you will learn new
programming there are three steps here
the first step is you have to understand
the syntax of the programming second you
have to understand how to solve a given
problem using that language and then the
third one is using advanced frameworks
when you learn this syntax when you
refer any book so they will teach of
syntax what is what is into what is
float what is for what is while loop but
you need to also understand how to
implement those things so pattern is one
of the thing which will teach you how to
use for loop how to solve a given
problem using programming so that that's
what patterns helps you because we need
maturity right so our brain is like we
when you when you learn something new
you will find it difficult because you
know you are not matured in that
technology so to make sure to get that
maturity patterns will help ok next
question is from not Simhadri so yeah so
what is the difference between Java SE
and Java EE developers there's a huge
difference between this two it's because
when you start your career as Java
developer of course you will be starting
with Java SC right because Java SD
stands for Java standard edition so the
core Java is called as Java C and then
we have Java EE which is Enterprise
Edition so very long advanced topic like
szabla
JSB EJB spraying so those those things
comes under Java EE so all Java EE
developers they aren't by default AC
developers right because they know
kochava that's why they are working on
advanced Java so let's say you want to
like EJB applications of course you
require kochava knowledge so every Java
EE developers and Java is adorable but
not every Java is available Tao easy
developer it's because after learning
school Java you can learn n2 again so
you are an Android developer and you
know Java SE right
coach always like a piece so Java SE is
a piece on that you have Java EE then
Java web components then we have Java
Mobile Edition which is M II so Java SE
is core Java Java EE is advanced part so
when you start with your career with
Java you are a Java SE developer once
you learn the advanced frameworks like
spring hibernate EJB you become a Java
EE developer next question is from deep
I know the basics of basic concept of C
can I learn Java directly and the same
questions from a ROG
and he says he knows C but not C++ can I
learned I say Java so we have two
similar questions and the answer is yes
you can learn Java directly from C so
once you know C you can learn Java but
you can also learn Java without C so
let's say you don't know C you can write
it in Java anyway so just you just have
to take out a book loan the thing is you
will find it damn difficult to
understand what's happening it's because
Java is a technology which needs some
sort of maturity in the programming
world example can you learn C
programming the first code you see is
hello world white and then you know you
you hate that much to write hello well
you have to write five lines what about
it the second code so whenever you learn
new language like C or the second
quadruple it will be addition of two
numbers so you have to write ten lines
of code to add two numbers what the hell
right so you need some sort of majority
when you go for Java you cannot say why
we are writing all those stuff so you
need to understand what is programming
and for that you should learn C or
Python depend upon your taste right so
you can you have to understand all this
programming using
by the no see now once you have learned
C programming you know what is
programming but you don't know what is
oops
because one of the amazing concept to
build software is oops conserve its
object-oriented programming so to
understand how oops works you can you
can use oops and you can use C
programming and that is C++ alright and
now once you learn C++ you know the
basic concepts of oops
now you can learn Java IDE is very
easier now to understand Java because
you have the knowledge of C++ that
doesn't means you should know C++ you
can learn Java directly but steps are C
C++ and Java okay
and the next question is from a rainbow
why not use Eclipse on NetBeans I guess
this question is on the code where I
have used notepad whenever you learn new
language you should always start with
the notepad because it will teach you
how to remember the syntax then once you
know the syntax then start to some ideas
you can start with NetBeans you can use
eclipse you can use IntelliJ what are
the best IDE now is IntelliJ right but
still if you follow my tutorials the
first one or two videos I have talked
about notepad after that I have used
that beans and then later videos I have
eclipse so I tried to make you
understand all this three different
different area where you can type and
the Java code maybe in future I will be
using IntelliJ for the videos okay so
you can use any ID depend upon your
requirement depend up on your company's
requirement and depend up on your
interest so I will suggest use eclipse
one of the best ide because it is free
right and the last question for the day
from peers
it says audio Maharashtrians so okay
first of all I live in Mumbai but I am a
South Indian so my accent is Mumbai
accent but I'm a South Indian I don't I
don't look like something and right but
I'm a South Indian now that's it from
this session so this is just a trial EQs
session if you have liked this video
make sure you comment let me know what
is what is going right and what is going
wrong for this videos and so that I can
improve
self there's always opportunity to
improve light and there's one more thing
that's my website name that's Elizabeth
comm just go to my website and so when
you go to the website there's a link of
feedback okay so there's a site thing
called as feedback just make sure you
give the feedback for my videos so
that's it thank you social watching and
