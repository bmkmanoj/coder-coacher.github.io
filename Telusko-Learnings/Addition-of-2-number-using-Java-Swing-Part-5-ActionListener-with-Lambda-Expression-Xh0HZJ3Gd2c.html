who love Java 8 now in Java 8 you have a
concept of lambda expression so you can
implement lambda expression in this
video or in this code so let's see how
to implement lambda here now what is if
you don't notice lambda expression so
lambda expression only works on
functional interface so what exactly
functional interface is a center phase
with only one method declaration so
whenever you have only one method in
your interface that interface is called
as functional interface and this naming
convention comes on game only in Java 8
so if you are Java 6 and Java 7
developer so you might not be knowing
this in fact if you are academic student
like if you are doing MCA all be a CIT
what you you people were you people
learn is Java 2 or Java 5 so in Java 8
you have this concept of lambda
expression which is again a remarkable
change in Java so let's see how to
implement lambda here now where to use
lambda whenever you work with functional
interface you should work with lambda
now if you can focus on this method
called as action listener just let me
type it okay once again here it's add
action listener you can see if I say
control space it says this method
election is not except only one object
which is of object of action listener
right so what we can do is when we know
the only object it will accept is action
is nothing why we need to write this
obviously it will need an object of
action listener this action listener has
only one method which is action
performed then by to write that method
the main logic here is this object which
is AE and this code right so we can
remove this this august lines this
lines are called as boiler plate code
which is not needed but still we use it
so what we can do is we can remove this
code and we can write only this part so
once again let me remove all this data
so that we can write it again say what
we have here we have B dot allison
listener in this bracket the only thing
i had to mention is i had to say there
will be an object of new there is there
will be an object of action listener and
this there will be a method called as
action perform the only thing i'm
concerned is about the name of that
object of the parameter which is AE in
this AE method there should be some
lines and that's why we use this arrow
symbol and this this arrow symbol also
means lambda expression and then we can
use black it open and bracket closed to
define the method so we'll take a back
it here and just paste your code which
is this code so copy and paste
so let me reformat it okay
so now you have now we can see we have
only mentioning the parameter name and
the actual logic we have removed that
boilerplate code which you have returned
in the earlier tutorial which was new
action listener let me try that again so
that you can see the difference let me
type that in comment so it was B dot add
action listener in this new action
listener in bracket and bracket what you
specify is public let me close the
bracket here it is public void action
performed it is action event a E and
then bucket
and then this logic so this discord copy
and paste now say both discord means
same they do the same thing but if you
can see the number of lines has been
reduced so I should have writing all
this code till here we can directly
mention AE and lambda expression so
lambda expression only works in Java 8
so make sure you're working with Java 8
to work with this now to work with Java
8 you have to install JDK 8 which I'm
using here and you need to work with
NetBeans 8 so if you are using any
earlier version of NetBeans maybe
NetBeans 7 or Java 7 this code will not
work so it mean on this code it may move
this now and run this code now so let's
say write like run and bingo still it's
walking
let's check the output so it's a 5 and
again 2 and the answer is 7 so you we
can use 3 logic or first you can
implement an interface you can directly
get object of interface and then we can
use lambda expression so that's it from
this video and doses come for the
further videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
