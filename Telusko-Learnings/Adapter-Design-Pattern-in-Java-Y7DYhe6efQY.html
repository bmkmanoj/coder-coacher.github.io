and in this video we'll talk about
adapter design pattern so there is
multiple design patterns available and
in Java so which one to use it's all
depend upon your requirements so what we
will do here is we'll try to understand
the and the use of adapter design
pattern for that what will what we'll do
is we create a class and we'll within
this class as cool and it belongs to a
packet which is comm dot a tap and it
will have a main method so in every
school we get some assignments right so
we got an assignment so let's say let me
create an assignment class so let me get
a class will name this class as
assignment work ok and in this class
assignment work I will be having a
method which is public void right
assignment okay so we got a class which
with a method which is right assignment
which takes a string parameter which is
string STR and what the problem is to
write an assignment we require append
right so to a site assignment we require
a pen so let's create an interface which
is pen interface here and in this
interface pen I have a method which is
void right okay so we got a void right
which takes a string parameter and
that's it so we got a interface which is
pen which writes something so to write
an assignment we require a pen
so we'll say public or not public will
say private pen
no H pen P we got private pen P now
since it's a variable we require a
getter setters for this well right-click
we'll say so give me a good asset or for
P okay we got the Gator set to power P I
hate this extra space is given by
Eclipse I don't know why I clips provide
this spaces okay if you know this just
comment the comment in the comment
section if you know how to solve this
problem in Eclipse okay so now so from
this what we need to pay it is going to
be an object of assignment of assignment
work and we'll name this as a w equal to
new assignment work
okay that's that that's there and then
we can call aw dot what site assignment
and we can pass I am bit tired to write
and assignment okay
so we took lenders so if I run this code
we got an error here which is a what
nothing because because because we are
not writing anything we have tried say P
dot P dot right right we need to pass
this string here and if I go to school
because pen will write as I as a normal
user we don't write write pen writes the
data so if I go to this output you can
see there is another point of exception
the problem is we are calling write
assignments which needs an object which
is P because using P which is we are
saying P dot right but we have not
assigned the memory to P right so we
need to assign the memory so to assign
the memory we have to call set P so we
can say aw dot set P and we took lead
object of pen but hold on I don't have
the pen interface and I don't have the
implementation for pen maybe to create
the implementation for pen I have to
create a method which is right I want
you I have to set the properties the
size of your pan the width of your lip
and all those things right me to set
lots of things and I am very tired to
create this object so I call him I call
that I call not because anyway when you
when you put to college or school you
know you never carry your pen right you
never carry your own pen you ask your
friends to give that pen so I called my
friend and said I want the object of pen
interface and he says oh I don't have
the object of I don't have the class
which implements for interface and why
should I create a pen interface for you
but I have a class okay I have a class
which is pilot pen which has nothing to
do with the pen interface so if you open
pilot pen it has nothing to do with the
pen interface you can see that my
friends name is Krishna he has nothing
to do with pen interface okay so it's
okay you could you can just give me
the object of you can just give me the
class for pilot pen and he is very smart
he's not giving me the source code okay
I thought he will give me the source but
I will change it I will change the
source code but unfortunately is not
giving me the source code what he gave
what he gave me is the class dot class
file which is pilot pen dot class that's
we all right maybe he's a friend or
enemy I don't know he's giving me this
thing which is pilot pen pilot pen dot
class which I cannot change so even if I
create object of pilot pen PP equal to
new pilot pen which is pilot pen and if
I pass object PP here okay first need to
import the package ok pass page is
imported now you can see it gives an
error because we are passing object off
pilot pen and here you're accepting pen
how will that work now okay so we cannot
we cannot do that right we cannot pass
object off pilot pen so this the problem
is same as let's say you have an iPhone
and you want your battery is bit low you
want to charge your iPhone and you don't
have an iPhone charger so you have went
to your friend house and then said I
want the charger so he has he you see
he's using a samsung phone so he got a
Samsung charger now you cannot connect a
Samsung charger to iPhone right so we
require an adapter so that adopter what
an adapter will do is you can connect
this Samsung charger to the adapter and
that adapter will be connected with your
iPhone so we require some something in
between we cannot pass object off pilot
pen here so that's not possible but what
we can do is we can create a class we
can create a class here which will which
will be called as the pen adapter which
can take any type of pen may be a pilot
pen or ink pen may be a gel pen so in
this will be having also this adapter
will implement a pen interface so this
will implement pen interface since we
are implementing pen interface we need
to implement all the methods okay hold
on that we need to implement all the
methods so we have to say implement okay
implement all the methods and well now
we can say okay hold on but I I don't
want to define all the methods all these
statements here so my friend has given
me the pilot pen of pilot print class
way so I've got to will do I will say a
pilot pen PP equals your new pilot pen I
will use his implementation using
composition and I can say PP dot
mark since the the method in this is
Mark Wright at least I have that access
to call mark
sounds good right so we got PP dot mark
and then from this instead of passing
the object of pilot pen let me get an
object of a pen adapter which implements
pen so we'll say we can even say pen P
equal to new pen adapter and then we can
pass the object of P here or object P
here okay and now if I'll on this code
we got I am bit tired to write this
write an assignment so that's the
awesomeness about adapter so my friend
is giving me just a class file and I am
trying to connect the his class file or
his implementation which I required so I
have a pen interface and I want the
implementation I am using his
implementation with the help of adapter
in between yes so that's your adapter
design pattern it's initially it will be
bit difficult to understand I think
you'll be watching this video two or
three times to understand what exactly
is going on but just to make sure was
this video and practice your own
examples to master and in design pattern
okay so that's it from this video make
sure you subscribe the channel for
