use jagd arrays with 3d so before
starting with that let's try to
understand some concept in address so
let's say you want you know the values
for this one-dimensional added so what
we can simply do is we just have to not
up to you mention the number here you
can use a curly brackets after writing
new int and they can specify the size
which is 5 6 7 &amp;amp; 8
so that's your adding you can do the
same thing for the two dimensional array
in fact up for this it's not composite
right new interview fill him of this
that's perfectly fine but for the
example we are going for this type of
syntax so we have to say near-end and
then we can specify 5 6 7 8 we can do
the same thing for two-dimensional array
so if you don't know this size so let's
say I know the number of columns for
sure or number of rows for sure is true
but not sure up the column or maybe both
so we can simply define our array here
and then we can specify the first
element of the first array and the
second array the first a 10 X 8 is 2 3 4
5 and the second array will keep it as 5
6 7 8 okay so this is two-dimensional
adding perfect we can do this same thing
for 3d but before that let's try to
initialize a value which is let's say 2
so for sure now you know the number of
columns but you don't remember number of
photos it's not do the same okay let's
keep it there now let's initialize the 3
dimensional array so even if you change
the number of the number of the first
row which is 2 2 3 4 and the next a day
is 5 6 7 8 so this is jagd added rise
with a number of columns are not fixed
so number of values in each other is not
fixed we can do the same thing with
three dimensional array so let's say we
have eight C which is three dimensional
will say neo end and when we can give
those three packets and then a'carly
back
so this will define your Eddie so this
array will have two dimensional areas so
example if I write new int here with a
bracket and you end here with a black
kid so this is two different Eddie's
right so this is a D and a D and this B
becomes a D of a DS simple in the same
way we can define two-dimensional array
0 so we'll say this is 2 dimension this
is first two-dimensional and inside this
we have 2 more values so we can give we
can I get just copy this laser to type
okay that's my first array and then I
can give a comma for the new value or
two-dimensional array one more
two-dimensional array and then we can
you can just copy the same number of
values but just here two more values
yeah it's a comma okay so now you can
see we have this 3d array which consists
of two two-dimensional array okay and
the first two dimensional array has two
one dimensional array and the second two
dimensional value and it has four one
dimensional array so this is itself this
is a jacked array and this is eject
array and this 3d is a which at which
also I jacked a delight with different
number of elements so that's how you can
implement or jagd
arrays inside 3d and again how to print
that so in the last video we have seen
how to print with emotionality you can
use the same loop here and it will work
cool so that's it from CD with Jack so
