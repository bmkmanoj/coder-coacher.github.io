format like I want to put into output as
the addition of four and seven is 11
right this is the output I want you so
what we can do is we can simply say the
addition of four and seven is now this
person D will be replaced by this num1
plus num2 simple right now before that
what we can do we can take one more
variable where you can store the order I
think we should remove this Fang now no
so what we can do we can create one more
variable and we'll name this variable as
result and this instead of doing this
operation here num1 plus num2 we can
achieve the same operation here so we
can say result equal 2 num1 plus num2
okay and we can replace this number 1
plus num2 here and we can say this as
result okay so now this person D will be
replaced by this result simple and now
if I try to run this code the output is
the addition of 4 and 7 is 11 but hold
on do you think every time will be given
the same input there might be chances
that my input is 5 and 8 now in this
scenario the output should be the
addition of 5 and 8 is 13 let's run this
and obviously it will be getting output
as the addition of 4 &amp;amp; 7 in study which
is wrong it is because we are doing some
hard coding here which means I'm
mentioning it 7 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; 7 the thing I
should mention here is 5 &amp;amp; 8 but
everything every time we have to come
here and change the numbers so what we
can do is we'll ask our turbo C++
interpreter that when you run this file
fetch the value which will come here
from num1
first the value which will come here
from num2 that means I have to say a
person D here and a person D here now
this person day is num1 this person D is
num2 and this person days result so what
we can do we can simply say it is num1
comma numb 2 comma result that means
this person d will be replaced by noun 1
this person D will be missed by num2 and
this person D will be replaced by result
simple that's on this file and yeah the
addition of 5 &amp;amp; 8 is 14 simple you can
print any format right now what we'll do
is let's check for subtraction so how to
check for subtraction it's very simple
we can simply remove this plus and say -
so instead of writing addition we'll say
it is
subscribe subtraction okay and if I done
this subtraction of theirs from their
output let's see it's minus 3 right so
that's right how to achieve
multiplication so we can simply say it
is a multiply sign and we can remove
this subtraction and we'll say
multiplication of this and this is this
1 and 5 into 8 is 40 that means we can
achieve all the operations but question
arise when you to divide something now
we don't have a symbol for directly
divided right like we have dot line dot
so we have to use something else / the /
means numb divided by num2 or no one do
you I went number two okay and followed
for the magician let me change this
number to 15 and 5 so divide division of
15 by 5 you should get as 3 and the
answer is 3 simple
so this is how you have to do my
admitting operations and we'll see the
varying part in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
