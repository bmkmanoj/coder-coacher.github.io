object learning in this part we'll talk
about the third type of object copy
which is clone now when you talk about
cloning object cloning is very simple
now now let's see how to clone this
object so initially what we'll do is
we'll remove all this extra part this
one and let's move the comment also to
make make it look better
okay so now we have we have to invoke
all the extra code so what I want now I
want to create a new object and simply I
should able to say here it's obj dot a
load so in Java we have this function
called as clone right but unfortunately
we don't have blown method which is
defined
can you see a clone method you know we
don't have a cloner that we just have a
tostring method which one which will
then this string now quash iodized okay
that means we have to define a clone
method here but hold on by default all
the classes in Java extends a class call
as object if you see if you go here on
ABC it extends object by default so if I
click on this object if I go to this
class object I just say I want to go to
that class object so if I say object in
this object class we should able to find
a method which is clone is known as one
so you can see we have a method called
as clone but unfortunately this method
clone is protected which means I cannot
call a clone method of object class
using using object of ABCs because it is
protected so you cannot call this what
if if I just go into my class and
override that method yes we can do that
right I don't know it this you we can we
can do that right
but unless let's try let's try so if I
say a public it is returned an object
this object type should be ABC and the
method name is it's clone okay and here
we can just say return it is super dot
clone because we want to call a super
method right so you know so it should
return it will return object now it's
cool okay now it's good now it says
there the this clone method might return
and error now again why we are calling
this a super dot loan here is because we
want to call this of this clone method
of this of this object class and that's
why we have to specify its super dot
clone right now there is there is some
chance that this clone will throw an
error now how to handle this error is
very simple we can just say it those
exception oh it's not supporting its
because when you go here it says it's
those clone not supporting exception
which means here we cannot increase the
scope of exception we can decrease the
scope which means I have to specify it
is clone not support an exception simple
so I have or what it what I did that
method which is present in object class
even we can just specify it as override
so it's work right so it that means we
are overriding of glow and material I
think it should work now if you go here
or it's still not working or it says a
clone is returning an object we want ABC
so we have to say it is ABC Oh again our
problem it says since clone is throwing
in error we have to handle this error
here so
in the same era which is known by
cologne method and bingo it's working
now everything is there no errors it
should work now object are this we have
over I did the method clone we have we
have called that method clone how to
call superclass method using a super
keyword everything looked better
i-95 print obj1 it should gave me value
which is 5 and 6 right I think it should
work I think it should work let's see
let's run this code and get ready to see
some output or some atom oh we are
getting a error which is clone not
supported exception now what this means
now if you can focus here yeah this
object class the object class
so we have this object class and we have
lots of methods right and one of the
method we have we are using here is
lonely but think about this if by
default if your Java or your JVM alarms
as we every one to clone the object or
just imagine you're hearing a software
which is a security software and some
hacker he just managed to create a clone
of your instance that instance will have
a state let imagine that state has
information about username password and
if you create a clone of it your hat the
software is hacked that means Chow JVM
says no way
I will not allow you to create a clone
of an object provided you specify that
you want to create a clone that means
whenever you create a whenever you
create a class in Java by default it's
instance will not allow it or the the
instance are not allowed to be cloned
now question arises how to allow how to
give permission now one of the way to
give permission is by implementing our
interface clock called as chlorophyll so
if you implement your class with this
variable interface that means you are
allowed to learn object now and
amazingly this cloneable interface it
has nothing which means this is a marker
interface and mark interface are
basically used for permissions if you
don't know what is marker interface you
can go back to my previous video where
you have a concept of marker interface
it will again we have two marker
interface we have will be using when
we--when is realizable and the second is
renewable we are using now and now for
on this and the output instance so this
is first table the second object now is
it a shallow copy or deep copy let's
check it looks like shallow copy because
we are directly adding a object name you
but if you change the value of obj one
if I say obj one dot j is equal to eight
the expected output here is five eight
if it is shallow copy both will give you
Phi eight if it is deep copy one should
give you Phi eight
ii should give you five six and if I run
this okay so we can see five eight and
five six that means internally it is
going as deep copy and it looks like
shallow copy so that is the importance
of object copying using shallow copy
deep copy and cloneable so thank you so
