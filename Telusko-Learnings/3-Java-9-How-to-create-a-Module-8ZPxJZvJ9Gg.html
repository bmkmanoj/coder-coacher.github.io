ready and in this video we'll see how to
create a module in fact to understand
the concept of modularity you have to
understand the problem behind that and
that's why in the last video we have
seen we have created this thick glasses
which is calculator ad helper and runner
in run oh we need a object of calculator
because we want to calculate something
and calculator itself is depend upon ad
helper now when you make big project we
do we normally do that but then fragra
now the most important part is
calculator and to do its task a
gorilla's helper had help of ad helper
now calculator and add helper they are
in some same I mean they are in imagine
that in some one one jar file and runner
is in our project so when you add a jar
file you can use all the classes you can
use calculator you can use add helper
but we don't want to do that because as
you can see the class add helper belongs
to internal package name suggest that it
should be used only for internal use but
anyone can use it you select in runner
as well I can use calculator how many we
don't want to do I mean we can in runner
as well we can use add helper we don't
want to do that I I mean I want that
other people should not be able to use
add helper but how can you control it
and that's why we have a concept of
module right so let's try to use let's
see how to get a module it's very simple
if you have a Java JDK install which we
just did you can uninstall you simply
create click on your project and say neo
there's a concept of module just mention
a name of the module because when you
will get a NIC module name is very
important I will name this module as
tennis co dot mean that's my main module
so this is one of the module we are
working with other click on finish the
moment I do that can you see that we
have a we have a project in which you
have SRC that's way normal in a sauce if
you have packages but if you focus you
can see be something in something drag
and boil we have that is for main it's
and--which in which you already have a
saucy that means in one project even
have multiple modules and every module
will have it their own source code now
in this module I just want to create a
runner plus so whatever class you are
you are having here let me put that in
ah see I would like you cannot project I
will say I want a new class call this
one now and in this one I want the same
output or maybe I just want to bring
hello Boyd as of now and I will say P
SVM it should print hello that's it this
is what I'm expecting now you can see we
have a different module in which I am
writing Java code will it work
nothing different right this is normal
Java right it should work the only thing
is I want to move this into a package
now you can have your package name same
as your your module name doesn't matter
it can be same or it can be different
your choice and I will just move this
this class to that particular package
and I've done that you can see in SRC we
have that ISKCON main in which i have
one so everything is perfect right and
if I run this code it should work so if
I run this code it should print hello
nothing wrong in that
you can see record the output but then
every module so you have anywhere you
work with the module you need two things
one a module name which we got here plus
we also need a module configuration or
how can you configure your module
because the module provides lots of
features why to gain control who can use
this module you can also mention this
modules depend upon some other modules
as we have discussed in the theory video
so one module can depend on some other
module or in one module if we have five
packages you may want to control the
number of packages you want to make it
visible to the outside boy how to
configure that the way you can do that
is by right-clicking okay not here but
on SRC the society right click here and
there is an option of module - info dot
java
now you might be wondering can be really
name up last name as I mean the file
name as module - info we can do that in
- in terms of module and unique we got
our module whatever configures we want
to do you can do it here just like you
write in fact there are very famous -
key words we can use one is requires and
the other one is export again will we
will talk about this later
why do we use export why do we use it
time beam this is how you create a
module and that's right we are we are
creating a Java file for configuration
right that's that different right so
yeah it will work there's no doubt you
got your class you got your module -
info let's run this project once again
just to see if everything is working
then we're going to do that the moment
you learn this file you can see because
hello but we also got one more further
which is out this is interesting if I
expand out we have our project folder
which is more demo but that is one of a
normal project but we also have the
disco main for every module you'll be
getting a different folder if I expand
that you got the disco interest where
you got mean and you got you another
class and you've got module - info dot
plus this is how you create a module you
can create multiple modules we can do
that so we will right click here and I
will say right like new module and this
module would be I will name this module
as the disco dot util again why we'll
use this we will see that later but you
can create multiple modules and the way
I do that you can see we got two modules
one is mean one is util and they both
have different SRC but was the advantage
so to understand the advantage we will
try to convert the other example of the
last video remember we have we have this
two classes a helper and calculator we
will try to do that in this util package
and we will control what we can use and
what we should avoid so how do you do
that that we'll see in the next video so
just to recap what we have done we have
simply created up we have this is simply
the module called as author this kameena
way you can do that is brightening and
creating a module and every module needs
this this file called as module
- info dot Java right that's how you do
it and this is the syntax of quitting
module just just use module the keyboard
the new keyword in Java and the name of
your module right it should be sensible
of course and you can use multiple
statements here so I hope you're
