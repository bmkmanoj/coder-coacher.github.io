different race colorings and in this
video we'll talk about XML so excellent
basically stands for it is extensible so
is extensible markup language okay so
why discourse markup language because we
specify something so an example if you
have familiar with HTML so in each team
will be used tags right so those tags
occurs marks okay so example we have be
tags so be reference to boiled right so
that is that tag here so it is a markup
right so it's a language markup language
and you can add your own tags zero so
it's not specific that you have to use
inbuilt tags you can have your own tags
and that data set is called as expand
Xcode is extensible which is expandable
right not personalized why we require
HTML and also why we require XML and why
it's so famous you know if you're if
you're if you talk about this this world
we are living in information age right
in this information age everything what
matters is information example you want
to talk to someone you use whatsapp you
you want to check other people life you
use Facebook right and why Facebook is
so famous it's because it doesn't matter
what's happening in your life you watch
it's important that what is happening in
other people life right so if you're
talking about all this data so to
process it to process data we have
language like Java C++ C sharp right but
how to send data from one place to other
place example if I let's say if I have a
client here and a server I want data
from the server right now this server
has to choice so whenever you want to
server to give you data so someone can
give the give your data in HTML format
so in HTML we send both the data right
we send HTML plus we send XML or so we
send data and we say the tags right but
let's I don't want to send the tags I
just want to send it data so we use XML
because in HTML we we want to specify
something in this layout I don't want to
send a layout I just want to send data
so we will use XML data
because in xmldata let's say a phone to
send 3000 so what exactly this 3000 is
so this 3000 can be points it can be
rank or it can be this salary right so
you have to pay very specific this is a
salary here so that's your salary so we
can specify salary in this bracket so
this 3000 is salary right that's why we
mention XML file now that also vary will
be used so XML you can use XML and yeah
so you can use XML well first we can use
XML to transfer data we can use XML for
conferring this framework so we can
configure the framework and in Android
so if you let's say if you are using
Android so you can design using XML
right so if you know about Android Linux
in Android we have or we create designs
using XML and when you work with Spring
Framework let's say when you're working
with job and you have spring you have
hibernate you have JPA so you configure
all this servers or all these frameworks
with the help of XML and we use XML for
transferring data so for transfer a
table use XML and now apparently we have
a new technology which is called JSON
which is JavaScript object notation
right so we have these three things we
have transfer data configure and design
so that is the uses of XML now how it
exactly looks like so let's say I want
to create an XML now so I will create
XML here and we'll say I want to store
my name okay so if I have my name which
is Naveen so I will say I will use a
name tag I will specify the name as
Naveen and I had to close this name okay
so it is composite to close the tag with
20 when you open it so we have to follow
some rules so the first row for the xmls
then a every opening tag every opening
tag needs a closing tag second every XML
file so this is XML file here so that's
your XML dot XML file every XML file
needs a root tag example if I have
to tag as aliens so you all are aliens
right so we have aliens tagged right so
alien tags open it in anti closed and
all your tags will be inside this alien
stag example we have an alien tag and we
have the closing for alien tag and we
have the tag with salary here it's a
three thousand and that's a salary okay
so we have we have an alien tag we can
also have one more so we can copy this
code here so we will be having also we
will be having one more tag which is
alien so this two alien ties are inside
a alien style so this is a root tag now
so this aliens will be called as flute
tags so this is root tag and inside that
you have multiple tags sounds good and
here so that's how we can create a XML
file right now in this XML file we have
two things the structure of the XML file
are the data okay so we have a structure
and then we have data right so we can
specify something called as grammo
for XML so you can define the grammar
with the help of so we have two types of
grammar one is called as structure
grammar it will define the layout and
the second one is it's the content
grammar so this data is the content
right and you can define the structure
grammar with the help of DTD which
stands for document type definition and
you can define the you can define the
grammar for the content with the help of
schema so that's schema now how to
exactly how exactly we can do that that
we'll see once we start the practical
okay
so this is just the theory of XML so we
have except XML stands for extensible
markup language and it can be used to
transfer data to configure the
frameworks and to what one more it also
design the layout try to design the to
design something then this is how you
can create XML so we can Vic we require
a root tag every opening tag needs a
closing tag right so we can have child
elements we can have parent elements
here so these are elements also and if
we talk about XML we have to specify two
things we have to specify this gaddama
it can be structural grammar it can be
contained grammar and if we talk about
structure grammar we have to use DTD and
for quant for content dilemma we can use
schema we can use schema to define both
the grammars we can define structure as
it as well as content using schema but
using DDT we can only work with
structure how exactly to perform that
that we'll see in the practical session
so make sure you watch the practical
session but before that do subscribe for
