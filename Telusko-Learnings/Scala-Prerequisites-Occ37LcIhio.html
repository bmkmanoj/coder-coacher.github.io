Scala now amazing decision so in this
video we'll talk about how to learn it
so welcome back this is the wind Wendy
from toys for learnings and now let's
talk about how to learn Scala but before
that there are certain prerequisites
right so first we liquids it is I mean
in terms of knowledge and the second
prerequisite in terms of software's so
to start with the knowledge first so to
learn Scala so in this series I will be
assuming that you know Java because I
will not teach you what is variable I
know I will not teach you what is loops
okay so we'll be using those stuff
directly so I'm assuming that you know
Java at least I'm not saying in the
expert level but as a big nerd level you
should know how it is for loop you
should know what is a day how do we
create an object how to use collection
and what is thread so if you know all
those topics at least basics of them you
can learn Scala so those are the
prerequisite as for knowledge if we
don't know those through those things
that's okay you can go back to my
channel learns Java a bit you can go to
the police playlist and watch some of
the videos to get the basic
understanding how Java works and then
you can jump it to Scala so that's the
knowledge knowledge prerequisites what
software you need so before installing
Scala which we'll be doing in the next
session in the next video so before
installing Scala your machine needs Java
so first first of all you is you have to
install JDK in your machine because it
will make sure that you have JDK and you
have JVM updated version of JVM so
that's the first thing second you need
eclipse okay because what we'll be doing
is we'll be installing a plug-in of
Scala in Eclipse
again you can use Scala you can use
Scala on command line you can use color
inside Eclipse you can use color inside
NetBeans IntelliJ or you can download
this color IDE itself okay but we'll be
doing scala with eclipse so before going
for the next video you can download
eclipse and you can keep it ready so
that's it
two requisites first first or knowledge
requisite and then sec software in
knowledge
java is required I mean the knowledge of
Java is required and the second one the
setup of Java is required so that's it
see you in the next video thank you so
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
