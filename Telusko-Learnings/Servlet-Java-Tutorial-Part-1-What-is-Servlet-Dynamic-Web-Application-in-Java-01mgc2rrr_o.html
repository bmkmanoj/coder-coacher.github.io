they will talk about servlets or you can
say our web programming using Java so if
we talk about servlets the question is
why we need subject in first place see
when you talk about a web page it can be
a static web page or it can be a dining
web page now with the static web page is
if let's suppose you have a web server
and that web server has some pages so as
a client when you request for the page
web server will check the IPA or the tip
the URL it will give the response right
so depend upon that if that page exists
it will give the page if that page does
not exist it will give you an atom but
what if you have you want to do some
processing on server side like if you
want to add two numbers if you are not
go for or to find a even number odd
number or if you want to communicate
with database in that case your web
server which works with HTML and as
chairman has don't have a power to
communicate with it with database or to
do any operations is because it's a
markup language for that you require
some server-side programming like Java
so to create a dynamic page that means
you have to generate a page instantly if
you don't have a page it will generate a
new page depend upon the request and
that is possible with the help of
servlets so we'll see a basic example of
adding two numbers using servlet so for
that first we require a project so we'll
go we'll open our NetBeans make sure you
have at least one of the server or
GlassFish or Apache so when you go to a
server you can see I have a half to a
bar chain to GlassFish because I'm
working with two different NetBeans IDE
one is NetBeans 8.0 second is NetBeans
eight-point 0.1 so with those two and
NetBeans I have two servers we'll use
one of them okay so for that let's get a
new project again in this will be having
option of Java web or java application
so this time we have to go for Java web
then we say next we'll give this project
name as serve demo
then we'll say next and here we have to
select one of the server okay at this
time since a batch is more famous we'll
go for a patch a tomcat and so latest
version of EE and we'll say next and
then these are the frameworks which are
available but time being we as - as we
are starting will not go for any
framework will go for simple web
application and we'll say finish now
once you click on finish this is your
project and this speech which is index
dot HTML is your you can say a default
page or the home page right so let me
show you something if I write here it's
hello world so this is my page now and
this is my project and again this is my
website basically so if I go to my
website and it will say enter which is
me run it will call this page which is
home page so again for I am running for
this for the first time it will take
some time for the employment ok and the
output is hello world right so this is
your this is your IP address which is
the same machines localhost this is the
port number of your server for the
apache tomcat it is 8.0 so the h0 it for
and then this is your project name which
also serves as your website name and
then we are calling a page called as
index dot HTML so inter so if we go to
the same page if you don't write this
content still it will give the same page
because that's your home page right now
we don't want this thing what we want is
we have to ask
we will send two numbers to server so
we'll add those two numbers and will
give me the feedback response wait for
that what we need is first we need here
we need to ask the user to enter two
numbers that ways
first number and second number for that
you say enter first number and we'll say
input okay for text field in HTML you
have something called as type text and
then we have to provide a name for
time it will say name is t1 and then we
require a break statement here so we'll
say BR okay what's the inter second
number and then we'll again we'll say
input type text and we'll provide a name
as yeah right guesses to t2 and then we
require a button also so we'll say BR
and be required a button on vegetable
when I click on this button it will say
add so we'll say input type this should
be submit and then we'll say value the
visible content it should be like add
okay now if I run this code let me than
this so again I gather the whole project
or you can run the one file I don't need
the side of right headers so we'll say
remove to make it more simple and then
let me say it one well in this code I
got into first number and the second
number then I add button right this is
this is your value of the submit now if
I until the value has 443 and seven when
I say add nothing happened right
it's because we have created a button
but there is no action there is no
action on this button for that you have
to provide something called as something
on which like if you click on this
button it will it will do some task that
you can define with the help of form tag
which we can define a - action okay and
then we'll call something called us add
again what's that ad means we'll see
later
so if we have action ad then we have to
funk mention a method when you talk
about method we have two options either
we can go forget or we can go for post
watch those we'll see later
so we have get end post and then we have
to form close this form
now now if I run this code you can see
there is some modification like if I
enter the details as 45 and 23 well
let's say add okay when I say add it's
calling something called as add which is
not available it's because we are not
creating any data or we have not yet
identified so what this add is this is
your Java code in which you can add two
numbers but because Java has the power
to work with variables in which you can
add two numbers so for that we require a
web of require a code which will work on
a server now if we talk about a server
it will not work with JVM it will work
on some server some web server whether I
app server now if we talk about those
type of servers one of them is Tomcat so
we have to use Java on Tomcat so if you
talk about those technology where you
can work with Java on web server or app
server you need something called
servlets so servlets are the web
component which works which resides on
server which executes on server and
which gives output on client machine so
to do that we have to I think on your
project and we'll say new servlet now
you have to give a name to servlet will
give ad because we are calling an ad
from our HTML code and then we'll say
next here you have two options either
you can take tick mark it or you can
skip this now if you give a tick mark
here it will add the entry of your
servlet into a file called as web dot
XML which defines the underlying
servlets underlying classes are these
soft lips right so we'll say finish
we are not checking this part now since
we are not checking it we need to
mention somewhere that the below class
is a servlet and for that we have to use
something called as annotations and
annotation here is its web service so
your web server it here is an annotation
which defines this ad class is a servlet
so whenever a user requests our ad page
that means you can see the output we are
requesting our ad write a slash ad
it will call this serve it okay now oh
then what next I will remove this text
again let let me just remove this mini
part will say our default class will say
a class and will remove this package I
want this package to become
automatically so remove did it now what
we have is we have a class add now this
class is not a normal class we have to
convert this into a servlet for that we
have to mention it as it exchanges HTTP
servlet it means it will fetch important
features of a servlet to this add class
and since when talk about a web server
it will have a web container now web
container should know which which
servlet the user is asking for and for
that you have to mention this annotation
now since we are using with we are
working within blue glasses we have to
import packages how to import package
you can click on this adder and then it
did will be option of adding port so you
have to click on this add import here
same goes for this you have to say add
import other way around you can go with
your keyboard shortcuts and the kibo
chart full keyboard shortcut for this
import packages is ctrl shift I now now
since as a user you have to call this ad
solid now this ad sublet will provide
you some service and that's why when you
say you are working with something or
your servlet works or it does something
everything in Java when you say does
something we have to use something
called as methods and the method here
will be called as service now this
service will take two parameters one is
request object one will be request
object what time it will say it is as
rdq and second will be response object
so it will be servlet response and will
say it is as re s
now now if we talk about a servlet it
goes in many different types the first
one was a servlet which was an interface
then then we had a generic servlet which
is the abstract class then we have this
HTTP servlet and then you have plated
your own servlet in all these transact
transitions from soft service we have to
use some new methods okay now service
and those methods work in the same way
so it's time being start we'll go with
service then we'll convert this service
into some other method now now we have
this object called as request so when I
use a sense your request it will send
all these details in this object now as
a server when you send details or
response to your client you have to send
all the details in response object now
our first task is to a take input from
user right and again we'll store that it
data in a variable so we'll say int I
now if you say int I you have to take
one put form user in which a user in
entering data in this field what is T 1
so in anyway we have to fetch data from
T 1 right and this T 1 will be enclosed
in this request object so that's why we
have to say it's request dot
getparameter from T 1 now the problem is
when you say get parameter it will give
you a string type of data what we want
is integer right so we have to convert
this into integer dot pass it and we
need a J variable also say we'll say
copy and paste this time it should be J
and we'll say it is as T 2 now what next
or we have to add these two numbers so
we'll say int K equal to I plus J 4 J
now now we have to send this detail
which is K to a client machine when you
say client machine client should have a
software where you can print this data
and those client software's are called
as web browsers
now question arises how to create a web
page it's very simple if you if you
wanna create a web page you just have to
open a notepad you just have to open a
notepad and you have to now let's
imagine I want to create a web page in
which I have only I want to show hello
that's it so you want you will say is
you have a type HTML code slight HTML
open HTML close but unfortunately if you
just type hello and save this in on
desktop as demo dot HTML and if you say
safe and just you need to open with a
browser so we'll say we can go for any
browser let's go for Chrome you can see
there is no HTML tag included in this
file but still we are getting hello
again huh
now we have to make it bold obvious we
have to use tags right so what that tags
is just give you some fancy layout to
your text at set
now when you say bow be it will make
that data bowl so if I save and refers
this page it becomes bold right it's
that simple
now what it means you writing tags is
not compulsory
whenever you use this tag you can use it
now if I now print this data key I don't
need any HTML tags so what I can do I
can just print this data to user machine
but when you say you have to print
something on user machine you require an
object of printwriter so we'll name this
object as out and we'll say our es since
we have to send data through the
response object will say get right up
and then now we have to import the
package so we'll use ctrl shift I
package is important now the problem is
there there is a chance that this this
get writer will give you an error so for
that you have to handle the exception
will so throws ioexception so this will
handle the exception now and then you
have to print data so we'll say print Ln
it will say que that's it so when you
say when you run this file it will call
ID solve it
by passing two values t1 and t2 and then
it this ad will get these details and it
will add these two numbers and it will
print it so let me try let me run this
code now run let me add two numbers it's
89 and 67 and a decent addition is it
156 right it's so simple right okay so
this is your first servlet code I hope
you got some details about servlet I
will continue with the topic in my next
