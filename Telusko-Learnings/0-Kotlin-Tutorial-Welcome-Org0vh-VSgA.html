different physical lodgings and welcome
to the course on Gotland so in Google
Google i/o 2017 they have just announced
that they are making Cortland as the
official language for Android again they
are not replacing Java the Quadling will
work together with Java in fact Athiya
if you want to program or if you want to
write an Android application we were
having only one official example when I
officer the programming language which
was Java and now we can use Cortland as
well so if you talk about cotton cotton
is actually very easier to work if you
don't know programming you can learn
coordinate very easily the only thing is
the cotton link works on Java framework
it works on JVM so you should know the
concept of Java as well to completely
understand how portaling works but then
if you just want to write a software
then knowing is Java console is not
necessary you can learn part link
directly you should also know the
concept how JVM works so if you want to
learn Cortland perfectly so I would
recommend you to learn Java basics and
then you can try to understand how JVM
works and then learning Portland will be
very easy now Partin was rivalled in
2011 by JetBrains now again this comes
this product is made by JetBrains
now if you don't know jetbrains
JetBrains the same company who has
created IntelliJ platform they have also
created Android studio platform right
and then Google has Google and IntelliJ
now they have Google and JetBrains they
have a strong mounting now and that's
why I guess it was a recommendation from
jet planes that they want what they
wanted quad link to be an official
language not just jet planes I guess
there was some developers they were
using Cortland for Android development
before so because of those
recommendations Google I just made a
partnership official language but again
a development in Java will not be
stopped right there are some developers
I mean not some calipers there are lots
of developers they are using Java from a
long time so they will be continuing
with Java I feel caught little better
for those people who are new to
programming if they want to be at a
developer you can run partly now you can
use it Portland can be also useful for
people who are all the masters in Java
because if you write a file in Java it
will take maybe it will take 10 20 lines
the same thing can be done in Cortland
in two or five to six lines
so Carlene will reduce your reduce your
number of number of lines you write and
again the less number of lines means
less less number of bugs right because
bugs are directly proportional traffic
directly proportional to the number of
lines you tight so yeah so in 2014 they
got the first version which is Carlene
and now the current version is one point
or let me just verify so the current
version of Coeur d'Alene is one point
one point two so again it was released
in Apple - 25 2007 teen so again maybe
in future we'll be getting more updates
and every new update will Abner will add
new features officially we don't have
good books for Courtland as you can see
I do have books on Schuyler I do have
books on Java 8 but then for quadlin I
do if we don't have books but we do have
the official reference from Portland so
if you just go to parsing dot lang okay
quad Ling Lang dot o-r-g that's I get
that's the website just go there and you
will see in fact you will find that in
description area so that is the official
documentation of quadlin you can they
have tutorials also but then if you are
a visual learner if you want to learn
from videos this is the series for you
so in this entire series we'll be
learning about Kotlin the only
prerequisite is you should know basics
of java to understand my videos i try to
make a small small videos not be lengthy
videos because as per ad X which is
education X they they have researched
and they found that the the student what
you say the attention remains only for 6
minutes so I try to make video mode or
less than 6 minutes maybe 2 minutes 3
minutes 4 minutes or 6 minutes there are
some videos which are more than 5 or
maybe 10 minutes that's just when I try
to get wrapped with that and I try my
best to make this code make this course
much easier to for you to understand and
if you feel some issues are there let me
know in the comment section and all the
best particles I hope you will enjoy
this course along</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
