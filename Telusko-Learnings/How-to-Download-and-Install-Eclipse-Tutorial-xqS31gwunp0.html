video we'll see how to use and how to
install Eclipse IDE now Eclipse is ID if
you use basically used for Java so
whenever you work when we talk about
Java development or Android development
so people normally go you use Eclipse
IDE so there are different ideas right
we have NetBeans we have Eclipse we have
IntelliJ we have we have we have lots of
options that's by industry standards
everyone uses Eclipse for the web
development in fact if we talk about
Android development
so tips provides you some libraries
using which you can work on Android so
in order to download eclipse what you
can do is you can just go to google and
you can download eclipse so we can just
type down Eclipse download now before
downloading Eclipse you you have to make
sure you have a JDK installed in your
system so where you will find JDK so you
can just go to your C Drive and you have
to go to Program Files there you will
see a folder called a Java and in Java
so there should be hacked you should
have at least one JDK so make sure you
have a latest version maybe 1.7 1.8
whichever available when you watch this
video so you have first you need a JDK
because when you talk about Eclipse
indirectly it will use JDK to compile
things so so once you search eclipse
download on Google it will show you an
option now there are different types IDE
for different different perspective so
we have J Java EE perspective we have
for Java developers now since you might
be downloading downloading eclipse for
all different versions like for for web
development of our software development
on console level or maybe for Android
development or you can simply download
is Eclipse IDE for Java EE if you click
on Eclipse IDE for Java EE then it will
open this Eclipse website where you can
see it asking for the different types of
formats
since we are working with windows here
and I'm using a 64-bit OS I can simply
click on 64-bit OS here or if you are
working with Macintosh so you can click
on any version we have which you are
working try to bit or 64 bit or Linux
now it has a different releases so we
have you know we have Kepler we have
Juno we have indigo so lunar here is the
latest one so so you can either download
Luna or you can Luna or Luna and you can
order on download Kepler so let's click
on this windows 64 bit okay now by
default is giving me Luna which is a
latest version let me go with Kepler so
let me click on Kepler okay so in Kepler
we have this 64 bit this one and here we
can download a 64 bit or 64 bit Eclipse
and we can click just on this download
okay so if you click on this download
okay it will ask you for the donation so
if you think Eclipse needs donation you
can donate some amount now so it will it
will start downloading right so it is
around 250 MB so it will take depends
upon your internet speed it will take
some time so in this video we have seen
how to download right but I have already
downloaded in my system so it's there so
this is the downloaded version here
which is of around 250 mb now once you
have downloaded the Eclipse now what we
need to do is so if you open if you
double-click Eclipse here it will show
there's a folder called as Eclipse here
so if I double click this or if I open
this Eclipse you can see there are lots
of folders and the most important thing
we have to see here is Eclipse now
Eclipse is not like a normal software
where you have to install it you can use
Eclipse by just unzipping it so we can
just right-click here and we'll say
extract here so it will now it will
extract the Eclipse here
okay and once you extract everything if
you open this folder after extraction
you just have to double click this icon
here and once you double click it will
open eclipse and then you can write a
code to test your Eclipse IDE cool so
this is how you have to download Eclipse
and you have to unzip it
it's a plug-and-play software I don't
have to install it so that is from this
video in the next video we'll see how to
open eclipse and how to create your
first project so thank you so much for
