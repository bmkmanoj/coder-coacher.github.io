verify how do I do that let me just go
back to the link okay so it's an odd
timing I know and I don't go live at
this time normally but then I'm live
today so yes people were waiting so some
people says come on great so yeah so
today I have a good news and a bad news
as you can see from the title it's live
courses good news or bad news or and bad
news no the good news so they start with
bad news I guess let's start with okay
in fact before starting with good news
or bad news let me talk about some
announcement if you remember last week
last month I guess I don't know about
the date now I have announced one thing
which is I'm going to stop all the paid
courses in fact I was thinking about
paid courses but then later I realize
you know some people they don't want to
pay for the course and some people they
cannot afford it some people I had to
pay and so I wanted to change the way I
want to teach people because the idea of
the disco lighting was to give you free
education and that's where we are
heading now so in future everything will
be fuel free on this channel right it's
all about free content so yes Tenace
color thing is adopting a free business
model it's not that I don't want to earn
from this because of course I'm spending
so much of time but I don't want to
charge you people so different ways of
earning from from this platform you know
I can I can earn from ads that's what
I'm doing I can earn from so I can run
from ads because as I you to buy we took
it on from ads I can earn from maybe
donations that's what I'm planning now
so if you so example if I upload it the
attack goes on spring or maybe if I
applied upload my entire course object
so the idea would be you know I will be
getting yeah so the idea would be I've
been getting so if you if you watch the
entire spring course which cost you
around let's say a thousand thousand
rupees or maybe you can convert that
into dollars it's a fifteen dollars for
the course you don't have to pay for
that you can watch everything for free
learn it free and if it is helpful you
can you can do it right that's what we
can do if you think okay that cause was
helpful
you can simply donate some amount that's
that's great in fact nowadays you can
see I'm uploading free content on
kochava free college aspe normally those
courses are paid courses you know if you
go to udemy they will charge you around
you know how much they will charge you
maybe they will charge you around $10
$15 for the course and you cannot even
confirm about the quality of that course
so this channel will provide you free
content and you can watch them anytime
in a bit of time doesn't matter for a
lifetime of course and if you feel those
are helpful for you simply donate that's
what you can do right and what what are
the amounts to tone it doesn't matter
you know even if you even if you donate
it let's say ten rupees that's fine you
know your 10 rupees will be helpful for
others because what I'm doing now is
whatever I earned from the from YouTube
itself I'm trying to do that on so I'm
trying to help other people on that
example so whatever you donate so I got
some donations last last one
I guess it's last one challenge and I
got some donations no that big amount
but those small amounts are important
right it will be helpful it will be help
it will be helpful so for some people
and some people asking for Paytm - even
we can do that I will be sharing my pick
and number with you so okay so you can I
will do it somewhere I don't know where
to put my ATM number or maybe I will put
in a description area of this video so
in the description area you will find
the Paytm number if you want you can
donate it as well so I'm searching for
different way of donation because
donation is something which you are
going for there's nothing - there's no
compulsion that you have to pay for fees
or something all the courses will be
feel free in future now till this point
I was doing something that made
announcement right so the announcement
was about the life courses so let me
just announce that thing okay so the
thing is I should last from last one
year I am doing some life courses on
YouTube or not one year it's been one
and a half year or two years now it's
been it's been two years I never I
started in in a last to last year master
on 15 March so I'm taking lot of life
courses like Co Java for saala
for JSP for spring hibernate I was doing
some a life courses and then the idea of
life process come came from some
subscribers they said ok we want to
learn live from you I thought let's get
a try and I started taking live
trainings I enjoyed it you know people
enjoyed it I enjoyed it I got so many
good comments or good feedback hardly
why not - not a good feedback but other
than otherwise everything was good I was
very excited I mean I enjoyed those two
years now after doing it for two years I
realized one thing that it is getting
taking a lot of my time the main idea of
the YouTube was to make free content to
upload more content as possible but due
to this life courses it is eating up a
lot of my time ideas it is 1 and 1/2
hour per day but then it's not just
about that one is about the preparation
it's also about the questions and then
there's so many other things so so so
the good news or the bad news is the bad
news first
the bad news is and stopping all the
life courses if you are waiting for the
right courses
unfortunately my plan is to stop light
pulses because it is taking a lot of my
time and I'm still trying to figure it
out once what with the best way should I
create more content or life-forces even
if I take like courses in future maybe
frequent one maybe we'll have some
contests and whoever wins the contest
contest will get the free course that's
what I am by now let's see how thing
goes but as of now the live courses are
going to end ok now what's a good news
the good news is we still have one batch
remaining you know so last month I
started I started with hibernate patch
so normally I started with hibernate and
spring batch before the announcement and
the hibernate batch is just over so by
tomorrow our data tomorrow will start
with a spring batch so people who are
still interested in running spring they
can join it that's fine so yes so yes
hibernate and spring are shown in the
industry they will be for a long time
what you're thinking it will be going ok
so the thing is bad new bad news is I'm
stopping all the online courses so there
is no light forces in future that's what
I'm playing now and
so what will be what will be coming in
future so in future you will be getting
all the fairy content so I when it
completes it in fit in fact I do have
have eight cities on YouTube but
advanced videos will be on the will be
uploaded spring videos will be will be
there so I will be sharing with spring
from basic and then spring boots doing
AOP all those things will be coming on
this platforms but it will be taking a
lot of time because this month as I
mentioned I have some very important
tasks up to the at after that I'm going
for a vacation after that so the entire
March I'm on vacation and then and I
will start the work from April made so
made a pill I was started with the
actual work and you will be saying not a
lot of free videos on the way you know
so yes before that I'll be finishing the
attack pour Java I will try to finish it
- serve it and JSP so let's see so
that's great so so that's that was an
announcement that I'm ending this batch
the right courses so that was the bad
news the night courses are going to end
and the good news is I'm starting with
and this is the last batch okay so yeah
so this one says exact we make in the
just-in-time one I've enough your last
batch yes this one is there in one of my
batch I hope this is why you're enjoying
the batch the life courses that's great
okay in fact I love like poses you know
the way we interact I mean I it was a
big decision for me I was talking to
Jason from last four months I wanted to
stop the batch from in December and not
in December in October itself I wanted
to stop the batch but you know I so
there was some I wanted to do this much
more because I love it I love to take
like courses so this was say is very
much okay great okay so that was the
announcement like courses are going to
end a maybe in future even if I take
like courses that when you free okay
that's what I'm thinking about now
because some people they cannot pay for
the fees and yes my core my courses are
bit costlier compared to the market
standard because we take live courses
right now people do compare my life
process with you Danny
the thing is
or any platform you get recorded videos
you don't get the you don't get that
support you know in life courses we
answer we try to answer questions I mean
you can ask questions I will try to
answer your questions and it's it's a
team effort right and every day you will
be having life sessions so you will be
on track so that's what the thing is but
still I wanted to stop it because of
civil reasons is it is it eating lot of
my time usually I was free a bit last -
last year I was I was having a lot of
time to work on but now as things are
going doing things are going good I am
getting a lot of things
okay so consistency is the key to
improve channel that's why I'm doing
that I am trying to improve my channel
okay so one more thing some people are
comparing this channel with the other
tech channels the thing is we are not
okay we cannot compare this channel with
other channels because this is a channel
where you are learning everything for
free I know where you will get all the
content for free right and so that's
thing and everything is number game you
know you cannot compare with number of
subscribers example New Boston has
millions of subscribers that's a green
guy right new portion you can find so
many causes there there are other other
platforms as well let's not compare them
I can see 150 people are watching this
and only 69 likes that's bad come on
guys okay so people are asking for the
fees the fee structure okay so to
understand it to get the free structure
you can go to terrace co.com there's
online courses tab there all I would
simply share the link here so I would
say that is co.com slash online dot HTM
okay so this is where you will get all
the details about the spring yeah so you
will get the details about the spring
and all those things okay so that's
that's one thing okay anything else um
we talked about today yeah so we talked
about donation right so everything will
be free in future so that's one way of
revenue model for me for me on this
channel because I'm not selling the
courses again and there will not be any
live courses so delicious
the one way to earn and then adds anyway
I'm adding a a good amount to sustain
this channel on YouTube but then you
cannot depend up on ads right because I
I don't know I never believed on YouTube
policies because I've seen people there
are I mean you need to be sundowning
other people I mean not you too but add
sensing it is getting close for some
youtubers maybe for different reasons so
you cannot trust them okay so that's it
that's about the thing we can have some
caution houses now let's take let's take
questions showing how to work with
string okay she will say SH showing hell
to work as paint doesn't get you sugar
okay so Alvin say is up minute nom
yellow egg bar oh hi Alvin how did the
other okay
okay most Mahajan say you should I learn
Android with Java of what you know Java
I would say cotton is better now because
Portland has efficient programming but
yeah
to run to work on jaw up Android I would
say Courtland but then knowledge of Java
is very important Karthik says thank you
sir for making Java easy oh thank you so
much in fact I would I want you I want
your feedback on the new videos which
I'm uploading the cozaar videos and they
advance our videos just to let you know
the codes our videos are not exactly a
new one it is it was created in 2016 to
not to be as back one year back in
December I started I guess in December I
upgraded all those videos and this our
J's videos which I'm making now so I
would like to do your feedback so you
can just enter the chat window if you
are watching poach our videos how it is
if you are watching so much is how it is
so that with your with your feedback I
can improve my training I can improve
these examples at least okay let me pick
up some more questions here and okay so
dnt says I heard that Java will update
every six months that's right
so after Java 9 all the Java versions in
future will be getting updated in six
months now why Java is doing that
because the technology is changing very
fast why do you have seen all these
languages coming up so Java Java things
you know we have to all
so upgrade now and Shirley Jo was going
down a bit for some time but now after
Java 9 it will be going up so Java 10 ja
11 I'm not sure about number versions
but all the major versions will be
uploaded I will be updated in 6 months
so you can expect some huge number of
features ok so I will say is hi hello
hello rau says we were waiting for you
ok for the session maybe so clinto says
you are awesome thank you so much Linda
okay so Akuma says a week I'll say hello
so I'm gonna be hard a high please add
water and wash our to do is I'm doing
that if you are if you follow the
channel I'm doing i doing sup which is
the videos hi might seasons are only
there so what is the meaning now is
savage a SP how many is there and the
only thing is even in spring in fact I
do have some spring videos not the
entire stuff and that stuff will be
uploaded in May June July something in
that way ok because it takes time you
know to make good content and come on we
are learning something very break
something like Java spring this is the
enterprise language droid we are adding
something which is using it in the
industry
so it will take some time Krishna says
great human being oh hi Krishna Krishna

us give us your premium number I've just
been given that is it so the chat in the
description you will find my patreon
number I hope I win today I write
paitent pick your number ok great ok so
please CPT of course news I've done that
so cause news of the good news is ok the
bad news is life forces are getting
ended and good good news is that we have

website and go to the online tab you
will find in fact let me just add the
link in description area so you can just
go to the website and check it out what
is going on with light forces so this is
the last batch of that is coloring for
public
so let's see I know that's a big
announcement do
okay so KK says so finally got
notification for this life conversation
or attached to it in fact I feel the
night time for live sessions awesome
because people will just show up you
know I normally do live session in the
afternoon and then people are busy I
would choose a good day you know
somewhere around maybe Friday evening
Saturday evening Sunday morning
something like that
let's see clinto says how to donate okay

so much for that okay so Venus say so
hibernate and spring companies are using
decreasing I heard from my friends tell
something about this please okay so when
you say the number of projects on spring
and - is going down that's not the case
because we have spring boot now we have
the I to programming spring it's not
going down see in an enterprise market
thanks do low waste low it is not that
it will be it will be over in one day so
it takes time I don't know it is going
down but I'm sure it's not going down
because not going down it's not going
down
so hibernate and spring they are not
going down there are other frameworks
which is coming in the picture but then
it's not going down
okay so deepak says please share spring
security videos yes so once I start with
spring series again or you're putting
spring security as well okay so I'm
doing a keeps phase I'm doing MC after
that I decided to join ethical hacking
course is it best or not of course it is
best it's all the
you know if you love hacking not bad not
a bad option right but if you're someone
you don't like hacking and just because
it is hype and you want to do that I
would say don't go for that if you're
interested do anything you want you know
I also believe don't just learn
something which is new in the industry
you can also go with something which is
old provided you have interest in that
example let's say yeah it is a
technology which is very old but then
you love it that's that's fine just
start with it and maybe the moment you
start working on that you will love
something else that you will move to
that or just to indices thank you so
much keep making ghosts video oh that's
what that's what I will be doing the
next channel say is spring wasn't starts
of course spring spring is a new
framework it provides you more features
than stores you know ok so watch Kevin
says you use latest app like BTM and
taste also so yes I have uploaded a
obliterate my pretium number then you
can you can donate using PTM eh yes I
should be doing that right so let's see
how do outrage works because I've never
tried days yet I wanted to but not done
yet okay so King Shu says please start
on the internship we are waiting for
internship it will work with you it will
be great oh no it will be my honor to
work with you people there it's just
that I don't know how to - things it
will take some time
I'm trying to against some of the other
stuff done once I do that I will be
doing as I mentioned the last video as
well I won't be taking internship from
me no sir this better enhancement of
your video
oh that's why I didn't get you okay so
another god of says can you please can
you make a video on your installation
different databases oh I do have a video
on masking installation I should be
doing with Oracle Oracle I guess I do
have this on this channel that we just
checked because when I talk videos have
been made by my friend switch it so
let's see I just want to verify his
instructions there psychist now says I'm
interested for sprinkles that's why just
go to the website and register
okay what what what octa-core Java so
once you learn code Java you can start
learning Sarla JSP and otherwise if you
want to go for mobile well I would say
learn Android that's that thing that you
can do oh the Deepak says your videos is
awesome thank you so much the park dream
us a size dipping upon you Oh what else
what else and it take one say a one says
please make a video course on deep
learning okay that's a problem you know
I'm not that much into AI because to
teach AI you need to be very good with
AI right I mean not very good but at
least you should know how thing works I
know a bit but not exactly teach you I
don't want to miss guide you there
god of says I'm having problems toys
shouldn't upset about databases okay let
me just think about it how can I make
videos on that okay they all say is
about new technology from where and how
to work okay so whenever you get a new
technology that's a good question
actually it's wrong where you can learn
oh this is your first stop you know that
is for anything are you uploading videos
on you technologies as well I would say
just just read documentation you know
initially if you are interested whatever
new on is only way what some videos in
fact I feel nowadays every company with
a with a not something new they make
that official video watch that first
then read some documentation I try to
implement it whatever you want you to
just try it out that will be awesome
oh hey okay so what next
Siddartha says your glasses asked so
cool thank you so this is my new glasses
that's great you noticed it okay so I
end up putting in this maybe yeah okay
so such an says advanced java all
courses so please go Java you Cindy okay
I was as I mentioned before as well I
wanted to make videos in India as well
but then there's so many things on the
way you know I'm not reading much time
to do that
okay so we make midnight says you're all
videos are amazing I was missing food a
meet-up
oh you missed when a meet-up that's bad
uh maybe I was using putting once again
in me or April maybe I'll let you know
oh okay so we make says I'm new I have
been watching your videos for La Forge
our programming almost three to four
days and your specials very helpful so I
subscribe and like your video live video
too
oh that's great thank you so much we
wake and stay tuned there are so many
videos on the way you can learn a lot of
things for free okay okay so that's
great I'm getting a lot of questions on
future of Java ok Java future is very
good but thanks to the new version which
is Java online there are some people who
are not explode Java 9 and they don't
know what Java right features are so I
would say go for that and Java has a
good future ok oh great great great so
ok punkin says can you comment about
react native ok I heard about react
native not much I just saw some articles
they were comparing react native with
Java for Android and what I realized
after reading that article is Java in
terms of performance is faster react
native less bugs so Java has less bugs
compared to react native but yes if you
want to make things very fast I would
say go for the I can't you it is very
fast
I mean development time is very fast
because in Java you have to do
everything from scratch but trust me if
you talk about big companies they want
their product which is working you know
it doesn't matter for them it is taking
1 month or 2 months what what what
what's important for them is it should
work perfectly
you know less bugs it should have major
support for the for the hardware that's
what I've never tried reacting yourself
now but the articles which I read they
say is Java is faster in terms of
performance compared to react need you
because anyway it is
Java is a java and javac coordinate as
the official language for Android okay
so when you say something is official it
has a good support that's important
where can I learn it working from
beginning no idea just sauce on YouTube
okay so techie and if this why Google
logo is there so here I'm using hang out
right so hang out whenever use hang out
for live you get that Google logo okay
seanix a is proud to call you my trainer
oh thank you so much sonic once it says
thank you for your part in tutorials or
thanks so much
okay what else what else what else
okay I lost all the questions it went up
it went up
where are the questions okay are you
playing panic finally meet up in
Hyderabad yes as I mentioned in may
always be in different cities like
Bangalore Pune and okay so in April I'm
going to not Actros March I'm going to
Delhi that's where we can have a meet-up
I don't know because I am going to
different place from Delhi I'll be
landing in Delhi Airport so let's see if
we could have a meet up somewhere near
an airport I don't I'm not sure about
the timing yet because my fly stick it
are not work to it so once I do that
I'll be letting you know when I'll be
landing in back and and tell me so that
we can have a small meet up there and
then in May I'm having a meet-up in Pune
okay in Pune Hyderabad and Bangalore
these three cities are recovering okay
okay so caustic says is there any
meaning is there name name okay any
sense of naming this Janis this
co-learning is sharp I mean ready oh
yeah I believe this when you have a
channel if it is your personal channel
you should have your name that's perfect
but if you are creating a brand it's
always written to have a brand name
because companies know it doesn't belong
to one person right it belongs to a team
right so currently I'm working alone I
have one person who is helping me but
what if I build a team you know it
doesn't matter it doesn't
sense to have my name there in fact I do
have my name channel which is already
which is only person channel I can do
anything there what I want to do but
this is a learning platform right so I
wanted to give some unique name and why
the disco because the disco means get to
know so this channel is more about
learning so get to know that's what what
it did but what it means so okay great
what else what else
okay please make a video on application
service yes we're doing that okay what
else what else what else what else okay
so someone is asking me a question
Python Python Python Python Python
Python versus Java nowadays yeah that is
what is happening you know everyone's
comparing different languages I feel you
should not come by the languages it's
it's all about your requirement okay you
know why we have more pathogen apples in
Java it's not because Java is bad it's
just that part is easy to learn and it
is included in the syllabus as a first
subject so a lot of universities they
they teach fight as a first language
I'm not saying but as bad is just that
you know Chow is also good
don't just say Java is bad just because
a lot of people saying Python is good so
Java says node.js for server I would say
please website I would say go for
node.js but it gives enterprise network
I would say Java is best okay
online course is for spring boot yes
springboard visual videos will be there
in May available in June I guess but I
thought now you can join the live
courses okay when you see a manage is in
in this month itself so it won't end up
getting mileage okay next question is
any plan for Kolkata meat as of now no
because I have some work in Hyderabad I
thought other have some personal work
banggood I have a
Trading wouldn't have a training so
that's why I'm going to visit these
three places
Kolkata I don't come there for training
so I have to separately take out a time
to come to Kolkata for a meet-up
sure they will try you know I'm also
looking for maybe if I get a college
request a training request from Kolkata
from some college for a seminar I would
show as I try to visit okay well as of
now I'm getting a lot of requests from
Bangalore for training so I'm going to
Bangalore okay okay okay so that's it
everyone okay sir Gordo says go live on
knowledge I'm thinking of that I'm going
I'm thinking about going live on my
marriage but it will it will not be on
this channel this is a vlogging channel
right so I'll be doing that on I mean
ready so just to keep things separately
a separate thanks Sara
okay okay
Kapil a no idea but it I heard is a good
good thing too good tool to work on oh
not not Bangla that's why it is bugaloo
Bengaluru yeah
okay so Kalyan Singh is which video cam
are you using now I'm using iPhone there
so I'm using an iPhone okay I don't know
how can you show I cannot show you my
mobile phone so I'm using a tripod here
and on the tripod I have a camera that's
okay this is an iPhone and I'm using a
mic so that's that's normal setup I'm
not a big fan of having gadgets I do
have a DSLR but I feel mobile iphone is
better okay okay so my hair says what is
DevOps in one statement I would say
DevOps is a culture that well say there
was a give up is a culture where the
operation team and development team work
together so you should have having two
different teams because there will be a
communication gap right between
developers and operation team and if
something goes wrong while deploying
developers should know what is going
wrong you know who made the mistake so
it's it's all combined so developing
team and objective working together
that's the ops so it's not a technology
it's a culture which company follows
nowadays so you are
some motivational speaker - is it thank
you so much cool guy okay so can you can
be attained your pune training on which
language Oh so when I go for training I
go for company training you know and so
different companies they call us for
your training so other people are not
allowed in the company so that's the
thing if you're working for a company
which I'm going for of course you can
attend the training they love you
okay so the last five minutes everyone
signing off it's a tight time I have
some project to complete so that I can
go first go to a nap
okay internship what about internship
with a disco for friend ended up mine
you say it's a la something in last
session yes I want some interns provided
you know angularjs prodded you know just
it maybe I need not just ever love Jesus
anyway technology will do if you take
new GS or anything will do and but even
if I take internship that will be in the
month of me okay so nobody says are you
okay I mean my teachings past Allah no I
know Scala but then not so much so that
I can teach it in a right pose okay so
McCool say so is it learning restful
Jersey today will help me after one year
to get a pass from college of course why
not because if you know rest api because
nowadays i mean i don't think people are
using jersey they are using spring
framework to implement let's say p i but
if you even if you know slash with
jersey it will beat will give you a
quick good foundation nickel says will
there be more data structure videos yes
but you know aren't feeling am NOT that
comfortable data structures i'm trying
to complete the other stuff which I'm
comfortable with but yes videos will
become video will be coming for data
structures I will not be stopping it so
that's it last one question let me pick
up one question here okay so is it is it
necessary to learn DevOps if you are
learning AWS yes I would say DevOps is
something you have to learn now is there
is no option you should be learning
DevOps it's not that difficult by the
way it's all about the culture you learn
and you cannot simply learn divorce in
one day it takes a culture it takes
you know it tastes it's it's a procedure
which you have to understand and it will
take some time so I would say spend some
time on DevOps is not difficult again
it's very easy okay so that's it
everyone signing off
that's what I want to talk about today
oh this one lipid question if we use
someone else content in an alert
application then due copyright claim
comes yes if someone someone says that
if someone reports that you are using
their content of course you're grading
your carpet right then

want to connect tomorrow so tomorrow I'm
going to go to college in Mumbai so we
