about left shift and right shift
operator now at exactly left and watch
it operator so I just it's also a bit
wise operator somebody's left shape so
let's say we have a variable which is a
and the value for a is let's say 15 okay
let's make it a bit easy let's take the
value as 8 so if you're a values H and
I'm creating a new variable which is B
and a and we are using our left shift
operator or a by 2 okay now when I apply
this to so first we have to find the
binary format of 8 which is 1 0 0 0
which is 3 0 so this is 8 right whether
you apply a left shift operator this
left shift operator will shift this
number by 2 bits because you have
mentioned 2 here now when I say it will
shift by 2 bits so we let say we have 0
0 0 it will append two more zeros you
just imagine we have our dot here so it
will come to this point and it will add
two more zeros so this is your new
number and this is mrs. how much they
started to write to this number here it
represents 32 so if I try to print the
value of B it should be 20 do so let's
say let's run this and it's trying to
write this this is how you work with
left shift operator but it only append
the 0 or it will append 1 whenever you
use the left shift operator it will add
extra zeros okay not 1 so that's why you
are getting the value as 32 let us talk
about right shift operator in right
shift operator let's say your values
again 8 and if this time you're using
right shift so you are going inwards so
what we'll do is we'll have this value
which is 1 0 0 0 and then we have a dot
so whenever you use right shift it will
send this number to bits this side on
the right side so it will skip this to 0
right half the value will be 1 0 which
is 2 and if I run this code answer
should be too
simple right so that is the I checked
operator let's change the number let's
make it 25 so if I use a number 25 which
the body format for 95 is double 1
double 0 1 and when you apply a right
shift operator by 2 bits it willl is it
will lose this 2 bits so it doesn't
matter if that bit is 1 or 0 it will
lose this two bits so if you remove this
2 bits here the value will be double 1 0
okay because we are removing the last
two bits so the output should be so quit
1 1 0 is equal to 6
okay and when you have this code that's
6 so that's how you use left shift and
right shift operator so that's from this
video so do look if you have told if it
was helpful then like the video and do
subscribe for further videos so thanks
so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
