code more efficient so what we have done
in the last video is we have used this
method which is filter in which I am
passing the object of predicate now it
is predicate is the interface a
functional interface which takes only
one which has only one method which is
test which takes only one parameter and
it turns a boolean value so in this
function you can define any logic you
want like you can you can filter the
elements depend upon prime number you
can also let's say you have a collection
of students or your collection of
students in which you want to filter out
all those students who got maybe about
60% so you can do that also so we can
achieve lots of thing using predicates
now if you see if you focus on this P
don't you think we are using this P only
once so what we can do is we can we can
cut this part here and we can write the
same logic in this filter method and we
know don't need to use this filter or
predicate P now now if you focus on this
this this code here from this point at
this point now this predicate is a it's
a lamp it's a functional interface and
if you are creating the anonymous in the
class you can see that means it selfs
give you a solution it says this and it
anonymous inner class creation can be
turned into a lambda expression I mind
you this solution will be only available
in NetBeans 8 if you are using any
version which is below before NetBeans 8
it will give you it will not give you
that solution in fact it will not
support all these different API s so we
can convert this code into a lambda
expression so you can see from here to
here we have a we have a boilerplate
code so what we can do is we can rewrite
the code so let me just cut this part we
can rewrite decoding this way so this
takes our integer value and what we are
doing is we are checking that value is
mod equal to equal to 0 right that's it
we can see the same code you are here
and if I run this code it's working the
answer is 180
five clear so this is how we should be
using streams we should be using filter
we should be using reduce let's say
before before adding I want to multiply
each number by two again you can use
something less map this map will take a
value and will convert that value into a
double of it so we'll say into two
simple the answer will be our hope the
doubling each value the answer should be
it should be 370 and so it's 370 right
so this is how we can use a filter
method with the help of predicate
interface now if you focus on these two
methods don't you think this this sounds
like Map Reduce of Google yeah so this
is how Google works right they first map
all the elements and then they try to
reduce the elements so that the
searching will be easy okay so this is
how we can we should be using a
predicate interface then you will say
okay I don't want to but I don't want to
reduce I want to find the first element
okay so the first element which is
divisible by five which is twenty right
I want to play into the double value or
the value of that 20 into two so what we
can do is we can just multiply it by two
and we don't need to reduce you what we
want to find is we want to find first so
there is a in build method which is
called as fine first year so if I run
this code now you can say the output is
optional 40 but hold on what is optional
here now Java is very efficient it says
there is a possibility that in your list
you will not find any value which is
divisible by five there is a chance
right in that scenario I don't want to
give you 0 I don't want to give you any
error and that's why I am giving I'm
giving you the output as far as optional
let me show you let me say the values
are 688 and 99 now this values are not
used by over five divisible by five
rights if I run this you can see the
answer is optional empty which simply
means you don't have any element which
is divisible by five so it will reduce
the bugs in your code
okay that's why I just love this Java
new API with the stream API which
provides you many features it will help
you to reduce the number of bugs you
have so this fine first function will
give you the first value with the help
of optional but let's say I don't want
to print optional I don't want to put
into optional empty if you don't have
any element I want to print a value 0 in
case if you don't have a value so in
that case we'll simply say all else
videos or else it should print 0 so this
will find fine first if you don't find
any value it will print or else so I
fell on this code now you can see the
out answer is 40 and if I don't have any
element which is d by D visible by 5
which I say argument it will go for the
same value in 688 and 99 if I run this
code now you can see the answer is 0 so
this is how how we need to use a fine
first function and all else function
which if you're fine first failed to
pick up any value it will put in the
value which is 0 in fact you can write
any integer value here simple so let me
just change the value let me go back to
the previous values okay okay let me on
this again for the charity and you can
see the answer is 40 then question arise
is it this is it code more efficient
well we talked about that in the in the
next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
