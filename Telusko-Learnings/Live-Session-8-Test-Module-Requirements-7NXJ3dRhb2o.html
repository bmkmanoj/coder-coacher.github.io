see my screen everyone so welcome to
Paris core learnings okay so we are
going towards the fifth I mean at the
8th session again this is not exactly a
session this is basically the
expectations what I have on the project
so before doing that let me just do some
modification I'm sharing I'm swapping my
screen share for time being just hold on
let's everyone join this session let's
then we'll continue this session at a
time okay so we got ocean Ohio June
you'll just all this is go
perfecto so I can I guess we can share
mais so I can share my square now oh
here we are
so I'm sharing my screen I hope you can
shame us with that okay so basically we
are so I got so after the last session I
got some means in fact lots of meals
where people are asking about the test
modules so the things were not clear
what exactly I want in fact I got some
codes as well so I got a quote from
Shilpa and Karthik is still working on
that so let's see how thing goes and I
guess Dutchman is also working okay so
so this is this is a small session where
I will discuss about what I'm expecting
from use people what type of test model
I want okay so let me let me share my
screen with you or share my website with
you you can see if I go to a website in
fact we are redesigning the things right
so if I go to so here this is what we
are redesigning so we got test with
login okay in fact you're going to start
with this one soon as a test without log
is what exactly is happening is so we I
have the entire code for this project
you can see the request is going for
test dot HTM so mother's the request is
going for test dot HTM and if you see my
earlier project and this I have I have a
controller here and if I search for or
test dot HTM so I have a request mapping
done and you can see the request mapping
of test STM so this is the code which
you are working with so you can see we
aren't calling test dot JSP again you
can just ignore those weird names I know
this is not a good way of naming your
jasa file but this is what we have done
in the last in the in the last project
it's not always the case right you will
use proper names sometimes you are
focusing more on logic not on names but
then to be a good developer you should
also focus on needs as well so shop
saying test dot JSP should be test dot
JSP
so I do have this file
this project is the earlier project
which we have done the last at last in
the last year so this is what we are
trying to redesign so again in the same
module I want to redesign now test
without module is actually a model where
you will get the questions from the
design file again without login means
everyone will get the same portion it
doesn't matter who you are when you go
to the website and when you try to keep
a test it will be same for everyone each
and everyone will get the same questions
so this is basically a this is basically
static questions which you get now where
do we have the static question so if I
open my developer studio
if I open SRC and mean I have a page
called a stash the DOJ's which with
people s there so if I open that file
which is test or JSP which is here so
this is the file which you are getting
and because of this file so because of
this file you are getting all this I
mean you are getting all these questions
now question arise from where you are
getting this question so as you can see
here ok as you can see here where is
that ok you know if this so much of
design in this page and as you know I'm
not I'm not done with the design okay
based on res dar is the twin study
questions
okay let me search for the static
questions okay I guess I lost them
okay okay
searching for those fatty questions here
yeah so as you can see this is the
questions we have so in this question
controller you can see we are sending
questions as well I'm sorry sending
questions here so you can see we are
sending questions okay okay so we are
sending a question here and from this
questions it is going to JSON file and
in this Jason we are fetching all these
questions again everyone will get the
same questions because that's how we are
fetching questions from a database okay
so you'll be getting this questions and
once you got this question a decent file
which is your decent one dot adjacent
file you can see we aren't fetching all
the questions here using jQuery and the
moment I click on the next button if I
select you here I don't know what's the
answer for this if I click on new you
can see the question is changing all
these questions are going on because of
this code here so that means to complete
this test module there are different
technologies should be familiar with
there should be familiar with Java
because you need to Siri to send
questions using Java code you will be
showing those portions with the help of
jQuery and every time you click on -
next - every time you click on previous
item if you click on submit that's how
you work that's you you work with jQuery
- to pass all those portions so as you
can see when you click on the next
button you know you change the questions
you depend upon okay first of all when
you change the question you have to also
fetch which answer was TechEd maybe
first on second also depend upon which
one was checked and ok and this is where
you are submitting the data to this
server where is that ok so ok this is
where you are submitting this data the
server so you are sending the data to
the server but then to send the data to
the server so it will send the data you
what you can do is you need to generate
adjacent file by yourself so you have to
send the data to the server using that
isn't quite example if I go to this test
you can see when the test gets over you
are calling verify one dot HTM by
passing the entire JSON string now this
JSON string goes to the server and on
the server it will verify for the pretty
of a question what is the answer example
for question number 143 I'm sending the
answers to for question number 1 0 1 and
so on you can search to I mean it is
possible that you do have different
questions forum into different answers
now if this answer is right you will get
this food otherwise you will not get
this code now where do i where are you
verifying that your answer is right or
wrong so again it is verified on the
server so as you can see I am sending
for verified wonder HTM that means on
the server side we have a controller
which is verifying this this question ok
so when you make this project make sure
you also implement all this things so I
don't know how many of you are actually
working on the project here
but ok again I have won mine I won my
announcement for the future sessions the
you can watch this live only if you are
a part of a group ok so from the next
session which is on Friday we are going
for a we are going for unlisted or live
sessions where only only people will be
having lengths can see that so the way
you can get the link is by getting into
a group so the group name is that is Co
live project so go to Facebook and
search for that is for live project and
connect with that I mean try to connect
try to I mean send a request to the
group and we will accept your request if
you want a part of a group then only you
will get the link ok because I don't
want to trouble everyone I don't want to
trouble each I mean all the subscribers
on YouTube so I'll before
those people who are in the group so
only those people will see the length
okay this is the last public public
video which I am making now okay so this
is what I am expecting from you people
you need to work with Jason so when you
send a request this request would be in
JSON format I mean the data you are
getting from the server will be Jason
format you have to pass though JSON file
using this page and once you complete a
values a bunch of click on submit you
have to send the question using you to
send the question using a using JSON so
all the answers will be submitted with
the help of JSON only so this is the
point if you remember and please if you
are working on this let us know do
connect with our group or do connecting
with the group and do connect with our
interns they will help you with this if
you are facing an issue so that is for
test without login if you are planning
to go for test with login the only thing
is if you want to give a test using
login you have you need to also create a
login and registration thing so for
login registration we have certain
fields so you can work together you can
work on both the things again this today
we are not do we will not be doing any
code today the actual point will be done
on Friday let's see how thing goes if we
can complete the code by Friday we'll do
it on Friday otherwise we'll move to set
it and let's see how it goes you will be
getting the updates in the group about
the next live session so if you want to
join the live session just go to
Facebook and search for periscope live
project this is the group we have
and just be a part of this blue if you
want to get future updates
okay so just what do you go to Facebook
and search for this search for this
group and send a request to this group
and so we will accept your request okay
so okay so let me just go back here okay
so I was talking about the registration
and login right so wait also create a
luggage registration and login page let
me give you the fields here for
registration the things I'm expecting
from a user is if a user I try to
register a user will enter a name of
course name is important right then
we'll ask for mobile number so that we
can trouble them by calling the just
kidding so we'll need a mobile really
impolite email ID will need password now
the only thing is I don't want to see
the password the actual password because
some people they do use their Facebook
password as my website password and if
you are showing that data in a passive
format again I can hack your Facebook
account right I don't want to do that so
make sure you use a concept of hash hash
hash functions but whenever you accept a
password convert that password into hash
code or hash function with the help of
md5 now if you don't know that just
explore that how to use md5 okay so we
earned if you have better solution let
me know how to protect your passbook
personal I mean your passwords
I need data both I need Institute name I
mean instead you dream or maybe which
company you're working for we need
qualification what currently your
qualification is and then we need a
state in which you live and we need a
country now if you might be wondering
why I need all these things it's because
after the test after the test module
will be also going for what you say a a
report thing or which would you say
graph example if you are giving lots of
tests so hey we also need one more thing
I forgot about city as well I mean we
also need City here
okay so we need all these things now why
I all I need all this thing for the
installation is because let's say after
giving lots of tests and we want to
check the performance so you can put you
can check your performance based on the
region example maybe there are I mean
your your score in the in your
particular city let's say in Mumbai who
is the top scorer in India who is the
top scorer in Maharashtra is the top
scorer right in this week who is the top
scorer
so we'll be showing all those graphs and
trust me trust me it works so maybe in
week wise month wise cpy state wise
country-wise and Institute wise example
you know if you are if you are studying
in some college if you're showing in
some college you want to compete with
your friends as well we can do that we
have we have trying to do that as well
okay so okay so this is the website
which we are trying to redesign so also
have a look on this website which is
here so once we have provided log the in
situation you have to also provide the
login form and when I click on sign in
so when you click on sign in you can see
you have to start the test so this
question will be coming from the server
now this is not that easy as your thing
the questions will be very personalized
because since I am the user I'll be
getting the questions which I am
eligible for if you are new to this
batch you will be getting I mean if
you're new to the website you will get
all the basic questions because that's
how the system is working again one day
we'll just also discuss how to fetch the
questions based on what level but I mean
we are working with this thing so let's
see how it goes and so you put four
graphs I don't know let's let's see how
we can implement graphs in this design
and that's why I need your help if you
if you know how to create a graph in
HTML just let me know so that we will
implement that as well so I hope I have
answered your questions which you are
asking me in mail and on Facebook or
other platforms so just make it work
let's see bye bye went by Friday or bye
in fact send me the code by tomorrow
itself so that it can merge because it
sometime for the integration as well
right so if possible send a code by
tomorrow so that we can make it work and
we will go live on on Friday
okay so we'll be doing the actual coding
of this on Friday just do letters I mean
do let let me know your feedback on this
how we can do this any kind of help will
be any kind of things will be helpful so
that's it from the live session okay so
yeah that's it all it so let just come
submit the code and if you want to
submit the code if you don't know the
account so the account is the I mean if
you have to send your poll to our email
id which is the Cisco live project at
reach gmail.com so send the code here so
we will verify and we'll send you the
we'll do the live session on Friday
anything else where this goes so that's
it that's it from the live session
everyone have a great evening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
