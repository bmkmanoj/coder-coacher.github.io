Wendy and in this video we'll talk about
abstract data types now if you have two
concepts here one is abstract and one is
data types let's focus on to the second
part first now when you talk about data
type it's all about data right so we are
living in a world of data and we are
talking about data structures so if you
want to store a data in your computer we
have to use a concept of data type
because if you want to store that
somewhere in programming we say that
somewhere as a variable so if you you
store your data in a variable and before
using a variable you need to define or
declare whatever variable you want to
work with now when I say what type of
variable so you want to store maybe
integer format maybe numbers you want to
store maybe a string you want to you
want to maybe you want to store a
character so depend up on different data
you specify different variable types and
those types are called as data types
because they turn I will help you in two
things first it will define whatever
data you are working with and the
associated behaviors or the operations
you want to work with example with
integers you can perform addition
subtraction division that's not the case
with string variables right you cannot
perform subtraction operation on strings
what you will hear when you say
subtraction on strength doesn't matter
so in integers we can perform these
operations so with data type you can
define these two things the first is the
type of data and second the associated
operations with it now this variables or
this type can be a simple type so it can
be a complex types in some programming
language we say that as a primitive
types example int float a float is
basically a point values we can have
character so these are called as
primitive data types it can be also
complex example I want to maybe I want
to create a variable of a phone now
phone will not have a simple value right
it will be having different properties a
phone will have a size of a phone the
price of the phone the brand name so all
this comes together to be able to be one
variable and that will be called as a
complex datatype right because we cannot
simply specify int or float there so it
becomes a complex one in different
languages we have a different way of
implementing it example in in c
programming we have struck structures in
in Java C++ we have a concept of classes
in C shop as well we have a classes
console
so we can do that with the help of
complex data types so we can create our
own type of data there and the problem
is normally when you practically when
you work on programming we normally have
huge amount of data that's why we say
data structures right we have maybe
maybe having huge amount of data and you
want to apply some algorithms now if you
have huge chunk of data you will be
putting all those data together right
and we say it's a collection of data now
using some programming language like C
or C++ B if you have a concept of a days
so in this array it's a continuous
location of memory right so if you say
add your five elements it is a
continuous five five elements and you
can put your data there but then with
this we also have some abstract data
types now okay what is the abstract that
we'll discuss and then some time but
then we also have abstract data types in
some languages example we have least we
have stack we have Q and we have map
this this thing which is least stack and
queue and map they are called as
abstract data type now that data type
makes sense right because they are of
different data types so needs
differently to type stack is different
again we'll talk about that in detail in
the subsequent tutorials but now we
let's focus on what exactly those things
are so that you can implement it later
whatever therefore is abstract it's
because this concept are just concepts
and every programming language of a
different way of implementing it example
in Java we have linked lists and we have
add a list so they have a different
implementation in different languages we
have a different implementation for this
concept and that's why we say this is
abstract this is just a concept now if
you really concept it will be helpful
for you in future if you are switching
to some other languages they have the
free implementation but at least you
know the concept so let's talk about
this least first now it is least if you
want to have a collection of data with
you and with that collection you want to
perform some operation example you maybe
you want to insert data you want to
remove data and you want to update data
if you want no you cannot maybe update
or you want to fetch it so updating
delaying fetching inserting you can do
all those operations on list so it's a
it's a bunch of position of data and you
can perform certain operations we can
implement that with the help of linked
list with very very awesome concept but
again
what is linked list hi patients will
talk will discuss that in one of the
video now that is simple right
what about stack and queue now stack is
bit a bit weird we'll talk about that in
some time let's talk about queue first
in real life we always work with queue
right example let's say if you want to
take a ticket so if you want to watch a
movie you want two tickets so of course
you have to join a queue there right so
of course whoever reaches first will get
the first ticket so the first first in
first out so this queue follows a
concept of first in first out so whoever
reaches first will get the first ticket
so that is first in first out this
applies everywhere so if you want to
take a ticket maybe if you want to
whatever you want to achieve something
you have to always supply a queue right
but why stag what is that and how it is
different from queue you can say stack
and queue are opposite to each other in
one term not with the names but then the
concept they follow stat follows a
concept of leaf oh so Q is fee for which
is first and first out
stack is leaf for which is last in first
out any example of this let's say we
have a stack of books so I have five
books here and if I put the first book
let's add our book and if I put this
ebook then C++ book then maybe Python
book and maybe data structures book so
which is the first book you can take out
of course the last book which you kept
there by digit data structures so that
is last in first out the same goes with
the place of plates so let's say if you
have type of plates so the first place
you can take out is the last plate you
have kept there so that is last in first
out now
how we use this in real life or in the
virtual world we have a concept of
recent applications right example in
your mobile phone as well in in computer
when you say recent applications the
moment you say ctrl alt tab it will show
all this in the applications right the
first app which you will see is the last
app which you have used so that is last
in first out again using stack we can
perform operation like adding element
removing element but we have a different
name for that example we have a we have
a thumper as push
so when you say push it means adding
data into stack when you say pop it is
removing data from the stack but which
element the last element which is which
you have inserted and then we also have
a peek big simply means if you want to
check so pop will remove the element but
if you just want to check it you can
simply simply use peek okay that's up
that's about stag so Q and stag are two
different concepts so Q is FIFO first-in
first-out stack is leave for last in
first out then we also have a concept of
map now we're map will be useful now we
talk about least normally to access that
element let's say if you have huge
number of elements here let's say we
have four elements and each element will
have an index value right example if
let's say this this is five six two and
seven to fetch this value element we
have to use index values and in this
body normal start with zero so it's a
zero one two three
but in issue of using index values can
we use something else can I use a string
example if I want to send huge amount of
data to the server so I have a client
and I want to send data to the server
every object we cannot remember all the
object with the help of the numbers
right example let's say if you have if
you are if you are friends and you can
oh you will not refer each other with
the numbers right you will say hey load
number 21 hallo number 25 or employee
number 26 you will normally refer with
names right in the same way in map if
you have certain objects here every
object will have their own own names so
you can say this is name r1 this is r2
maybe this is SS this is KY
so you can have any name so every value
will have a key so it's a key value pair
so this is your key and this is your
value so every key every value will have
a key so in order to fetch that value
you want you have to you should be
knowing the key right so that's the
concept of map so this all things which
we are discussing here they are called
as abstract data type and every language
have a different implementation example
in Java the hash prime implementation or
the map implementation is hash map right
and the least implementation in Java is
as a list or a linked list so every
programming language have a different
implementation so that's that's what
your the abstracted types are again how
to implement all these things
programmatically that we'll see in the
subsequent tutorials I hope you enjoyed
