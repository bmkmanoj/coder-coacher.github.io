ready and in this video we'll talk about
what is JPA and how to wave them in JP
now before going for JP there are some
prerequisites so soap understand this
concept you need to understand what you
need to know what is Java you need to
know what is how to work with databases
and how do we connect this to with your
Bob JDBC because if you don't know how
to work with any PC then this video will
not make any sense to you and having a
knowledge of hibernate will make will be
added advantage but that's fine even if
you can even even don't know open it
that's fine we can still try to
understand what is happening here so
Java database entity bc3 requisites
right and now we can jump into the
concept so before implementing it we
have to understand the theory of JP
right so what JP a is so JP a stands for
Java persistence API so what exactly
this means so let's get back to the
world of IT so when you say you are
walking in this IQ boil or technological
world we are walking with informations
right we are walking with data so
whatever we use it's all about data
right if using Facebook if you are using
whatsapp you're producing at the end of
as application as well it's all about
data right so your company is spending
so much of money why because they want
to work with data so if you want to work
with data you use office right in self
as we process data now those data are by
default temporary data because your
application is working with some data
the moment you close the application you
will lose all the data what you want is
even if you're a patient side shut down
you still want to persist that data
somewhere where do we post our data so
normally we can persist data in a file
or we can pass this data in a database
which is your DBMS or odd appearance you
can say maybe MySQL Oracle toast
yourself there's so many are given is
available yeah so question arise how do
we save the data so we have one way you
have a java application you have a
database you can you Teddy BC but again
that's what so many issues which ad BC
you know you have to fetch the data or
so normally in Java we work with objects
and then in the database well you have
those and columns how can you save the
object in data in the rows in column
format and that's why we have this
concept of ORM
so what Oh our NS or
basically means it stands for object
relational mapping where you have a
class so you have a class structure so
then that class will be having some
variables and then you have a table now
if you can compare your class name will
be a table name and your class
properties will be your table columns so
we can do that mapping there okay so we
have to use Oh Adam now
Oh Adam is a concept which is applicable
for different technology it is there
they fit dotnet we have for Java so that
different languages are technologies
with we can use other but the problem is
to implement ORM in Java we need some
tools right so when you say tools we
have hibernate is one of the tools we
have hi Pat is one of the tool we have
top things so there are so many tools
I've enabled so you can use any of this
tool then you can make it work
so using hibernate using iPad case you
can build Oh
RM application now the advantage would
be if you're using hibernate or any oil
and tool let's say you have an object
yeah so let's say that also you have an
alien object inside alien object you
have alien ID in your name and in a
technology for maybe you can also talk
about the salary of alien and which
laptop alien use or which technologies
working for give it and discuss about
this but then let's say you have alien
object and you want to store that alien
object editor base so in JBC what you do
is you fetch one one badge when you
store it that's not good
that's a little bit of a right so what
Oh Allen says is take the object and
save it into DW directly that will be
awesome
so to implement why don't we have
different tools so every company they
want to use over and now the problem is
we have different tools right so let's
say today we are using hibernate and and
their application is built using
hibernate
now let's say after 2 years you thought
ok I buy this has some extra features
and we want to use those features so you
could switch your application from
hibernate - I bet is is it that easy
maybe your application is built on top
link and you want to move it to
hibernate is it that easy to switch
between different bottom tool you can
switch if they are India if they are
using the same type of structure of same
specification unfortunately all these
tools they were having their own way of
working
they have endeavored independent right
and that's where this Sun Microsystems
they realize you know wait to have some
common standards and that's where they
introduce JPA which is Java was
API it is basically a specification so
all these tools maybe hibernate I better
stop and they will all be in they all
will be implementing JPA standards or
JPA specification so that if you want to
switch from I bet is to hibernate it
will be easier because you're just
changing the tool the implementation but
this specification is still same yeah so
that's the advantage of using JPA in
your project but yes if you are building
your application purely on hibernate you
will face the issue of shifting but if
you build the application based on JPA
it will be easier for you to switch
between hibernate - i betting's but hold
out when we have JPA
then why wait in hibernate now as I
mentioned JPA is just a specification so
if you want to work with JPA you do need
hibernate or Arbutus or any of this for
the implementation so if you are
building a hibernate project then you
are walking with hibernate if you are
building a JPA project then either you
are using hibernate for the
implementation all eye patches you
cannot simply make a JP application
without any of this tool yeah so happen
it is important even if you're using GPA
the importance of JP is if you want to
switch from one technology other to
other tools you can do it very easily
in fact in future if you are working on
spring booth applications and then if
you want to work with database we
normally go for spring booth JP so this
will be a first step towards JP in this
video so let's try to implement whatever
we have talked about now what am I do is
I will get a new project so you can see
my sprinter and at week a new project
you and I will say this is a mammal
project ok with maven it's not here so
let me say mavin I want to get a maven
project and this maven project I will
mention I want to create a QuickStart
project because I'm not building a web
application here will sir next ok so it
does take some time to done it from the
Internet yeah so it is asking for the
group ID I will say nobody is combed or
telescope and the project name I will
mention is JP a demo I can you can have
any project name doesn't matter
click on finish and you can see record
our project here now in this project
what I want to want what I want to
achieve so it's very simple
I just want main methyl yeah so I went
to class which you have main method so
that I can do on the application so even
before connecting with anything I just
want to verify if this phone works on
this Eclipse works that's it that should
be a first step
something certain has a job application
and it worked you can see we got hello
world but then I want to implement a JPA
type of thing
now of course to save data somewhere
because JPA will be helpful for Sarah
Gadon right so we need a database and
fortunately I do have mask you'll hear
installed so you can see in my machine
I'm using mask you can use any DBMS you
you want that's completely fine you can
use poast piece you can use Oracle there
will be some modification we can handle
that so I am using masks you are
specifically I'm using masks will
workbench to handle my mask you again
you can work on command as well if you
want it but on break I'm a good big fan
of GUI so I have a workbench here and
the return is name which I paid it is
Naveen entire database I have a table as
alien so have already done this before
hand so that you know I will not waste
much of time in the video so in this
alien table I have those five records
you can see we got one I mean Java to
watch other big data three debit dotnet
and fourth Anna PL MN not ml and then
turn off Michael so we have this five
entries there
now I want to fetch this data using
application or maybe I want to store
some more data so what I will do is I
will go back to my Eclipse and I want to
create so first of all to fetch that
data since we are using o RM tool you
need to also have a class which will
represent the table so let me create a
class for you here so I'm going through
here I will say new class and this class
will be alien and the second finish so
we've got our class and then in this
class we just need to mention those
three properties so if you compare we
have a ID we have a name and we have Ted
let's do that so I will say private int
a ID then private watch string a name a
name and then private string tag so I
hope we only have three variables and
that's why we have three variables we
have a ID a name and tag so your columns
will
your variables in the Java class and
then these three variables need getters
and setters or the right-click here I
was a source generate getter setters and
okay so we got our class and record our
gate as it is we also need our two
string method so I will say so's
generate two string so that if you want
to print an object you can print the
values of waiting show up into the high
school okay so we got our class here
that's that's cool right now what I want
to do is I want to get that object of a
lien or maybe I will try to fetch data
from the database so what I want to
achieve here is we already have those
five requested right I want to fetch the
data from database is it possible let's
try so what I will do is I will say
alien a equals u so when I fetch I want
to specify some ID right so I will say
hey i want the alien with name of it ID
which is three yeah so when I say three
it should find David and dot that but
will it work so I would say hey JP a
please gave me a nyan object with ID for
now or no not for three now will this
work of course not right B Allah we are
working on java technology this is not
Java this is normal English right how
can they implement that here so to work
with JP a we have to do some settings
right JP a is not a Superman right we
need to want me to make it understand
what you're talking about so how many
use JP here so there further care to do
some settings the first thing is JP a
has this special method for us find now
in this point you simply have to mention
for and then you have to also mention
the class name so alien got class and
then you have to mention four so find is
a method inside JP a you have to pass
two things the first one is the class
name the type of data you're you're
fetching and the the ID which is four
but can you simply call a method without
a class name of course not right
whatever we have learnt job in Java till
now as if you have a method if you want
to call it from a some other class you
need to create object of it all if this
particular
you can simply use the last name how do
we access fine here now to use this find
we have a special class or the interface
which is called as entity manager now
basically all the classes or all the
classes which represents our database
table in JPA is called as entities now
in fact if you have worked on databases
we have e-r diagrams right so all the
tables are also represented by entities
so alien class is an entity for us right
so to manage those entities we have any
D manager because in your application
you might not have one table or one
class you might have ten classes so ten
entities so we need a manager to manage
all those entities so yes we got one
entry manager but question arise how do
we instantiate it unfortunately this ID
sign that's an interface we cannot even
say nunu into the manager that's the
first problem the second problem is if I
say control space is not working you can
see I'm not getting the the the package
now the package is not there is because
in the maven dependencies I have not
mentioned that I want to work with JP or
hibernate so as I mentioned JP a is only
a specification right you need to
implement that with the help of
hibernate all I but is our top link
whichever you like
but I when it is will the top contained
in this list so I want to implement JP
they have a hibernate so we have to make
sure that we do have hibernate
dependencies in this project and how do
we do that so I will open Firefox
browser and where's that it's getting
open and in this Firefox I will download
the dependencies for hibernate now we
don't have to actually a download one by
one jar file
thanks to maybe it gives you a concept
of maybe repository where you can
actually search for
hibernate so when you search for
hibernate it will give you a hybrid
depository in fact you can just go to
the website of rebel depository and here
you can search for hibernate even that
will give you the same same list it
which is not give you the same register
let's search for higher on it again it
is giving a different thing so you
see the first thing which is called
hibernate or in functionality okay if
you have seen my hibernating dash series
we have already done these steps yeah so
if you know hibernate this is very easy
for you you can skip this way to skip
this some steps and then go ahead but
then if you have if you are new to oil
and technologies just watch the entire
video so that you to make sense so
you'll just let pick up the latest one
here we go let's pick up the five point
two point eight and I will say copy in
fact let's say copy let's go back to our
file and paste so we got one dependency
for hibernate and the moment I do that
can you see that in rem in dependencies
it will download all the different
dependencies for you
now it's also depend upon your internet
speed how fast it should be mine is very
slow today is taking some time now by
that by the time it downloads it's the
hybrid dependency we want one more now
see if you work with MySQL you need a
mass per character right before working
with Oracle you need other connectors
different DBMS have different connectors
to work with and for this one we need to
use MySQL connected as well so every
time it gets downloaded I will search
for massive ohonta
the first one and I will download which
version I always prefer this table one
this looks stable there is no problem
with this let's copy this one and go
back to your paste and you can see we
got high by dependencies and in some
time we'll also get my SQL one because I
just saved it it does take some time to
get down with it and you can see we got
Moscow connector as well now once you
got these two two things we can simply
say control space now and you can see we
got regard the imports and I first
Center we got editor manager belongs to
persistence package yay so that's the
power of of these dependencies
okay now how do we care of it I went to
identity manager now unfortunately we
have to write one more step to implement
that to create onset of entity manager
way to create object of editing manager
Factory
so this follows a factory design
patterns you know all the all the latest
frameworks they all follow design
patterns it's all about design finance
so we need to use factories and pattern
here you don't have to implement it okay
- it or JP has done it for you if you
want to create object of entity manager
you need any divisor Factory
so let's say e-m-f any object will do
but in question eyes how can it rate on
the top entity manager factory good
point
okay so what we will do is these are
there's a method called as there's a
Pascal as process turns persistence dot
is it a plows or interface is it it's a
class so persistence dot the method name
is it's what get entity manager factory
no on this one is it created in a
factory yeah so the method name is
create entity manager factory and yeah
something here again what is that
something will I will I will tell you
that in some time but you have to pass
something here now once you've got
object of entity manager factory you can
create you can use that object and in
matter of fact when you can say create a
new manager okay so you just should
repeat what we have done we have painted
two objects I did the manager entity
module factory and now using e/m which
is the entity manager factory you can
say ii m dot find and you will get an
object so what do you think done this
will this work of course it should not
work because something is missing now
know where we have specified which DB
miss you want to work with I mean we
have specified it in a pom file which is
this this prom file here but then how do
your project knows that the app knows
which device you want to work with or
which database you want to work with all
what you're using is possible we have to
specify those properties somewhere right
but then now normally when you work on
different frameworks you know when you
work with hibernate JP a JP a with
hibernate or spring framework or story
work we do specify the contribution file
or the property files you can say so
here as well we have to specify some
properties where now we can specify
those properties inside SRC so inside SR
72 special folder inside
Java is it inside Java let's verify no
inside mean I want a special food up on
his sauces I will say fold up the folder
name is resources / and inside that the
folder name should be meta I and this is
the exact path you have to follow so it
is resources / meta Hanif and inside
this folder you need to create a XML
file you can make it specify the
properties now it's a new and this
should be an XML file yeah so let's say
XML because XML is a fancy thing right
and like we have properties files XML
files
thanks to Spring Framework we also we
have Java based configuration so I will
say persistence dot XML and here we have
to paste that we have to use that XML
code now in XML you can specify your own
tags I mean the framework will have
their own tags so in JPA we have a tag
on its persistence and in that
persistence tag you can mention a
positon unit and you can mention all the
properties what I'm talking about this
thing so if you specify properties or
persistence and inside this procedure if
you have a positive unit now why unit is
because let's say if you have multiple
settings you might want to work with
different setting for different
applications or different behavior at
different time so you can specify a
different position unit and you can
select one at a time example this
properties they have a unit name as PU
you can create another one as PU 1 PU to
appear you can create multiple positing
unit and then here you have to mention
these properties so we have our driver
name we have a URL user name and
password now once you have specified all
these things let's go back to app now
how do we link it how do we link this
code with our XML and that's where this
double quotes comes into picture this is
where you will mention your position
unit name be you can be anything it can
be ABC it can be my JP APU it can be my
P you it can be P doesn't matter right
but you should have you should have a
same name and fault aside now this work
everything looks cool right
let's verify so what I'm going to do is
I would right click here I will say one
ass job application
you can see we got eddo now what ll be
got is it says are they going to locate
per sister which is Ariel it's there the
class is available here why it's not
able to find it that's because when you
work with JP JP a bicycling works with
entities what is entity so we have a
class and they have a table so something
in between we have entity how do we
convert this glass into entity or how do
we mention that this class is not about
closet identity so for that we need to
use a special a negation here which is
called as a DTD this this is what will
make this class as entity and then we
have to use at ID which will be your
primary key because every table needs a
primary key so two things the first
thing the first thing is the entity and
second one is at ID
two links that's it now this world oh no
that's verify I will go back to my app
and I will say Ron and Oh something has
happened and we I don't know with it is
it successful the way you can verify
this by printing the object right so if
you don't this if you print it the
object you will give you the output
right and you got it can see that we got
our alien object that we got a and for
IDs for Anna and ml you can change the
value film for inside you can also view
value from the user I will say I would
say - and - I don't know who is that
let's run this and - is that simple yeah
so this is how you can save you can
fetch the value how can you save the
value because I want to one also want to
see how did we save it so what I will do
is I will go back here I will say alien
3 equal to new alien and then I was
visible some values I will say a dot set
a ID as it says 6 maybe I will go
forward 9 I would say a dot set a mean
as maybe
Maria and I will say a dot set 10 ok
which take is emitting now I would say
tech is hardware yeah and then once I
got this details how do I save it now to
save this it's very simple you can
simply say e F now to fetch
using find to say the metal name is
persist you're persisting it and you can
simply pass a and this should work let's
verify let's run this code and you can
see it is printing here but then is it
affecting database let's go back to
database via Moscow and ok so there were
some issues I just I was just solving
the issues that's when I insert this
inserted in your policy on ignore that
row and I would say it run this code
let's verify is it Maria then no we
don't have money other that's weird
now the thing is many way you want to
change data in a database we use
something called as you know we have to
as actions to manage acid acid
properties so here we before saving we
have to start the transaction and before
and after saving we have to commit the
transaction and the way you can do that
is by saying 'i am which is the entity
manager get transaction dot begin this
is how it was start the transition for
you and here we'll say e and dot get
transaction and we'll say commit it's
that simple
yeah i know the video is bidding getting
away then they down but then that's how
it works so yeah so now will it work
let's verify it should it should it
should yeah so you can see we got the
output but then let's verify in the
database here we go we got nine Mariette
Maria and we got Hardware simple yeah so
now let's see what it thinks they have
done we have syndicated an avid project
we created this app class of the order
ticket they already had that class here
in this we have kiddies I didn't object
and then took all this important one is
entity manager and then it image effect
way so using factor we can trade on it
affinity manager which is you to specify
the the persistent unit name which we
defined in the XML file again this XML
file should be there in the resources
folder
I don't worry I will push this project
on the github so that it will access
this project or you will find the
negatives description a description area
so that you know you can just pull it
and you can use it for yourself make
sure that you make those changes here
the d URL the user name ID pass will be
depend upon your machine
is Italian you can use identity @id and
then we have this property we have this
hibernate dependencies master dependency
now there's one thing how do we know
okay let's see if you want to understand
everything about JP because this is only
this is only one video right so what you
can do is I do have a place on hibernate
so if you want to understand each and
every step why I mean what are the other
possibilities we have identities can we
change the column name can change the or
what if you don't have a table can you
create a table by yourself you
understand that those terms when you
start when you start working 500 series
so after watching this video if you
enjoyed it different like button but
then also watch how it entire series and
then you will get the idea about all the
power of overlap tool the main idea
behind this video is if you want to
understand JP a this is how you
implement but then we can also do with
with hibernate right why you have to use
JP here it's because in future if you
think okay let's change I don't want to
work with maybe let's say if you don't
create a JP a project or if you create a
five minute project from start the
problem is in hibernate I have to think
what you do is hibernate code example
this two objects will be based on
hibernate framework or hibernate
packages
the thing is in future if you want to
change it you need to change the so
let's say from hibernate if you want to
move to eye biters or maybe top link you
have to change the source for as well
but if you look at this project of
project which we have built here even if
you are changing from hybrid hibernate
to I am it is you just have to change
one thing and that is your dependency
that's it everything remains same that's
the beauty okay maybe some other changes
as well but then that's so it it does it
require on the minimum changes when you
want to move from different LM tool so
that's the beauty about JP I hope you
enjoyed it don't forget like button and
