different aggregate functions in SQL now
if we talk about a table here so I have
a table called a student so let me fire
a query to know the data in student
class or shouldn't table so let me say
select star from table and if I execute
the query so I have a table with all
these rows and columns so I have for
those here excuse me I have photos here
one is student ID we have name we have
marks and we have age and we have
approximately I guess it is six of those
so when I say select star from student I
get all the data right but let's say I
just want to know the number of those in
the table so what I can simply do is I
can simply I can use some aggregate
functions now I skill office use some
aggregate functions and one of them is
called as count so we can simply write
select count for all the columns so we
can can count the number of total number
of flows with star here so it says
select count star from student from your
table and if I click execute the query
you can see the answer is 6 so in total
I have 6 rows so in order to know the
number of rows in your table we can use
count star now what if let me just
execute the query once again now if you
can see we have some marks here so we
have 15 77 90 so what I want to know now
is I know I want to know the name of a
person or the details of a detail of a
student who has the maximum marks so for
for that also we can use a aggregate
function which is called as max and we
need a marks maximum mark so we'll say
max marks from student and if I execute
this query you can see it is 95 okay now
since we are just writing max marks we
are getting the max max column okay now
let's say I want to know the minimum
marks so instead of writing maximum we
can write minimum marks and if I click
execute the
well you know so we are getting the
minion Marxian okay now let's say I want
to know the average marks of the student
so I can simply say select AVG for
average and we can mention here marks
from student which will give me the
average mouth of a student and if I
execute so does the average marks okay
so we have 67 point 3 3 3 or 3/1 most
people so now we know they are for
aggregate functions let's say I want to
sum up all the marks so we have select
sum and we can mention 4 marks from
student and IFI execute this query so
you can see I have total 4.4 that's
weird it's a 4 not 4 is the type of
error in Internet right
but anyway so the total number of marks
here is 4 not 4 so what next we have
let's say so if in total the number of
aggregate function is it is 2 so let me
just expand this you can see all the
queries so the number of hash functions
aggregate functions is 5 so we have
count we have min max average and some
okay so here this count star will give
me the number of rows in the table min
will give you the minimum marks max will
give you maximum marks AVG will give you
average marks and some will give you the
total of the marks cool now this is
these are the aggregate functions in in
SQL now let's say now if I execute this
query which is count star if I execute
this we can see it is written as count
star let's say I want to print as only
count so we can use something called as
alias so in alias if you mention
anything as the name and if I execute
this query you can see it will show that
name so let's say instead of printing
min marks if I execute this query which
is min it shows it shows it is min marks
I want to print as minimum so we'll say
as
mini-mom okay so now it will print
instead of printing mint marks it will
print Minnie Mouse I guess I got so much
better right like every sign instead of
printing a BG we want to printer as
average okay so if I write average and
if I done this query so you can see it
was written as average but let's say I
want to print as average marks now if I
execute this query you can see it is an
already error here the problem is these
are two different words right and SQL
treat excuse go SQL goes worthwhile what
word by word so we want to show this two
terms has one word okay as one thing so
we can use our double quotes here so
double quotes that specifies they are
together okay okay it's not working
maybe single quote okay so we can use
single quote here and if I run this
query you can see the title is average
marks okay so now you know what are the
great functions and how to use a Lea so
this thing here is called as a Lea's so
that is that's it from this video in the
next video we'll talk about some more
