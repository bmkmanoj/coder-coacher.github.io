have talked about we have talked about
annotations how to use annotations so
these are some pre-built annotations
available in Java right but what if you
want to create your own annotations so
what we can do is just to explain that
let me remove this part here in fact let
me remove everything from here except
this main method just remove all this
thing so let's try to understand how to
use annotations so basically when you
talk about annotations so we can use
annotations on class we can use
annotations on methods and we can use
annotations on on variables right or you
can say fields so if you want to create
your own annotation so let me take an
example here just to show you
demonstration here so just to give you
the glimpse of how to get on own
annotation let me get a class here and I
will call this class as Nokia a series
now as you know that Nokia is not into
that market of mobile phones in fact
they don't have there a good smartphones
now so we used to have so at one time
Nokia was damn famous you know every
food was Nokia phone so we used to have
those torch phones we used to have those
Symbian phones we used to have those
quad so those those phones where where
you have keyboards so in the center we
used to have this screen and on the
right hand side on the left hand side
used to have the keyboard it's more like
a joystick if I don't remember the
series name
I guess Nokia called a q-series if I'm
not wrong but so Nokia is very famous in
that in that terms but when it comes to
smart phone
Nokia choose to work with I mean to use
Windows OS and then they lost everything
so that that does a different thing
right so Nokia and let's say Nokia is
coming with a new series for this a
series phones and just to call
themselves as a smart phone now they
need something real so they need an
Android OS to call themself as as and as
a smart phone right we I don't prefer
windows phones and smart phones but
let's say we they are going for Android
phones now now just to specify that this
is an Android phone we can have the
add annotations here so we can say at
smartphone so if you say it's a
smartphone so if you assign annotation
which is at smartphone now this class
becomes a smartphone but hold on what is
smartphone this is an annotation can you
see that we are eating writing at the
rate so that means that's an annotation
and we are creating our one iteration
here question is how do we create an
annotation it is very simple so just to
create your own annotation simply use
add rich we can call it as okay so we
have to use a key why pagas interface so
we have to use a great interface so this
defines the idea of creating your own
annotation and we can we can use a name
we can say this is a smart phone
annotation so this is how we use
annotation and this is how we create
annotation so to create annotation we
have to use at interface smart phone so
this is an annotation in which you don't
have any variable can you see that we
don't have any variable here so this
type of annotation when you don't have
any variable will be called as a marker
annotation so annotations which doesn't
have any value inside it
we call this marker interface but let's
say I want to create one one value here
so if I say it will have a string os
name that's how we create that's how we
create a field so we say string OS now
this this has one field or one value so
this will be called as single value
annotation so when you have one it will
be called a single value okay we can
have multi value so let's say I will say
this is inch and it would be version in
fact it's better to write it in a small
characters will that will be better
right so we say this is version and
we'll give it on Becket's and a
semicolon okay so now this is this has
two values right so this will be called
as multi value annotation
so if you have if you don't have any
value it we put this marker interface a
marker and annotation yeah it is same
like marker interface anyway if you have
only one value it will be called as
single value annotation it will be
having multiple values it will call as
multi value iterations now how to
specify the values to it so in this
smartphone so when you are using the
annotation just give a round bracket and
specify OS is equal to Android and you
can specify a value I mean you can
specify the version and you can say this
is version 6 which is marshmallow right
so we are using a smartphone and it has
an OS which is Android and it has a
washer which is 6 so this is a Nokia
phone now and if we can call it a smart
phone because it has a notation of a
smart phone if you don't provide this
annotation then you cannot call this is
a smart phone now so by specifying
annotation we are saying that this is a
smart phone okay now so what if you
don't specify the values if you don't
specify the values you can you can write
okay if I remove that if I don't specify
the value we can use something called as
default values here so by default it
would be Android Oh will say by defy it
will be Symbian difficulty spelling of
Symbian may be this one and we can say
default let's say zero so does the
default version will be like say 1 0
will be not correct right
so if you don't specify the values here
it would be this values Symbian and 1
but let me just specify the value and so
if you specify the value it will
overwrite the existing value ok now so
that's how we create our own annotation
and that's how you can use your own
annotation but hold on how do we fetch
those values in the main class that will
