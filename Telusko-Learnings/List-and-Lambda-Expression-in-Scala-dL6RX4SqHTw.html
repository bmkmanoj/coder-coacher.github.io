methods in Scala let's see how do we use
how do we use what you say list of
values here okay now let's say if you
want to create a list in Java so this is
the Java console Here I am creating a
list and normally to use at least we say
list of integers and we'll say this is
Nam's equal to we say new at least and
then we can specify the values here
right so we can say that mean put the
package first which is you tell okay so
once we have got the package we can add
the values by saying num start add and
we can say value for and then we can add
one more value below we can say this is
let's say this is we can say this is
let's say eight so we can we can do that
right this is one way another way is if
you already know the values we can't
actually say well arrays dot as list
I just dot as list by passing some
values I can say 4 comma 7 comma 2 comma
3 right so we can pass the values like
that so we can use address dot as this
and we can mention the values here right
and how do we so this is this is how you
do in Java right now if you go to Scala
let's see in Scala how we do it so in
Scala we simply say bad Nam's equal to
we say least we don't have to use any
new keyword we can simply send these 20
we can specify 4 7 2 &amp;amp; 3 so the thing we
can do there is same as here so we can
write this stuff here we can say list of
values so it is you can see this dumps
this nums is by default at least of int
okay so that's how we could it at least
here now how do we print a list of
elements in this Java so to print the
list of elements we can use a normal for
loop or we can use enhanced for loop I
so normally an enhanced for loop we use
int int i : Nam's
and then we can print individual values
right so we can print I and if I'm this
code we could record all the values in
Scala also what we can do is we can use
a enhance for loop here
it is very simple to an how to use an
ounce for dope here we can say a for and
but in in Java we specify a colon right
here we don't have to specify a call and
we can use a a doll on the left hand
side and we can say this is numbs and we
can put our curly brackets here and we
can stop saying system product printer
than we will we only use print Ln here
and let's print n and you can see will
be getting the output here we can see we
got the output as 4 7 2 &amp;amp; 3 in fact we
don't require this kinda package when
you have only one statement that will be
because SCADA believes in less number of
lines right so why do west your number
of lines just because of semicolon so I
can write that in one line and you can
see we got the output as 4 7 2 &amp;amp; 3 so
that's how you use that's how you use
enhanced for-loop in scala we use we use
a left arrow here okay so in in java we
use : here we use a left atom now i
don't know if you are familiar with
lambda expression in in java we can also
use lambda expression here so let me
just do it in in scala in java first and
then i will show you how to do the same
thing in scala so let's go back to let's
go back to my Eclipse in Java now how do
we use how do we use a lambda expression
here it is very simple now to know more
about lambda expression you can just go
to if you don't know that expression
that's okay you can just go to the
description in description I have a link
for the how to use Navi expression for
for for lists of values so I will just
remove this part so in Java 8 specially
we can use num start for each now this
this only works in Java 8 okay it will
not work in Java 7 so I can use for each
and I can specify I and we can use an
arrow which is system oh okay that's
weird so I and arrow and against if I
can specify system dot out dot hey why
the circle is not working here
okay that's weird system dot out dot
okay I think I should type it here we'll
say system dot out dot print Ellen and I
can specify the value either so even
this thing works in Java safer than this
code you can see we got the output now
how exactly is working you can just go
to the comments like I mean you can go
to the description area and you can see
that but just to give you a glimpse what
happens is in Java
eight nums has a method which is for
each and for each takes the object of
consumer and consumer is a interface
okay so what we can do is here in the
code we can specify that we are passing
the object of consumer in fact I think
you should you should watch the video
the description you will get the
complete idea and stop wasting time here
so this assumed that you you can use now
expert here
so in Java eight you can use lambda
expression in in Scala also we can use
lambda expression so again the lambda
the concept of lambda expression came to
I think it came to it came to Scala and
it came to Java 8 from skylight self so
if you don't do the same thing in Scala
we can use non start again the method
name is for the each itself and we can
use I as we have used it on the log in
the in Java but we can specify the type
of I here we can say int and then in
shop using so in Java we have used a
single adder right we have used a single
arrow in in Scala we have to use double
arrow so we have to use a double arrow
here and we can specify I want to do
print Ln of I that's it so you can see
we are getting an error here why I'm
getting error that is weird
oh we have instead of using okay have
used or wrong brackets we have to use a
condom racket Co yeah so we have to use
a candy package not want not around
brackets so you can see we got the
output so we use lambda expression in
Scala also so I will I would recommend
you to learn about lambda expression
mode in Java eight first
before jumping to Scala so in Scala we
use equal to and greater than sign in
Java we use a arrow and I mean a hyphen
and a greater than sign so that's how we
use a list of values with lambda
expression in in Scala and Java so
that's it thanks so much and see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
