programming now and this what we'll do
is we'll try to print hello now or you
can print hello world now when you learn
any new programming language maybe C or
C++ or in future you feel learned Java
the first quotation right is hello world
it's not compulsory but programmers
believes it's like doing some
inauguration of programming language so
always start with hello world you feel
better you know so let's let's print
hello world so to print hello world what
we require is just a text colors
hello world so we can simply say it is
hello boy
now now if you want this text exactly on
your output screen so whichever text you
write this this type of text which
should print on screen or if you want to
use those type of words this type of
words are called as literal strings or
string literals that means all your
strings should be in double quotes that
means the exact thing should print on
output or your black screen now what
next you need now C programming follows
a concept of pop now pop stands for
procedure
oriented programming which means C works
with procedures or you can say functions
that means if you want to achieve this
task of hello world you have to print
this so there is a inbuilt function
called as printf now since it's a
function function always goes with the
brackets you have to use down brackets
for functions so func function name is
printf and then you have to use this
down bracket to specify it's a function
notice semicolon after every statement
in C programming you have to give a
semicolon statements doesn't means line
statement means a set of a line or a
statement like you can say apart which
should execute individually okay so this
is what you have to print
now now what we'll do is we'll try to
when you want to run this code what you
need next is whenever start with C
programming or maybe C or C or C++ you
have to define a main function now main
function act as a entry point to your
code that means when you when you
execute this code the entry point will
be main function and when you would
define a function you have to give this
curly braces okay so this curly braces
means you're opening a function and this
is closing the function now what next
now as I said this printf is the inbuilt
function which means the exact meaning
of printf will be saved somewhere now
let's say where you saved to check the
detail about printf you just have to go
to that word printf and you have to
press alt f1 control f1 so if you print
control f1 you can see it describes the
detail about printf now which where the
detail is stored
so this detail is told in two files one
is Konya dot H and second is esterday IO
dot H now this H extension means this H
stands for header files now what exactly
header files are they are the files
where the meaning of this printf
function belongs or any other function
belongs so what what it means whenever
you work with printf you have to use
those header files which are yesterday
IO dot H now as to D stands for standard
input or this IO is input output dot
header file now since we are working
with header files we have to enclose the
set of file name into angular bracket
and you have to use a keyword called as
include with this hash tag which means
you want this header file in your code
that's it we are done with the first
code so once you've done with the code
you have to save it with the help of
- and then to run this file or to
compile this file you have to go here
and say I want to compile this file so I
will say alt f9 compiled warden doesn't
matter and then let's run this code to
run - so the output you have to say alt
F 5 again you can see the last output
now let me just now I want to clear the
last output now if you say the output we
are getting not a palindrome hello hello
now this is this is what I have done a
day back now what I want is I want to
clear the last output so to clear the
last output we have a function called as
CLR SCR which means clear screen so
using this you can clear the screen
and let's run this week and I agree on
this code with the help of control f9 so
if you press ctrl f9 compile is turn and
well where's the output it's gone for a
milli second for one form 1 milliseconds
the output was there because the frame
was not able to capture it that means we
have to hold this screen the problem
with this is it's showing the output and
it is vanishing what I want I want to
hold the output screen till I enter a
button okay or a key so for to hold your
screen we have to use a function or
method called as get CH now get CH
transfer it is get character so it will
hold this screen until you press a key
now when you talk about this gets the
image let's see where this gets here so
ctrl F 1
now get CH belongs to our header file
called a scone you that means we have to
import or we have to include one more
had a file which is it's Coney au dot H
now what exactly this cone yo means cone
a stands for console input output that
means the output screen you get is
called as console and now if I run this
code you can see we are getting the
output as hello world simple right so
this is how you have to
type C code and you have to compile
using or you can die killed on it using
control f9 okay and the demeaning part
we'll see the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
