from today's call add links and in this
video we'll talk about hibernate caching
now if you're thinking that what is the
advantage of using hibernate instead of
using JDBC we are lots of advantages
right one of the advantage we have seen
is o RM which is object relational
mapping so is it the only reason to use
hibernate not exactly in hibernate we
have some more features which is one I
mean one of the feature is hibernate
caching now what is what is caching or
cache so basically whenever you want to
access the same data multiple times
issue of hitting your database every
time you can use caching right so how
exactly it works so let's say we have
our client here and then we have our
application and then we have a database
here right so whenever a client sends
the request to the application server
that request goes to your your database
server right so let's say you have a
client here and a client want to fetch
the data so what we normally do is we
create session object right so in
hibernate we have to create session
object then we have to use transactions
right so when you are fetching this
thing we need to use transaction which
is a part of session so what happens is
whenever you will a client signs the
request of the application server that
goes to database it will fetch the data
let's say I'm asking for select star
from students so if I'm filing this
query you can imagine how many data
we'll be getting it is not one or two
records because we are not doing any
filtering we are saying select select
star from student it might have 2000
records maybe 3,000 requests maybe
10,000 records so in this scenario when
you fetch the data it will be coming to
your application server and the from the
application server it will go to the
user so that user in that particular
session right but let's say if I'm again
in filing a query so let's say I'm
requesting the same data for the second
time from this for the same user in the
same session okay so in the same session
if I'm asking for the same records it
should not be so what it will do is it
will again it will again go today
so I'd be like it hit your database
server it will fetch data time-consuming
right so when you have done that query
for the first time it should be stored
somewhere so and you can I say memory it
should be there so when you when you are
this query for the first time data
should be there indication memory so
that for the second request it will
check okay we have the same query let's
go for the data here right and now this
cache a is provided by your hibernate
and this cache a will be called as first
level cache a okay so for the particular
session so this is one session let's say
if I'm using session 1 for that
particular session will be having a
first level cache in but let's say if a
user is changing this session may be the
same user is going for the second
session or we have another user who is
going for second session so we have two
different session now now this two
different sessions will be having two
different
first of all caching that means if s1 or
in this session one if you are finding
this query you have your data in the
first level cache of s1
now if s2 I mean the second session is
following the same query now the data is
not available in the first level cache
of session - so again it will hit the
database right so I can be how the
advantage is if you are filing the same
query in the in the same session - it
provides you first of all cache it but
if you aren't - defense session then
hybrid says okay you cannot use first of
all Cascia here then we have to go for
something called as second level caching
so basically it has two levels one is
level one and level two so level one is
by default given by hibernate okay so
even if you don't want to use it however
let's say say take this take this option
of using first of all caching right I
can how to do that that will say the
next video but this is how your first
level cache a works you know it in the
same session so let's say I want to use
second level cache a so what second of
all caches says says is it doesn't
matter how many sessions you have
all these sessions and the same
application can share the second level
cache it right now hybrid will not give
you by default okay you have to
configure this so first of all you have
to use some third-party library for this
so again when you say third-party
providers so we hide either we can use e
edge caching that is one of the option
or you can use o edge OS then we can use
we have one more we have swarm right so
we have all this cash available now
which is best
so everyone prefer to go for eh caches
so in this in this session we'll be
talking about e edge caching okay now
when you say eh cache you how it works
so we have to configure certain things
let's go for the first one so let's say
if I'm using a pH cache you have to
configure certain feels now what feels
we have to configure first of all since
we are using now so let me just create a
line here so first thing the first thing
we have to configure is your P om dot
XML file because see when you say you
are using eh cached that means you need
to download that library right so that
library name is e edge caching you have
to you have to download this cachet from
the maven repository you can go to
memory deposit you can ask for even e H
cache a you will get each other pass
then next you have to also download the
Josh file which is hibernate e H cache a
John file again for this this is for
integration so this is the this is this
caching will provide the features and
this will provide the integration of eh
and hibernate the next thing we need
here is so you have to configure your
hibernate dot C F G dot XML file in this
C by default your second level cache a
is disabled you have to enable it so you
have to add certain properties in your
hibernate dot C f0 XML file which will
specify that ok we want to we want to
allow or we want to give the permission
so that we can use second level cache
you have to configure that in hibernate
dot C a0 XML so first you have to give
the permission
can you have to mention who is your
provider so our provider in this case is
eh cashing both this thing you have to
provide in hibernate dot see a detour
XML file the next configuration which we
need is you have to change your entity
because by default not every entity is
cacheable so you have to provide two
annotations for that the first
annotation is called as ad ad cachet the
second one is in fact the first one is
cashable the second one is caching so by
by specifying that it is cashable that
you are saying that you can use I mean
this entity is eligible for caching the
second one is caching because you have
to flow you have to specify these
strategies okay there are different
studies available we have video research
again when we start with the practical
implementation you will understand what
I'm talking about but we have to provide
two things one is cacheable and second
is the cache a strategy okay so if you
can configure this thing you you are
using the second level cache it okay how
exactly we have to do that as we'll see
in the practical video but timepoint
remember is we have the concept of
caching and hyper tonight we have first
of all cache a we have second level
caching
whenever you go for first of all cache a
it will be in the particular session
because every session will have its own
first level cache it for multiple
sessions if you want to share data then
we have to use second level caching
now second level cache you for that we
have to use certain providers we can use
eh cache if we can use OS cache a we can
use swamp one of the best one is eh
caching so for that you have to
configure your pond XML file you have to
configure your hybrid file quantization
file and then you have to specify
cashable on the entity okay so that's it
that's how you use hibernate caching in
the next video we'll talk about the
practical implementation act but if you
have got subscriber channel do subscribe
and if you like this video to like the
video and thanks so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
