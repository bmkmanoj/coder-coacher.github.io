we'll talk about a patent so we'll build
is patent okay so now how do you have to
design this so we talk about this stuff
this have a pattern so of course we have
to use and now we have to use two for
loops are in fact nested for loops so
imagine this is a square box okay so all
this when you when you start with this
type of path and so always imagine that
these are a square box so we'll say this
is star star star and then it will say
this is star star and star this is again
start okay so imagine you want to build
this so for that what we'll do is we'll
use a for loop okay and then we'll say
this is int I equal to 1 so we have to
count the number of rows and number of
columns so we'll say this is number of
rows is 4 so the first the outer loop
will talk about the outer for loops or
outer the number of rows and the inner
for loop we'll talk about number of
columns so we said this is in J equal to
1 and J is less than equal to 4 and then
J plus plus right and this will print so
I will say it's out and I will try to
print only the print not print and then
I will print star and space ok and if I
run this code
okay well this code you can see
everything is getting printed in one
line but we want what we want after
every row so after every row we need to
take a new line right so I will after
the inner for double execution will say
print a line so that it will go to new
line and you can see we got that square
box which is this this square box here
but we don't want star we want numbers
right so what will happen if I instead
of typing of this star if I print the
value of J let's see what happens now
and if I run this you can see we got 1 2
3 4 all the values in the box format
it's because every time your inner loop
works it will start the value of j from
1 it will go to 4 okay and now what what
next now the problem is we don't want to
print the whole box we just want to
print this pattern here right after we
are done with this now we want to build
this
you know to get that what we can do is
we can just see we don't want so in the
first one we want to start from one it's
second oh we want to start from to the
third we want to start from three and
the fourth row it is full right so that
means the value of J will start from I
so if I values 1 it will start from 1 if
I values 2 it will start with 2 right
and if I run this code we got the output
but not in the format what we wanted so
what we want we want so here it is first
printing the value and then we are
printing spaces but in this scenario
first way to print this space here so we
need to print this space and we're going
to print the value so who is responsible
to print that spaces so what we'll do is
we'll take one more for loop and this
for loop we'll start with maybe I will
say K and the K value will start with I
okay is it will start we start with one
and this K will go till equal to the
value of I okay maybe less than I and
then we'll say k plus plus now this K
for loop is responsible to print the
spaces and every time was simply sprint
with without Ln will sprint it will
simply print a space here so what it
will do so when your outer for loop runs
it will run a for loop here who will
print this spaces so initially the value
of K will be one and I will be one so
this will not be executed so then it
will not print any space but in the
later stage again after that it will
print one here I mean one two three four
in the next iteration the value of I
becomes two so it will become two and it
will print one space okay and then after
one space it will print two three four
then in the next iteration it will print
two spaces and list goes on if I run
this code
you got this output quite simple right
so that's how you can get one two three
four here and if you want we can also do
one one one one we can print all ones
here you just have to change this J to 1
it will print one
okay so yeah that's it from this video
