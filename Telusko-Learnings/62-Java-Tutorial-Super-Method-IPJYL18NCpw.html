so now we know about inheritance we know
about constructors in this video we'll
talk about super keyword our super
method so what exactly super is but just
to understand that what we'll do is
let's try to understand the the working
of constructors when it comes to in high
trends and then we'll understand the
real power of super keyword for that
what I will do is I would simply use a
simple class name as a which I which I'm
doing from a long time so let's say we
have class a and we have class B and
both these classes they have a
constructor so let's say in this class a
I have a constructor which is public a
and I'm printing there so let's say this
is in a okay we'll simply say in a and
in Class B again I have a constructor
here which is public B and in this I'm
printing the same stuff which is in B so
we got Class A and Class B till now we
don't have any relationship between B
and a when our do is I will simply say a
Class B extends Class A so Class B is a
subclass now and a the superclass now if
I create the object of a so if I say a
obj one equal to nu a so now I can see
I'm creating object of a not of B and if
I simply say I mean if I simply create
the object of it of course when you play
it the object it will cook it will call
the constructor white which will call
the constant of a and if you run this
code okay so we got our output there
which is in a write that means when you
create an object of a you get the
construct it it calls the color of a but
how about if I create the object of B
now base B different right because B
extends a so B the subclass now so let's
see how it how it behaves when I create
object of B now when I create object of
a it calls the constructor of a but what
about B if I create only top B what
happens now will it call cost of B let's
try so if we run this code you can see
that's weird right we are creating
object of B but why we are getting
observing concept of a so that means
when you call when you create object of
subclass it is calling this subclass
constructor plus it is also calling the
superclass constructor so the concept
says whenever you try to create it the
object of subclass it will also create
the it will also call the constructor of
superclass so it will call the conceit
of superclass there it will call the
cursor of subclass ok that's why you got
in a and in B so this is the point to
remember whenever if anybody could adopt
of subclass it creates I mean it calls
the cost of super class and subclass
both now what I will do is in this two
class I will have two more constructors
and which will be a parameterised
constructor as we have seen that we can
create parameters constant right we can
have to construct in the same class
that's considered overloading right so
we have this constructor here let me
copy that and we'll do the same thing
here we'll say this is in a int so I'm
creating a constructor which is in a int
let me copy that and we'll paste it here
also and we'll drink in v8 so you can
see in Class A and in Class B we have a
constructor okay so you can see we have
we have two classes a and B and both has
two constructors our default one and a
parameter wise knife if I create the
object of B which is default one if I
than this code of course it will call
the default gossiped right
let me pass a value here if I pass a
value five so if I pass the value 5 it
will call the constructor which is the
parameter instead of B right but what
about the constructor of a will it call
the default one or will it call the
parameter wise one as we are passing a
parameter we expecting that it should
call both parameter right a and B both
parameter and if run this code it's been
different we got the output as in a and
in b int it's because whenever you
create object of subclass by specifying
the parameter it will call this
specified constructor of
subclass but it will call the default
character of superclass so it doesn't
matter what type of object you create
you're creating an object with parameter
wise one or default one it will call the
default constructor of superclass that
conducts there is something it will do
what if I don't want to call the
whenever twice I don't want to call the
default one I want to call the parameter
wise one how to do that so what we'll do
now is first of all let's try to
understand why it is calling a default
constructor so
we get that widest point default master
then to understand how to call the
parameter wise one so what happens is
every constructor so every constructor
in sub class will have a by default
method called as super so even if you
don't mention that even if you don't
mention super it will be calling I mean
it will be super there so if you don't
mention super then it will be there by
default it will be given by your
compiler okay and we have a super here
also now since we are creating a
constructor which is bypassing five
which will call the parameter wise
consists of B and it is calling super
when you say super super simply means it
will call the constructor of the
superclass
so when you say super and bracket it
will call the constructor of superclass
now since we don't have any parameter
here because by default if you don't
mention that your compiler will put the
default one which means it doesn't have
any parameter and that's why it is
calling the default one but how about if
I pass this I here if I'm passing that I
there what happens is this will call the
parametrized constructor of the
superclass which is the public a end and
that's why I put on this code now so we
got in a int in B in so when you create
a constructor by passing a parameter it
will call this constructor first but it
will not execute this this statement
here before executing a statement it
will call the constructor of superclass
by passing a value okay which is I I
mean so you are passing this value and
it is it is spending that statement
there okay and that's why that's how
your super works but how about if I
don't let's say if I don't pass a
parameter it will call the default
constructor of B right which is of
course when you don't mention the
parameter here it will call the deform
instead of B and it is calling the
Falken sitter of a which is this but
it's say I want to call the default of B
and parameterize of a what you can do is
I can simply pass a number here so if
you pass five it will call the parameter
wise one that's why the output you will
be getting is in a int and in being so
if you learn this code that is what we
are getting here okay simple so that
so you can specify a super matter so
this is super material</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
