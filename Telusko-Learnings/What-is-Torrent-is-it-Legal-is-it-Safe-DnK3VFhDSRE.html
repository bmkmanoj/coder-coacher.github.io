and today we are going to talk about
started last week I went to one of the
college for a seminar and during seven I
was talking about Windows versus Linux I
was in firming band you know as a
programmer you should be using Linux
instead of using Windows because this
gives you lots of tools which you will
improve your programming skills and then
some of the people got confused so meta
download dinners and how to install it
so I given them some tips you can
download it from Internet you from
Google you can search for Windows it
will take it to the officers outside of
Ubuntu and you can download it from
there or you can go to torrent and you
can download torrent from there you can
download torrent client and you can
download it now most of them was not
knowing what is torrent and then some
people were debating with me the
authorities illegal and yes you know if
you according to some news channel news
web some websites they are involving
that torrent is illegal anyway you see
what is the websites of torrent based
websites like the pilot day and they
have those notice there right so torrent
is legal or is it illegal so in this
session in this video we're going to
talk about what is torrent and how to
use it right so okay so this get started
so what we have first of all let's talk
about torrent when you started now
solvent is simply up for a fall okay now
if you do not know the spread of all
means but of course simply means some
rules and regulations so the entire
internet is walking with protocols right
we have HD protocols we have s d8
protocol we have telnet protocol we have
torrent protocol now what happens is for
different above service we have
different for the choroid example if I
talk about website when you browse the
website you always use HTTP protocol
when you download files we use FTP
protocol because when you deploy a
website you you you use some FileZilla
software using which you upload a file
right which is FTP then you share your
screen with someone that is your telnet
protocol remote sharing right so we have
different services every service having
depend for the call in the same way we
have one or protocol which is for the
stolen now what is different in done in
compassion
STP or any other protocol see what
happens this system actually have a
server and you have a client right so if
you have these two things server and a
client
what happens is every time of client
requests for a file request versus
server and server gives the response the
problem is there are some people they
cannot afford server cost example if I
want to upload a file I want to provide
the file to the entire world maybe I
have some software I have some videos
with me
I want to distribute them to the entire
world what I can do is I can upload that
on one server and you can download it
from anywhere the problem is I have to
maintain the entire cost right and it
will be one-way communication there will
be one server one client and it will be
not that fast right so so ok if you want
to achieve this thing to use FTP there
so we have a client clients will
download the files on the server using
FTS Witek all right
the thing is oh we have one more thing
which is called as telnet the advantage
was also not not telnet torrent the
advantage of using torrent instead of
having one server one client what if
every server every machine becomes a
server
I don't think about this stuff having
one server can you have 10 servers but
you will think okay we cannot afford one
so how can you afford 10 servers
what is this 10 servers are naturally
not actually servers they are normal
machine this would say like distributed
systems right we have we are
distributing these files but same thing
is happening here let's say I have a
friend named s Sam
now Sam as a file now the moment I
download this file so instead of only
Sam as uploader I can also be uploaded
right now if someone else want that file
that we harsh want that file
what Hersh can do is Hodge can download
the same file from from Sam and Sam
Levine right now the same file is there
with three people now we can have the
fourth person he can now use the pulse
on three people the awesome thing is we
will not I mean we all will be having
chunks of files right so let's say if I
file going to be one into three parts
one part will be downloaded from Sam
second part is downloaded from marine
and third part is downloaded from Hajj
so I so forth for machine will get files
from the three machines right that's out
on it works
it's a peer-to-peer network so I we
don't need a server we don't need a
client here anyone can be yourself
anyone can be uploaded anyone can be a
downloadable right that's why we call
such peer-to-peer network now you are
thinking do we
really use peer-to-peer network we do
use it approximately 4% of the traffic
the best traffic is done with the help
of peer-to-peer now you can judge it I
mean that's a that's a torrent or a to
go get foreperson just imagine how busy
it is in the entire world there's so
much there are lots of people they are
using torrent protocol
okay so FTP is simply we have a server
we have a client in torrent what we have
is we have multiple machines and I can
share data right and each machine can
upload each machine can download with
the help of turns for the call but the
question arise to use any protocols we
need some client right example if you
want to use HTTP protocol we put a
browser if you want RFC protocol we need
some software right example Internet
Download Manager we have lots of
downloading software side how can we use
toilet so to use a toilet at all we
require a toilet point and dice torrent
client is one of the very famous point
we have is micro torrent which is also a
do torrent which we call it as we have
big torrent right we also have using as
an how to pronounce expose other lots of
available there are lots of torrent
clients or whenever on the internet you
can download one of them and you can use
it right so using this this software you
can download the file right okay now we
have some special keywords here okay one
of the key what we have learned is
formal pjs after the call the second key
word which is called as cedars and
leeches now if it does if you have a few
have ever went to any website where you
can download torrent file you can see
that symbols that we have feeders and we
have leeches now what what do you mean
by feeders and nature what happens is
whenever you talk about upload or let's
say and if I want to share the file with
the entire world if I upload a file so
my machine is a seed ok so because I am
feeding it I am providing you this file
so I am this feeder but now if you are
downloading it you as a leecher because
you are stretching the file while you
are downloading the file so when you
download you you are leecher when you
when I put a file I become a cedar but
then can you down can you a download the
file and upload the file at the same
time to think about it if you are
I love 1gb and out of 1gb one of the
dembe's on is on a downloaded can you
share that same hundred down same 100 MB
with someone else it is possible right
so the same time a leecher can also
speed it right and that's why you know
when you download something from using
torrent you there's also uploading
process which is going on right so see
those who only sees who only provide
uploading part and leechers who download
and maybe they have a choice of
uploading as well right now some people
do call it as peers as well I don't know
why they don't disappear but that what
makes sense here is th white seeds and
leeches so feeders up top loaders and
leeches are downloaded right so that's
how that's how the entire thing works
here again you can control the bandwidth
how much you want to share right now
that's about tolerance how exactly
towards work so we have multiple
machines they are communicating with
each other but then question arise let's
say we have 10 machines and this 10 much
is associated in different different
location what is Mumbai one in New York
when is the very one in Singapore so
let's say we have all this machine
situated at different different places
now if you download a file how would you
know that somewhere download this file
right so what we have is we have a we
have a database college Strykers will in
that database will be having all the
track files so whoever I want to see
this they will be having their entry
there now I'm going to download that
file it will download because of that
type a database or data file right and
now question arise how would you know or
how will you get that that type of file
let's say I want to share my videos ok
so for Java I have 183 videos and I want
to share those videos in shops and
sharing on YouTube I want to show you a
different way so I'm a feeder so let's
say amphitheater
we have also first year who the theta
let's say you have one no machines a
machine so b3r feeder how would you know
that we three are seeded so again we
have a file in which we'll be mentioning
all the feeders ok
it is also done with the help of hash
code so we so every chunk of data will
have a hash code and that will be
tracked but in question arise from where
you will get that file and that's why we
have this awesome websites like we have
extra torrents we have big dot we have
okay we have Pirate Bay again not
summiting any of the total channel here
okay my main aim is not to promote all
these channels just that I'm giving you
those sequence right we have key cash
stolen TP remember now that that's
website is banned and the owner of that
channel or none of that website is now
in jail right
remember and only he might quite a bit
but then that there's a serious issue
right but then there are lots of
websites available so when you go to
those website when you search for files
you get a torrent file right and when
you open that torrent files with a
particular client example if you have a
big torrent if you have utorrent you can
open that file and it will download all
the things right that's how the thing
works but now personalized is it legal
the answer is yes torrent is not illegal
the torrent protocol is not illegal what
is illegal is sharing the data which is
which has a copyright see till now I am
talking about all three things right
example my videos are completely free
then we have other things with example
Ubuntu Ubuntu is free for all white
those things sharing those things on
torrent websites are completely legal
what is illegal is sharing the corporate
content examples as a filmmaker if I am
spending so much money is remember the
game of thones one of the series of Game
of Thrones even before reducing all the
channel the official that official
channel of the game of Thrones which is
HBO before that they have the the entire
series was available on tolerant so just
imagine this people have spent so much
of money making that show and what we do
we should be watch it for free famous
musicians they make the composer music
what we do we download the thing for
free there are people they are spending
their entire life maybe five to six
years for building a software and what
we do we crack it and reuse it is it
good thing the bad thing right it's not
just bad thing it's illegal if you are
doing that on torrent because 20 is the
biggest platform to share all the things
not just a pirate content also
pornography I mean just say my
how much content how much I know its
content we are sharing on internet again
is it right or wrong that's not the main
issue is just that the children's
nowadays they are getting exposed to
this thing
so in some sense using this websites is
not a good thing but then if you can use
storage in a good way it will be a very
very very amazing thing so what I feel
in stop banning those channels or
banning those website if you can just
you know filter all the extra content
which ones which are not needed
so you're banning the entire website
like quick cash which is kick-ass
doesn't what you can do is you can
remove the content which is not needed
it's like I guess they have done now so
these are business search engine causes
torrent to dot-eu I am not sure about
the website you can just go to the
website if you search for some copyright
content it will show you that this the
content the filtered is applied and you
they have removed all the copyrighted
content specially if you if you search
for Bollywood movies you might not find
it right so they are implementing those
things there yeah so that's about
torrent so first thing is torrent is
free it's good and it's legal the only
illegal thing is sharing the copyright
content the second thing is it is safe
now many many pages talk about safety
it's about viruses it's about Marvel now
especially if you are using Windows
machine whatever you do you have a risk
of getting a virus on your machine right
if you attach a friend if you attach a
pendrive it is a risk there same goes
with torrent according to a survey I get
30% of all the contents on torrent are
how they have malware ok so just imagine
when you download of download of free
content from pathology it might have
some some virus now question arise
should should be used on and know when
you have when you know that they have
lots of virus malware you heard about
ransom bears right it might also be dead
now question arise should I use should I
use torrent to download Ubuntu because
that's what I said I was talking to my
people right you should use tor which
you should use torrent or download one
too the problem is what if the Ubuntu
version which is download has a vital
now to verify this we have certain tools
what you can do is you can download the
ubuntu from
offices website or not folks I may be
from torrent and go to offices website
official website will have been have
some hash value take a hash value get
the hash value of the software which
have downloaded and top it I mean
doesn't match it if they both are same
you're good to go against the different
software's using which you can verify
the file which is God's on the over of
the tolerance is actually a original
copy or modular copy right solidifies
Windows I'm sure most of you are using
pilot copy of Windows specific specially
countries like ok I don't want to name
any country here but then we are using
pirate content let's say that the only
problem is if you are if you're
downloading Windows 8 or Windows 10 how
can you be sure that the OS which you
are using itself is not a malware may be
there are lots of competency in the OS
which has which are affected and what we
do we install these party 20 violence I
mean can you imagine you don't mind t
what else you install the pilot
antivirus and that's why the issue is
created void the maybe the Entenmann's
itself is part it is malware so okay
think about it and that's why I always
say use leaders bitch
maybe match maybe Linux Ubuntu right
stop using Windows presence that easy
again you had nothing against Windows
via the important thing is about Tony's
life so I hope you bought the idea how
tolerant works and if you have any more
concerns on toilet let me know in the
comments section and that's it do click
