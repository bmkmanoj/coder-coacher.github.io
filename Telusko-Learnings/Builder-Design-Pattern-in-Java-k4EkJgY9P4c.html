try to understand what is build up
pattern so let me write it is build a
pattern so this is one of the creational
pattern in design patterns in Java in
which it will be helpful for you to
create an object here so why we require
this pattern so just imagine we have
this phone and in this phone so let's
imagine you want to create your own
modular phone so let's not let's say you
don't want to buy a phone by company
like Samsung or Apple or maybe HTC you
want to build your own phone and when I
talk about your own phone you require
some configuration right you have to
specify maybe you have to specify the
RAM size or the as I am Emily you have
to specify the processors company you
have to mention the type of OS so what
we'll do is we'll create those variables
here so we'll say private OS which will
have your data about OS maybe Android
iOS or Windows and then we can mention
print with say and private and we'll say
Ram so how much RAM you have then we'll
say private or string the company of
your processor may be a Qualcomm
Snapdragon cocom maybe media attack then
you can have let us say one more we'll
say what screen size and screen size I
want it in double ok so it will say this
is double screen so say this is screen
size okay the next thing require is
let's say what what we check or let's
say we have we require batteries so
battery will be int format so by 2 it
will will be in mah format right which
is integer so it may be 3000 mAh it may
be 2300 mAh so we will be having
different different types and to create
this object or we require a we require a
constructor here with all these fields
so we so right click and where is the
constructor will say source click on
constructor which is here and will
select all the variables and click ok so
we got the concept or ID so in order to
create the object of this phone we have
to go to shop so let us imagine this is
my class we'll have to create this phone
object so I will say this is
phone P equal to what now we have to
save a new phone right and then we have
to pass all the values so we have to
specify the the OS type we have to
specify the screen size the battery RAM
everything right so what is the first
thing so you have to go back to your
phone you have to check what is the
first thing we have to mention that OS
right so that we can say this is Android
and the next thing we have to mention is
Ram so let's say this is a 2gb RAM then
again you have to we can also say
control space here and we can check the
second thing is processor so India but
double coach we can mention this as
Qualcomm then the next thing we have to
mention is what we have to mention this
as a screen size so we'll say this is
5.5 inch screen and the battery right so
let's say this is 3000 watt 3001 and
3100 mAh now once we got the object we
also want to plant it so for that we
require a two string method so we said
to string just to get the data we'll say
this is soz or to string and we'll fetch
we'll try to print everything and here
if I go back to my shop I will just
print the object and if I run this code
and record the output as the values
right so we got OS which is Android then
we got the RAM size which is 2gb then we
have company with of processor which is
call comm then we have this one the
screen size 4.1 5.5 and by three is 3000
1h right but if you observe this pattern
but if you observe this two classes we
are not using any pattern yet so if you
observe this this class we are passing
five five variables inside a constructor
out of five parameters an installer
constructor sometimes becomes come it
some time it becomes complex for you to
assign the value and let's say I don't
want to specify the time size I do not
want to specify the time size still we
have to specify something right we
cannot keep it blank because we have we
are we have to pass five parameters so I
do not want to pass a value and I do not
want to go into that complexity so
ensure that we can use build up pattern
now how that works so for that let me
let me make some changes here so
we'll be using this will be will be
creating one more class which is phone
builder who will be responsible for
creating that phone for you again oh
it's damn simple so what we'll do is
we'll take all this way all this
variables here in this phone builder and
with this phone builder what we will do
we'll be doing is we'll try to as we
have discussed in the theory so we have
we have source and then we'll write we
take all setters no Gators only setters
so we say all setters and okay now the
advantage will be a issue of void if I
mention it as phone builder object at
one time you can specify which
parameters you want to set so instead of
void everywhere just mentioned phone
builder instead of void will say this is
phone builder phone builder phone
builder phone builder which means if you
set the value if you set the OS as the
parameter the object it will return his
phone bill again how to use that we'll
see in some time so we say this is
return this okay because we want to
return the object and they doing the
same object here and then this and and
turn so we are trying this object which
is of one builder here okay
now the advantage will be so in this
phone builder we have this five
variables and then we have setters for
that and every set of returns the object
of one builder now in your phone shop or
we also required one more object here
one more method which is which will give
you the phone object so we say this is
public phone and we'll say this is get
phone and now what this phone will
return is will return new phone and will
pass this one not that one will pass new
phone and will say control space we have
to pass all these values right and from
where we are getting this values from
the from this part now let me let me
tell you how it works so let me go back
to the shop and instead of saying new
phone what I will do now is I will say
new phone builder so I am not using new
phone I am using phone Builder dot
I don't want to set all the values I
just want to set the OS I will say set
OS as let us say Android right the next
thing we have to specify is the so that
is that is the object you got then again
we'll say dot will say set let us say
ram 2gb tax it I don't want to set
anything else and at the end of this we
have to say get phone so you will be
getting a phone with a which is Android
phone with 2gb RAM and remaining value
will be default and if I run this code
even if you are not passing all the
values your Purcell's your specifying
Android you are specifying Ram you are
not specifying the processor you are not
specifying this will in size or not
specifying the battery so it will take
default values and let's say I want to
specify something now so we can say dot
set battery which is 3000 mAh and if I
run this code we got that 3000 image
there so it is that flexible right so
you can set the number of parameters by
yourself and the sequence does not
matter you can set the OS first when you
can set the battery you can set Ram you
can set screen size in any order so what
we are doing we want a phone so we are
creating object of phone builder then we
are setting the OS then we are setting
the I am resetting the battery and then
we are trying to get the phone so that
means we want a phone which is Android
we want the phone which has 2 which has
2 GB we want a phone which has 3000 mAh
and then we are called we are saying get
phone it will give you that phone okay
so is that possible because in phone
builder we are adding this method which
is get phone which gives you the object
of phone sounds good so that that is
your built up pattern in creational so
this this is a part of creational design
pattern so I hope you got the idea so I
will make sure you first was the theory
and then this method said that that's
that's from this video thank you so much
