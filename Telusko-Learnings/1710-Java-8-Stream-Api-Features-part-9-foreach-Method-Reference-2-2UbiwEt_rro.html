method which is for each in which we are
passing a method reference instead of
using a lambda expression so if I run
this code now since we have not done in
the last video so we'll see the output
is 1 to 6 right so it is it's walking
but hold on is rental is the only method
you can use here no we can use any
method so let's say let's switch back to
lambda expression here so what we were
doing is we are saying I : it is system
system dot out dot println and you have
to put in the value of I so this is what
we are doing the in the earlier
tutorials now let's say I don't want to
use I don't want to use your print this
print Ln what I need is I want to print
all the values into will multiply out
the values by 2 and print it so what we
can simply do is we can create one more
method which is static method public
void static sorry public static void
let's say double the value also with a
double it so we have a method which is
double it it will take a parameter int I
and what it will return is the return is
and it will return I into 2 now if we
are using a method which is double it
here and I want to call a method which
is double it so what we can simply do is
we can simply remove this thing and we
can call double it and we can pass the
value of I and if I done this code now
yes it is double it let's print the
value I into 2 so if we were forgot to
print here and we'll say it is void so
instead of going for end let's go for
void and it's on this you can see the
output all its doubles over 1 to 2 2 to
4 3 to 6 so by getting all the double
values then we will say is it the only
way to print it can we use a method a
frontier yes we can
so what we can simply do is instead of
fetching the value I and printed we can
simply say
I want to double it take all the values
and call double it but since this double
it method belongs to a class Java 8 demo
we have to give a double colon so that
we can say double it belongs to Java 8
demo class and now if I done this you
can see the same output so this is how
we should be using method reference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
