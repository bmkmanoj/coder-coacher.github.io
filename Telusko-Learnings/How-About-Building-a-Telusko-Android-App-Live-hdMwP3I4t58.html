Toys for landings and if you see this
channel we have so many videos right we
have videos on Java we have news on
Android we have on networking and if you
talk about Java itself in Java we have
different modules right we have Co Java
we have the advanced part where you have
Spring Framework where you have we have
hyper tonight right so we have all these
videos and recently last month we have
gone live for Java tutorials I mean I
was making my entire website again on on
this on live on YouTube light so I hope
you have seen those videos and it was it
was helpful for lots of people and then
I got some requests for analyze bird so
they were asking me when I will make
android videos again so it's actually
not possible okay so a lots are not
possible but then it is very difficult
for me to again go back to Android now
because I am working on Java frameworks
I am working on spring framework which
is spring itself is so big I working on
spring security spring boot spring data
so I'm focusing more on spring now
because I am a corporate trainer I mean
I work on as and as I interpret winner
right so I have to work more on spring
side but just because I am getting lots
of requests and also planning to
redesign my annual app which is already
been made now so my interns have worked
on this as you can see we already have
an app now let me focus on that and okay
so why did we already have an apple
knowing how visible it is there but then
okay I think it is quite visible so if I
click on this and if you want to learn
so again this app the old app is already
there on the App Store okay this is the
new app and we have made some changes to
make it more effective and design is
better than the last one
okay so again this is other development
now and if you can see we have videos on
all the different modules so whatever
video you will find on YouTube all the
videos are there here as well right why
this because there are lots of people
they travel they want to travel when
they want to watch my video so they can
do this again you can use it you have a
youtube app as well but right the sort
of distraction there so this is this is
what you say a non destructive
destructive or this practive what you
say doesn't matter right so if you can
scroll we have all these videos here we
also have a test module which you are
still working on that there are some
bugs there and ok so we have the code
module so this is what our
doing live okay now this live session
will be for those people who are new to
android so if you have already been to
Ehrman if you're already a developer
this will not be that helpful for you
but then if you are learning Android and
then you don't know how to make a
project because a lot there are lots of
tutorials on YouTube they teach you what
is Android but they don't teach you how
to make a project in fact I miss that
part in my in my life in my last year
videos on Android so now what we are
doing here is are we making this this
app live on YouTube so that you can
learn how to make an application right
now again I'm still confused to make I
mean to put these videos on that is
called learning so that is co pro
because we are planning to do that maybe
I'll be going for those for learnings
author is co pro let's see how it goes
if you can okay you have you have to
help me with this if you want this these
videos on that is called learning so do
share this video a lot do share this
video with your friends if I get a
enough number of viewers and subscribers
on this channel I will do that in the
risk of learnings odd if I feel there is
no much of growth in this channel I'm
going for the discord work because I
made lots of messages also because they
are getting disturbed by these videos
you know there are lots of there are
lots of subscribers on this channel only
for Java they don't want to annoy Google
Android because they don't want live
sessions so I have a pro channel now
where we'll be having humilate people I
don't want a much crowd there I want
limited people and then that challenge
the subscribe subscription channel right
and if you want because I have to
support other thing as well right I have
to buy this camera a good camera right
that you can see that all focus there
we want good lies we want good
background to make the quantity of
videos much better right and this is
cool challenge charges are very costly
you have to pay one lakh rupees per
month and that's all going to be come on
Troy okay
it's very less it's 95 a piece per month
okay and if you are paying in dollars it
will be two dollars right so it's not a
big amount for you right so it is an
interactive offer if you want in future
it may change right into actually it
will be to a 95 apiece per month and two
dollars right okay let's keep that aside
the main thing is I will making this app
but the question is using which language
as you know that now we have two
languages two official languages for for
Java we have Quadling and we have Java
for Android we have Portland in Java now
okay so which one to choose maybe maybe
Java because lots of projects are
already built on Java and then it will
take some time for the industry to use
cotton as the first language for for
Android still there lots of project what
about what is got published
there are 99% of project which are still
working on Java only 1 or 1/2 percent
what you can say projects are built
using cotton now but in future it will
change they will be preferring cotton
more so lines this make make this
application using 2 languages Java and
cotton in both initially we'll start
with Java and later will convert this
code into cotton and we will also learn
how to it how to convert the existing
project into Cartland so it will be an
amazing experience let me know your
thoughts this this this module of this
thing is still in planning stage I will
give you more details on the telescope
group so you have to make sure that you
go to Facebook and search for that is
could loop because the future updates
will be coming on that group and those
do like our Facebook page because you
will be getting lots of updates there so
from where get well from when will
starting this or how it will be going
the timing will be published in that
group itself so I hope you're excited
I'm excited my team is excited here I
hope in fact my nephews are also excited
so that we'll see in the light session
every wants and do let me know your
thoughts in the comment section so do
subscribe and do set it share this video
