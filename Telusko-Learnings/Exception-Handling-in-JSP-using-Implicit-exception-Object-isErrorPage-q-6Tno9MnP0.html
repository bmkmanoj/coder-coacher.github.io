of exception implicit object in GSP so
this is also called as exception
handling in JSP so what we'll do is in
this body tag let me use a form tag
so in this form tag I will ask user to
enter two numbers so we'll say form
action
we'll say calculate so we'll create a
JSP called as calc dot JSP
okay so we'll say character jsd and the
method doesn't matter we'll go forget so
this will take two parameters so we'll
say type equal to text so we need to
text field here and we'll say name of
the first is num1 and the name of the
second won't be none too so just you can
just simply copy paste it so and the
second part will be dumped oh so we have
number nine I'm closer to as to input
text field and we require a button so I
also need a break between a br tag here
and a beer tag here also okay and then
this will create a button here we'll say
input type submit is because I want to
work for the form tag and then we'll say
the value which it sure is let's say
divide so I'm going for operation in
your college divide so if you enter a
value like fifteen and three it should
be in the value as five now since we are
calling this as character JSP we'll say
a new web page so we'll say new JSP page
and we'll name it as calc dot JSP not to
mention the extension we can simply
click on finish I don't need all this
extra comments here so I will remove
this comments I think I will remove this
head section also I know I don't need
that and here what it should do is it
should take those two parameters so
we'll say we require two variables so
all this coding will be done in body so
body open body close and inside this
body what I need I need our JSP tags so
we say scraplet and in this corporate
what we'll do is we'll create two
variables one will be no
and the value for this no one will come
from in from the users will say
integer.parseint since the value will be
coming in string.format
will say request dot getparameter and in
this will pass specify the name of the
other field there which is no one you
can just simply copy paste and we'll say
this is num2 and he also nam - so we got
this - well you two values here once you
got these two values what we can do is
we can add them we need to subtract it
right so we'll say when you create one
more variable which is result equal to
it will be no 1 divided by num2 okay so
we got we got an operation here which is
no money by by num2 and once you got the
operation we can also use out dot print
to fill it result or we can use
expression tag here so if you're not
familiar the expression tag in
expression tag if you mentioned anything
it will directly go to the out dot
println of your outdoor print of your
subject so we'll say result here so this
is one way of printing so that either
you can print here out dot println in
packet result or you can use expression
with by printing result here simple
cific got two pages when is integral
HTML in which i have my view in which
user will enter two values and click on
a button and then it will call cap dot
JSP in which i am applying the operation
of division so if I run this code now so
it will open in my web browser so it
shows me to text field here ignore the
type of you're getting so we say five
and let's say next value will divide
fifteen and five so if I click on divide
the answer will be three right so we're
getting the right output but let's say
if I enter by mistake if I intercede oh
and if I say divide you can see it gives
me a page with good error now imagine
your user getting this type of errors no
use I will visit your website once again
if you if they get this
you know if there is one problem that
the problem is you cannot divide a
number by zero right so you can specify
the user that you cannot divide by zero
so in order to plan that you need to
handle this exception so to handle the
exception so if you're familiar with
try-catch block of code java in order to
do this here
what we need is we need we need a
directive page here so we'll say
directive in order to use directed tag
we need to use a turret symbol which
directly we need we need page directive
in page like today's option of other
page so in case directive HTML so we
need to do this in calc
so in calc we already have a directive
here
so after this page encoding because we
can also we can create one more page
directive here but since I have already
so I can use that with the edit page in
if you get any error just call edit oh
geez so I can simply call so in order if
if you get any exception in this file it
will call this edit or JSP page okay but
unfortunately I don't have any page here
so we can simply say I will say new with
greater JSP page and will name that J's
page as error dot JSP and we click on
finish okay so once you've got the JC pH
I killed a I don't want all these
comments so here in this body section
what I can simply print is in h1 tag
itself well print error I can we'll say
you cannot divide a number by 0 all
right so this is this is what you have
an arrow so if I run this now this I
have tried to handle the exception so it
is getting open in my ie it asking for
two values we'll say 15 and 2 just for
the experiment and the output should be
7 and if I type here 0 so it will go to
counter JSP
Kalka Jesus we will find an error and it
will call ed Adagio so this this output
you are getting from energy right so but
we have tried to handle the exception
here but let's say I want to print also
the error the error generated by your
JSP in order to print the error what we
need is we need a JSP we need a
exception object here so what I can
simply do is after this we'll use a
expression tag this one and in this
expression tag I can use in Bill object
called an exception so this is the
exception object which is generated once
you once you got the error so anytime
you get error on this page it will
generate the exception object which is
this object so this is responsible to
print the error let me just change my
browser I'm fed up with this let me use
Firefox and lunch back to HTML you fire
on this so after running it give me the
same same thing if I say 15 and 5 the
output is 3 just for the checking and if
I say 0 now and if I click on divide
again it's giving it says unable to
compile the class file for JSP the
problem is whenever you use this object
call as exception so you can see
exception cannot be resolved to a
variable which because by default you
are not allowed to use this object call
exception because in every class there
will be an exception object but you're
not allowed in order to use that object
we need to specify one more thing called
as is this other page so we need to
specify that this page is error page so
we'll say by defied is false we'll make
it true if you make it true that means
you can use this object now simple so in
order to use exception we need to do
this part we will run this code again
and this time if I say 1559 0 if I click
on divide now I can see error you cannot
divide number by 0 so this is the error
which is printed by you and this is the
error printed by your tomcat
okay so this is divide by zero error so
this is how we need to handle the
exception this is how we need to use the
implicit object which is exception so in
total we have seen in the last video we
have seen the importance of session
object application object and then we
have this exception object so these are
all your implicit objects in JSP so and
that's it from this video so and do
subscribe for the further videos and
thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
