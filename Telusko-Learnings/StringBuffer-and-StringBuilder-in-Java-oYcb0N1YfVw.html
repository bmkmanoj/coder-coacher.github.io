strings are immutable which means once
you assign the value to a string
variable and if you try to change it it
will not replace the old object it will
create a new object for you I don't want
to do that what I want is I want a
string variable where the value of the
variable should change it should update
I mean it should not get a new object
will create it which it should update
the old value in that case what you can
do is you can make your string mutable
and how to do that is by using a class
called string buffer so string buffer is
a class which provides yo string
mutability in fact we don't have one
video we have two classes we have string
buffer and string builder I can measure
the difference of both I mean both are
seen both are used for string mutability
with one difference that we'll see later
so timing let's focus on string before
so let me create an object of string
buffer here and we'll say this is SBF
equals your new string buffer okay
that's our object now once we created
the object of Springbok for let's assign
the value so I can you can assign the
value later or you can assign the value
here itself let's say this my value is
the bean now I want to I want to assign
a different value I want to assign let's
say I know in ready in that case I have
to obtain right so I will say SBF let's
try it then let's try to do that let's
say this is now being ready
will that work and you can see there is
an error
it's a is mismatch converting from
string to string buffer what you can't
do is you can use some methods here
using which you can append so when you
already have the bean there you can also
append it right so you can say this is
now in space ready so now if I try to
print the value of it so we say sbf now
SPF you know is an object right to fetch
the value we can say to string again
it's not compulsory anyway because if
you don't mention to string it will be
calling to string and if you run this
code that's here and you can see we
called the auto is now in ready so this
time it is not creating two object it's
creating only one object
okay so the same object has Naveen and
then later on we are appending with
ready
in fact that lots of methods we can use
we can say SPF dot what else we can have
we have append then we have we also have
it will face the character character
acts then we can delete the characters
from a particular position then we can
okay
we can insert the character so let's say
if I want to insert a character in
between I can do that
then replace now we can also replace the
text example if I were to place Naveen
by let's say I need any name with five
characters let's say Manoj so what we
can do is we can say the place from the
position zero to position four and I
want to replace by my nose my nose my
nose my knots and now if you see the
output you can see it's Manoj ready oh
we have replaced it with five and it
should be at five like okay so we have
replaced it with my nose radius that's
how it works that's how we can we can
replace the characters in fact we have
lots of methods you can explore more
methods from this it's always a good
trying to explore we can also fetch this
substring if you if you don't want the
complete string you want to print only
five pages we can do that by using
substring you can set the end quad yeah
we can insert a and we have lots of
methods to use we can also use direct
let's say I don't want I don't want this
double D here okay so we can we can
delete that so what character it is 4 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 so 8 and it will end
at 10 is that way and if I run this code
yeah so we can see we have removed a DD
so that's
that's how you that's how we use that's
how you use string before now if you go
to the string before class let's see the
definition of freight so string before
class is a class which provides string
mutability and if you see the definition
of it string buffer is that it's a
thread safe it is thread safe what it
means is string buffers are thread safe
to use by multiple threads so let's say
if your if your application is working
with multiple threads so in that case
you don't want one thread should affect
I mean one thread operation should
affect the other clear operation so what
we can do is you can make your if your
string buffer these threads say if that
means you'll not be having problem with
multiple threads if one three is exiting
the string before other thread we'll
have to wait and we have things I've
talked about that right a thread safe
when we are talked about synchronization
if you make a method synchronized only
one thrilling access it and that's what
shrinko face is all about it is thread
safe so we have one more class right
which is string builder now string well
string builder will have all the same
methods the the thing which we have done
here string builder will also have the
same methods the difference is if you go
to string builder and if user did
definition of it it's a mutable keiter
a sequence of characters but it is not
thread safe so you can see it says but
with no guarantee of synchronization so
string builder doesn't provide you
synchronization that's the main
difference so if you know if you know
that you don't have multiple threads in
your application you can of course go
for a string string builder and if you
have multiple threads it's always safe
to go for a string buffer so given a
choice
always go for string buffer okay you you
never know right but at what time you
will you will move to thread so I always
go for string buffer
string builder is something which is
there if you want to use it you can use
patch stringify something they should
always use so that's how you achieve
string notability using string buffer
and string builder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
