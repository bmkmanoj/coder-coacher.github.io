we'll talk about network security
practicals for BSC ID v sin so in this
you have your practical as first you
starts with CSI fir then we have
modified version of it then we have more
alphabetic and then we have
transposition ciphers in which we have
little fancier in pookkalam now what you
call them now you have list of things
here and then you have defi husband des
then we'll go for a es RSA our c4 and
Blowfish so in the current video we'll
talk about CSI 4 and modified one
remaining part you will see in next
consecutive videos so let's start with
the first one in this this is my this is
NetBeans IDE I'm working on you can use
any version of IDE so above 6 I guess
yeah ok then
the first step is you have to create a
project like this project additional
application and then let's get a new
file so I click new Java class and we'll
name this class just ok so we'll name
this class as this class is a cipher ok
ok now what do you see a cipher it's
like if you have what text like you know
this ok so let's imagine what is this i
for now let's suppose you have a string
called as ABC now this CSI 4 means you
have to convert this ABC plain text into
a cipher text which will be a increment
of 3 to the each character now what I
mean is if we take this a you have to
increment this a with 3 characters which
means the output will be d because it's
Dom today we have BC and it will be d
then after for this B it should be e and
for this C it should be F right so this
is the what we have to do so this is
your plain text and this should be your
cipher text and for this there are
certain steps to follow
the first thing we'll do is we'll create
our main functions we say P SVM tab it
will give you a main function I think I
should increase the font size for you
guys it's fun I think it should make it
18 that's not so it's 18 for now okay so
what we'll do now we'll take first first
task if you have to take a plane a plane
text so what we'll do we say apprentices
PT and we'll take plain text as ABC for
the mappers purpose we are taking the
text as ABC you can have any text here
next what we don't want is after
conversion will be getting a cipher text
time being it is unknown because we have
to calculate the cipher text then we
require a key now what key means is in
CSI for your key is 3 that means you
have to add each character with a width
3 which means the output you'll be
getting is a plus 3 SD ok now the next
thing next thing you need is we'll we'll
just we'll just say we'll say CT we want
to find the value of CT now so we'll
define a method called as do encrypt so
what this method will do is it will do
my job of encryption ok now the thing
you have to pass is first you have to
pass your plain text and then you will
pass the key value or timing will go for
this plain text ask will send PT
directly so what we won't want to do the
encryption with this PT so let's remove
this K value for simplicity let me make
the things very clear for you or simple
for you ok so once you once you define
once you call this do encrypt method
which is a user-defined method which
means we have to create this method now
but let's assume we have a method so
after that you will be getting an output
and that output will be CT so let's just
print this city simple right now our
task is to create this method called as
to encrypt and to do that what we'll do
is we'll define a method now that method
should be static right it's because we
are not eating using any object here so
we say
a static method which will return a
string value and the name of the method
is do and click OK and this will take a
string parameter SPT now what we'll do
next is it will just okay now to do all
these operations we have to take one one
Giger right so we have to fetch e1 one
character for that will take our
variable which is of can format as C
then then what we'll do is we have to
take one one character now right we have
to replace this string we have to
replace this string or this string of PT
which is now ABC we have to replace with
the new values for that we have to
convert this into string buffer so what
we'll do is we'll use string before
because string buffers allow you took
two teens change the string because it
is mutable as you know string string
class is immutable so we'll go for
string before so it's string buffer
okay and the values for the string
buffer should be PT that means now this
PT now with this PT is still in SP now
we have to we have to start with the
first value like we have to change this
string to the new string right that
means we have to take one one character
and change it and to go for one one
character we require a for loop so we'll
say end will say I equal to zero because
normally string index will start with 0
and we have to finish till the length of
the spring right so if your string is
three characters it should stop at two
and then I plus plus now what next we'll
do is we'll take that we'll take that
character or anything any value like
example in this PT what we have is we
have stored ABC so we'll take this a and
we'll do some operations see ultimately
what you do is we have to add a 3 to
this a now unfortunately we directly we
cannot directly add 3 to this a so what
we'll do we will save that a
in a number format and for that we'll
take a video vocalist number so let's
define the variable as num and we'll say
num is equal to no now what we I want
this a should be converted into it's the
ask I value right now to convert us a
number a guy trying to ask a value it's
very simple right if you write if we
write in single quote it's a right so in
this num what we're getting stored is 65
so value of a is 65 now what I want if
your value is a it restricts 65 center
of that what we'll do we'll say a minus
65 that means in this num now it will
store zero now how do I know that the PT
of beauty first character is a is just
instead of writing this what we'll say
is we'll say SB give me the character at
index zero so zero means if I will get a
I don't know I see as the loop
progresses ultimately the value of I
will change that means we have to shift
from a then we have to shift to B then
you have to shoot to see and for that
we'll simply specify here I now I don't
want a value 65 I want a value zero so
it'll say 65 minus zero now why 65 is
because capital a is 65 right and then
we'll add this num with three because we
wanted the increment should be of three
right so we'll say num three and then
now what next
now what if I say if your a value is 65
you're not your zero value will be 92
right so or 91 so your that value will
be 91 so if let's suppose your your
string is not ABC if it is oh yeah let's
go with ABC that's with let's do with
this first and then we'll see what we
will see with or if questions so what
we'll do we'll save this value in C now
now how to get the C value we can
directly say it's num plus 65 now what
we are doing here is
if you got a so if you say a minus 65
the non value will be zero and then you
will add yeah we will add this num plus
three which means it will be which means
it will be three and then that three
plus 65 to 68 and this this 68 character
is d so ultimately in c variable you
would be having a value T but this num
plus 65 will give you integer value what
I want is type the values I have to cast
it with character simple right okay okay
so what we'll do we'll gosh it with
character and then we have to replace
this value of a as D so for that we'll
say s B dot set care at I and we'll save
the new value as C simple right
and after the whole for loop what we'll
do we'll return this city oh not so you
will run your SP and for that to return
s B now the problem with SP is it is a
string before right and you required
strings so that way you have to convert
this string before into string and do
that what we'll do we'll define a new
method or new object called a string and
which will pass SP simple that said you
know if you run this code now you should
get some output now so you run this file
and the output is d EF as we needed
right so a plus three is d B plus three
is e and c plus 2 D is F but if I take
my name its if W let me run this code
and yeah so this is my this is my name
for my cipher text so so this is this is
how it works right it a simple but what
if if I make this as mm X Y Z
so what should be the output right what
we want is after X it should be Y Z a
right so this a should be exit with a
this Y should be B and said should be C
right so output you're expecting is ABC
but when you run this file unfortunately
this is the output it's because the
Oscar value for Z is 91 and when you say
91 plus 3 it becomes 94 and then the
character for 94 is this so what we want
is once it grows 91 so once the value of
your string goes beyond 91 you have to
come back to 0 and for that we'll do
some opt we'll do some checking here so
we'll say if your num is greater than
greater than equal to 26 so in that case
what we'll do is we'll say num equal to
na minus 26 so it will if your value
exceed 26 we have to protect Uzi row
okay now if I done this file so this is
your desired output right okay now let's
do let's let's go for decryption so this
was your encryption right so what if if
you want to decrypt it for that we'll
say we'll say again PT equal to do
decrypt in bracket if I pass city and
then let me obtain the value of PT so
the output I'm expecting from PGI again
is XYZ Y so it should print XYZ but
first we define this method to decrypt
so it will go down and it's a static
string to dick click and this again will
take a PT as parameter this one city
will say strange city so the string city
now so inkay in order to do that what
we'll do is instead of instead of doing
all these opticians what we can simply
do is what do you fire fire return
directly do encrypt because to encrypt
will give you a positive value sight but
what if I pass CT and will pass one more
character as 26 minus key let me show
you the magic what if I take here int
key key let me pass key values as 3 and
the right and then then then then hey
also let me accept the key value so
insure of this 3 what will say it will
say key value right
so what I'm doing is I'm adding one
operator to each and every method as int
key now if a passed which is 6 minus key
so it will go back to my previous value
let me show you the output first see my
this is my ciphertext and this is my
original text so if your past when you
six minus key it will do the same
operation reverse order that's what we
wanted right so this is color technician
now so this was your cipher a CSI for
right very simple but what if it's very
easy right because you are directly
going for the value 3 which means it's
very easy for a hacker to decrypt this
value so for that what we can do is we
can directly take we can we can do some
if we can use some modified version of
CSI for in which the key value will be
anything between 1 to 25 for that well
what we'll do is we'll take int key
value it will be 3 by default so here
instead of passing 3 will pass key which
means the same but what if we want to go
for modified version in which these not
value it the value can range from 1 to
25 right and for that what we can do is
ensure specifying this value will take
input from user
all right so we can take input from user
and for that we'll say to do that we
have reached by bufferedreader
so we'll say before reader VR equal to
kneel before reader now I hope you know
how to use buffer in case if you don't
know the don't know how to use before it
does so you search for my video on user
input in my channel so it's new import
push stream its input stream reader I
didn't bracket what you I say you have
to pass the system dot end now since we
are using before that we have to say for
those exception because this is checked
exception so we have to say so the
exception and we have to import the
package to import the package just click
here and say import then you have to
import this one also will say this one
report ok then you stop taking value
from this will take input from user so
we'll say we'll ask user to print enter
key value and then use a balloon to
value using go further a BR dot readline
so we can take input from user using BR
dot readline but BR dot readline will
give you string values you have to
convert into integer format so we'll say
powers paint simple right so now now if
I done this yeah it's just another key
value instead of going for three what we
can pass this which we pass oh just hold
on okay again straight okay if I pass
five you can see I'm getting a most a
ciphertext rest CDE right now what if I
take of user input or some plain text
from user so again we have to use buffer
in this case so what we'll do is ensure
this will say read line
so using this you can take input from
user now so this is waiting for my input
and we'll say Naveen and though it was
not a key value simply say six enter so
you can see this is my cypher text using
a key value as six so this was your CSI
4 and modify CSI for this is your first
and second sub part of the practical so
thank you so much for this watching this
