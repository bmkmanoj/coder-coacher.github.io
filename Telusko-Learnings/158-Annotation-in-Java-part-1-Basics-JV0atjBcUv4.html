reading from the list for learnings and
in this video we talk about annotations
now annotations is something very new to
Java new doesn't means that it is there
I mean yesterday it came but it's there
from a long time so it so annotation was
introduced in 1.5 jar 1.5 so if you have
learnt Java before that you might have
not heard about annotations but after
1.5 we got this gift from Oracle we can
use I mean not a writer but son that we
can use annotations now annotations are
very powerful let me just give an
example of a location in fact if we talk
about the advanced framework with high
but like hyper tonight spring they all
uses annotations to work with now so I
thought we can do quantification using
XML on annotations but everyone click
forward to go for annotations let me
give you some examples how I mean how it
looks
we'll talk about in detail how to create
annotations we'll talk about which
different aspect of it annotations in
the coming videos but in this video
we'll talk only about how to use
annotations so Oh what we'll do is let's
say we have two classes here one is
class a and then we have one which is
class B and as as well plus a extent I
mean Class B extends Class A and inside
this class we have a method which is
public void show okay and here also will
say public void show so what we are
actually doing is we are so this method
show or Worldwide's the method which is
from a right so if I create the object
of a now and if I if I call show
opposite will call the method of a
because we are getting object of a but
in case if our grading on it of B it
will call the method of B right because
the method of the method B overlies the
method a with a method of a but let's
say if if we have a very very big name
here we'll say show my data from lost
your database so let's say this is my
this is my method name and again we are
doing the same stuff here we are saying
show my data from last year database
let's say we have this we have this two
methods here and in this I am printing
so I am printing let's say in a and here
I am printing in B and so we are
expecting that when you call this method
show my database okay so if I call this
method now it should it should call the
method of so it should call the method
of we have an error here what is they
show nothing okay
so if you call this method it should
call the latest method right so this
method over wise the initial method so
it should print in B but unfortunately
from this code you can see we are
getting the output as in a it's because
even if you are overriding it it is it
is giving you in a it's because
purposely I have made a mistake I don't
know how many of you have seen that but
I made a mistake here
so this is a small B and this is a
capital B right and this may happen when
you write a code so this is a runtime
error right so runtime error are very
harmful compile time is something we can
work with so what we can do is we can
write at override so it is always better
to use a notations here
so if you write at over Droid at compile
time itself it will say hey you're not
overriding any method here because we
don't have any method with this name in
the class a so you will get to know that
you have made a mistake
and now you can see there is no error so
we can use at over that annotation to
specify that we are achieving over a
method overriding now again this is
helpful for two things it will inform
your computer or it will inform your
Java that your intention is to override
a method it will also inform the other
programmers let's say if somebody is
somebody is saying you're cool and if
you written at override it specifies
that your intention was to override this
method
right so you don't have to use external
commands here so this method overrides
the earlier method we don't have to do
that right so it gives you that it
solves two problem of yours one it will
check the compile time stuff it will
check your name has the same name as the
previous name and it will also make sure
that it will become a comment for the
other other programmers okay so that's
how that's how you use at override
annotation this is one the second one is
let's say in this class or in this
method I am using some I'm using a at
least and let's say it is new analysts
this is a topic of collection right so
when you work with analysts normally we
so if I if I create object of validation
you can see we are getting an warning
here this morning says a Denise should
be having a generic type so we have to
make sure that we specify the type of
value you're working with so you are
working with integer nom right so that
was the warning there again
we are getting down there this is now we
have a warning because of this obj
because we are not using obj but the
onion warning was because of this
integer so this was so the array was not
type safe that means if you don't
specify the gender it will give you X it
will give you some warning let's say I
am NOT concerned about the warning what
we can do is here itself we can add one
more annotation called as suppress
warnings and you can mention don't check
any and you stop that okay so you can
write at uncheck if I'm not wrong it is
unchecked yeah so it is unchecked and
you can see it will not give you any
problem when you compile this on your it
is giving you warning here but when you
compile this on notepad it will not give
you that warning this is a different
warning here so if you want to if you
want to remove that water you can simply
write add suppress warning unchecked so
when you when you do this on command
line you will get a better understanding
of it okay this is one thing so this is
one one of the annotation we can use we
have one my intention if let's say if
you have a method which is public void
show and so earlier people used to use
this method but now you have the new
method which which you don't want others
to use this method what we can do is we
can write add deprecated so by writing
and duplicated you are mentioning that
don't use this method I mean this method
is available for you but don't use it
can you see that line there okay so if I
try to use that show method which is
show it will give me a line can you see
that and it says this method is
deprecated so it's better to not to use
this methods so there are some internal
annotations available inside Java this
is three or we have one more which which
was introduced in one point H if you
want to create any interface let's say
interface ABC and this interface
contains only one method example void
void show if you have only one method
here what we can do is we can write add
functional interface but now in Java 8
we have this feature of lambda
expression actually as we have seen in
the series so if you want to achieve
that we can use at functional interface
this is also an annotation now the
advantage of edge let's say in by
mistake if I if I put two methods here
so it will give you error because you
are making it as a function interface
which means you can have only one method
and you are doing two when you are
giving two methods
that's a compile time error right so
it's always better to use annotations to
help and to be a bit to be a better
programmer right so that's how that's
how we can use annotations but the
question is how we can write our own
annotations that is tricky right that
will say in the next video so thank you
so much make sure you subscribe the
channel and like this video so that I
will be motivated to create more videos
like this thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
