structures
oh-ho-ho I know you're pushing there you
might be thinking what is data
structures and what is so important
let's find out
welcome back aliens my name is Ivan 20
and let's get started we are living in
an Information Age now what does that
mean it simply means that everything
around you it's all about information
the IT industry which you are working
with its IT which is information
technology right so what they need is
information but we have to store that
data somewhere right and that's
important avoid data how can you store
that data because after that after
processing that data you will get
information right but how do you store
that data no data can be of different
type right it can be a normal data it
can be a complex data so it's all about
how to store it
now why is reading is so important we
can simply fetch data and put it
somewhere right take a file put your
data there no it's not that simple it's
not just about storing data it's also
about how can you fetch that data in
efficient way how can you process that
data in efficient way so with that data
you will do lots of thing so you have to
build a solution in such a way or if you
have to store your data in such a way
that it will be easier for you to fetch
it to process it and to you know again
shut it somewhere and that's why we have
this concept of data structures so
before learning a language if you
understand what these data structures it
will be easier for you to understand how
that language works right in fact if you
have learned any programming language
before maybe C or Python or Java in that
we use certain things for us arrays we
use least so to understand those concept
data so it is very important so data
structure is all about how can you
structure your data so that you can
store it and use it efficiently again
there are certain algorithms you can you
can implement on that if you heard about
this concept of searching techniques we
have sorting techniques so we can apply
all those techniques only when your data
is properly structured now how do we
store that data so what we have a
concept called as abstract data type it
simply means you can store your data in
such a way that it will be easier for
you to work in future example we have a
concept of least so if you want to save
data in sequential format we can
actually use lists we also have a
concept of stack so let's say if you
want to sort everything
sequence format we can cover list maybe
you want to you know when you say
windows tab or all tab in Windows or in
any OS it will show the recent
applications right now if you remember
the first app it shows you is the last
which you have accessed which means last
in first out so at that point we use
stack some sometimes we have to track
each and every note so we simply use
linked list all other other concepts one
more thing the least fancy which are
talking about that's an abstract concept
because every language have a different
way of implementing it and the actual
implementation like link list we have at
least in Java we have those two things
so data structure is all about how do
you store your data now push our eyes
why it is so important now I mean of
course it was important before as well
but nowadays we have this boom of data
structures right everyone want you to
know data structures in fact if you go
for the job interviews as well so
initially they used to ask about
programming language they used to ask
about mathematical things now they talk
about data structures they will ask your
question based on data structures and
talking about all the companies there's
a might of Google Facebook or Apple they
will start asking you a question on on
data structures but why why now it's
because the world is changing
yeah thanks to this concept of big data
yeah
every company they have huge amount of
data with them how do you process them
how do you store them so they we have
different frameworks like Hadoop spark
to process the data and the base of all
those things is data structures if you
understand it has structure it will be
easier for you to understand the beta
beta frameworks
thanks to AI you know machine learning
how will you implement AI if we don't
have data and to store the data we need
data structures right so the base app
for everything is data structures so
it's important for you now to understand
data structures if you want to get into
big companies and plus there is one more
thing here you know the you're learning
data structure will be helpful for you
when you start learning different
languages because every language have
their own way of implementing it
maybe Python or C or Java so they have
some inbuilt
things you can use it only when you know
how that works so that's how you should
be data structures and data structures
is all about storing data and using it
efficiently right so in the coming
upcoming
we'll talk about how do we implement
some data structures and what are the
algorithms available so that you can
implement it I hope you like this video
