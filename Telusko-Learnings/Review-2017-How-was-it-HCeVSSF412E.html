this year there are so many things to
talk about and let's talk about three
things the first thing is my
achievements for 2017 the Lightning's
and in taking learnings we talk about
the professional learning and the
personal earnings so let's get started
welcome back aliens my name is Devin
ready and let's start with the
achievements as it a disco family we
have achieved two big milestones the
first one is we have reached 100,000
subscribers
yay and the second one is we have
browsed 15 million views on the channel
that's awesome right and the best part
is those hundred thousand subscribers we
have got only in this year because last
year bmp-1 having a thousand subscribers
and remaining 1 lakh subscribers we will
be reached in this year with that funny
tone subscribers now we have a silver
button to show off from a long time I
was thinking about doing a collab with
someone who actually believes in giving
something to society and so I did a
collaboration this year with sort of
Shukla and also known as my Sergey and
it was awesome collaboration
one of the biggest achievement of this
year is finally I got engaged with my
love now it's time for landings as I
mentioned before we talk about two
learnings one is professional and second
is personal and let's start with the
professional first so in professional as
well we have two types of learning one
is communication and second is technical
and I have learned quite a bit in
communication but let's talk about the
technical part here in technical let me
mention the first one which is quatrain
I am very happy after after learning
Courtney and walking on Cortland the
next thing is I have learned a REST API
it's not that I was not knowing about it
but then I wanted to make videos from a
long time so I have learned it from
start to end so that I can teach so the
next one is AWS code start whenever you
make an application nowadays you have to
deploy that application somewhere right
and ADA place is the best platform now
and in that they have introduced new
thing for this aw Scott star in fact we
have done a live project this year right
so the lot of tutorials available on
YouTube which will teach you about
different technologies right so my idea
was how can you implement the
technologies which you have learned in
real-life scenarios and that's why we
did this live project I know the biggest
change in the Java network which is Java
a9 and awesome features right in fact
I'm very excited for Java 9 now even I
was thinking sometime you know because
Java is going out maybe Java is going
out thanks to Cortland but it's not time
to Java 9 we have so many awesome
features now and Java will not be going
anywhere in the cottage scenarios I have
learned a lot of things in profit as
well example I have worked and mockito
for the first time in this year then
learned about lean agile not just agile
it's also lean agile is there and then
Jenkins
now after professional learning let's
talk about the personal learnings we all
know that health is more important than
money but this year I realized that
health is actually more important than
money because if you are thinking that
you know if you have money you can take
it off your health that's not this
that's not the thing if you have health
you can take care of your money you can
earn more money if you have if you are
going good health from the moment we
cross 100 thousand subscribers I was
feeling under pressure now because since
I have hundred thousand subscribers it
is my responsibility to give you the
code content now a lot of videos I was
getting some comments some bad comments
of good comments and I feel they
motivated you looking at those good
comments and those likes but then there
are people who give me bad comments
initially I used to feel bad about it
but then I realized that without people
one are critics and second are haters
now anyway many will see a bad comment
on the video it may it might be a critic
and it's good for you as a YouTube
content creator it's good for you
because your critics will help you in
improving your content and you know I
mean I'm working on my content creation
now but then what about haters I used to
feel bad about haters but now I have
learned one thing
stop giving to your haters now what are
my plans for 2018 any resolution and the
answer is no because from my childhood I
have never achieved those things which
have which I have thought about but then
I do have a set of plans to achieve in
this year example I want to build my own
platform now I want to build my own
platform from love from last three years
okay but then I started working on it
and then due to some other work lot of
distractions I cannot say distraction
but then I was busy with some other
work example pointing creation on
YouTube and then my corporate training
and working on some projects and we have
personal work son working on my project
so this year maybe we'll work on iOS
Android and the web web application and
I'm hoping to upload all the videos on
those platforms as well now I will try
to read more books but it is not a
resolution I'm trying to read as many
books as possible whenever I get time
nowadays in fact I have a mobile
applications where I can read books I
have physical books as well so whenever
I get time I try to read as many books
as possible and the most important
things I am planning to you lots of
meetups this year I mean may not be the
same city in Mumbai but maybe in other
cities whenever variable I visit so
let's see how we can plan it how we can
how can I can how I can meet with you
people
so I will excited for 2008 2018 so I
hope you enjoyed this video there's so
many things so many things we have
talked about so that's it everyone
thanks so much for watching enjoy your
your ending</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
