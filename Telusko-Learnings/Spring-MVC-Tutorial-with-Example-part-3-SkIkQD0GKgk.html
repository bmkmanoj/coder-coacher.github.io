create this file which is sublet dot XML
file now you can see we are getting some
error here and the other is because of
this double quotes so let me change this
upper to proper double quotes because I
have copied this from my other file it
was there was some error so make sure
you have the proper the book is format
there and you can see we are not we we
have resolved that error now even if you
run this there might be some error
let me check was the error so if I say
finish run it was like some time to load
and okay let me close all the other
files and if I expand this let's say 7 &amp;amp;
6
if I the submit oh okay it's again have
given me the error which is for not 4 so
whenever you see for not 4 it is
actually file not found and it's not
able to map they should have a request
with the URI the problem is whenever you
call add how would your application
knows which method to call so in order
to make this as a controller we have to
use some sort of annotations so we have
to use annotation here which is
controller okay so we have to use a
controller and a ssin which defines that
this is a controller and you need to
also mention the request for which
request you are executing this method
and to specify every time you call ad
you need to execute this method we have
to say a v2 is an annotation which is
called as request mapping annotation and
this equation mapping annotation we have
to mention in double quotes with mention
for ad request you have to call this
method called as ad we don't have to
make sure we don't have to have the same
name and an ad you can have any name
provided you're calling that particular
name here our URL and now if it on this
nothing way to restart the server so
this start
it will take some time and let's try
this once again if I say run this okay
so we got something and we got an error
so it is something with the beauty so
all the word as a different thing but
what we wanted is to print I am here
right we got something so since we are
printing I am here we got I am here
simple so that's how you can map your
application from a HTML page or the JC
page to our controller but hold on we
don't want to show the output on the
console we want to show the output on
the JSP page or a page right so for that
what we need me to call a page here know
how to call a page to call a page first
you have to get a bridge so let's create
a page and we'll name this page as will
say this page as maybe display dot JSP
let's make this this small so we got a
page here which is displayed JSP in this
space let me print I am here that's it I
mean time printing I am here now how to
call this page now in order to call this
page you can what you can simply do is
instead of returning a void we can
mention handwritten a string okay and
here we have to say return and you have
to mention the name of the file which is
display dot JSP so this will call
display dot JSP
okay so whenever you call ad it will
call display dot JSP
let's run this and boom so you got a
page which is displayed of JSP and you
can see it written I am here now the
amazing thing about this is even if you
are passing numbers we are not accepting
those numbers but instead of printing
here a dot or something what you say
display about JSP of our printing ad so
we are actually hiding which type what
type of technology we are using but we
don't want this out but we want to add
two numbers right now to how to add that
two numbers will say in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
