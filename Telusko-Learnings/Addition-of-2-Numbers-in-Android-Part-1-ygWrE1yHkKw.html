how to set up Android studio once we
have added SDK and we have also run the
emulator right now everything is set up
so now you can start the actual coding
part now from where we should start so
we have done with hello world that's the
negation of the code right and the
second code we always slide is addition
of two numbers doesn't matter which
language you learn maybe C C++ Java
Android everything everything starts
with addition of two numbers right now
why this code is important because in
this way you learn about different
variables also to take input from user
how to give output to the user and
that's why we do addition of two numbers
right
so in this video we'll see how to add
two numbers so we require two text
fields we require two labels we require
a button where you will provide the
event and then you can see the output
right now one thing to know here is
whenever you work with buttons in
Android or maybe any any type of buttons
maybe radio buttons or something every
button needs a listener right because
when you perform the event so your
button should be able to know that you
are performing some event and that's why
you have to provide the listener
again you can provide it is know with
the help of GUI way or we can provide
with the help of Java way again we'll
see both in the coding part ok so that's
the thing you should know and we'll
start with the coding now so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
