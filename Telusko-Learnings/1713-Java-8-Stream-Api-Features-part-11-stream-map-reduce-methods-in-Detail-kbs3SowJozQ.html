map and reduce interface method works so
the last one last video we have what we
have done is we have created a list and
then have six elements and we are just
like we are just multiplying each number
by two and then we have some we are
adding all these numbers now to
understand this topic let me comment
this part and let's do it again so let
me write this thing once again it's some
space here I was a system dot out dot
println and in bracket I want to put int
value start so first way to convert into
stream now what this stream will do is
it will convert all your values into
stream now once you get stream this
stream object here let me go step by
step what we need here is we need to
create object of Sri will say stream s
equal to values dot stream now this
stream method will give you object of
stream let me input the package so you
can see we have a package here which is
this so stream belongs to stream package
and we can simply type here s okay now
we just we don't want to create object
of stream what we want is we want to
multiply every number by two so what we
can do is we can simply say s start
there is a method for this map so map
will take a value it will convert that
value into the specified output you need
so what we can do is here we can say map
and this map object needs object of so
if you can search here it needs an
object of function so before using map
we need to create object of function so
before this stream somewhere here let me
get object of function so how to get
objective function will say function for
all the integer values which the object
name is F equal to new function here and
let me check the signature function
first let me for the package okay its
function dot funk
and if I go to this function interface
it takes two things one you can if you
go to function you can see it takes two
genitive values one is the the type of
the value it will take and second Dayton
type so you can type is are so I hope
your family with genrich's topic to
understand this we you need to be very
clear with genrich's so it takes two
parameters integer and integer so it
takes an integer parameter and it
returns an integer parameter so here we
have to specify both so it's integer and
integer and we can give a bracket and
opening close and we give us a my colon
here since function is the interface we
have to define the methods now let's see
which method this function have and the
function the method name is apply and
you can see this function is a
functional interface so function is an
interface which is which is defined in
version one point eight and it's a
functional interface which means we can
use lambda expression but that we'll use
later so in this function it has only
one method which is public returns are
integer values will say it is integer
and the function name is accept so we
say except it takes a integer i take
sine theta I
and we can simply say for every value of
I return I into two simple okay we are
getting an error here which object let
me check
okay it's not except this is apply so
method name is apply here okay
so method is applied we have to say it
returns integer it's accept integer for
every value of i we can just return the
value which is integer which is int 2
and somewhere here we can just pass the
object of f so because if i given
semicolon here you can see this map
returns or object of stream so now let
me get one more stream here will say
stream as equal to let's say this is s 1
so this s 1 has all the values which is
multiplied by 2
if you want to verify if I say stream
dots the stream also has a method which
is for each now you know how to use
forage will use a forage method here and
we can simply use method reference with
the system dot out : : let's print all
the value will say print Ellen okay so
we don't have to use s out here okay so
let me print the value of s so if I say
run you can see stream has already okay
I made a mistake here it's printing the
values okay let me print it later so
simply I will say s out it will print a
start
it was values start stream let's let's
keep it there
now if you come back here what we have
done is we have first take a stream
which is all the values 1 to 6 and then
we have we took all the values which are
mapped so it will multiply all the
values by 2 now this map it doesn't
stream so we got to stream now let me
get one more stream which is s 2 now in
the stream I will say s dot s 1 dot
reduce now what this videos will do is
reduce will take the object it will take
two parameters first is 0 the initial
value and then we have to specify the
object of binary operator so wait to
pass the object Oh binary operator now
how to pass the binding object of binary
operator that we'll see in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
