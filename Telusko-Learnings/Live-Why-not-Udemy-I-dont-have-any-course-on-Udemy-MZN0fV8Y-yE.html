says the new school adding is life great
so I just love that set reminder thing
it will let you know that I am life but
I can't see my face here I don't know
what song yeah so I can see that I can
see that and let me know the wise this
time and the last time we faced some
issues with the voice because I was
using my Mac camera this time I'm using
my mobile camera and mobile camera the
dogs
yeah so I think everything seems good
the video quality is good the audio is
good so we can get started okay the
topic for today is why not you Rami I
guess I'll take up all your questions
but then before that we'll start with
why not you dummy and then I will talk
about why I don't upload my videos on
udemy platform or any other platform for
that case ok so to understand this let's
get started with what is it I mean now I
don't know how many of you know this
platform udemy it's it is basically one
of the best online learning portal okay
so nothing against udemy here so if you
go to udemy.com their websites first of
all this cos theta that is edx.org e
that is what you dasa T that is
udemy that is teachable that is there's
so many websites where you can get the
online courses right now from this
website what I love is one of the
website I love is Coursera then one of
the website which I love is edx.org now
this are the websites which will teach
you something you know they always
believe in teaching you something so if
you want to really follow some no player
some website I would say go to Casa de
and they give you those that quality
content to the difference between
teaching and educating you know I have
seen a lot of series or not in fact I
have bought some tutorials on udemy ok
that to be honest
so whether not now it's been a long time
now I'm starting defendant 3 works I
bought some tutorials on udemy I thought
it would be good it was good but the
only thing is it there was not teaching
it you know I don't know is it because
of the problem with the udemy platform
so I did some research on udemy plectrum
what I realized is you dummy has some
restrictions you know this is how you
should teach these are you to teach okay
I don't know is it only for my thing so
I created my udemy account I start I
thought about creating a Content there
but I never feel I never felt
comfortable on your dime platform you
know there were some or the other issues
one of one one of the issue which I have
with the Democratic forum is the first
one they have different rules and
regulations second one is this one keep
rising now see all these courses which
you learn online they are costly okay to
be honest I have seen people teach Java
in thousand rupees or we can say $10 $15
and I'm not sure about the quality
content but then yes people do teach you
Java or they upload videos for $10 $15
$100 you know what if you go to your
Democrat forum they will say all the
courses are 200 I mean most of the
courses they are they will cost you $200
which comes out to be approximately
13,000 rupees yeah and later they say
okay we are giving you all the causes
for ten dollars I mean why they're doing
this I mean it's thinking about this
they say 200 dollars and they strike it
and they say ten dollars
I never been I mean what you say
bargaining or negotiation I never I
don't like that skin so you cannot do
that right once you are setting a course
for $200 and sandy you say ten dollars
that is one thing I don't like about you
Danny because as a content creator I'm
sure there are a lot of good content
creator on udemy as well but then if
they are saying you know if they are
saying they are charging you thirteen
thousand thirteen total piece for that
course and sunny this is her go-to piece
it's not a good thing right so I should
I feel be constant if you think your
course content just deserved thousand
rupees make it thousand rupees why
you're saying to a hundred and then
strike it out and then saying or 12,000
then strike it down
it's not about 50% it's 85% off you know
there is something I don't feel
confident about you Danny the thing is
you know this is human psychology they
are playing with the psychology and
that's what I don't like what you'd have
me so I went to you tell me multiple
times to
by different courses even I want to
learn something new right every time I
want to I have this habit of noting
something new not a great habit but then
you know because I have to do something
which I am already doing right but then
I have this thing I want to learn
something new so what do you dammit to
get something but then the other thing
is the moment I see the prizing tag
because we have this you know we have
this thing in our mind which is if you
are buying some if you're buying
something for late 70s which cost 13
thousand rupees and you are getting a
good buy right what if the quantity is
not good because you will rate the
content for that seven hundred apiece so
it me Pete if you are buying something
on udemy for seven hundred rupees which
is approximately let's say ten dollars
and if you don't like the content of you
if you want to rate the content you will
rate the content based on that but it's
not the original price and certainly
when they increase the price and you
think okay because the course got 4.5
rating that it might be try to cut and
sender you buy this buy the course so
that is one thing I don't like this
thing like what it is you platform on
the other hand we have puerile site we
have costed our courses are providing
most of the courses for free and those
are quality content if you really want
to learn something big they teach you in
week basis you know good sessions then
we have the site which which which takes
you around 1,500 rupees per month but
that's a good platform right we can you
can do a lot of things I'm not saying it
has everything but then how anytime I
would say a producer is better than
udemy
the moment you talk about quality of
content so I tried to Judah me but then
the only thing is I made lots of courses
you know I created Java Java courses
which I was selling online using some
different software's or different or
different services I wanted to upload
them on udemy but then you know
somewhere I was not putting good or
uploading of those videos on udemy so
and that's what you know there's one no
problem with with udemy asked what
someone potted in they come in the chat
window you can download ulema courses
for free you know there are some so all
so there are policy now if as a content
creator if my if the only way I earn is
through udemy and if I upload videos on
udemy and they get hacked and those
videos are uploaded on
some of the platform and you're gone
right I guess there are some platforms
where they are uploading content from
udemy right and in fact uh there is one
website which is okay something guru and
on that website someone is setting the
couch on videos mic freely available on
YouTube on that platform and they are
charging approximately somewhere around
4000 rupees for that course I don't know
who buys that but then that's what I
have the issue with the privacy now so
yeah that's that's the thing so that's
why I don't like um it's the first
problem is the rules and regulation for
udemy the terms and conditions for the
quantity is very bad again it's not bad
for others it's not good for me because
I'm doing YouTube and YouTube gives me a
bit of it exhibited right again YouTube
is not a education platform it's a check
it's not what you say it's an impact
form but it was I did it in a platform
now it is you know if you see the blog
it's if you see the tagline of YouTube
videos it says broadcast yourself
so whatever you are if you are a single
broadcast yourself if you are dancer
yourself is a trainer broadcast yourself
right and that's why I believe more on
YouTube than on udemy so I'm not saying
I will not be making courses on udemy
future I might I might put all the
courses for free because I don't like
that present scheme or if I even if I
upload a Content autonomy for a paid
course even that would be having a fixed
price not like two hundred dollars and
then so I can say ten dollars I don't
like that scheme so yeah that's about
udemy if I if I get something what about
you tell me why I am not having in fact
it's not just dude I mean I got rather
you know it since I'm a youtuber record
system good to my subscribers now so I
do get mails from different platforms
you know they want me to make courses
for their platform in fact not just one
I guess every week I get you know I get
some meals you know from this from
different platform you will not believe
there are more than 100 hundred
platforms education platform online you
know and from everywhere I do get some
means make a Java Java course for there
may be some sprinkles for them and from
the good publishers as well so some
there are online good publishers the oil
court I got a request from them as well
and the only thing is I mean I don't
want to work with them some of them but
then the time is the issue but some of
the some of the platform I don't feel
that good
so yeah that's what maybe in future I
will be having a course there okay so
that's about why not udemy and YouTube
is the best platform right and you are
learning everything properly on YouTube
so why not and and this is a better
connect then you know you cannot go live
on udemy so so that's that's the answer
for all the questions who are asking me
why I don't have my course on udemy in
fact I was getting this question for a
long time but then recently I got a lot
of questions why why not let me after
the last video which I have uploaded on
about D courses so yeah so let's get
started so I got so many questions here
let me start with where ever I can see
okay so Prakash says which platform do
you prefer to learn okay so if I want to
learn something I first go to a proto
site because I do have a pulse or the
ground I'm not saying it is best for you
it's just that I don't know I feel
comfortable with it you can also get
these three months free subscription for
closed site there are some ways to do
that initially I started with that and
then now I'm paying for the paying for
produce sites I guess I have quasi
subscription now yeah I have done people
I have paused subscription from last two
months I'm not using pure site for last
two months but maybe I will again resume
it to learn something new I guess they
don't have blockchain you know if or if
they have not you know I will review it
okay so I can see yeah so 160 people are
watching this and no it's come on guys
if you enjoy these set up sessions that
keep up like with that okay so great so
next one is yeah my favorite platform
has a pro site next I prefer to read
documentation nowadays and I have I've
got this one thing nowadays read
articles and don't learn okay
implement so I don't know from last year
I guess someone I was talking to someone
from the industry and he has given me
the step don't tell don't learn
implement stuff you know the moment of
the moment you start implementing things
at that point you will realize
what you can do with the technology so
how I learn now I don't read I don't
watch videos I implement okay I read and
I implement I also watch video but not
the entire series what I do is I let's
say if I want to learn about the thing
we should have talked about Portland you
know in June somewhere I've made the
entrances of Portland
sohow island quatrain I read the
articles I let some books not the book
but then the articles I guess I've read
the documentation of Portland and then I
was doing some experiment and while
doing experiment I realize okay this is
what you can do with Courtney this is
what you can do it Cortland and the
entire steps is my own syllabus so
that's how I learn now even you can try
that but I will I'm not sure will it be
good for everyone everyone have a
different way of learning some people
love videos and that's why you watch my
videos right some people like to read
books in fact I have talked to some
other industry experts as well their
eyes when I go to different training
they like reading they don't like
watching videos in fact when I asked do
you watch my videos they say no if we
don't watch you YouTube to learn
something new so what they do is they
read books they read articles and that's
I guess that's why I started reading
articles now thanks to those people and
the articles are amazing you know and
even I'm thinking about writing blogs
now from a long time I was thinking
about it I I know it sounds locks on
them in 20 so I have a blogger account
I forgot so I have two blogs and no one
is reading the acts maybe in future I
will start making more blogs I would
write I will try to write because
writing is good so reading and writing
is a good habit so I will try I will try
to read or write articles as well let me
know your thoughts should I write the
articles believers of support me in that
because if I had articles it will be
horrible and you have to lie you have to
say it is good you know so that I will
be getting what you did well I will try
that
okay so god up say college is giving me
zero practical knowledge and it's
lobos's 15 years old that's why I am NBC
a first year so why a company require a
degree I'm myself the vault on Java and
data structure skills daily two to three
hours that's great you know I love
people who work hard
other than depending on the quality
levels so
yes there is a issue with colleges
nowadays you can blame two you can blame
different stuff here you can blame your
teachers you can blame your department
you can blame your college you can blame
your new University but I feel it is the
root cause the university itself they
are not able to manage the entire crowd
they are just trying to make money and
since they are trying to make money they
don't want to provide a good syllabus
because if the updates and APIs they
have to update causes as well if they
want to update college they have to
update teachers and you have to Train
preachers every day
and it is possible what you can what
what they can do is they can you know
they can take these teachers from the
colleges and they can train them for one
week let's say if they introduce a new
technology in the syllabus let's I do I
guess we have distributed computing you
know in all these novice most of these
novice but I've never seen anyone
teaching issue in computing properly so
what they can do is they can ask and
this industry expert they can call them
or maybe cloud computing so they can
call them to the college and they will
provide training to this college
faculties and then faculty will know
something how to teach that subject and
that's the first thing second the
payment teachers are paid very less you
know compared to these example if you
let's say if you if you're good at
something if you are good with
programming you're good with technical
skills and you are also good with
communication what you will do is you
will search for the job in the industry
and since you are going to industry we
do not have teachers right and people
who are not any job they the last option
they have is to be a teacher
what if they increase the salary of
teachers that's one of the way you can
you know you can improve the age of the
system so I feel teachers are paid way
less so that's one thing we can do and
we have to also change the attitude of
students you know nowadays I'm seeing
all the college students you know I
don't know if you know this I used to be
I used to go to colleges for teaching
earlier so I used to visit colleges as a
visiting faculty not as full-time but I
never really felt you know that people
are interested only five to six people
from the entire past they were
interested because the moment you know I
have this habit of eating extra things I
don't know if we
people who attend my sessions live and
the class sensation they know what I do
is I talk about the concept and then I
take some real-life example I talk about
general I get technology in every
session of two hours I spend fifteen to
twenty minutes only on the extra things
example if I'm teaching Java I may talk
about Bitcoin I am i talk about
blockchain I may talk about distribute
computing I am I talk about clouds no
nothing to do with these levels and some
people they are interested some people
they are not and that's where I lost my
touch with students you know then I
thought okay they are not interested why
to teach them and that's why I went to
you too because when YouTube people who
want to learn on the day will join
people who don't want to learn they will
know and I think that's so simple right
people who are watching this video now
they are interested in learning so
that's that's that's why I don't like
college so I don't know the environment
anti environment is very bad nowadays so
first of all we have to make sure that
your new city is going University is
doing good again something there and so
teachers they have to update themselves
and teachers should be paid I mean they
are not happening but that at least the
amount they should be paying they should
be getting and the attitude of students
they have yeah students have to be
motivated first huh enough of the you
know of this thing okay let's get
started
yeah and the question is why you need
degree because that's how it works you
know see because it's not about teaching
it's about have you passed the exams
example if you want to clear software
engineering exam of course you will read
something right so that's why we have
the degree quality degrees you'll be
having approximately 25 to vary subjects
in that degree if you if you can at
least see all the subjects not reading
entire book but then if you know to be
substrate it will be helpful for a
software developer
okay so that says when we'll get spring
hibernate lecture for free surely not
the live session but then you will get
the videos for sure in maybe around
April or May because time being and busy
with some other other projects and the
videos in next month I have a personal
work okay so I will be see for next two
months and
I'm getting free in April and I'm then I
will start with the three videos but
sure in this platform will give you a
lot of lot of videos in future okay so
I'm I'm you know I'm motivated now so
let's see how it was and if you can see
from last one week I have a plated so
many videos because I'm motivated now so
thanks to you people you know okay to be
honest I recently I got bitten
demotivated because of some external
factors and now again I'm going so this
is like a sign you know I was on top I
was motivated and then I was going down
and down and down then I got some good
people to talk to and then I went going
up and absurd is that a sine wave now so
I'm going okay so thermometer I go down
let me know you can motivate me that
okay so I'll just says hello so great to
see you again how can I work with you
I'm basically asking for internship
under your supervision oh that's great I
was in fact I was looking for internship
not now I was looking for internship in
October and now I'm again I'm thinking
about giving internship but maybe maybe
me so somewhere around April May I will
go for the online internship or you can
say remote internship where you will not
be being with me physically in one room
all in one office will be having the
virtual office so you can work from
anywhere I will be giving you some tasks
to do and let's see how it goes maybe a
paid one or the free one that's a
different thing but yes I'm thinking
about giving internship and there's that
next thing I'm also thinking about
opening a good office where I can call
people back make me to have meetups but
the only thing is to invest since and
making all the causes for free I'm just
searching for a way to generate revenue
so that I can improve the quality I can
get a good office but I can make good
videos I'm thinking about animations you
know but then that will need some
investment and also thinking about
donations you know if you can donate to
dance cause I think that would be
awesome son still going in a way to how
I can generate revenue so that I can
open office now
so again I guess on the web on our
website there - we know donation but
then I'm also thinking about patreon now
I have a patreon account you can be a
patreon
patreon for my for this channel Lexi
okay so question is from southern
MacBook Air for programming sir not have
budget for Magnaflow yes MacBook Air is
enough for programming but the only
thing is the moment you talk about
Android studio that we've talked about
visual studio if you talk about Xcode
this Sophos are bulky it's not that they
will not run on macbook air it's just
that it will be bit slower right what
can expect from Mac is speeding right
and the moment you start walking on
macbook air and if you're using Android
studio I feel it will it will slow down
your machine one thing you can do is you
can don't run emulators you can use your
mobile phone as your output device I
guess that should be enough but if
you're not investing on macbook air and
if you can invest some mode on macbook
pro that will be awesome I'm not I'm not
saying to buy the newest night Book Pro
I want will also do 2015 what is perfect
2014 one is also perfect so you can go
with that option as well 14 15 16 17 so
all these three years whatever budget
whatever comes in your budget go for it
the only thing is MacBook Air is not for
programmers it is for business people
Chloe's Papa grammars if you're thinking
about long term go for my GoPro okay
next one is which book for data
structures in Java just go to Amazon
search for leader searches in Java
whichever get whichever book gives you
the first result you can go for that the
thing is there is no book which is bad
the only thing is everyone have their
own way own liking I don't like any
books on inner structures I don't know
why I tried append bugs but then I'm not
liking those books maybe the flow is not
good maybe the flow which I want it is
not the way they have oh maybe I don't
like it structures okay I cannot
recommend you any book there but you can
go to go to Amazon good see for the
reviews you know that's how I buy books
so go for the title read the reviews and
see what is the which is a bush the best
book there okay do you know Michael
services a bit
I know micro service is a bit I did only
for one month yeah and then I forgot all
the concept now I just have to refresh
so last year I was giving out training
why don't they come
and they were and I was supposed to
spend two hours I was supposed to teach
to ask micro-services
so I thought okay let's learn
micro-services and that's how I learned
microservices and now I don't even buy
anything it is something I do not
everything okay so laptop learning AI
any laptop on AI Scott just because you
are letting AI are not implementing it
so any laptop will do will work the
moment you say you want to implement AI
you want to use huge amount of data to
process that algorithm to to actually
make it AI then I would say using a
gaming machine will be Kurt so by a
server hardware all by a gaming machine
that will be better for AI because
gaming washing also have GPU if you want
some extra processing power okay so
other says sir I have asked you always
the question oh you have asked me to
make a video on how to learn Java on
this platform because I just your
question just went somewhere so I guess
that's what you're asking
so yes the video is on the way I'll be
making a video where I will talk about
after noting kochava from the videos
what you can do next so now should you
go for Android should you go for it I'd
one shower should you go for testing
should you go for what options we have
so many options of the kochava right so
which one went to go what and if you're
going for the ones I'm about to learn
first so I'm gonna make a video on that
for sure now today I also uploaded a
video on code Java now I know we have so
many version of kochava available on
this platform of this for nothing
we have approximately 183 videos already
uploaded why new videos is because those
183 videos aren't core Java available on
this platform that is for nothing just
the recording which I have done there is
very old so when I study the channel
2014 that's when I made those videos and
some videos don't have good audio
quality so what I want now is to apply
upload the videos so what I did last
year I have made a series of Java Java
tutorials to sell them but then now I'm
thinking it's not a good idea to sell
videos again I don't know this is they
some brainwashed happen in somewhere
here so now I'm applauding those videos
so those who are paid with you certainly
and now they are making them free
available for you but those videos are
not
this time they recorded in 2016 last
year 2017 well yeah
Oh 17 yeah something the same but you
know 16 are giant 2070 servers so that
is your Co Java series okay next one Oh
c-sharp videos please yes I used to hate
dotnet earlier and now since dotting is
open source so I might make Seashore
videos but then even if I makes you shop
videos it will take time because there's
so many things lined up okay what next
someone says code Java and advance our
videos in Hindi I tried you know I tried
making Hindi videos but then I don't
know why because when I talk to all
people I talk in Hindi but the moment I
see a camera I'm not comfortable talking
in these so I don't know I will try I
will try to make Hindi videos maybe
because when you look at camera you
start thinking in English because you
are talking to global audience right and
every not everyone knows in the example
in India as well in South no one talks
no one speak Hindi so that's where the
problem starts but I will try so you can
see I have another channel which is not
even ready so just go to that channel I
might upload any videos there not on
this channel this is purely English
Channel because this is a global channel
okay so what next
so Scala videos yes I'll be continuous
color with your later
so once I'm talking about all these
things I will start with Scala as well
okay next next next
okay can I pursue a career in it applies
without much coding yes editing this
also has a maintenance part you know
ADL's is not about only about the other
person of yours has deployment it has
some different services where you don't
need coding skills what you need is good
understanding how cloud works good
understanding how to deploy application
a good understanding of how to monitor
application because a doubles provides
you services like cloud watch where you
can actually see the things how your
approach is performing so yes you don't
need much putting skills for some
modules on a diverse and just go to add
a percent rate account that you will see
so is
is dead okay
I'm not Nick Python should I also go for
Java complete complete complete Python
first and then go for Java don't learn
badly I mean you can learn quite badly
those there's nothing wrong with that
but then if you face some issue you are
very stuck so complete Python first and
then go for Java Java necessary had you
also work on Hadoop using Scala Java and
Python in fact you can also use our
programming language but Java since I do
piece built on Java if it's better to
use Java for Hadoop so it's not
compositing but then it's a best option
okay so I don't say it's no need so your
English is easy to understand oh thank
you so much I tried to keep it as simple
as possible
okay okay okay raise the questions okay
so Java swing core Java effects no long
time getting this question a lot of
course JavaFX thing is all now okay so
age 26 what are gonna learn what I can
learn you can know anything I would say
go for this in technologies because see
nowadays we have this craze of
programming and programming and
programming everyone talks about
programming but what I feel now is
programming is just one time in so if
you want to perceive your career in a
good way it's not about programming it's
about technology which technology or
choose example if you want to be a
developer it's not just about Java is
not just about XML it's also about how
Android works how efficiently you can
make an application on Android platform
you know it's also about UX it's also
about the performance because you can
see you have some apps which is famous
apps which works week smoothly and the
Sun there's some ass which doesn't work
smoothly right because they don't know
how I enjoyed works so you have to be
yeah when you write a code you have to
think also about the how Android will
work internally so learn technology I
would say go for using technologies now
machine learning is booming then
blockchain is the future so if you
really want to enhance your skill now if
you want to learn something new I would
say
option is awesome to start with that I'm
not sure I cannot say hundred-person
doctoring a future but 99% I feel
blockchain is a future because I have
read multiple articles because in fact
you don't know the moment I started
writing blockchain and now when I open
Facebook I get an ad from IP and
blockchain so I p.m. have that module on
blockchain blockchain so you can think
about this right I company like IBM they
are trading leblanc change services so
it is a future right in fact in India
ICICI Bank already started working on
blockchain so it's a good future it's
not something new
what is blocked another not log change
blockchain be l OC k CH AI n blockchain
okay so to know more about blockchain
are you making our video on that as well
a table I did with Bitcoin okay so your
way of teaching impressed me to learn
Java or thank you so much thanks so much
for that okay it is blocked in yeah
that's which is blockchain
okay so Lincoln says do charge a little
amount for the courses since we tend to
learn fast when you pay for it oh that's
right and this one this is one tendency
you have you know when you when you paid
for the course you normally are
dedicated but then I have a different
mindset if you are really dedicated to
someone you don't need to pay for it all
even if you pay for it you might back
out example I have seen a lot of people
they join Jim by paying maybe 10,000
bees and they don't show up after five
days so it's I I don't think money is
the issue nowadays it's about dedication
how committed you are now yes if you
really want to help this platform you
can donate
that's one option you can go for because
even be neat pointings I'm still
searching for a way to find it this
platform let's see if you have a session
let me know so patreon was I should say
given by one of my subscribers so I have
done that okay so make tutorials on
JavaScript the thing is JavaScript is
not is Martin
our script is not my cup of tea you know
I I know javis that I I can work on
JavaScript I can I've worked on angular
for some time maybe not for some time
but it weren't tragic I mean I'm not
comfortable with JavaScript now so many
things you have to learn you know okay
so next is charge for the courses no
maybe donation will be along this table
not everyone can pay for the charge
courses right let's see what if I charge
1000 piece for the course first of all I
don't want to charge 1000 of course
because I don't feel technology should
be so cheap it should be other three I
should be costly and that's why if you
if you see my life I shouldn't go sis
they are positive because it's about the
quality you provide so so that's one
thing so I you should get a free all it
should be a good amount since I'm making
it free if you can if you if my C's is
helpful to you you can donate if you
each is not helpful ignore right that's
my thing now this is more like a
postpaid now you don't pay and learn
learn and if you think it is what P
alright and pay whatever you watch okay
next one would be testing was a
development a both are good you know
both are awesome and both are required
we cannot see development is the best
thing because if you make a software is
not tested its of no use right example
let's say if you build an application
for banking and that you are not testing
it you are risking billions of dollars
if you're making an application for
let's say flight the aeroplane and
you're not testing it you're risking it
so testing is very important now which
one to select is dipping up on your
mindset if you think you can solve
issues go for I mean you can solve real
problems go for development if you feel
you know how to test stuff you know how
to have a different mindset towards
things then go for testing I feel
testing is more about your mindset the
way you think about something how
negative you can be but I don't know it
okay you know that just kidding so so
support free learning please yeah it's
free it's free
how to increase both proficiency for
programming it's very simple work and
start working don't just learn things
start implementing it because the more
you implement that's how you learn
let me give you a example of my video
editing so when I started learning how
to edit videos I was I was never I never
felt comfortable while I was watching
someone else video so I went to YouTube
to search how to edit a video in
Camtasia because I use Camtasia for
editing or recording editing I know I'm
noob there but then yeah I use Camtasia
and I was not feeling you know I was not
feeling good about those videos because
we don't want awesome but then I was not
able to implement that one day when I
did I stopped watching videos I started
using Camtasia and step-by-step I
realized okay this is awesome you can
see so many features so I feel watch the
videos of course and then also work on
it the more you practice that's how you
will improve your proficiency so I can
edit now videos quick I mean faster than
the way I used to do earlier so I can
see 155 people are watching this and
once and good likes yeah so if you are
just joined click on like button let me
know if you're enjoying session okay so
okay what next new like what course I'm
not good with your network you know
there's something but difference between
what you know is and what you teach I
don't teach things which I only know if
I have not implemented it then I don't
want to teach it so that's the thing
okay so you're coming for career in
physical acting not okay I'm not a good
person to ask for that ethical hacking
okay so best back-end done up a language
I will always choose Java but then you
can also go for JavaScript all Python
does those are good options okay
oops design pattern I have uploaded
videos on design patterns the basic
concept of Oaks and I'm trying to make
three videos on opps only theory about
herbs you know what is abstraction what
is ni times in theory okay no practical
implementation the typical oops concept
object-oriented designs
I will think I'm thinking about that let
me just think and let me just see how do
i how do I do that
oh okay
future of skylight so it has a good
future because of big data now so this
path framework which is very famous
Apache spark it is very cue thing Scala
it uses color to to to to complete the
task so it has a good future okay Oh
question what is a difference between
Java and JavaScript okay
I'm a big fan of Java and I don't like
Java said okay it's not I don't like
JavaScript but I'm not comfortable
JavaScript but okay just to give an
example here I read this code somewhere
okay no he's not taught my coach so
difference between JavaScript and Java
Java and JavaScript is same as the
difference between car and a cockpit
they both have a car spelling but then
they're two different things so Java and
JavaScript there's very different
technologies it's just that when
JavaScript came into existence it was a
it was a it was having a different name
but it was not famous so they wanted to
make it famous and Java was famous so
they are taken to the java name and now
it is JavaScript but Java and JavaScript
have nothing to do with each other
nothing good if um things oh okay oh
okay gosh
okay so I'm a soul are not doing Java
and other courses since last three years
should I continue yes if you're slow
learner then focus on your own
technology don't try to learn other
things start with one complete properly
and then go for the next one that's the
best option okay so they last five
minutes because after this I'm going
live on the another channel which is not
infinity that that will be a fun
challenge we will do some fun there this
is where you
we'll talk about programming so maybe
next seven minutes seven minutes more
okay use off it was Darwin industry
everyone okay most of the technologies
which I mean most of the company which I
visited they use it once doubt that so
what I said once allies it's about the
plain frameworks like strictly work
hybrid framework then maybe some
companies also uses towards so yes it
has a good future
currently lots of companies are using at
one spot which is the spring thing work
hibernate framework the Java EE stuff
basically okay
okay so Django spring nodejs unbiased
opinion first of all I have never worked
on Django and no J so I cannot comment I
have worked on spring and I would say
spring is awesome the way you can build
an application and it is so it's not
just about building application is also
about maintaining the application
solving the bugs because development is
not only about making new things you
have to make thing which works and trust
me if you make a software or the website
on spraying it works I don't know why
but everything is so smooth there you
know everything makes so logical sense
so it works I cannot say that with
JavaScript because job when I tried
learning JavaScript and I was facing a
lot of issues some time it works some
time it doesn't work there's so many
dependencies I don't know why what's
what's wrong there mostly I cannot
comment on the other two frameworks okay
okay all the questions okay so many
questions on hacking
I don't know hacking so I can't comment
yeah future of Python it's bright it's
very right thanks to machine learning
thanks to all this new technologies
nowadays they are using they are using
Python in fact Google is using Python a
lot
so yes pattern is good it has a good
future who is a car between okay of
course Java is a car there come on
okay not with the technology but with
the Spelling's you know the Java is card
and JavaScript is a carpet ok nothing
against JavaScript here ok so the thing
it's not my quote by the way it's
someone else good I just wanted to
convey that do different things
ok so please make a nice logo for your
channel so I'm not a good artist but if
it can help me here you can make a good
logo for my channel I can send it to me
I will surely use it so send me
something a good logo if you if you have
one for me Java with automation is good
yes it's very good job with automation
is very good
 a jaw-dropper should I learn
what I should what should I learn next I
do yes if you if you know Hadoop a bit
start with head you or maybe not just
idea we can also start with spark that
will be the option for you oh okay how
to use heck a drink I could earth
website it's very simple just go to
hacker let's get a great account and
start with small questions start solving
start with small questions and that's
how you start with it okay let me just
see the specs here four more minutes
guys for one which is always 640 and we
are supposed to end it at 6:45 so after
this I will be going live on another
channel the other channel which I have
ok that's great
so make a video of your time management
or surely I'm not that good with time
management but I try to use my time as
much as possible so yes I will
everything about everything about it
okay what okay what after pooja what
should I learn Java I fix all Android I
would say go for Android now Java is
also good but then see it's all depend
upon which type of market you want to
target if your target mobile platform go
for Android because we have so many
users who are using more mobile than
desktop right so every day you use your
mobile phone a large compared to a text
job so I would say go for go for Android
it's good ok so when you will be getting
o talk about that question right so it
will be everything but in April or May
ok so book will go says can I ask taking
a question another channel I would say
ask here taking a question will be here
and then the fun will be there so so
another channel which is having 20 that
we will only do fun there let me just
share the channel channel here I would
say don't mean ready if you search for
having 20 I guess that Chan is not
coming on top I don't know why so
basically I have three channels one is
the very old one which I don't use now
I'm showing the link here so that you
can if you have a question ok so next
question how to practice code like
professional start working on project
and the more project you work on that
saw us work you will learn as expert or
professional because professionals don't
just learn they implement right okay the
best language to learn in 2018 your
opinion okay first I would say Python
second I would say Java so this two
language I love okay next question
please make videos on spring and
hibernate surely I say as I mentioned in
me it'll be having those videos maybe
before that if I can complete all the
other work because I have to complete
these toads videos are in knots towards
some it and JSP then I have to complete
the code Java videos which I started
uploading today and the dinner
structures after that I was going to
start with Oh blocks is also there after
that I will start with spring and
hibernate okay learn g TK okay just for
someone else not for me maybe okay okay
trying to find projects Google okay so I
am learning iOS application please
suggest me best place to learn Swift
save questions on my side even I'm
looking for the best place to learn
Swift I'm not and that's why I went when
you died me for one of the course on
swept last last year I guess I lost you
and I've not got any good resources for
it there are video there application
available then I'm not comfortable with
those things maybe you are comfortable
you can go with that so thank you sir
la flama they poured oh that's great
okay okay can I get a job despite being
without programming yes
ite is not only about programming Ike is
about so many things you know we have so
it acknowledges it's also about testing
also about deployment also about support
databases are so many things available
why it is if you're not really good
programming that's cut I mean that's
okay okay so even if you are not good at
programming at least basics of
programming is important not the
advanced part but basic should be good
okay not good you should know you should
know basic and learn technology which
you want to work with just oh you only
be tested testing if you want to be a
deployer go for the ops that's the best
option now okay so wishing you plump it
up
oh hi laughter Mumbai or desk wait okay
okay so great a so many questions here
so that's it everyone it's it's all in
645 so I have to go live for another
channel for 15 minutes and then I have
some other work this is Sunday so it's
from any time also so I'll just spend
some time with my family so I have to go
out so yes so that's it from this
channel this this live session I hope
you enjoyed that you know any comments
in the chat window and the King because
like button if you enjoyed this session
and that's it I'll see you on the other
channel so paste the link here let me
just pitch it again so with that channel
like that channel that's my personal
channel so I cannot see any likes there
is it any like I don't know so go to the
channel and see you there everyone will
do some thing there some so musty boo
