from political earnings and in this
video we'll talk about seekbar so it is
sake bus so you can see in this output
will try to do this so if I drag it so
if I drag this Sigma you can see the the
value here is increasing so it goes from
zero to hundred and we are also
increasing the size of this text here so
as as you move your sake bar it is
changing the size of the text okay you
can change edit you can do anything with
this sig bar it's just a demonstration
of how to you how to use a cig bar here
okay so it goes from zero to hundred you
can you achieve anything here so let's
see so let's see the code how to do this
so now let's see how to do it so what
well does and this let me create so we
have a view here already have data that
this view in which we have a text view
where we have printed a and we are made
sure that it will match the parent and
we have placed it in the horizontal
center so that we can see a here now
what we need one more thing here is a
seek bar right so we will drag this seek
bar here will keep it somewhere down the
side will keep a margin in between this
two so I will set a margin top as maybe
a 100 so that we need like big gap okay
now so what we'll do now is we'll proper
form some arc action inside the Java
file so for that when you could be
required to things require text view or
we'll name this as TV which is textview
and we require the seekbar well then
this as SB right and in this voice
create the object of this to TV and SB
will say this is SB is your seek bar so
SB equal to seek bar and which is fine
bill by ID which is r dot r dot Sigma
all right that's the that's the name of
this seek bar inside your layout now
next we require is TV so it's a TV equal
to
is your textview will say fine view by
ID which is r dot ID dot was the name of
the textview here okay its value let's
name it as a way to keep it value no
issue we'll say this is value right now
once we got this to what we need wait to
add the listener to this c bar now how
to add a listener to the sake bar we can
simply say SP dot set on click listener
okay so since we want to not on till u
s-- now this will be set on Sigma
changed listener because we are changing
the value of the seek bar right and then
we have to say on C bar change listener
it will give you three methods one will
be on progress change so every time you
move this seek by one by one it will
call this method and then before study
before causing this method it will say
on start tracking on on start tracking
touch and then on stop tracking touch so
will not use these two methods we can
also use it but have time being will use
this this method which is on progress
change in fact you can do some tags so
you can do some experiment using this
two methods you can print some message
okay but will use this on focus change
so how how to change the see every time
you would change the seek bar it will
change this one which is in progress
okay so let's say if you see if you move
your sink back to five it will update
this progress to five okay
now let's set the text so I will say T V
dot to change the text size we can say
set text size and we can mention his
size here we can say focus but it really
very small right it will move from one
to hundred so let's multiply this number
by ten okay so it will go it will go
beyond that let's make it five I to make
it ten let's make it five I guess ten
will do that no no the problem is
sometimes you are
it makes your system down so we'll keep
it five into five okay so if you run
this code your sig bag will work and
let's let us try let's try it and if I
run this code in my Nexus 5x
so it will take some time to load my
time let me just pause the video so this
is the emulator if I open this if i
unlock the simulator you can see we got
our app here which is a which is it text
and then this is your seek bar so now if
I move this seek bar you can see the
size of your text is changing okay so it
is changing and then we got no it is go
it went beyond the limit because we have
meant 8 if we have said into 5 right so
just changing that text also so that's
how we can use sake bar to increase font
size so how he is walking let us let's
print it value also let me just print
that progress bar let me just just print
that progress value on wet wet print
let's take one more field where we will
print that let me just copy this code
and paste it here okay this will have a
different value we'll say this is a
watch now we'll say this is V I'm not
getting in a new variable name so this
is V here we don't want to keep it in
Center let's remove that let's remove
the gravity and we do not want to say
this is match padding this is web
content so we got one more textview
there which will have a value of the
progress and for that we need to create
the object here so we'll say this is so
that's T V comma T V one right and then
we will say this is T V 1 equal to we'll
copy the same text and we'll paste it
here ok and this one will be V right and
we want to set the text of this progress
bar or in the focus bar with the seek
bar in T V 1 dot set text and we'll set
it text as focus will also go into
string right because when you set set
text it requires a string it will not
support end so we have to give double
quotes that will convert into in format
let me show you something if I remove
this
you can see we go we are getting some
warning here oh it's working that's nice
that's nice it's working
so I have to change it to string and
we'll also set some text here we'll
print a toast here so say this is toast
dot make text we'll say this is main
activity dot this gamma will print
started and here we'll say this is toast
so that those dot long or going to give
it shot okay
and now let's run this let's see what's
happening so if I run this code oh
there's one more thing I did change
let's let's remove that into five or
let's keep it went to or let's remove
that let's see before I think if I
remove this what what it will do and if
I removing after removing that will turn
it so once again and then it will take
some time to load okay just loaded let's
run this oh it's not working because of
some other so what is the error here it
is getting crashed because of this was
not found okay that's weird
a TV one not found but we have specified
TV one and inside this also we have
mentioned V okay everything makes sense
here why is the error
let's put string there and office guards
issue let's run this once again and
let's dry ok so it's working now because
it was string there we cannot pass any
way to pass string and then if you run
this you can see we getting we're
getting the output and the maximum value
you can go from zero it goes from zero
to 100 right so that's your seat bar
sounds good so that's how you can use
Sigma in your project it can be used for
multiple use that is one of the use of
Sigma yes it is that's it from this
video and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
