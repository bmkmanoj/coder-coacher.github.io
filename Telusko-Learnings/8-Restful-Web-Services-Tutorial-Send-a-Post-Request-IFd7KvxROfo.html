create a get request and a post request
now you can achieve a get request from
your browser right you can directly go
and you can paste this link the problem
starts when you have a post occurs
because this is where you have to
mention the post because see when you
talk about your browser we have your
other supports get requests the eval
support post request but maybe in future
will be working on put requests may be
delayed requests in that scenario we
have to use some sort of client which
will send all the sub of requests again
you can use JavaScript here but then we
don't want to write any of the code so I
will be using a tool as postman again we
have seen how to use this tool and how
these tools is made or I mean how to
download this tool and how to make it
open so let's try to run this code so
what I will do is I will first of all on
this code just to make sure that
everything is working fine so I will
click on this and click on Run button so
the non server again it will take some
time to start the server and sort of the
things okay so as you can see our server
started and this is the or the quest but
again I don't want to use a web request
here I mean I don't want to use drugs I
want to use postman and in here I will
send a request for aliens this is a get
request I would say get requests and
send as you can see we got the data but
now this time I want to I want to go for
a post request right now let me dig
nurse verify with above row table
because I'm sending so you can see I am
sending a XML request now if you want to
send a post request again we have to use
XML right because if you can see we have
an alien where we have written XML root
element so that means we are expecting a
XML zeroes let me go back to my postman
and I want to create a new object so I
will I was just popping this so that I
will be having some sort of template
with me so the copy this and then now
what I will do is I will go for a post
request I will say post but this time
you have to send a request could - for
aliens - aliens / alien
and if I click on sign you can see we
got an arrow
it says unsupported Mir type and then
all those things that for that you have
to mention the header whatever data you
are sending so the data you are sending
is not Jason but XML because you are
supporting only XML and even when you
send send now again it says bad request
because see you are sending a request
but you're not sending data right you
should be sending data as well so in
that case you have to go to body and you
have to mention XML and that page of XML
what I have to send now is I will be
sending the ID as one zero five then
I'll be using a name here called as
harsh and let me just use a points as
let's say 40 points now with this value
let me send other quest and you can see
we are getting this data back and if you
can verify on the server Oh on the
server side we are getting this weird
output because I forgot to put two
string method here my bad
because to print the values we should be
having two Scimitar as well right
because otherwise it will print the hash
code so let me say John done generate
two string and click on OK now as you
can see we got our two string method el
and let's get back first of all you have
to raise on the code or it's already
done let's go to post one once again and
click on send now you can see we got our
data which is coming from the client
right again you can write it a piece of
code here and you can save this data in
a database the important thing is now
you know how to send a post request now
just to make a quick recap what we have
done if I open that and is the postman
so if I open up Forsman here as you can
see we have we are sending data so you
have to make sure that when you send as
it pours data on the server it is select
post from here you have to mention the
URL again you have to mention the alien
as well then you have to say click send
but before sending you have to also send
the data right so I am using Azure data
here enroll it or you have to type your
XML and then you can specify whatever
data you are sending so you're sending
an XML type data not d jason and in
headers you have to also mentions
whatever data you are sending so that's
XML and click on send you can see your
sending your data back to the server so
that's how you send a post request
but then how do we use a maybe you maybe
you want to do something else now maybe
you want to send a put request how to
update data how to delete data again
we'll be saying everything in the
subsequent tutorial so I hope you're
enjoying this session duplicate like
