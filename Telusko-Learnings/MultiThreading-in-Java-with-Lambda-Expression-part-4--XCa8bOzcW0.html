last three tutorials we talked to be
talked about threads how to use lambda
expression with thread now in this we'll
try to make our cord look more beautiful
it's because the mean the main reason
why we have this lambda here is just to
make your code more beautiful more
readable or less code okay so what we'll
do now that we focus here the sole
purpose of this T reference here is to
call start right that means we are using
this T only once so what we can do
instead of using name the reference we
can directly say we can directly say
it's the object dot start because once
whenever you use an object only for once
you can do it try to get a reference you
can directly use an animal's object so
you can see we have removed that T also
be so we have to reduce one more line
now what next we can apply this same
funda on this class a so instead of
using a class a and start instead of
creating a class here what we'll do
we'll we'll fetch this code with it's
important code up side okay
so again after after doing some
manipulation the ultimately the ultimate
code I will be getting is this it should
be something in this way so basically it
will be the copy of this so I will say
let me copy this and paste now if you
create this two copies one will be hello
and second will be hi
so one will print hello again with a
print hi and again you can have hello hi
and you can have hi hello what I want
there there's the yeah what I want now
even if I don't this quote now let me
show you the output it would still work
and the output is
is this hello hi hi hello hi hello hi
hello
so you can see it's working in pattern
but the problem is both these thirds are
starting at the same time what if we can
just provide a delay there so we can
just we can just use this line which is
this one so that we can probe just
provide our delay between two threads
and instead of going with this one
second delay we can have 200
milliseconds delay and yes now now we
have we can we can run this code
apparently so you can see hello hi hello
hi hello hi and you have all the streams
right that means we are able to run the
code badly now let's try to reduce the
code a bit
now what if if I go here and instead of
writing this code inside your triad see
if you compare both the code they look
quite similar right it's quite similar
now what I can do is I can just define
our material and the method name will be
public void show okay and this show will
take a string parameter may be string
STR and it will print this text yes I'm
sure writing code here let me write the
code here and it's our printing hi let
me print the value of STR so this is
Thiago printed here cool
and here we can call we can call this
show getting in now here we can call
this show now how to call show here it's
very simple just simply say new the
class name is multi-threading is because
to could to call this method we have to
use we have to use an object of the
class and then we can say show and we
can pass here we can pass hello
I mean we can print a hi hello in any
format
and we have any problem you know okay
and then okay there is some problem I
guess
oh and the same thing will do here will
say new it's multi thread dart show and
we'll say it's hi
and it will give us semicolon here yeah
okay now let me in this code hi hello hi
hello there was some problem here
did I missing something here no and here
I called it as hi still there's an error
and I was a problem it's it's not been
issued anyway let me run this code again
you can see we are trying to achieve
your bad ilysm but still there's an
although everything looked good I guess
there is some bug in NetBeans does the
issue of anybody work with this new
software's and let me just find out the
bug if you have any I've said true I say
it everything okay let me just reduce
the core bit more I hope I will get some
sort of a little start of expression
does it have extra bucket - the bucket
yes I have an extra bucket here so this
is my main open-close open-close
open-close
it's open clothes they look perfect
right oh I'm writing this code inside
mean I'm doing it happens out of
anywhere when you make your code more
beautiful they might did my gender
semana
that's a funny part anyway so I have I
was writing my voice show function
inside mean that was the problem okay
now if you can see if I done this code
it's hi hello hi hello hi hello hi
alright so we are trying to reduce the
code as much as we can
now if you see whenever you work with
lambda expression you just don't require
these curly braces because you have only
one statement right so what we can do we
can just get rid of this curly brackets
and we can say add oh and week and I
agree that this statement here and when
you have only one statement no need off
this semicolon and no need of this
bracket we can directly end our
statement up side okay so that and we
can use the same code copy we can have
the same code here so I should have
hello we can say we can specify we can
say hello now I can see we have reduced
our code so much you can compare the
first example in this example the number
of lines have reduced the code look more
beautiful it's more readable we are we
are focusing more on implementation more
on what it does then how it does right
so that's the importance of lambda
expression and that's the importance of
Java 8 feature so if you run this code
again you will see hi hello hi hello hi
hello right
and that's multi-threading with lambda
expression so I hope you got what I
meant to convey now if you have any
doubts please comment and do subscribe
