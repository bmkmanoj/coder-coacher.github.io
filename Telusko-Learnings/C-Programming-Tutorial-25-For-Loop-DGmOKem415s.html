right now what we'll do is in this
example we'll convert while loop into a
for loop now the advantage of using
formed up is so when you talk about
while loop we have the step side so we
have to provide the initial value we
need to provide condition and way to
provide increment and decrement or
decrement right so we have to provide
these three things in three different
lines because while loop is only
concerned about the condition it is not
concerned about the initial value it is
not concerned about the increment part
so while is only concerned about the
condition so in for though what we can
do is instead of using while loop we can
in further we have to specify three
things so first is initial
initialization then you have to specify
condition and we can specify increment
so in each in initiative we can mention
here which is I equal to 1 and then we
have to provide a semicolon as we have
done in this line then we have to give a
semicolon to provide the increment part
which is I plus plus so we do not have
to define we don't have to initialize
the value here so that means we no come
in required no comment required and we
don't have to mention this also so we
can write only one statement here in the
for loop which is print F and all the
three important statements in the for in
the same line so this is initial value
this is condition and this is increment
and decrement so now if I run this code
you will be getting the same output
hi-hi-hi for the 5 time so if you think
which is better for the plight not
exactly depend upon your requirements we
can use different loops again in the
further example we'll see I went to use
while know when to use for Logan to use
do-while loop for time bin know you know
you know the syntax right we can use
while loop within your condition we can
you do a loop in which you will execute
the block at least once and in further
we can specify all the three important
statement in the same line cool yeah
that's that's how you use a for loop and
the further for the examples
take some coding example just to work
hard on this loop part so thanks for
watching and make sure you watch next
