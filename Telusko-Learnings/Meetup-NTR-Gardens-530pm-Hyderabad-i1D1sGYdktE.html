announcement for the Hyderabad Meetup
okay so it was very difficult for me to
decide the place because initially I was
thinking about Heidi city then I caught
some comments that they wanted the they
wanted the meetup in amid paid now I
know there are lot of students are there
in Ameerpet and IT professionals in
hi-tech City so I was thinking about
Ameerpet the only problem is I'm not
able to find a good place to do a
meet-up in homage paid like a good
garden there might be some cousins
because I'm not I've never visited on me
the paid side I'm not sure about the
type of questions they have and is it
available for everyone to visit so
that's why I have changed the location
to ntr gardens now why entire garage
because it's nearby to everyone like
people staying in neo since are good
people can come from amid wait it's
nearby don't fold five kilometers people
staying in nampalli everyone can visit
ntr gardens right so that's why the
location isn't here gardeners now people
who are staying in Hyderabad we have a
meet-up okay just to announce it again
announce it again this time we'll have a
technical come a normal discussion meter
we'll have we'll chat chit chat about
different stuff some something about
technology something about other stuff
like YouTube so let's see how many
people can show up because it's in
Hyderabad now people wanted me to come
to I the powerful media and I'm here so
okay so okay I can see some questions
from Bangalore okay yeah but I'm
thinking about Bangla meetup as well not
sure when it will be but I will try to
do it as soon as possible maybe next two
months okay not saying much questions
because this morning time normally
people don't show up on on YouTube okay
so I've been talking a lot it's been two
minutes now okay so once again the
meetup is in Amira page not in a very
weighty ninetieth audience of people
around can come there so ntr gardens
timing is 5:00 p.m. 5:30 p.m. so I'll be
there by 5:00 okay so if you want to
come out here you can join me that but
the official rate will be 5:30 so we'll
have a meetup around 4:00
so at 6:30 we'll be closing it and so
try to be try to reach before that so
that we can have a meet so that's it
everyone I hope you look at there okay
so and yeah so in the afternoon I'm
going to I was doing some places I'll be
uploading photos if you're nearby you
can meet me for sure so that's it that's
the announcement the whatever you want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
