now let's try to code it so we have
assigned the name for all the components
so this is your edit text oh we have not
given the name for this let's double
click here and we'll provide a name
we'll say this is e t1 this is edit text
1 and this is a 282 32 ok so we got to
edit text and so this is a t1 and this
is t2 as it mentioned Oh I've mentioned
it is 82 ok now so now we have we have
all the components now the next step we
have to do is we have to write the code
for this ad now how to add the code
let's let me run this application on the
emulator first so let me just pause this
video so that I will open my emulator
and then I will run now as my mate I
started here so now what I will do let's
let's enter 2 value so when I say 9 + 6
I want to add this 2 values as like as I
click on this Add button nothing
happened it's because your button now is
deaf now what we need to add is we need
to add the listener to the button now
how to add listener so go to the Java
file now this is whenever you want to
achieve some actions you have to use
your jar of idea now the first step is
you have to create the object for all
these components so we have 4 components
here for we have yeah we have 4
components first one second one third
one and fourth one you have to work with
this components right so we have to edit
text we have one button and one text
view so to do that again we have two
more textview here why not them because
we are not changed we are not doing any
operations with that it just a label so
let's get that full objects so to get
off those four objects what we can do is
just go to this okay go here and just
type the first one which is edit text so
will require edit text here and we
required to edit text which is 81 and 82
and then next we require a button so
we'll say button B okay that's one
and require the third one let's import
the package for this so just go to the
button and say control space it will
import the package for you and the next
one is text view which is T okay so we
got this three values obviously this is
also okay
now we need to assign the memory for
those now while providing the memory you
have to also reference your edit text
which is in Java to the edit text in the
XML to do that we need to use we have to
say 81 equal to there is a method for us
find view by ID because that's a that's
a view right because every component on
your in Android they are called as views
and in this and find view by ID you have
to mention the idea of your component
which is et one but with this you have
to also mention that it is r dot r e dot
81 now this R here is a resource
this shows dot ID dot 81 now the problem
is this 81 which is in your resource is
of type edit text right so you have to
also mention the you have to also
typecast it with a hit text because it
will give you view a normal view we want
to be very specific I want edit text as
a view so that is the first one will
acquire one more now which is 82 so you
have to mention 82 and this one also 82
okay next we require a button so we'll
say again we'll just type crossed it
with button and we'll say find view by
ID we'll say r dot r dot or button name
was button BT and ad and the last one is
a and s unser witches we second find or
this is your text view which they find
view by ID and we have to mention beat r
dot ID dot what it is TBH answer okay so
now we got full confidence here now once
you once you got this four components
you have to assign the listener to the
answer now how to assign the listener so
just go back to XML or your design this
on this Add button search for the on
click event so there will be a event
colors on click you can see it's here
and will say as soon as anyone clicks on
the button just call the method which is
add so as soon as you mentioned add
there you can see there's a symbol cos M
which represents our method so in your
java code now you just have to mention
that you are working with a method which
is public void add which takes the
parameter as view okay it takes the
parameters view and as soon as you click
on this button are going to input the
package first okay and so as I so click
on this button it - let's let's print
something will print what we planed
clicked click or click on add okay and
let's run this now so if I have this
application again on the emulator so it
will take some time let's see something
is happening or not ok it will take some
time to load here okay now so I have let
us take two values one is it doesn't
matter what values we take when I click
on add oh we got the answer how is that
possible okay this is the wrong
application which is opened which
application I'm working with I have not
performed in action that's the magic
right oh I have two apps that was the
idea app so now this is H and 6 and if I
click on Add button you can see we got
something here which is called as
clicked on ad okay so that's how you can
perform an action here but I don't want
to print this right I want to perform an
action here that action is or that
operation is I want to fetch the values
of 81-82 so we'll say this is int I
equal to 81 dot get text okay but the
problem is that text will be in a string
format we need to convert that format
into integers you have to say integer
percent right
and so that's your four tet1 and we
still got an error here okay we need to
convert this into string format yes so
then we need to copy this code we want
it one more time which is here and
that's why I say it whenever we want to
learn advanced programming your java
console should be clear
okay and let me take one more which is
int K I will say I plus J and now let's
assign this value to unser now how to
assign the value so we have to say unser
which is your textview with a set text
and we can say unser is a dimension
double quotes here : and we say plus K
okay now let's run this application I
hope it will work even don't tell me it
will open the same app again the wrong
app this is the wrong app here I have to
first app so it's starting oh it so I
can open the same app I don't know
what's happening here so let me open my
app so if I enter 8 and 89 and 8 which
should be 97 right so if I click on this
Add button you can see the answer is 97
so this ad function is working because
we have assigned the on click method so
that's one way the second way of doing
this is let me just come in this part
okay the second way of doing this is but
you can add a listener to the button and
how to do that we have to say b dot add
or we have to say set on click listener
in which you have to pass the object of
on click listener so this on click
listener is an interface and we need to
create the object of interface here so
the way you can create the object of
interface is by using neo on click
listener or because we have to also
provide the implementation for that
because it's an interface alright so
this is anonymous inner class if you are
not sure it is anonymous inner class you
can just go back to my Java codes and
the Java tutorials and search for the
video on inner classes so let me just
type this thing
you search for inner classes okay in my
youtube channel also you can search for
that inner classes telesco so you will
get that video and just was that video
for this okay now let me assign that
value or let me perform this action in
that method so we can just reuse the
code okay let's copy this and paste let
me remove this comments here okay and
the proper indentation was that okay the
proper indentation here okay okay now
once you have provided proper
indentation we have assigned a listener
here and we you can see we have
commented this part now since we have
commented that part we need to remove
the action from the add button so we
need to remove this let's go back to
your codes everything seems perfect now
let's do on this application
let's just let's see if it's working or
not okay and now don't don't tell me
again it will open the same wrong app
yeah that's weird I guess maybe this is
because of the same name okay now let me
just assign values we'll say a th and
we'll say this is five if I click on add
button you can see this 93 right but
this time we are working with the add-on
click listener now that's it that's how
you can add two numbers right but let's
say you have family with the Java 8
let's say if you have already worked on
Java 8 now the advantage here is if you
have worked on Java 8 we don't require
this all this course this is a
boilerplate code here and we can provide
a lambda expression oh okay it's against
a is at not this level so you can see
there is a red symbol here we can set
the language level to Java 8 because it
only supports with Java 8 right so there
you can see we have reduced the code a
bit in fact we do not have to mention
this view also that's optional we do not
have to mention this on back
so if you don't know what I'm talking
about just go to again my youtube
channel and search for Java 8 new
features and just mention that lets go
there so that you will get my videos on
YouTube so just just search for this
video first and the that is color or
Java new videos new features ok now if I
done this code just for the last
verification again we know that it will
open my old app ok sorry for that Oh a
way to change the source code yeah I had
to do some settings there so but it
works if you run this application on
your machine I just have to change my
source level from 7 to 8 in the settings
so that will do that later but it works
you know this with this thing will work
if you have using Java 8 ok now let's go
back to the working code so that's your
working code for this you know in fact
Java it also works and yeah that's it
that's it from this code we can that's
how we can add two numbers so thanks for
watching and make sure subscribe the
channel so that you can watch for
further videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
