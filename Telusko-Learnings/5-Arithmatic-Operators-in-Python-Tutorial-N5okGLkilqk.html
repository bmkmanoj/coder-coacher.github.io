this is something frivolous learn
something called as operator so what is
operator simple answer we can we can
understand operating like home various
operations we need operators so like
this is also all technical so I will
explain assumes very simple for yes why
is it true okay so this is the
opposition
what is the hopefully what is operation
we are doing is doing addition addition
of numbers okay so these numbers are
operators and this is it so it also
there are various operators availables
like arithmetic operators comparison
operators sign and operate that logical
operator bitwise membership and identity
operators so there are many various of
leads available we will learn also like
we also learn some operators so we'll
start with arithmetic operators
so arithmetic operators like just to
explaining in arithmetic operators there
are some limited operands available what
are the friends
plus I have multiplication position so
these are our pretends available in -
walk it so well it will explode one by
one we will with variables be yes I
don't even know
then use our first operator which is
this so what is because addition okay
this object is used to add numbers okay
and the same thing if you say Street
hey sorry miss tiara and B were saying
yes to this steer this is I hope it is
also used to concatenate two strings
okay so this operators is operators
region okay this is used for addition
okay so what it does is it adds left
operand with the right operand this is
that's our friend hey no I mean what you
will see what we'll do we'll use another
so what it returns returns subjection of
favors so this gives value of right
operator X right is there any - then you
understand with this you be also hey
okay so pretty used to multiply - Oh
friend
okay now what we'll do we'll store any
say a type B so what five six okay this
is just one division our next operator
is mod operator so let's see what it
returns so again I will fill it
e3 and I restore some new values 98 and
to entry and then say a what operator
three because one
so in case we even ever fit device
the invariable divides - by 2 so in
tremenda we will get 1 so this operators
so Victor returns remainder ok now one
more thing again I will delete it and
feel it the same new back they say
thanks now what I will do I will use our
pic returns returns</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
