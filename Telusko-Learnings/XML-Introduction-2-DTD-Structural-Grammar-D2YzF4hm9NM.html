we'll talk about the grammar of XML so
we have two grammars one we have to
specify the structure or they have to
specify the content right so in order to
stroke in order to specify the grammar
for the structure we use DTD and this
DTD stands for document so this is
document type definition so your XML
documentation definition so your XML has
a proper definition all you have to
provide a proper definition to it okay
now question is how to provide a
definition so what we need here so in
your XML let's say I don't want to this
so let's say if I miss if I miss this
name so you can see we are not getting
any error so if I is even if I say by
date it is not showing any s all right
so I want to show the error so to
specify this we have to use some we have
to specify the rule so we have to first
create a DTD so I click on your projects
a new go to others and inside this
search for D T T it will give you that
file next now you have to mention the
file of you have to mention the name of
your D DT so we said this is a lien type
okay and dot D D D we will click on next
anything to mention no finish now as I
so click finish button you can see it's
a note it's also an XML file right so
DTD itself is XML file now here you have
to mention that we are using this tag
here which is aliens so this is your
alien so for this so everything here is
an element right so you have to specify
a new element you have to say not
element everything should be in capital
letters then we have to specify aliens
and in this aliens what are the elements
you have you have to mention those
elements here so we have we are
mentioned this alien at so let me just
drop it down that's better right
so now we have two window okay so we
have this alien so we have mentioned
agents element and inside this aliens we
have alien right so we'll say this is
alien now once we got alien
just attribute you have to mention or
the next element is your alien element
itself so that's element alien and in
this alien you have two things one is
name and second is Salvi right and we
have to also close this so we have
mentioned this two things here one we
got agents which is inside this you have
alien and inside alien you have name and
salary now once you have mentioned this
now let's talk about name and and salary
so we'll say element name and inside
this name what is the type of name now
so the type of name is PC data
okay so we have PC data which stands for
pass pass character data and the next
one is salary so we'll copy this and
paste so this is salary and this is of
auto type of PC title right so there is
no error now and if I right click say
write it to check everything is good
yeah so it is no I doesn't no warning
and if I go back to this file now and if
I so we have mentioned some rules let's
see let's see if we are getting some
error
okay still no either because we have not
taken this degree inside this file right
so let us take that ETD here now how to
include DDT inside this file it's very
simple just have to say not doctype so
does the thing you have to use so your
to mention everything in capital so I
have to say doctype we have to mention
what what is the element name so that's
alien
so that is aliens and after this you
have to mention there are two to
specific types one is public second a
system so let's say if you are
downloading the XML from the internet
you have to use public since we have the
system or since we have the file inside
our system will say system and we have
to mention the name of your file which
is alien type dot DTD okay at the end we
have to provide a angular brackets
closing angular bracket and now if I say
validate so you can see we got some
errors so the error is the content of
element must have an alien so we have an
alien here
but in this alien we have not mentioned
about the the attribute right so we have
not mentioned this attribute and as the
error here so let's specify the
attribute itself before that let me just
mention name so we'll remove name later
so first we'll complete the needful
we'll say this is Manoj okay so you can
see we are still getting error is
because we have not mentioned about the
attribute now how to specify the
attribute here to specify attribute we
have to say not at least okay that's the
attribute list you have to mention then
it belongs to alien right and the the
variable name which is the attribute
name is a ID and it is it is mentioned
as item ID because we want it unique so
this is like a primary key for XML or
for SQL and then we have required
requirements which is composite to have
that a ID there and we are still getting
some errors okay now what's the problem
so if I remove one x one alien so you
can see there is no problem right so
this alien can have one aliens as soon
as I write more than one alien so it
gives you an error the problem is you
can have only one element of aliens you
cannot have two elements of alien is
because by default in one parent a tag
will be you can only have one child tag
I mean one child of same one child of
same tag to mention that we are using a
one arm oh we just have to say plus plus
me it is you can have one element or two
elements by one or more than one element
you can have 10 elements 50 elements
right so that's how you mention that
now what if I remove this theme - as
soon as I remove that name if I say by
date we are getting an error it says
there is a the alien is incomplete
without name right so that's that's the
rules we have we have set here okay
looks good so we have one more thing we
can also specify one more let's say I
have one more attribute here so the
favorite language not the speaking
language but the programming language so
let's say both this
alien they they have their specific with
one language so let's say I'm
comfortable with Java and when it is
comfortable with C shops so we have this
two languages here also not c-sharp but
let's say Python right so we have Java
and we have Python right so we have this
two language but we have not specified
the attribute here so I have to specify
attribute so you have to say not at
least and you have you have to mention
it belongs to a lien on the language
name that's a attribute name language
now or we can specify it as not require
that thing we can just specify it it
here which says an error we have to
specify the okay so is it required
optional so we can set it as optional or
let's say and this will makes mention it
is optional bit work with optional let's
try now we have to mention required okay
so it again gives you an oh the
attribute type is required in the
declaration of attribute like for the
idiom what's that
okay this is problem okay anyway so
let's say I don't want to I don't i want
to be space specific here so use I can
have a language is Java or Python so we
can say the by default language itself
let's say Java okay that's a default
value they have but we can also specify
that they have some they can choose one
of them so we can say they can they can
have Java they can have a Java with
small Java or they can have a let's say
they can have C and they can have Python
so if you are specifying anything other
than this that should there should be an
error right watch the error white space
is required between the attribute and
declaration okay done
okay so that's the default values we can
specify it can have Java C or Python and
default is Java so if you don't mention
you think it will give you Java and then
we have error on this side oh okay
I don't think there's an arrow so it
should work now yes so now I does that
so we can specify any of this but let's
say if I change this byte on to let's
say COBOL so if we comfortable with
COBOL even if you say COBOL it will give
you an error because we have to choose
the element between Java C and Python so
that's how we can specify the rules with
the help of DTD but we have only used
something called a structure grammar not
the content grammar and how to achieve
content grammar that we'll see in the
next video where we talked we'll talk
about schema</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
