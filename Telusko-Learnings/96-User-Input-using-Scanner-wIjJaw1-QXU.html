now scanner is very advanced is because
I mean we had system dot in dot raid we
had before the reader then why we need
scanner is because if you look at this
code it is not that easy we should be
using something which is simple to use
which is easy to understand so what
we'll do is a shop using this type of
input here I will use a scanner now how
do we use a scanner we say scanner SC
equal to new scanner okay so that's how
you get a budget of scanner class and
it's just that when you create the onset
of scanner class was Jeff named put the
package first you have to say it's
control shift oh it will import the
package for you so scanner belongs to up
package which is Java dot util now in
this scanner you have to pass an object
so which option you have to pass you
have to pass the observation system dot
in so have to specify that from where
you are getting the input maybe I
pending the input from the file
maybe you are getting the input from the
network you are in getting the input
from the keyboard so you have to mention
that you are getting the input from the
keyboard by mentioning system dot in
there now once you do that once you
create the audit of scanner we can take
the input we can say n equal to so there
is also we can use SC dot which is the
object of scanner with the next end so
next int is a method inside scanner
which will fetch the integer value the
advantage here is you don't have to
handle the exception the second
advantage here is you don't have to
convert or string into integer that's
that's what we have done in buffer we WI
right so we have to take the input as a
string then you have to convert that
into integer using it is at a percent
but in scanner we don't have to do that
we can simply say SC dot next int as
less you do that it will fetch the value
and it will keep it will save that value
into n okay and we can simply print the
value of n now and if you on this code
it is waiting for the input will say 78
and you've got 78 it's not just that in
fact not just only for integer if you go
to scanner class there are lots of
methods which we can use methods like so
we have next int then we have next next
long we have next in fact we also have
next line somewhere so you can say we
have next double so we have all
methods which we can use we can also
have next big integer which is the
bigger integer you can use so again you
can explore this class and you can find
out different methods so that's it
that's how you that's how you use SC dot
next int and that's how you use kind of
class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
