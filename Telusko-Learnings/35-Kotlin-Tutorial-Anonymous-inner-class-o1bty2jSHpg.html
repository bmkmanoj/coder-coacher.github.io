different days for learnings and once we
have talked about object keyword and we
have also seen that how to use single
Joe and design pattern in Cortland now
again you could have done the same thing
in Java as well right but then we have
to do some extra step in Java and
Cortland makes your work very easy
whatever you do now is let's try to
understand one more use case of object
in fact there are lots of uses of it
let's see one more
now if you remember when it comes to
Java we all we also have a concept of
anonymous inner class now again if you
don't know that you can refer my video
on anonymous inner class on YouTube and
so you just search for the anonymous
inner class that is core you will get it
get the video now why do we use
anonymous inner class so let's go for
instance let's say if you have an
interface here and if I name this
interface as alien as we all are aliens
here and okay stuff in shop agent let's
go for a human because I guess lots of
people who have a problem by using that
alien keyword there so let's say we have
an interface which is human and in this
human interface we all know that we all
think so we say I will get a function
and I will name this function as string
as we all think right so we got this
interface and they are creating a
function calls think oh we are working
in Java code right so I should be
writing boy thing that's weird right so
when you are coming back to from Java to
part in got in the Java this is what
happens now what I want is I want to
create an object of human again we
cannot instantiate a human - because it
has no interface right so what you have
to do is when I say human let's say a
programmer equal to now let's say human
programmer equal to of course we cannot
say new human right because that's and
that's an error it will not work because
humans here is an interface right this
will not work so what we can do is we
can create a class and that class will
extend human class as we all know or we
can create a class which extends which
implements your human and then you can
create object of the class and your work
will be done the another way is you can
directly create an anonymous inner class
what it means just after your new human
thus I mean just after your object you
can simply write or you can open the
current package and close the curly
brackets
that's weird okay so let me shift that
point up somewhere okay let me escape
I'd keep it keep that here and okay so
as you can see we are realizing new
human here now if you want to make it
work you have to find that method right
so we are saying public void it think
and we can just open the bracket in
close the bracket and then you can print
whatever you want to print or we say
it's out and I will print okay I will
print thinking what should your thing
watch me because programmers always
think in virtual world right so we say
think virtually okay so we got this
interface and I can once I got the
instance against a programmer dot say
programmer think and if I run this code
if I right-click and say run as I mean
run main you can see will be getting the
output in some time and here we go you
can see we got the output as think
virtually right that's how it works
that's how you can create or we can use
anonymous inner class in Java but how
can you achieve this in in cotton can I
can I create something like this in
Cortland or not exactly but we are we
have a way to do that now first of all
we need interface white so I will create
the same interface here as well and in
the cotton Lane environment I will say
interface I will name this interface as
it's okay
I will name this interface as human okay
that's my interface here and in this
interface I want a function to be called
as drink the same function which we did
there again there's no need of a
semicolon here and inside my main method
I want to create object of or I want to
instantiate human here so if I say bad
programmer that's how we could object
right and I want object of human so the
type of object I want is human if I say
equal to now the problem is I have to
use a class I cannot say I cannot say
human bracket right that's what that
will not work because human is interface
so what could be done so if you want to
use anonymous in a class here we can
simply say hey I want an object so we
can simply write an object but in what
kind of object you need so I want an
object of type human right and we'll
open the curly brackets and close it so
that's how you implement it here
again we can use the space again did its
depend upon you how much space you need
I always make sure that I put that below
the object itself okay and here we can
say overs right I want to what I do
function right is thing so the right
thing and here will print what thinking
think watch re okay so that's that's how
you that's how you create an instance or
that's how you create a instance of
programa and then at the end you can say
hey programa think and then of course it
when you run this code if I click and if
I say run first for Katie and I give it
in same output there and yes we got the
same output whistling virtually right
and that makes sense right so this is
your java code so in order to use
anonymous inner class we use this syntax
in java and in order to use anonymous
inner class and Kotlin we use this
syntax so this is the use of object
keyword here so using object keyword via
creating this instance again you can use
this instance only once okay this
instance is not reusable and that's why
it makes sense to use object right so
some radius we are getting only the one
what you say we are getting only one
instance of it on indirectly right so we
are saying human over right fun thing
and then we got only one instance of
this so yes if you want to go for
anonymous inner class we'll go for this
object keyword again do remember this
because in future also will use this
concept a lot so make sure you practice
this quote before going for the next
subsequent videos so I hope you
understood the concept of anonymous
inner class in Cortland again if you are
not familiar with anonymous inner class
in Java as well I would recommend you to
watch the video first
that's the okay can you see that we got
an error because they both the class
belong so same package the human and
human but that's okay right the code is
working that's going product that's what
is important here after do practice this
and we'll see in the next video where we
talk about the companion object so
that's it guys see you in the next video
I hope you are enjoying my session so do

enjoying this and make sure you share
