working on the addition of two numbers
in which we took two text field one
button and one label and then we have
added all the components on your frame
and then we have set the layout we have
make sure that it is visible synthesized
and we have the defined we have defined
the do the closed operation it should be
instant closed and let me enter gain and
the output is this in which you can type
two numbers we'll say five and four and
when you click on it this button it
should show you some result
kahshanna is why it's not working it's
because you have added a button here
which is your you have added a better
button on the frame but by default this
button is dumb when you click on that
button it should listen to your event so
whenever you talk any way you say we are
creating an event your button should
listen to that event when you say you
need to listen or your button need to
listen you need to add listeners so like
example when I say something if I
speaking now you are able to hear it it
is because you have ears you need to add
a listener to your button and to add a
listener we need to use a method called
as an action listener because when you
click on a button that is called as
action so I mean to say add action
listener now if you say this method this
action listener needs an object of
action listener interface so this action
listener is not a class it's an
interface so we need to pass the object
of action listener but unfortunately
action listener is an interface so it's
your action listener is an interface so
question arise how to create object of
action is now so we have two ways either
we can create our own class which will
be way to search for a class which
implements action is not otherwise we
need to use our class which will
implement action
so we'll go with this type so we have to
say implements action listener so that
whenever you create object of addition
it will give you object of action
listener so I hope in Co Java we have
seen that that whenever you create
object of a class it also made object of
its superclass a it's also good object
of its super interface so when you
create object of addition you will get
object of action listener now how to say
this
we need to use addition of video to to
use object of addition we can simply
said this so this here is an object of
addition and it's also an object of
action listener yeah but now there is
one problem since action listener sub
lets me click on the section is now this
action listener here is an interface
which has a method called as action
perform so as Java says we need to
implement we need to implement this
method so it's go to a class and let's
implement it so how to implement me to
say public see the signature it is
public void actionperformed it ask you
for object of action event and actually
if it is a class here so what we can do
we can simply say it is public void
action performed it's performed all
right if you ask you for object of
action event will say AE I define you
and that's it now you can see we to
import a package we'll say control shift
I and this comes from Java dot a
double dot event dot action event and
we'll say okay so now we can see we have
action performed which comes from action
listener and yeah everything looks good
but then let's run this now if we run
this code they are to the same if I say
5 &amp;amp; 4 still when you click on this
button nothing is walking it's because
whenever you click that button it will
call this mythical as ad actually so it
will execute
every time you click that button it will
call this action perform and we have not
returned anything in this action perform
now what exactly will come here that
we'll see in the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
