depth we have an algorithm now what is
deputy Hellman so in previous video we
have talked about symmetric key and
asymmetry key right so in symmetric key
so dictograph II what you have you have
to angle top file and you have to
decrypt the file right so if those if
both this keys are same you know for
encryption we need a key for the kitchen
to be the key right so if both these
keys are same
it's called as symmetric key
cryptography in earth symmetry what you
have you have to use some different key
for encryption you will be using some
different key for decryption right so
for encryption what we are using we are
using something called as public key and
for ticket thing we are using something
else private key so if you have this
both different keys right and this
combination will be called as a
symmetric key all right so today we'll
talk about symmetric key then I suppose
it if there is a person called as us
Mukesh and there's a person called as so
we have two person one is Mukesh and
groaner
okay and Mukesh want to send a file to
do not let's suppose this is your file
right to send this file first they have
to encrypt so Mukesh will encrypt this
message with Avenue k1 andronik will
delete this message with k2 and the
ultimate thing is this k1 and k2 should
be saved right so the both is - you need
to say use the same keys then question
arise if Mukesh goes with a key that
suppose key is 15 how will donor will
note that the key is 15 then you will
say okay so first Mukesh will send a
file of a key k1 to luck but the problem
is if let's suppose there is somewhere
between this a person passed ostrich and
ostrich try to hack this key k1 so
afterwards if Mukesh wanna send a fight
also
Rajesh can't decrypt it right so we
don't want anyone other than Mukesh and
don't have to know the pilot so what way
to do is we need to exchange this keys
okay so see this is show alight we have
to exchange key in such a way they know
when will come
to come to the right so Mukesh will
generate a key k1 and no luck will
generate a key k2 and both this key
should be same and for that to achieve
that we need algorithm called has a defi
Hellman algorithm so using this you can
exchange you can create some keys and
you can exchange those keys now how to
do it so we have some steps here the
steps goes in this way the first step
you have to go Mukesh and turn up will
Google come to a conclusion we'll take
two numbers and NJ using an insecure
Network right let's suppose McCain says
ok let's go further let's go for two
values when he's n second is G and they
will go with panels like ne is equal to
11 and G is equal to 7 so they are going
with some values ok so n is level and j7
then what they will do now this is this
is the this is network right so this is
your network and you're sending a file
and and G let's suppose if a shish in
between trying to hack it okay so this
will know N and G nitrogenous energy but
what Mukesh will know who did it select
one more number X and only will select
one more number as why
okay so Mukesh has X enough has Y and
then suppose x value is 3 and Y value is
6 now ash
Mukesh don't worry about Y value what I
don't know about X value and that's why
now she's don't know about X and 1 so X
is with Mukesh
Y is with donek so the passage don't
know about x and y now what what Mukesh
will do you will try to calculate or
value a and what I will try to calculate
a value P so formula for the a is Z - 2
X mod n and formula for B is NH 2 why
because it's G - Dubai Mall and Y so
this is your formula now how do you
calculate this we have G G is here 7 7 -
2 3 more lemon now it is more it's a
remainder right so let's suppose if you
have 3 7 - 2 3 it's 343 more 11 so the
answer will be first what will the first
one to divide this number 343 by level
and the avenging the early many remind
of path you will get
remember you will get is to write so
when you divide a number 343 11 you will
get a value 2 and then this value to
mukesh will send a to Rana so long that
now has Avenue A right and the value of
a will be 2 then what next now again a
viable selector like a certain value
wire and he will try to try to calculate
a value be the four be too long ok now
how we will calculate B is your book G
value is seven point two seven h.261 the
value for n is 11 right now what is
seven raise to 7 days to six it's some
number the number is it's one one seven
six four nine more lemon and once you
calculate this value is in calculator
the value you will get is full so B is 4
a is 2 and B is 4 so Mukesh has sent a
value of a to Lana the product will send
a value of P to mukesh now mukesh know
about B which is 4 so Donath now knows
about a and who cares knows about we
write a she also knows about a and B
right so now she's not value a and B but
ashes don't know about X on she don't
know about why in fact Mukesh don't know
about Y and Rosa doesn't know about X
right so people still buy things some
secrecy here now what afterwards once
you get the value of P now Mukesh will
try to calculate the value of k1 now how
to achieve k1 the formula of K 1 is P -
2 since vocational Buzzbee right to be -
2 X mall and and liquidfun trying to
calculate value K 2 which is he is to
buy more and again home - it was a
signal support can Ashish can calculate
K 1 no because Ash's don't know about
Tex can you calculate K - no because
your I should do not about while she
knows about
a B and G what is C good is x and y but
then what next
when you say K 1 equal to now B value is
4 4 s 2 3 mod 11 and 4 H 2 3 you will
get a value as 64 so it's 64 more limit
and the value for K 1 you will be
getting is nice
ok so once you can go you will get 9 and
here also your a so he will try together
with K 2 so this is K 1 K 1 is 9 K 2 is
so it's a is your two lines 2h 2 pi
value is 6 so two days to six more 11
now when you say to mr. six it's again
64 but it is 64 mod 11 and answer you
will get is 9 so K 2 is 9 K 1 is 9 and
you have achieved something which is K 1
and K 2 are same so K 1 is 9 K 2 is 9
and finally we have achieved perky which
is same and this is how your temperament
algorithm works right it's simple you
have to follow some steps approximately
you have 7 steps
ok so this is a few Hellman and that's
what we this video so do subscribe for
more videos thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
