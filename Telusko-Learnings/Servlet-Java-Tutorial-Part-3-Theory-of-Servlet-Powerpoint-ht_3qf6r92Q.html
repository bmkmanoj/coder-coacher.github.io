servlets so the last two examples we
have seen what is servlet how to create
a servlet and then we have seen do git
and do post method and this will discuss
about some theoretical aspect of sublets
now if we talk about solved and you know
it works with a model for Less request
and response see basically if you talk
about self that they are server
confident right so we what we have is we
have a client and we have a server so
this is your client you on the left side
and we have a server on this side now if
you want any resource from a server may
be a HTML page may be some image a video
or something else may be a game so you
have to send a request first now this
this request will be of type HTTP right
because we want a page right a page we
should have multiple links so you have
to use HTTP request this equation will
go to server now this server may be if
it is a static page or dynamic page
depend upon your request will return the
page okay and the page type will be HTML
now if you talk about static dynamic so
I have a different video on that if you
can just go to my playlist if you will
find a video called as static versus
dynamic page web pages there you will
know different types of pages so
basically when you if you are working
with static or dynamic you have to send
a request so that you will get a request
or response so this type of model is
called as the quest and response model
so if you talk about the quest it's a
it's a it's a type of request which is
HTTP and you have to specify something
called as URL because whenever you send
a request to a page you should know the
URL of the page which is Uniform
Resource locator and then maybe you have
to send some parameters maybe let's say
you want to login and then you talk
about login you have to pass username
and password right so you have to have
to pass some parameters now once you
send a request what you need is here you
will be getting some response now this
response will be with a status code now
what is status code is like if your
request is accepted and which is getting
processed
so the requestcode will be the serious
squirt will be 200 if you're if you're
if you are accessing a page which is not
available or it is not found it will
return for not for of course everyone
knows about for not for right so that's
your status code now when you send some
of these points you know your response
can be of different type it can be HTML
page it can be a text or a picture so
that that you have to mention here which
is a content type and then the actual
content maybe if you are selecting here
text so it will be a text image right
next so when you look let's talk about
submit now so now we know we have a
request model if you have assigned a
request we will getting the response now
if you talk about a dynamic web page to
create those pages what we need is a
servlet right now where to run your
subjects so on your server there will be
happy you will be having a special GBM
and that special JVM will be called as
web container now you will get this web
container from Apache Tomcat or you can
use GlassFish earlier there are lots of
different containers you can use and all
this container they are part of web
server right so now if we talk about
Apache Tomcat it's a web server if you
talk about glass which is a combination
of web server an app server but
basically all the app server they have a
web server in build so when you send a
request here so you have to send a
request the request will go to web
server now this web server depend upon
which type of request you are sending or
the new office outlet it will go to web
container that is web continuous
possibility to call a particular servlet
right because ultimately the page you
have to generate will be generated by
the servlet so initially you have to
send request to web server this web
server will have a web container and
that container will have solve it now up
so in detail how it works so you have to
send request to a web server web server
sent a request to web container now your
requests go to there's some piece of
error here this is the quest so your
request goes to our thread so every
servlet will every time you send a
request to a server that instead of
running only one solve right it will
create upload so that the same servlet
can be accessed by multiple people
you know let's say if we talk about
Facebook just to imagine enough for time
being basically Facebook is stated in
PHP right but let's say in scenario
let's say Facebook is created in Java
maybe servlets so in that's in this
scenario let's say you want to access
your friend list or if you want access
messages so messages will be one servlet
right and if you want to access your
message it will create different thread
at the same time some other piece some
other person he want to access is own
messages so it will create different
thread right so multiple people will be
on multiple threads so one to one person
one thread multiple people that will be
multiple threads and every time you want
to execute your thread you have to call
a method Karzai's service which
indirectly will call Duquette now if
your request is get type it will call
doget if your request is post time it
will it will call do post address with
the last video and then you will get a
response page which is this HTML page
and that will be sent to the client cool
so these are your web container works
now if you talk about the the role of
web container so basically talk it does
these five operations first it provides
your communication support wench which
means multiple solve let's can
communicate with each other with the
help of web container it also manages
your lifecycle which means let's say if
you want to create a soft like so you
have to first go first first you have to
go for the init method then we have to
go for a service method then we have to
go for destroy method so creation of
your sublet and destroy of yourself that
will be done by your web container next
who is responsible to create multi
person as if you get multiple requests
which again web container who provide
security
now servlets is known you know they are
largely used because of their security
features and who provides the security
again it's a web container and then we
have it also supports JSP now what
exactly JSP is that we'll discuss later
this in the further tutorial now let's
say you've got a request ok so you have
a web container in this here in this web
container you have let's say 10 servlets
and now you get a request from a client
you want to you want some resource
like example in this we have a servlet
name Soviet class for this login and a
user sensor equation was Dogon you know
if that's a printing mistake again you
know I'm very bad with typing let's say
we have a we have a URL which request
says log on now what I bought I want to
link this logon with login so this is
how we have to it we have to do write
again how to work with this then we'll
see in the practical when we will be
start with the coding but basically you
have to type these two two tags here
okay so in order to maintain in order to
mention which servlet to run and to
mention your content of that what else
applets we have you have to use a file
called as web dot XML and this file is
also called as deployment descriptor now
if we talk about the lifecycle by
default every subject will be in this
state which is done does not exist as
soon as you call a solve that it will go
for in each state and it will initialize
now as soon as your server get into this
container it will provide you service
and once yourself is complete it will
get destroyed cool let's say you want to
create your own servlet so in order to
create your own servlet first step is
you have to create a served it okay and
then if you not appear to serve like
what we need is you require a a class
cause I should observe it so you have to
extend your class to HTTP servlet which
in turn which in turn extends generic
servlet and this generic servlet
implements Sublette interface okay so
all the features of lob that you get is
from this servlet interface cool so now
you are all said you know this is this
is the basic theory of servlets the my
my intention was not to in to overwhelm
you with all these concepts because we
will be using all this concept is like
in the you know subsequent tutorials
so at that point I will refer to this
certain slides you know we talked about
this slide we talked about this slide so
don't be so stressed we were talking
about this in the photo tools so
basically remember you have to remember
this thing you have to create a servlet
which is your servlet which will extend
a
you served it cool and you get all the
features from subject interface here so
dense it's not the theory now and we'll
talk about the morning but continued
implementation the next module tutorial
