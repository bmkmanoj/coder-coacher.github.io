Java not now this is a not exactly a
trick but you can do some weird stuff
now what exactly this means is let's say
I want to put inside out so I will say s
out and hello
odd hello world now my condition here is
I don't want to use this semicolon after
this statement that means I want to
print the hello without using this
semicolon at the end of println now if I
remove the semicolon obviously we get an
error right now that my question to you
you have to put in this without using
semicolon so you can pause this video
you can open your NetBeans and try it
out so once you once you complete with
your or once you tried if you get
success come back to this video and you
can see my logic so I will I will
recommend just pause the video do it and
come back now since after this we will
come back let's let's see how to do it
like is not possible right is because if
you miss a semicolon here obviously it
will give you an error but let's say how
many or whatever functions available in
us in this out out object now if I go to
this println method now println returns
void if you see it is a void myth void
return type right now let's say in C in
Java we have one more thing called let's
print F now this is what we have used in
C programming right so we can say hello
world without you let me just go to now
printf now if you go to printf printf
returns something we can say printf
returns print stream right so what I can
do what if if I use our if statement now
if whenever you talk about if if always
need something right so what I will do I
will say I will pick up this content
from here or this line from here X and
in if condition we do not require a
semicolon and what we can check if it
returns null that's it we will do
something here but not required right we
can just delete this part
the main thing is this statement will
execute it will return an object off or
instance of print stream will verifies
it as null or not doesn't matter
obviously it will give you a false value
right and it will come out the important
thing is we are executing hello world if
I run this code now you'll be getting
hello world it's that simple okay so
this is one of the trick you can do in
Java</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
