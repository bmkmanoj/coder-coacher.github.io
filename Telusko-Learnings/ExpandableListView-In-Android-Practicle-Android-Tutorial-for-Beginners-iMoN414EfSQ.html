ready from Paris for learnings and in
this video we'll talk about expandable
ListView
so the expandable list views as we have
seen at the theory video so in this we
have seen which this is what we want to
create here right so we have expandable
list in which you have two elements so
basically we have two elements here
which is Java and C an inside Java if
you click on the expand button so you
can see there's an arrow here I don't
know it is visible for you so if you
click on this arrow it will expand it
will show you super and capsulation
methods is the richest part of Java and
we have procedure pointers and add a
which is a part of C right and if I so
we can also click on this one of the
icon there if I click on encapsulation
or anything like methods it will show
Java methods I belong to Java and then
the you clicked on methods so this is
what we want to achieve in this video
now how to do that so let's go back to
the Android studio so what are the
things we require here the first thing
we require is this view the completely
view the second thing is this Java and C
this is one type of view and the child
elements there our second view so in
total we have to create three resource
files in fact three views we can use
this one for the complete view so in
this we require expandable list view so
inside your palette search for
containers inside contents will be
having expandable list view just drag
and drop it here so you can see we have
expandable list view there okay and if I
go to the text of this you can see we
have some extra stuff I do not want
these two things I just want the closing
tap and I do not require all this
padding stuff let me remove this so that
it will look cool now go back to design
or you can also check the preview okay
so we got the elements right here
not as the first view we want three to
create two more layouts we'll say the
next layout is we'll say the source file
layout layout resource five we said this
is least padding because it will be
having all the parent elements which is
Java
and see okay and and this what we need
is just our text field so we'll fetch
the large text here on this on the
screen and we will set some properties
here so the first thing way to set is
the ID with instead of saying textview
will set LBL parent okay why LBL will
say txt parent so that is your parent
element by default will be large text we
can also set something this thing is not
required we do not want to keep it
center because parent will not be at
center it will be on the left side so it
will be left side alignment and I want
with to be match pan because it will
cover the whole cell okay so that's our
parent we require one more for child
will create one more layout will say new
layout resource and this is least child
okay
and in this lease child will fetch large
text on the screen go back to text and
for the child will mention the
properties as we don't want we want it
on the center but not the gravity we
want this Center as we'll use text
alignment that will do right text
alignment will set text alignment as
Center because it will take the center
stage from of this cell and then we can
also set let's set also set the gravity
I guess gravity should walk here let's
set the gravity as Center then we
require the text or the ID here will
mention the ID as what will say txt
child so just remember this we have txt
parent and then we have so in this we
have txt patent we have the extra child
here okay and okay
let me remove the text alignment will
keep gravity because if we this is what
makes this thing in center right okay
nothing more I think we require here
okay so we got the least parent
Beasley's child so once we have done
with the layout stuff now it's time to
code okay we will start with the hard
coding so let's start with the
main activity so go by to the main
activity now other things we require
here now since we have taken so since we
have taken this list here which is
expandable list view we need to create
object of this wide so we'll go to main
activity and we'll try to create the
difference of it so we'll say expandable
so that is expandable list view which is
here and then we'll create the object of
it will say expandable ListView
okay we got the reference and we require
to least write one list is for this Java
and C this is part of the list and we
require a hash map which will have the
reference or which will have the
elements with the key so this this
pointers this Java C these are your keys
right so we'll create two things one is
list for parent so we'll say this is
list of string this will be on languages
so you can see we have all the languages
right so we have Java and C so that's
the least we can also create a map so
this map will take two parameters one is
this string which is which refer which
represents the language which is Java or
C the second will be list of topics it
has so we say string okay if you are not
comfortable with map and least concept
just go back to my channel and search
for collection sessions or collection
and generic lecture and have a look on
that so we'll say this is topic so we
have languages and we have topics so
this Java and C they are languages and
then we have is this thing which is
topic right and all this topic belongs
to one language example we have
encapsulation in Java we have methods in
Java then we have add a pointers in C we
also have added in Java just for the
demonstration I am using this values
okay so let's use languages in topics as
two as the elements now we took
initialize it right so we have to create
the object of expandable ListView so
we'll say this is expandable ListView
equal to we have to create the object so
I hope you know till now how to get
object right or how to link the XML
elements with the java element so we
have to
find view by ID which is r dot r dot
expandable list view okay once we got
the expandable list view now it is our
duty to fill these elements way to the
end to fill this elements which is
languages and topics you can see we have
not filled it using XML not even with
the F of Java yet so what we'll do we'll
try to fill those elements or fill those
elements we can fill those elements here
itself we can mention those trough here
all what we can do is we can use one
more method here who is who will be
responsible to field data so we'll say
fill data ok and we'll try to first
insurance the array so we'll say this is
new add a list ok a then way to ensure
eyes topics so this top X equal to this
is new hashmap implementation ok and
then we'll try to add some values inside
languages so we can add Java and then we
can add languages dot add we can add one
more which is C we can add multiple
languages here used to your wish how
much language you want to add and then
we'll create a way to add the values
into the list or the topics what but the
topics will be again at least right
because every language will have
different topics so we'll create the
first list for Java will say new add a
list ok and the second list is for C so
we'll say C equal to new added least ok
and we will add some elements so for
Java the elements will be the first
topic is super so we'll use super then
we have Java dot add let's add next is
encapsulation and then we have methods
which is encapsulation and then we have
Java dot add we have method right so we
have methods or methods method ok that's
what Java and then let's add for C so
for C the first value will be procedure
so that is your procedure then we have
seedot add it will be pointers and the
last value we have is added so we'll use
D we have added here okay
we got this array now let's add or let's
add these elements into the into the
hashmap so what we'll do with you is
topics dot put because every topic every
D so we have this topic which belongs to
Java right and this belongs to C so in
the in this puts first we have to
mention the technology name which is
language or the language the language
names which is languages dot language
dot or languages dot get 0 the first
time if it is Java so Java topics is
this Java so you can see we have in the
hashmap in the map we have first as
string and second is least right so this
is that a string and this is the least
and we can say topics dot put this is
languages dot get we can specify the
index number as one and we can say this
is C values ok so once we got the
elements after this creation of this
field we have to say fill data now as
soon as you call this method which is
filled data it will fill all the values
here I mean it you will get all the
values inside this Lang and map now once
it is done we just need to show so it's
not the next step is very easy we just
have to set the value in the expandable
ListView by saying expandable list view
dot set but hold on which method to use
how to set the values so it is always
recommended that or it is the only way
you can add values to the expandable
list view is is using adapter so we need
to say set adapter by creating the
object of least adapter god by creating
the object of expandable least adapter
and the problem starts here if you could
directly add this values inside the
expandable list view the topic would be
have been very simple right but
unfortunately we have to use adapters
that means we need to first create the
object of expandable list adapter then
question arise how to do that it is very
simple just
go here and say expandable least adapter
which is the inbuilt interface and we'll
name this as leash adapter as the object
name and if you click on expandable list
adapter it's an interface which has
large soft methods you can you see we
have so many methods to work with and so
to work with expandable leash adapter we
can directly pass this here which is
leased adapter but we need to still
create the object of this right and to
create to create the object of least
adapter we need to search for the class
which implements expand the ballast
adapter right and unfortunately we don't
have we just have one class which is
base expandable adapter which itself is
an abstract class so in order to achieve
that in order to achieve the least
adapter here we need to create a java
class so it is our responsibility to
create that adapter so we'll say my
expandable least adapter I can just use
the short names here now in this
expandable list adapter way to simply
say because see anyway we need to
implement that interface which is
expandable list adapter so ensure that
we can just extend a class which
implements expandable this adapter which
is base expandable list adapter okay and
if you go to this class base expandable
list adapter it implements expandable
adapter right so we can use this but
this is an abstract class so we need to
implement all the methods which are
there and you can simply click on
implement methods so any guess how many
methods you will be getting 1 2 3 4 just
click here and have a look how many
methods we have we have 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
so we have 10 methods so it is our
responsibility now to implement all
these 10 methods quite challenging right
ok let's let's start with our work ok so
if we can just define this our work will
be done ok we just need to we just need
to fill up all the string what
before that let me just create the
object here so that this talk will be
done
we'll say new my ex or my ex list
adapter okay so if you can run this
College let's try to run this let's see
what's the output we are getting so that
we can continue with the example it will
take some time to load by anyway okay it
will take some time to load here okay by
the time let's have a look here so we
have so we have X my expandable list
adapter which has lots of methods in
fact we have ten method so I so we have
to override all these methods with our
behavior because if you don't override
it you will get the default output oh
for the okay it's taking some time of
course it will take some time because
this is Android studio so you can say we
got the list here which is blank we
wanted some values right we are not
getting any value it's because what we
are doing here of it returning null null
zero how what out will be getting here
right so will not get any output so to
fill this elements we need to send so in
shove instead of calling the default
constructor here instead of calling
defog instead of my X list in the main
activity we need to pass three things
first the name of the context second or
the object of the context which is this
second will pass the languages name now
the third thing will pass is the topic
name so we need to mean to pass these
three things so we are passing the
context we are passing the least adding
we are passing the of you're passing the
languages we are passing the topics so I
so that those output or those languages
and topics will be you can see here
right now since we are passing those
values we need to create a constructor
which like which will accept those
values so I click on your my X list
adapter go to generate and click on
constructor by oh not this one way to
take a constructor by fetching values
right so let us create those object here
so we'll say this is context well name
the object has context so because that
is what we are sending right so we have
to
ending the context which is this object
then we are also sending the list of
languages so it's a list of string which
will take languages then we have a map
which takes string and the list of
string as the value and we'll say this
is topics okay and now let's have a
constructor so we'll say again generate
a constructor for all the three values
okay yeah so we have this constructor
now once we caught the constructor now
let's try to set all the values now the
first thing we need to first the first
method which is the group count now it
is this group count means if you see the
output what we are what we want here
we want two elements why do we want Java
and we want C so group count is two now
will not return to here will return the
length of the languages so we'll say
languages dot size okay that's how you
will send the languages so now the
second one is get children count it is
this is very simple now begin to get the
children count business topics so we
have to say topics dot get in which you
have to mention the position so let's
say if I say dot size we don't want the
we don't want all the elements we want
the these the count
so let's if I if I say this image if I
if I submit this video so we have four
Java
we have three elements for C we have
three elements let's say we have one
more language it is C++ and for that we
have two elements in that scenario we
have to send the particular topic size
right so we have to say a group position
so it for Java it will be three four
seed will be three four c plus 4 it will
be two so that's what we have to mention
the the children count the next way to
face the group now this group is very
simple for every for any specific
position you have to return the group
name so let's say for zero we have to
turn Java for one we have to return C
and how to do that just simply say
languages dot get
and in bracket you have to mention the
position which is group position right
now way to get the child we can just use
the same concept of get children count
here we'll say topics dot get in which
you have to mention the languages dot
get in which you have to mention the
group position and then once you get
everything just fetch the the name of
the name of the child which is get child
position so let's say for for for the
zeroth location first Z dot location or
1 1 location child which is Java second
is encapsulation right that's how we'll
it will fetch once child an you have to
mention the group ID which will which
will return the group ID for you just
return the nothing else is returned
group position and for this also return
child position this will return that's
very simple nothing much here now once
we have done all the small things it's
time to go for something big ok now that
big thing is this one okay now we to
said let's go for the last one we want
to select the child element that's why
we say true because we want it to be
selectable okay everything is done
except these two things one is group
view and child view and this is the most
important part because what you are able
to see here is all because of this two
things okay it's not because of the
count parent will only give you the
counts not the actual values the actual
value will be given by this gate group
view and this is the thing which will
maintain that that stuff so we'll return
here convert view so a main job is to
change the value of convert view okay
let me just make it convert view also
okay both will return convert view and
it's one this let's see what's the
output we are getting once with on this
it was like some time to load by the
time we'll discuss let's let's recap
what we have done so we have created the
adapter okay so now we have created the
adapter by x by extending a class which
is base expand
list adapter okay and which you have we
have to use this the three parameters
which is context least and map we need
to ensure eyes it and then we have to
set this methods which is group count
children count group children and all
the stuff okay okay we got an error was
the error is because of that let's track
for the error it says oh still we are
getting null because anyway we are still
getting null so let's set all those
values so I think after setting all
those values will be solving the problem
okay oh is that the problem let's run
this a once again I don't think that
should be the problem let's see let's
try it once again okay while it is
running let's let's go to the second
part oh it's not working way to just set
it okay so let's set all this values so
since this is empty so let's set the
value now while we are getting
nullpointerexception is because by
default this is null right so we need to
first inside initialize it so when you
run this for the first time it will be
null but if you click on the second
element or if you fill in the same
application second time it will there
will be values right so before doing
anything anything of first we'll fetch
the title how to face the title just say
string title okay now from where to
French the title or will say this is
this title is for language right so will
they say okay I to make title let's say
this is Lang okay which will have the
language name so how to face the value
of this just say we are taking a string
parameter and we to say get group get
group by specifying the position which
is group position and this get group was
this get group will be calling this
method which is which we have defined
here for any specific position it will
give us the name right so once we got
the name we need to create the object
okay so we'll say because this object
will be created only once so if you are
view
if your convert view which is if your
convert view is null then only we have
to create object otherwise we do not
have to create the object we can use the
existing one now how to get object is
very simple when you create this object
this view we need to fetch this one why
this is the view okay again we can so
this is the VB to embed into the into
this convert view and to embed that we
need to use a layout manager so we have
to not leave manager but layout inflator
we'll name this as inflator itself and
we'll say this is okay this is enly in
layout inflator not from layer inflator
now how to get object of layout inflator
we have to use context dot get system
which is get system service and this is
the thing we have to use again no need
to okay just say layout this is the
constant we have to use this is the
static thing we have to mention here
which is layout in fitter service so
what this will this line will do is it
will give you the power to embed this
view inside your XML or inside your
actual ListView
okay now let's create the object of
convert view service a convert view
equal to inflate turf dot inflate by
specifying the layout which is r dot
layout dot least parent or not child but
this is parent for group we have to use
parent and the second parameter is the
view group we don't we don't have any
group so we'll say null okay now once we
got the ref once we got this object of
convert view let's set the value now
what will be the value will be setting
is a way to change so if you remember we
have a textview right so we need to
update this textview
with the help of our code so to do that
let us go to this and say text view okay
which will let us say this name this as
txt what a well name this as txt parent
okay and we'll say this is text view so
it will say find okay this is context is
it context yeah so it is gone convert
view dot fine view by ID then you have
to mention here the ID name which is r
dot r dot txt parent so this is how you
will fetch the parent value and then
let's set the value there so we said txt
parent which value will be setting years
of asset set text the name of the
language so initially it will be Java
and then it will be C so we'll be
getting two elements so this method get
vo get group bill will be called two
times one for Java one for C and you
will get it the same thing we have to do
for child also right so for child we can
actually use the code so we can just we
can just type it one is will name it as
a topic equal to we'll say string get
child by specifying the position of
child position I'm going to specify two
things the group position plus child
position okay now once we got the topic
we need to create the object so we can
just simply copy this thing because we
want to create object of convert view
now once we have done that the only
change will be inside this will be
having child right one will be parents
again with child and here we need to
fetch we need to create these two things
so let's one try to type everything when
we can reuse the code so this is txt not
parent but child and this thing will
also be child this thing will also be
child and the language of language will
be having topic okay I think that is
enough okay that's how you create an
adapter write it it was a huge task
right so let's go back to the main
everything seems good let's run this
code let's see what happens if I run
this code I'm going to set all one more
thing once we got
the output will set one more thing are
going to set the listener right once you
click on the element we should be able
to see the pop up a toast for that
matter and you can see we got at least
here if I explicable its try to solve
this error it's okay no normally it
happens you you you get errors some time
and that's that's okay so there's a
problem with the topics topic is not
initialized
is it tight the thing this is how we get
something wrong with the children count
oh I made a mistake here this is not a
get group because we need to mention the
count for the least of languages slide
because it belongs to language dot get
and there will be group position I think
I made a mistake here no so this this
two things should be seen okay now I
think it should it should work okay and
languages are sorry others are the part
of programming right you cannot write
the perfect code every time so it
happens so it will take some time to
load okay so let's see
okay so we got Java if I expand our you
can see we got this the three topics and
if I click on say we called this three
topics right so that's how you get
expandable list view so you can see we
can also collapse it expand it collapse
expand and if I click on pointers
nothing is happening we want to show
some what you say we want to show a
toast here now Y toast let's say if you
click on pointers you want to show the
next activity where you want to show the
details about the pointers what you can
do is you can put a listener to the
expandable child element so how to put
that so we have to say was that we had
to say expandable list view dot we to
set the listener for this and how to set
the listener it is very simple just how
to say set on child click listener okay
by creating object of on child click
listener
in which you have to just show the toast
okay
which is I hope you know how to use
toast why I have to say toast dot make
toast in which you have to specify first
thing which is mainactivity dot this
does the context you specify then the
string so we have to specify the string
so we have to mention the language name
so we'll say language dot glue position
so we should we should know which group
has been clicked and we'll also print
the child name so we'll say this is Plus
which is what a topics dot get in which
you have to mention the group position
plus child position from not wrong yeah
so just like this two things
Oh group position what I am doing here
group position first okay hold on I just
messing with this thing so when you say
topics dot get you have to also specify
the language right because that's the
first does the key here and we need to
mention the group position and then
after this we have to say dot get and
then you have to mention the child
position okay and then at the end you
just have to say the toast length will
be will keep it looking for it long okay
and at the end will say dot show so big
code I'm tired of typing all the stuff
okay let's lunch run for the last time
I'm quite tired now okay by the time it
is running let me ask you a question
okay what question for this session the
question is who is the founder of
Android namely person right so I will
expect the answer in the comment section
if you know the answer just comment it
so question is who is the founder of
Android you can see if I click on
encapsulation it says Java code
encapsulations Java is the group name
and caption the topic name let's go for
see a day so we have see a D so that is
from this session in which you have
talked about expandable
ListView if you want a quick recap I
will not repeat just repeat the video
once again so that is from this session
