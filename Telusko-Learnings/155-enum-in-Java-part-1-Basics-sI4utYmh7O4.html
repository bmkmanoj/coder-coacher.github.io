ready from tennis for learnings and in
this video we'll talk about enum now in
fact a enum enum is used in all the
languages right if we talk about C
programming C++ so enemies everywhere
now in Java when when we had the first
version which is 1.0
enum was not there right so there were
there were lots of people they were
saying that Java lacks features Java
Java doesn't support multiple
inheritance Java doesn't support enum we
don't like Java
so when 1.5 the Java community they came
up with the concept of enum right so
again this innum is not the same enum
which you have in c and c++ it is very
different from that we'll see that what
is the difference interest in this in
the subsequent video in the subsequent
videos in this video we talked about the
basics of enum so you know why we need
enum so let's let's take an example
let's say I want to represent some
constants example let's say we talked
about the range of integers so we have
the range of integers which goes from
negative raised to positive range right
so it is a predefined type but let's say
if I want to have my own range example
range of month so we have 12 months in a
year right this start with January we go
for February we go for March and then
April and then it ends at December right
we can go for the we can go for the
range of colors we have green red blue
again we have those shades in blue as
well we have sky blue light blue and all
the stuff but we have other engine
colors we have arranged in mobile phones
or mobile phones company we have Apple
we have Samsung right we have all this
range so if you want to create your own
range we can use enum but Edom was
introduced in 1.5 right what about what
before that so before that if you want
to create a range of on strain basically
we used to work with interfaces example
we can name this interface as let's say
mobile company range in this mobile
company range we can define our old
constant but the way used to create
constant is by
being let's say inch or maybe not in
let's say string the first company would
be let's say Apple and the name of Apple
the value for Apple would be Apple now
this this Apple here becomes a constant
because by default if you light anything
inside the interface I mean if you hear
anybody will inside the interface that
becomes a constant right so by default
it is final even if you don't mention
finally this final right so you can
create multiple constants here we can
say string Apple we can say or was that
we can say string a string not mango
catchy above our company we can say
Samson right and we can have here
Samsung I just made a mistake it should
be in capital because very very clear in
constant right so it should be Samson
okay so we have Apple we have Samsung
and we can have multi can get multiple
constants right but whenever you use
this constant in fact this should be
static on static variables because I
want to use this with the help of
interface right so if you want to use
this in main class what we should do is
we is to say let's say if I want to
compare this name so I will say if if
mobile company dot
Apple dot a pelant to compare this wet
with my own string as Apple now the
problem is this is a string right how
can you how can you know that this is a
string how can you know that this Apple
is a string not a integer because you
may assume that that's going to join you
can compare the number again you will
get an error we don't go on that right
we should know what type of constant you
are working with social working with
this type of constants we can use
something called as enum so we can say
in a mobile company or we can simply say
mobile and we can create constants here
so we can say this is Apple we can say
this is Samson right we can add one more
company that's the SGC so we have all
this company here and that's how you can
create a enum now and we can remove this
thing okay let me just
right here let me just print the value
for inable say mobile dot Apple so
that's how you can use in ohm here so we
can specify the enum and we can create
the constants we can create Apple
Samsung HTC right
again this semicolon is optional here if
even if you don't write semicolon that's
okay so whenever you go to enum that
semicolon is not compulsory to right
there which is better to have semicolon
because we are coming from Java world
you know we have this habit of keeping
silicon at the end so let's go with that
flow
let's keep semicolon at the end so
that's how you create a enum and that's
how you use innum so when you run this
code now and you will get the output as
Apple right in fact you can apply the if
condition here you can check the
constant with the Apple constant or
something in that format you know so
that's how you use in M now if we talk
about this enum it has multiple methods
in fact we'll see that in the subsequent
videos so we can create an enum with the
help of enum keyword this is important
to remember we have a enum keyboard we
have to specify the enum name and then
we can create the constants now how it
is different from other languages in
fact this in C C++ we use the same
syntax so I don't think that nothing
different from this but we do have some
difference in Java now we will discuss
the first difference here itself we can
define enum inside the class as well in
fact that is something we can do so i of
defining the enum outside the class we
can define the end of inside the class
okay what what about inside the method
oh no that's not possible we cannot do
that inside our method you can see we
are getting some errors so compiler is
giving you some bad words so we'll go
back and we'll set that into a class so
we can create a item inside the class
all we can get it in term outside the
class so yeah that's how we can use in
them in the in the next video we'll talk
about different ways of using inner man
different features so thank you so much
and make sure we before going for the
next video you have liked and subscribe
