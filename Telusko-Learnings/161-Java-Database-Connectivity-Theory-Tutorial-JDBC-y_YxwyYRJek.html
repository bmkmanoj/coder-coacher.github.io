ready from police for learnings and in
this video we'll talk about JDBC so JDBC
stands for Java database connectivity
now think about this world think about
this information world what matters is
not the websites not the software what
matters is data right so if you talk
about this concept like information
technology so everything moves or
everything works around the information
right example think about what's my
views what's up to share information
right why views this banking software to
check our bank balance all those things
right so the the whole funder of having
this software world is because of data
so the center of attraction for
everything is data right so when you
build a software why you build software
because you want to process data and
where you store this data so we acquired
a database so you will be having a
database in your system where they was
told all your information now this
database can be flat file system this
can be our DBMS this can be no SQL this
can be Big Data doesn't matter it's a
database wide so let's say you are using
our DBMS which is relational DBMS you
can talk about MySQL we can talk about
Oracle SQL servers those are your a DBMS
wide if you talk about MongoDB so that's
no SQL if you talk about Hadoop Big Data
so that's a different topic if we talk
about files the difference of databases
right so we'll be working with our DBMS
here so if you have a database user
that's your database and you have a java
code because to fetch data from the
database we have to file SQL queries
right so to work with database we have
to file SQL queries now if you are
working for a company you are not a IT
expert let's say you're you're working
for a bank now you want to fetch details
of an F of a customer you will not file
a query right you will click on a button
so that means you need to create a GUI
where you will click on the button and
the data will be fetched from database
that means you have to connect your
front-end application so that's your
front-end application
with the back-end database this is your
database and to connect Java with
database we require a connectivity right
and that concept of connecting Java with
database is called as je BC so Genesis
stands for Java database connectivity
right so whenever you want to connect
your java application with database we
require JDBC now here we have four
different types of drivers because when
you want to connect java application
with database we were to use one driver
so we have for choice we can use a
native driver which is ODBC bridge
basically so we have what you visibility
which is used for ms access we can use
native API we can use pure Java drivers
depend upon you what you use so there
for certain there are four types of
drivers so main intention is not to talk
about drivers but to connect your java
application with database so whenever
you want to connect your java
application with the database you have
to use seven steps so the first step so
we have to follow seven step so from one
to seven so the first step of the
connectivity is you have to
input the package so that will be your
first step now which package that we'll
talk that we'll talk about this later so
we have the package second step is you
have to load that load and register
the
driver so first step is you have to
import the package second step is you
have to load and register a driver
the third step would be connecting our
establish the connection establish the
connection
the fourth step so first step is import
the package second is load race driver
authorities connect establish the
connection the first step is create
the statement the fifth step as process
or ah let's say this is execute the
query
and the six step will be process results
and the last step is you have to close
the connection on the statement so these
are the seven step forgery we see the
first step is input the package the
second one is load and register driver
the third step is establish the
connection fourth as create this
statement fifth process the results or
fifth is execute the query six this
possess results and seventh will be
close now to want to remember these
steps just imagine you want to call
someone you want to call your friend and
you will ask him as let's say your
polygraph Lyonya college and then you
asking as results are out or not so you
will call him guide so before calling
what you need a phone so of course you
want a phone right so let's input the
package next you need a network you need
a network and you should be able to call
so that is load and ROI so driver you
reversing card right now once you have a
mobile phone once you have a SIM card or
working SIM card the next stage you have
to establish the connection so you have
to call em you have a dialer number and
you have to place on dial button it will
call then you have to think what you
have to say so you have to say results
are out or not so that's this statement
you have to mention that statement next
you have to speak that statement it is
execute the query then after saying you
will get a response that is you have to
get the response that is it out or now
so do you will be getting yes or no so
that process the results and that once
everything is done that's the close
right so if you follow the seven steps
you can easily write any JDBC
application now question arise which
package you are talking about so this is
input de package right so the package we
have to use here is Java dot SQL package
so that's the package way to use use
with Java or SQL dot star the second
step so we can break down the second
step into two parts so we can say the
first part is loaded driver and the
second part is registered so we can say
this is point a and point B so we have
to a which is load and to B which is
register now how to do that so which
driver so depend upon which type of
BMS you're working with so if you are
working with MySQL so we have a
different driver for Oracle we have a
different driver for Postgres we have a
defend driver but let's say in this X in
this example we are talking about MySQL
right so for the driver from ask ul is
palm dot mask you ought Jerry be C dot
driver so does it die one name we have
so I just call dot mask you'll dot Jerry
be C dot driver so you have to load this
driver and here to register
but hold on when you say you want to
load it but from where we're from which
location you want to load it so you have
to download a jar file a library from
the internet and the library name is
it is mask you'll so that's mask you'll
connector so if you are using NetBeans
in NetBeans we have this connector in
bill so just you just have to right
click on the degrees and import the
library again will see that once we
start with the practical ok so so we
required this leverage so if you are
using NetBeans it is n built if you are
using Eclipse you have to go to Google
search for mask you'll connector and
download the jar file ok it will be
approximately 172 kb from not wrong so
if you download that software then you
have to load it in your project and
again we'll see how to load in the
practical session and then you have to
register now once this 2 step is done
now ok ok we are remaining with this
register how to register to register
this we need to use a statement which is
we need to use a method which is called
as for name so for them is a method
which is a reflection API method which
will load which will load your driver so
you just have to mention here comm dot
mask you lot so this this driver name
JDBC driver so you have to write this
method which is for name ok that that's
how you register our method Malaysia
driver so this method for name belongs
to a class class so so we have to say
plus dot for name so that syntax we have
okay don't worry I can write the I will
write the code for this once again yeah
so we have the next step is establish
the connection now in order to establish
the connection you have to instantiate
the interface Paris or not that this one
it is connection so there is an
interface called as connection and you
have to instantiate that object or that
interface next is create the statement
statement will be of two types one is
normal statement entering it's of three
types one is normal statement then we
have prepared statement
and the last one is Colleyville
statement so we have three types of
statements here one is statement prepare
statement and caliber statement so when
you want to execute a query so you can
execute the query with the help of
statement object when you have a query
which is in Bell so you have a
predefined query but you have different
values you can use prepare statement
again we'll see that how to use it and
then you want to execute the PL which is
the programming procedural language in
SQL so you can use Colleyville
statements so this is for stored
procedures okay now once we got this
statement you have to execute the query
now whenever you execute a query you
will get a response right so let's say
you want to fetch the data from the tape
database so you will get a table
structure so the response can be a table
structure second let's say you are not
fetching you're inserting a value so
whenever you insert the value into
database it will return the number of
rows affected so you are getting
something so you can process the results
whatever you get and then everything is
done you can simply close it how to
close get the object of statement close
it get the condition get the object of
connection close it so that's how you do
the seven steps now how to write the
seven steps in a programming way so this
is the steps right so before continuing
just pause the video write down all the
steps on your notebook so that we can
refer okay
so let me remove all the statements now
okay so let me write this in our coding
format so let's say we have a main
method oh so that's your mean okay
again this is public static void main in
that you have string arguments so that's
that's that's you can that you can
imagine right so the first arrests are
the faster the first type is you have to
import the package so the package name
is you have to write import statement
and the package will be Java dot SQL dot
star so does the package we have to use
right the second step is you have to
load the driver now to note the driver
you have to right-click on your library
fold library folder inside your project
property so on the right side when you
open that beans on eclipse you will be
having a library folder there you have
to add a mask your connector driver okay
I can we'll see how to download that in
the practical session on how to assign
the value how to assign the library now
once we got in ivory basic the the
second part of the second step which is
to point B or 2b is you have to register
a driver for that the driver name is
comm dot mask you'll doubt it's JDBC dot
it's
oh it's fun it's driving
right and then you have to load this
with the help of a method which is for
name so for them is a method which will
load your driver and this for the method
belongs to a class parlors Plus this C
need to be capital because this is a
class so it is class dot for name in
bracket e optimation a driver name now
once we got the driver name or laudatory
driver they store it next step is create
the connection how to get a connection
we have to say connection we can say
connection count as the object name or
the reference name
the problem is connection is an
interface right so we cannot say
connection corn equal to new connection
because we cannot instantiate the object
the interface directly right so we need
to search for a method which will give
me the object of connection so someone
has implemented the object of connection
some somebody has implemented the
interface connection and now they are
providing the object so the method name
is it is gate connection so gate
connection is a method which will give
you the object of connection okay how it
does doesn't matter right because we are
not concerned about how it works we are
concerned only about the connection
object now this connection object will
take three parameters the first one then
we have second one and then we have
third one okay so it takes three
parameters so the first parameter is the
you are L the second parameter is
username and the third parameter is
password okay so the URL for your
database because in your DBMS let's say
if you are using MySQL you may have
multiple DBMS so which database you want
to work with so you have to mention that
here second to axis mask you'll we have
to specify the username and password so
this is username and password again
we'll replace that thing once we got the
link now how to call this gate
connection method right because it is a
method right it will belongs to a class
so the class name is driver manager
okay so this gate connection this is a
static method that's why we are using a
class name it'll drive manager now once
we got the object of connection which is
gone the next step is you have to create
the object of statement how to do that
so we can say statement st equal to now
again this statement is an is an
interface so we can use the object which
is gone dot create statement right so
once you got the statement object so
this is your to be step this is your
third step and this is your fourth step
this is your first term okay
now the fifth step is you have to
execute the query so how to execute we
can simply say st dot execute
query so that's the method you have to
use and in bracket you have to specify
the query so let's say I want to fetch
the whole table so I will say select
star from student so let's say I have
this table which is student now it will
fetch all the data right so this query
will fetch all the data so what we to do
wait to say waited save it as data
somewhere right because if you father's
query I will be getting a table
structure because it's in this table I
have two rows one is roll number and
second is name right and so I'll be
reading that table in this will in this
one will be having some record so let's
say one naveen - let's say large and
three Mona so we have this three names
right so we have Naveen Raj and Mona so
now if I fire this query this table will
be stored inside a object of result set
so we'll say RS so this set is a
interface which off which if you are
creating the object which is RS it can
hold it at table now this six step how
to process results so - to fetch all
these values there is a method with RS
koalas get string or get int so to fetch
roll number we can say get int to face
the name we can say get string okay but
the problem is if I say get get end
which into a you'll be getting this one
second one or third one that's the
question right so initially your pointer
will be somewhere here okay before the
first value so their point is there so
you have to shift your pointer to the
first location and how to shift we have
to say are this dot next as soon as you
say are s dot next it will shift your
pointer from this location to one now if
you say Alice dot
get end and if you specify the column
number you have to specify which column
the first column the second column so I
can say the first column it will give
that value one okay and you can store
this value anywhere or you can just
print it let's say I want to print both
the values so I can say I can use a
space in between so it attached your
first value second we can say either
start get because the second column is a
string so we can say get string and in
bracket you can mention two so this two
will give you the second column data
which is Naveen so we are the first row
if I say get in first column it will
give me one get string second column it
will give me the beam if you have to go
to next row it will say again our is dot
next now this will take you to the next
row now if I like the same line here I
will be getting two and Raj right so we
have to do this for three to four times
depend upon how much those you have the
sheriff writing this code repeatedly we
can use of loop right so we can use a
loop which is while loop and you can put
this RS dot next inside a while loop and
we can print this data with the help of
system dot out dot println right so this
is system dot out dot println but will
it work inside of a loop because while
loop needs true or false right we want
to check how many rows we have maybe if
you are if you are here how can you go
to next line when you don't have that
row so this are s dot next will do two
things the first thing it will shift the
pointer second it will check if you have
that next line right so that's that's
how you this is dot next works and once
you have processed all your data
the last step will be you have to close
this statement object which is st dot
close and corn dot close sounds good
so that's how you write your application
using JDBC so you if you if you execute
this code this is your seven step if
execute this code you can connect with
it
database so we have written this to
fetch the value we can also write the
methods or we all we can also add up
query for inserting the difference will
be when you talk about SQL so we have in
SQL we have something called as DD l we
have d ml and DQ l we also have TCL but
that's not important here so DD l is
whenever you create this structure of a
database on a table that's d dl whenever
you want to insert delete the values it
is manipulation and whenever you want to
far the query for fetching the values
that is DQ l so for DQ l we use execute
query let's say you want to insert the
values that is that comes out DM l right
so for that you have to use a method
which is called as update execute update
again we'll see that once we start with
the practical okay so that's it from
this and so before ending the session so
normally in after every video now i will
be asking you some questions about the
technological world so for today's
question is who is the founder of oracle
if you know this answer just commit in
the comment section let's see who was us
first so that's just on JDBC see you on
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
