dimensional array now just to implement
that let's create a let's let's go
forward and let's go for four elements
let's say we have four four variables we
have a b c and d and let's say I want
values like so in a I want value as five
and B I want six in C I want seven in D
I want eight so in order to do that what
we have to do is we have to say a equal
to 5 then we have to say B equal to 6
and then C equal to 7 and then D equal
to 8 that's one way right but when you
know you have four elements of same type
what we can simply do is operating that
four elements we can create an array in
which I can specify I have to say it's
new and again we have seen this in the
last video how to define an array and
then we can see the size is four and
then we can assign those values in this
array so we can assign four individual
values in one added we can also do that
with the help of this curly brackets we
can simply say it is 5 comma 6 comma 7
comma 8 so instead of pleading for
variables we can create an array now to
access individual variables is for to
access 5 we have to use X of 0 so
whenever you use write X of 0 you
represent your representing 5 when you
are saying X of 1 it will be 6 and X of
2 will be 7 X so 3 will be 8 that's all
your fetch values right so basically
when you talk about a array it's a
collection of elements now let's say you
have to the address we have Y which is
curly brackets we have 6 comma 7 comma 8
4 by 9 and then we have one more array
which is Z and this also have some
elements which is let's say 9 comma 8
comma 7 comma 6
so I have a 2 I have 3 add is ok and you
can see all these 3 addresses of same
type they have gained type and of same
size right so whenever you have
similar type of elements what we can do
is we can create an array but what if
you have three arrays of same type with
same element we can simply create an a
new add in its name this new add it as
maybe P and this P will be an array not
just an array of elements it will be an
array of Ally so I want to create an add
it to all this elements now to define
this we can simply say a new end and we
can specify the number of flows so this
will consume rows and this and this five
six nine this will consume the columns
so the number of rows we have so we have
three rows so we have three rows and we
have four columns just imagine this is
represented in a matrix format okay
again I will make sure in future
tutorials are you talking about the
theory of a days so I have a good
example for that I can we'll discuss
that in a theory
once I get a once I get make a video on
two-dimensional added a time and let's
focus on how to implement that so we
have Inc P which is a two dimensional
array we can recall we have here we have
two dimensions one to represent the rows
and second will be representing the
columns so this is one type of
representation and now to assign values
so this position here this is the first
row and first column so when in ad is
when you say it is first your website is
0 so 0 comma 0 is equal to 5 so it will
assign the first value there now you
have to say it is 0 so let's go for this
element which is 6 so we have to say is
0 comma 1 which is let's say 6 and the
list goes on we can assign the values ok
so let's say I am assigning the values
using so let's go for static assignment
now how to assign this value statically
so we can simply use an array so when
you use a bracket bracket means an array
but this array is not an ADD of an
elements this is an array for arrays so
this array which is this curly brackets
so let's expand
skander brackets so this cut this
blanket Co so this ad here will hold not
value so they do not hold values this
will hold ad is so let's imagine this is
my first added comma the second added
comma the third added okay so we have
three addicts and each ad it will have
some elements so we have to say 4 4
comma 6 comma 7 comma 8 that's my first
added the secondary will have 6 comma 7
comma 8 comma 9 the third are they will
have 9 comma 8 comma 7 comma 6 simple
right so this is the values I have so
this is 2-dimensional added represent
then just let me just give a proper
layout for this so I hope you can
imagine this is a 2-dimensional format
now the question is how to print this so
before printing this let's print this ad
here okay so if you want to print a this
array what we have to do is we have to
use a for loop and then we can mention
8 I equal to just let me check if this
reporting is working oh hold on let me
just verify my recording yeah it's
working it's working
so let's come back so we have to use our
variable which is I and then we can
simply say I will start with 0 and then
our less than less than equal to so
first we have to count the number of
elements we have so we have four
elements so we have to go till 4 or
maybe less than 4 because we have to
finish it at 3 and then I plus plus we
can simply say s out and we can print
value of X of I so this will make sure
it will print all the values of X okay
so let's run this so if I run this
and against the answer is five six seven
eight so I just meeting all the elements
of X now I don't want to put in all the
limits of X I want to print all the
elements of P now to do that just say P
simple right and now let's save this and
run oh it gives an arrow so it gives
first three values and then it says add
index out of bounds exception so
whenever you get this type of array
letters this is basically because you
have crossed your limits
so because because you have crossed your
array size the problem is whenever you
type when you will say P of I it will
count the number of arrays in this
two-dimensional array so we have one
array we have two added we have three
added for this P this is an element this
is first element second element and
third element so you can go only to
three and since you are not printing an
element into your printing an array and
that's why you get you got this weird
output so we cannot say so when you run
this one for loop it will take the
elements or this will take the add is
now for that individual air is let's
take one more for loop will say this is
Jay of zero and J will go to so I will
go to three because it's on the number
of those three rows which is this time
it is for four columns let's give a tab
let's say enjoy now in this instead of
just mentioning I we have to mention J
also so I represent the number of row
and J will represent number of columns
okay let's run this now let's see what's
the output so if I run this you can see
I am printing all the values but all I
want to print is in them in the proper
format maybe in a matrix format so for
that we just remove this println because
maintainer will always maintain a new
line and let's print a space also
and after every for the water every in a
for loop let's print a new line so if
you're not clear with what I have done
now I will recommend you to watch our
videos on patterns so if you can jump
off my playlist you will find videos on
patterns you understand what how this
further basically works and I find out
this you can see this is a proper metric
format this is five six seven eight and
then this goes on simple right so this
is how you have to print the elements oh
yeah the dots are all about
two-dimensional arrays in the next part
of talking about how to use enhanced
for-loop and then the next part after
that we'll talk about how to use
enhanced for-loop with two-dimensional
array so thanks for watching and do
