okay so I'm live on YouTube that's great
and at the start itself I got seven
views and three likes that's great and
oh I'm getting some questions as well
let me see the chart of is that mmm oh
can I access the chat window from here
okay okay so as you can see I have seven
people watching this I have to use them
I have to use my laptop I don't have a
choice now I thought I can see the chat
I can see the chat but then it is going
away in two seconds so it's better to
have a separate I hope all us proper
they're still I will verify it here and
okay so it says I'm live and if I if I
watch my own video that's oh yeah so
okay so I can see how sixty people sixty
three people are watching this that's
great after a long time oh you are
facing some lags there oh that's that's
weird hmm so I'm here to answer all your
questions in fact I am going live after
how many days it's been fifteen days
maybe so it's been fifteen days now okay
great
okay so as you can see I am getting lots
of questions that hold on I just have
some patience I guess I just miss lots
of questions there okay so if you have
just joined and if you like this type of
session looking on like button that's
important right so I can say 61 people
are watching this and if only 15 likes
if you like this type of session do
click on the like button and let's start
with the questions okay before going for
the answers let me give you what you say
a disclaimer it's not possible to answer
all the questions you know because there
are lots of questions here I will try my
best to answer all the questions but
then in case if you if I miss your
questions don't feel bad okay so in fact
I did last 15 days before and I was not
able to answer all the questions so what
I will do today is I will try to first
take the questions from the last week or
from the last session because I
mentioned to put your questions in the
coming
section so we'll go to that video first
and check the course check the questions
and then I will come back to this this
questions here okay so okay and we got
okay so great so here we go so let me
just answer the first question this is
from Mohammed Rashid he says I just
started Java learn so many things just
because of you thank you so much for
watching I thank you so much
Russian oh this is missing tutorial 9.40
yes or what happened is if you follow my
Java playlist I have approximately 183
videos so I have made sure that every
every video has a number right and I've
divided those into chapter wise so they
have fifth chapter 6 chapter when it
comes a ninth chapter in which I'm
talking about input how did it get user
input in that nine point four is
actually a buffered read before it of
video and you guessed it right that is a
buffered heater video but then that
video is not that good
compared to the other videos you know
that videos so lots of people find that
video very confusing so I've removed
that video as of now but I will be
making remake that video of before you
develop I would have to add that soon so
yes in my playlist nine point four which
is a video which is missing but thanks
for the update okay let me just grab a
coffee as well okay so it's very
important to have a copy while in a
session because you need lots of energy
okay next question here is about the
online batch which I'm going to start
and from 12 September the online batch
is for advanced java and if the question
is do we have to pay neat charge for
that yes are the live sessions which I
take for for puja advanced java those
are paid courses though that those are
not free courses all the videos on
YouTube which are free to access but the
moment you say live sessions from me so
again I have to earn my bread but all
right so yeah those are paid videos okay
next question is okay where's that
it says Oh question question question
okay so is your video on servlet JSP and
spring MVC are enough to learn okay so I
cannot say those are complete videos but
then in your enough to start with okay
so if you want to just start your I mean
you just want to learn solve the JSP and
spring MVC you can you can see you can
actually go for that but of course you
will not learn everything okay what next
from where do you reach at okay so this
question is the in the comment section
where do you read the chat so when I go
live on the right hand side of my video
I can see all the chat there okay and
okay what else what else what else okay
so question okay so this is a point from
Prasad ready and he says please make a
video on interaction to cloud computing
soon I will be making a video on cloud
as well okay so that'sthat's that is
that is from the old video now let's get
back to the current video and let's try
to answer your question so this course
okay so Vicki says hi sir hi Vicki and
hi chica and hi James so you can say is
built-in happy teachers day oh thank you
so much I was supposed to go live on
that day but I got stuck with some of
the work I was busy with the training
okay in fact I got one more question
where was I for this two weeks okay I
was busy with one of the training I was
I was giving her training in one of the
jpmorgan so I was visited though those
trainings so but I'm back now
again I'm be getting busy with other
training soon but then I will try to
make as many videos as possible before
starting the new next training so so our
question here is question is from error
okay
so question is what do you suggest for
those who are below company minimums
criteria for placement okay and this
very common question you know because
see when you talk about big companies
they
there of course they want your good
grade you know they want you to have a
good GPA or what you I don't know what
do you call that C GPA I would suggest
you know what you can do is go for
startups go for mid-level companies
where Marx is not that important
important as your skill set right so
search for the companies where skills
are very important especially you can go
for startups why'd they don't they don't
focus on mass they to focus on your
skills so improve your skills and target
those companies and surely you'll get a
job a good job and yeah there's one more
thing which what are the key what are
these skills that you have to improve so
again I do our video on minimum skill
set required or five skill set required
for this otherwise you can improve your
programming skills as well your data
structure skills database skills so work
on those things and you will surely get
a job
okay next MacBook Pro 2012 this question
is from James mic Book Pro 2011
secondhand Intel okay good good good
ok 2011 model is very old even if it is
I seven it will be a very old generation
but yeah MacBook has a good light but
the only thing is you know 2011 model
it's very old I wonder would suggest as
if you don't have a good budget I would
say go for Windows machine don't go into
MacBook just it just because you want a
MacBook but yes of course if you're
going for iOS programming if you have if
you want to do with your editing then of
course MacBook is awesome so 2011 model
will I will not suggest that it's very
old see for current thing it is good but
then in next one to two years I don't
think so ok so next is from movies
hounds I know sir
yeah I'm good so well T goes says hello
sir you helped me a lot
thank you oh thank you so much next okay
so the ROG in this say is we need
complete web series yes the restful web
service videos are going to complete
it's just that our visit with one of the
training so I was not able to do that
but soon I will be completing
Kishore Kumar says hi genius okay you
are genius because you are learning so
much so many things
so next everyone says hi hi okay some
some people are facing lag I don't know
I'm not just I'm not seeing any lag hear
people saying telesco job boy or thank
you by the by the way my name is Naveen
you can call me I've been there
oh yeah okay so which profiles the next
question is oh I lost all the questions
great you know sometime I I hate this
jag bender you know the moment I scroll
it goes bead way down and I lost lots of
questions here where was I where as I
was I it's here yeah
so question is can you make a video on
VM Bell on okay so can you make a video
how to learn Mac OS in VMware in Windows
see though those things require lots of
patience it requires lots of time and I
don't have that so no I cannot even not
expect that video now okay okay so now
use Android studio on Windows okay this
question is from a s and it should I use
Android video I understood you're on
Windows or Linux I would suggest you to
go for Linux because it works good the
problem is with Windows Windows itself
takes lots of RAM memory you know and if
you're using even though I know story on
that you're gone so I would suggest to
go for Linux and it it works perfectly
fine so go for one two or any Linux
distro which you love this says was
eagerly waiting Oh even I was waiting
for the foregoing life I was free
yesterday as well but but thought in all
Sunday's is the best day to go live so
today I'm here okay next is let me just
close my mail service I can see lots of
nails are coming here okay
okay how much time it will take to learn
and your studio for beginner including
learn Java so Java itself will take one
or one or two months to learn completely
I mean I'm talking about Co Java and
after that if you are going forward if
you're going for Android it will take so
this you're not learning and or sugar
you are learning Android programming
okay so it will take approximately two
more months so you can imagine four to
six months to get to use to that but I
would suggest while learning you can
also make some projects so you're
learning and working so some people they
prefer learn completely and then make I
prefer to start making it and meanwhile
you will learn lots of things in fact
that's how I learned locked closed or
technology so no I have not learned it
completely
I learned basics and then I start
working on it
the moment you start working you will
learn more okay so so planning says I'm
frustrated with the current the Indian
education system should I drop out from
college to pursue my dreams
I love coding what is your view towards
it oh very common question you know
there are lots of people they got
frustrated from the education system and
that's true you know that's very much
true in fact at some point I was
frustrated with my college College the
way college to teach but you don't have
a choice you know even if you even if
you love coding if you need to join want
to join a company they will ask you for
your degree and if you don't have a
degree with you you will struggle a lot
so what the second thing sometimes we
feel that we know lots of things but we
actually don't know what is going in the
market you are on the other end you are
in the end or where you know where
you're learning stuff but you don't know
what exactly is going on in the market
so I would suggest what is going to mark
it and then you can then you will know
what happened so first complete a degree
you need to market and then think about
chasing your dreams
okay next oh okay there are lots of
comments oh how can I learn machine
learning it's very easy just go to okay
first of all we don't have much videos
on YouTube for machine learning but yes
this is one guy Siraj or you can search
for a I or machine learning Suraj you
will get awesome videos otherwise you
can follow and roof is is very good
promoter of AI so in on Coursera on
udemy there are lots of courses
available just check it out and I can
see 127 people watching great and only
70 lights come on if you are watching
this if you just join a session we are
doing a live session live Qi sessions
where I will try to answer all your
questions so if you're like me this
session click on the like button please
that's what motivates me here and now to
go live again hmm
so coffees over I got lots of energy now
and let's answer your questions again so
what is interstellar so question from
yes and says what is interstellar
interstella is basically a internship
website I have I have not tried it yet I
just heard about it that you can get
internship I've never tried it so you
can try it out if you want to go into
ego you have to go for internship you
can try intern shut up okay say
something
oh hello from one of your alien oh okay
I know yesterday last week okay so last
or last two days I I met one of my
subscriber in Mumbai when I was going
but when I went when I went for a
training so I was roaming around in
lunchtime so what my subscriber his name
is I forgot mr. Tiwari Ashish Peabody I
guess I met him and yes Dasha last day I
got a call from his name jesh maybe so I
know from last 2 to 3 days I'm feeling
lots of people they accepted that the
fact that they are aliens and I love it
so okay so from Abby Abby says I believe
motivation is one of the most important
thing in every developer life so why
don't you start uploading the kind of
videos that will get inspired
oh okay so let me plan for it in fact I
was making videos on inspiration things
you know if you watch my previous videos
last year videos sorry sorry for the
book this is coffee a fake place so much
yeah so if you if you go for last year
videos I mean last year I used to upload
all this motivation videos and even if I
am I'm trying now to upload as many
videos as possible for motivation ok
please upload JavaFX tutorials see this
is the problem you know I'm getting lots
of requests for the Philippine
technologies and first of all have to
learn all those technologies ok I am NOT
a Rajinikanth ear to know everything
right so let me just learn so I will
make videos as soon as possible as I can
I get some time so yeah ok so how to
apply Google ok we have discussed about
that so you're going to apply Google
just make sure that you are very good
with data structure skills database
fears networking skills programming
skills at least one technology one
programming knowledge one programming
language and you're good to go so
practice aptitude skills and apply apply
to those companies ok and we got a super
chart here from personal ID we got three
daughters Thank You Krishna for that but
I don't know how that will come in my
earnings okay so I just like to figure
it out how this super chat Adnan goes
into my actual learning because last
date last week also I got some money but
then I don't know how it goes into my
earnings so let's see ok oh I want to
start G as please tell me how to proceed
good question the first way to learn Jas
is to learn Jas
so learn JavaScript from basics you know
learn about what is variables how to
create those functions how do you Paul
those functions using HTML so learn the
basics of JavaScript once you know
JavaScript start with any task of
JavaScript framework or you can start
with angular you can start with react
you can start with okay so first of all
don't just learn those things okay those
things are actually I tried okay I tried
learning angularjs last year and now I
know nothing about
angularjs because those I don't know why
those concepts are so volatile the
moment I learn
two weeks everything gone so make sure
when you learn this technology I need
JavaScript framework do practice make
some torches generally you remember that
and make your own notes because
otherwise you will you will forget that
trust me okay so next question from ROM
Adamo so why is Scotland better than
Java for Android okay so first of all
Cortland is better in case of
boilerplate code the problem is when you
launch our language there are lots of
extra code we have fish you have to
learn you have to write in Catalan we
don't have to it should write to all
those boilerplate code example if you
want to write a Java code even if you
want to print hello world you have to
create a class you have to get a main
method and then you can write the code
your main line is also static method and
I mean this is a show you know if I want
to teach someone Java I have to teach
them what is class even even if you want
to print hello world
you have to write what is plus now I
have to explain what is public what is
static what is wide what is main or the
string Arg is sad to explain lots of
things right so I'm sure that coddling
says you don't have to do all the stuff
you just have to write your logic so it
is better writing the boilerplate code
when in Java or Cortland so by no means
I'm saying courtney's I mean Java is not
Java is bad it's just that we had like
boilerplate codes that's fine with me
okay I love Java but then some people
they prefer cotton okay question from
Akshay
what is grad Phi W a art file okay so
think about this world you know when you
when you make a folder so that folder
will have multiple files right and what
we do when you want to transfer that
files we zip it so if you have a folder
you will zip it so don't sell or dot rad
so dot rad is a zip folder right so you
can send the entire zip folder now in
Java technology if you are making a
standalone application you your classes
so when you create a Java file so let's
say you create five Java files you will
compile those files so that those files
will get class those class will be those
files will become class files right so
now you have five class files okay now
if you want to cross for those five
class files or some other machine you
know putting that in a folder what we do
is we'll create jar file J a
jar right that is what stand-alone if
you want to create a web application in
web applications we create grad file
which is web archive so w AR it's a web
archive so if you are creating our
application for servlet JSP you have to
create a wire file and deploy it on the
server so I hope you answered your
question okay so deja says hello alien
Oh see that you know people aren't
accepting that they're alien now and I'm
feeling better
even if my channel gets banned or
terminated or even if I'm if I don't get
a video in the future I have put I have
made some changes in your life and I
have made made sure that you are alien
and that is that is something I love so
say yes you are aliens great does Java
has any route in the field of AI yes I
feel it has but then people do prefer
Python for that yes you're right okay
okay so question from a mobile number I
don't know who puts their mobile numbers
a user name you were asking everyone to
call you I don't know okay uh so please
teach Swift iOS development okay so just
to update you and soon I will be
starting with iOS learning so I will
start learning iOS now and soon I will
be making videos on that okay so the
Howell says congratulations sir you are
going to cross one million okay okay I
will
I'm going to cross but again that's the
question and I will be soon crossing 1
lakh subscribers which is hundred
thousand subscribers for 1 million I
need more 9 minutes more 900 thousand
subscribers ok it's a big big number ok
so question from Akshay what is the risk
oh very common question in fact to know
this answer just go to youtube and
search for what is the risk oh and you
will get the answer but just to give you
a hint that is Co means it's like I'll
go void which means get to know it means
get to know ok to learn
okay so TechNet says I am from Nepal a
high
okay James says is it one learning swing
framework in nowadays no no no one no
one works on swing nowadays I would
prefer to go for JavaFX and that's why
you can see I'm not adding any video on
swing nowadays I do have a video on
swing I have the entire place for swing
but then I'm not adding any videos on
that because no one uses not so go for
Java effects that is best I think I can
see 161 people watching guys click on
the like button if you are watching this
okay I can see so if you've just joined
click on like button okay I can see that
number is going up good thank you so
much okay so next next question is from
Vivekanand
so I'm motivated by you to make with
your son Java what does great start a
channel okay anyone can start a channel
now if you just have some skill set if
you know something make a channel help
people right okay so can you tell me
about banking domain oh not much of idea
but hanging domain sir and I look at one
yeah oh okay so Jax panel says I'm
studying mechanical engineering but I
guess this is this is the thing
ligatures oh that's right spider
thank you so much okay so I'm studying
mechanical engineering but what I want
to work at IT company did it possible
yeah so you can you can so if you are
mechanical you can learn programming see
programming is one thing anyone can
learn the only thing you need to have is
commitment you need to have a different
way of thinking so may change your
thinking be more like an alien what try
to leave in virtual world and work hard
because the programming is not easy but
at the same time it's awesome so go for
it okay that will has collected now yes
it is 100,000 subscribers so soon I'll
be getting that I don't know when you
can help me with this
I still need 2000 subscribers let me
just verify so I still need to them
subscribe us if you can help me by Tom
share this video with your friends let
them know so it says ninety eight
thousand two hundred subscribers so I
need 1,800 subscribers more so help me
with that you can just share this video
ask if any subscribe
that's what you can do okay so since
force c'mon I don't have much idea
Pankaj not much idea sort of says what
should we do to improve programming
skills practice the more you practice
see the thing is don't just write simple
codes once you have learned programming
try to make big projects right not not
exactly big project but then a project
where it will ask you to think try to
solve some issues think about this how
whatsapp works make a dummy whatsapp
application think about how Allah works
or uber works create a small application
which will looks like uber so that's how
you will improve your programming skills
and make sure that you are solving some
difficult questions so go to hacker rank
I could earth solve those questions and
it will improve your programming skills
that's what I pray for
okay so please upload a video on Apache
see effects and don't have any idea on
that so okay I will make a video on Koha
or just Koha okay I don't know I'm
seeing all those new things today so
Koha can just like make it write it down
somewhere Koha and Apaches at least I
will see what is those technologies are
next time if I get some question I can
give some hint about the entire video
how you study I hope so question from
actually how I study everyday good
question actually I have a book I have a
notebook so that is sitting at I just
skipped that so I have a notebook I have
a machine so if I want to learn
something new so currently I am learning
Amazon code star I will have a uploading
videos soon on Amazon which is eighth of
this gold star and some logging dad so
how I am learning that I'm making an
application and deploying an application
and making like making my own notes how
everything goes and then I will make a
video that's how I learned so learn
practice make a video and you're done
because the moment you make a video you
learn two times or three times you know
because it takes lots of experts it you
need lots of brainpower to make a video
right I don't know how you feel if I
make a video how easy it is some people
find my I mean some people think that
making a video is very easy some people
find it very difficult I would say is
not difficult but then it needs lots of
energy lots of brainpower
lots of concentration right in fact
going live as well it takes a lot takes
lots of effort that doesn't seems right
okay so once he says namaste sir namaste
Vamsi
okay so NIP says when you will okay when
we will see the videos related to spring
security and spring are two I'm not good
with security I tried spring security
but then you know it's something which
doesn't goes in my mind directly I do
understand how spring security works but
then to teach it needs a different skill
set a different way of understanding it
that's what I'm waiting for the moment I
get the complete understanding you'll be
having that video okay and then I just
stuck with other things as well stuck
with the other trainings as a corporate
trainer so I'm stuck with the corporate
training I'm stuck with projects I'm
stuck with online matches so I'm not
getting much time to do other stuff so
but yes I will do that because I have a
channel I don't have a choice I have to
have to keep you updated that's my
responsibility I will do that okay
which book you prefer for Java i purify
it first Java whatever the best book
okay oh so many questions okay two of
five more minutes maybe okay let's go
ahead I'm not tired today
and normally I get tired in half an eye
itself but today I have some energy I
just I just need to make sure I'm
sitting comfortable okay oh you know
this change is very bad actually
okay so let's take some break and let me
talk about something else okay so some
motivation some motivation in fact I
believe so one of the comments say one
of the comments say is why do you have
to you have motivation is very important
so I believe in two to three sentences
one is I have this I have that this I
know somewhere else the first one is
initially you need to you need you need
to learn something and then you can earn
all I can say the more you learn that's
my said that's my my way of saying it
the more you learn the more you earn so
that's what I think is very important we
are in a world where things are changing
so learning is very important so the
more you learn the more you earn and if
you have poor grammar you have to write
classes right in Java so there's one
more there's one more what you say a
saying which says the the more classes
you write your class will increase so
the more classes you write your class
will increase so do practice that is
very important okay so next question
so Pavan says I'm before that I have one
more question
oh okay everything gone up this is why I
hate me these chat windows okay a
question could you prefer which one
resolution but I'd sharpen it working
doorway okay so I have an interview I
have given the core Java DBMS as my
strand but I'm not sure what top is
somewhat important so the best way to
know what topics are important you can
just go to Google and search for
interview questions or attend the
interview because see you cannot expect
that you will get a job in the first
attempt so attempt more interviews and
every time you they will ask you no
questions and that's how you look you
will learn what topics are more
important so I tell my interview go back
go there get the question come back home
factors and next time go again and
you'll get sharp okay there's no
shortcut for success you know as Linux
is better okay I got a job in question
based company a question says I got a
job in Mass Effect oh okay so I was
there yeah yesterday not yesterday on
Friday near mastic so good good company
from campus placement should I apply for
a message through off-campus production
based company yeah I mean go for mastic
it's a good company one of my friend is
working for mastic I'm in Maastricht so
and if this has come as I talked about
Asha she is also working on elastic so
yeah we can just say the company
okay how do I start my career good job
I don't know doing so - oh the languages
like not dodging questions c'mon kid
hi so it's better to learn it's better
to learn only Java or other other
languages like node.js JavaScript Python
mmm
Java is good if you want to get into
enterprise boy Java is very good but
then JavaScript frameworks also on the
way now everyone is using javascript
frameworks so like angularjs reactive
jas so yeah think about that you can go
in that way as well it's good it's very
good okay so many questions so many
question okay so as a beginner what
should I learn Java or Cortland I would
say just go for Java first and then
learn cotton but if you can find a
videos which if you can find a cotton
videos which starts from scratch you can
even cut in as well but there is no harm
in learning Java okay because Java is
what you said default Oh a de facto
language so learn Java as well why not
okay
how can you exercise I hope my

can see I add account is going up so if
you are new to my ok if you're new to

that's what I love to do what else what
else I love to do I like to learn new
things the moment I get a chance
the moment I get a free time I learn new
new things the move because does awesome
right
so okay so hey those say so please tell
me about Sam Dean I need is it okay so
Sam Dean is basically technology you can
say on a framework not sure but then
using zomling you can make an
application which works on all the
platforms because what happens is if you
want to make an application for iOS you
have to use Xcode and Swift if you want
to make an application for Android you
have to use Java but for if you're using
if you're using sampling using c-sharp
you can build an application which will
work on iOS Android and Windows right
awesome thing about the future I'm not
sure about the future of salmon but it's
a good thing you can if you want you can
learn a lot got it okay so drew says
Java section oh you're talking about
future okay I see you mr. Lee okay so
John future it has a good future because
see I'm not saying job is the best
language but then there are lots of
companies they are not already using
Java so I don't think Java will go any
any soon but then can't say anything
like we are in IT world you can't say
anything ok so question from James how
to stand out in freelancing first of all
you should have a good profile when you
are working on a financing project make
sure you make sure that you create a
profile grade your profile on different
websites like three lines or dot n we
have up work go directly to your profile
create good projects and after every
project ask for the feedback from your
client they will rate you good and the
moment the more ratings you have the
more experience you have make good
projects and link those projects there
and you will get to go and you have it
to go which place are you sitting now

in
bedroom so this bedroom is also my setup
this is my lab this is my how could
setup kind of officer not exactly but
