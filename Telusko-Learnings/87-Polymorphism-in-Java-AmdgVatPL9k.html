ready from police for learnings and in
this video we talk about polymorphism
now when you see you know they in Java
be a job everything in Java is an object
right so when you talk about object we
have classes and then we have all this
oops concepts like we have in gas
elation we have an agent so we have
talked about all the stuff that you have
talked about class we have talked about
object we have talked about in agents we
talked about encapsulation in this video
we'll talk about polymorphism
now when you say polymorphism what it
means so let's bring down the storm so
we have poly as one board and then we
have morphism as a second word or you
can say moss that's what I can work like
so when you say poly so the meaning of
this poly is many so when you say many
many many many many more many more so
this mouth will be called as behavior
okay so this is behavior so now when I
say many polymorphism it is many
behavior right so it is something that
if you have one thing and it is it as
much multiple behaviors example you know
you have one device which can do
multiple stuff given upon or if you pass
different parameters example what what
what what could be the example here
example humans let us say if we are
humans you know we have different
behavior in depend upon different
situation right so when you are going
for a party you have a different
behavior when you go to your office you
have a different behavior when you talk
to your crush you have a different
behavior when you talk to your parents
you have a different behavior right
so we behave differently at different
situation so we have multiple forms or
behind by people's behavior right it
just we are same thing but bypassing
different parameters will become
different right so what we have here is
so we have this something else many
behaviors as many forms right now let's
imagine we have a class which is a again
I'm going for my typical class example
plus a so this is my class class a and
in this class I have a method which is
shows so have a motor which is show
that's how you define a method right so
we say public
void and then we say show now it has
some statement right so let's say two
handsome statement you know in order to
call this show what we need to be quite
a main function right so on this side
we'll be having a main function and in
this main function you will write you
will call this show now how to call this
show the only way ordinay the wavy call
a method in Java is by cutting object
right they have to say e
OBG again now you know how to get
objects we can say simply new a that's
the constructor there and now we can
call obj dot show right that's how you
call it so now we have one method and
then we are trying to call that method
with the help of an object and then it
features getting called but let's say we
have one more method here so we have one
more method which is public void and
then we have show now this show takes a
different parameters now this short take
okay you know can can we have let's say
we don't have any parameter can we have
two methods with the same name in same
class and the answer is no because there
will be a confusion now if we if you
call show which one to call because this
are two different methods right so this
is doing something else so this is doing
task one and this is DHing - this is
doing task two now there are two
different tasks right there two
different methods so there is no
confusion that which one to call so what
we can do is these two methods will be
different depend upon their parameters
right so we can pass a parameter here we
can say int I so dance the parameter we
have here which is 8 i right so if i
pass a value here so if i pass five now
since i am passing a parameter which
will call this method here which is
public void show which takes in
parameter and it will do this star
because we are passing a parameter here
we are passing five right now if we
don't pass anything if you just give it
blank it will call this first method you
can have multiple methods you can have
one more method here which is public
void show which takes two different
parameters let's say it takes float
parameter so we have one more show
and it takes fluid okay
now the count is same so it takes only
one parameter even this method takes one
parameter but they're different so it's
not just the number of parameters also
the type of parameters right so if you
have multiple methods with the same name
but different parameters this will be
called as overloading of methods right
so this concept will be called as method
overloading right now then we have one
more concept so this is Method
overloading which is one the same method
name but different parameters look at
different types of parameters different
number of parameters but it should be
different right so that's Method
overloading now if we remove all this
stuff and then we let's keep it this way
let's say we have just one method here
which is show and now I have one more
method which is one of the plants which
is B okay so we have Class A and we have
class B and this Class B extends Class
eight so this is exchange so B Class B
extends plus a now what happens is
whenever you extend up class and
whenever you so this method will be will
be coming here like say five so you find
if I don't get object of emails like
this object of P now I can so if I say
obj dot show this show so this show is
not here it is not in side B so it was a
call from the methods which is which is
class is right but let's say if I define
this method here if I say public void
show now if I have C I have the same
method right the same method signature
no parameters so do this to our same but
they belong to different classes right
and they are linked within heightened so
now if I call show this will be calling
this second show it will call the second
should not the first one okay because
this show now over light so this
overwrite this method and the concept is
called as method overriding now let me
give an example you know I am giving
this example - four to five years now so
let me repeat my example in this video
let's say in the inside when I was in
my 10th standard it was year 2005 yeah
it was year 2005 at that time you know
some of my first they were having a
mobile phone right and then another
should tease me I have a mobile phone
do you have a wise phone and they were
having this fancy mobile phones of Nokia
which is no care that was this double
six or number mobile number you go to
that first smartphone that was six
doubles earlier that was this double
video they were having that phone and
when they used to ask me which one I
have I was not having any phone for at
that time but my father has a phone
right so I just told the I sister than
that I have no key are double-double
three one zero that's the hammer phone
if you know so that's before my father
had so I you should say I have that
phone because everything which belongs
to my father belongs to me right because
it's my father's own or my iPhone 4s my
dad on suppose I have that phone right
because that's inheritance but after
four years when I bought my first phone
I guess in yeah in my second year of my
graduation when I bought my own phone at
that time if people used to ask me which
phone in Oh hold on eyes I bought after
two years so when I bought Nokia c18 no
Motorola so it's not ok so modulus e18
and then at that time people used to ask
me which phone you have I should say I
have Motorola right why because my phone
has over sided my father's phone because
my father's phone is my phone but my
phone is my phone right my phone is not
my father's phone right so I have two
phones now one my father's phone and
then one is my phone but my phone
overrides my father's phone so if people
is asking me which one I have I have
Motorola c18 okay so that's how that's
the concept of overriding so when you
talk about polymorphism we have two
concept one is over loading and the
second one is over writing so let me go
for a quick recap so when you say you
have two methods with the same name but
different parameters that's overloading
when you have two methods with the same
name same parameters but due to
different classes it will be called as
over dividing so that's it from this
video this is all about polymorphisms
if you have any questions in aus you can
Porsche in a comment section and if you
have any questions regarding to your
career you can every Sunday will be
having QA session where you can ask me
some questions live ok it will be a live
session you can connect me life or you
can ask your questions I will try to
answer those questions so that's it
that's it for this video thanks for
