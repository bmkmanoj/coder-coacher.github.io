ready and in this video we will see how
to install eclipse and how to be
configured Tomcat on Eclipse on windows
so step one would be we need to install
eclipse of course you need JDK as well
so I hope you have JDK installed on your
machine in this machine
I have Java 9 but that's fine you can
also install Java 8 or Java 7 ok so step
one would be you have to download
Eclipse I will search for Eclipse
download to be specific we want Eclipse
Java EE version so I would say Eclipse
EE download and you can see this is the
website you will get and if you click on
this ok now the version is with
different this is a version in D go B
but we want the latest version so I
would select oxygen packages here and
from this we have to select Java EE
developers and in that also we will be
going for the different versions as it
is windows 64-bit machine I'll be using
64-bit here once you click on this it
will give you option of download and you
can go ahead and you can download this
the moment you click on download it will
get downloaded by the time it gets
downloaded let's go back to the page and
you can see that's why it feels so
famous you know there are different
flavors available so if you are working
on Spring Framework you can also go for
spring which is based on Eclipse for
different reason which they have
different IDs available now once you got
a clubs downloaded the second software
we need here is Tomcat Tomcat being a
server for your salat I would say Apache
Tomcat you can go for any version will
go for Tomcat 9 and let's click on this
one in the audio/video which should we
have conjugal on a mat I have installed
Apache Tomcat 8 and mass is just to give
you a different flavor that you can work
with any version we are installing 9 now
once you get this page you have to
search for so first of all this is in
beta version but that's fine it will
work you might be facing some issues but
then we can avoid can handle that
this you can see we have so many options
now we will be going for this zip
version because we don't want to install
it we just want to load your tomcat in
Eclipse IDE so we click on the zip
version this will download the Tomcat 9
and we also need a source code
distribution so that you can see the
source code as well
so the concept again how to configure
this that we'll see later but you can
see we got this 3 software's these 3
software's are there in my folder here
so if I go to software as you can see we
have this 3 files and now let's unzip
the this version so I will right click
and say extract here and by the time we
can also unzip the tomcat version so we
can right click on Tomcat and that we
will say
extract here so once we got these two
softwares you can see we have this two
folder and now I will open eclipse now
inside this folder you can see we have a
software called as Eclipse XE never
click on that and this will open eclipse
now it will ask you for the workspace
now workspace is basically a folder but
you can put all your projects I would
say the workspace here is my solid
workspace and I looked like on launch it
does take some time to open because this
is a first time opening eclipse and on
this machine so once we got this IDE of
enable you can see we got the welcome
page let's not touch it you now and
click on this welcome page now you can
see we have we got different areas this
is where you will on the left hand side
you will get all your projects we don't
need this outline and tasks as of now
now this is important this our tab here
now if you are walking with servlet this
is very important you need a server tab
now sometime you will not find this tabs
here again you can see we don't have
console tab here because this is that is
where you will get your system dot out
dot println messages now if you want to
see this thing you can click on window
this option of show view in show view
you can select console if you want
console there let me sleep on console
you can see we got console here if you
want Saba you can also click on server
now since we already have it here we
don't have to do that otherwise you can
select that and it will show you the tab
I can see it says there's no service of
enable now how do we connect our server
here so we'll click on this one now it
will ask you for which server you want
to connect you can see it gives you so
many options here now we have to expand
departure in Apache we have you can see
we have different version now since we
are walking with tomcat 9 let's like
this one and click on next in this you
have to select the path where you have
your phone let me just go to that path
so as you can see I have set to that
path here I will click on ok so this is
the path where I have my apache tomcat
which is which we have downloaded and
unzipped now once you got it let's click
on next and nothing to configure here
click on finish this is how you connect
your epileps with tomcat
so this is your tomcat here but we have
to also verify right it is working so
whenever you before creating a project
it's always better to test your tomcat
so I would say start and you can see it
is something is happening behind the
scene we have to make sure that it is
starting at some point and it started
now how do you verify we started now
first of all you need to know which port
number your target is using so if I
double click here on this this is the
port number you are running your key
on which is eight zero eight zero to
verify this let's go back to your
browser and here to verify this we'll
type localhost colon 8080 so we'll type
localhost colon 8080 and if I Center you
can see we got the response from Tomcat
now since your topic is up and running
that's why you got this response now if
you want the awesome tomcat web page you
can also select this option the second
option which will show you the Tomcat
homepage if you want to see that and
once you do that quantification you can
also restart your machine now again some
time you know your machine will give you
some issue if you already have a service
running with this port number maybe you
have a Sam server or some other server
which is using eight zero eight zero
port number you can change it from here
you can change your Tomcat port number
two eight zero eight one or two your
choice and save the transmission on your
server
everything will work once I've done that
conjugation that means go back to my
browser and I will say enter do you see
that we got the awesome Apache Tomcat
home page so this is how you install
eclipse on Windows and these are your
config or Tomcat so I hope you enjoyed
